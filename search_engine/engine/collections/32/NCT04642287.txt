      topical calcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment in OTRs on
      immunosuppressive medications with precancerous skin lesions called actinic keratoses (AKs)
      and a history of non-melanoma skin cancer in order to eliminate AKs and prevent squamous cell
      carcinoma (SCC) development. SCC is the most common cutaneous malignancy seen after
      transplantation, with a 65-250fold greater incidence in organ transplant recipients (OTRs)
      compared to the general population. This increased risk is due to the systemic
      immunosuppression caused by anti-rejection medications, which are indispensable for
      protecting against allograft loss. Our previous findings have established the efficacy of
      calcipotriol in combination with 5-FU in inducing an antitumor immunity against AKs in
      immunocompetent patients. This SCC risk reduction is accompanied by the induction of robust T
      cell immunity and TRM cell formation against AKs. Calcipotriol is a FDA-approved low calcemic
      vitamin D analogue for the treatment of psoriasis. Topical 5-FU is a standard chemotherapy
      for AKs. Based on our previous findings demonstrating the synergistic impact of TSLP
      induction by calcipotriol in combination with the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU that leads to a
      robust T cell immunity against early skin carcinogenesis in immunocompetent patients, we aim
      to determine whether this efficacy is maintained in OTRs on immunosuppressive therapy and its
      effect on SCC prevention in long-term after transplantation.
