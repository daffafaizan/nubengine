    
      Infraclavicular brachial plexus block under ultrasound guidance is used for surgeries on the
      upper limb. Traditionally, the block is performed at the lateral infraclavicular fossa where
      the cords are variable in position relative to the axillary artery. A recently introduced
      technique is the costoclavicular approach where the cords are viewed as relatively more
      superficial and clustered together compared to the traditional technique. Those meeting the
      inclusion criteria and will consent to participate in the study will be randomized to have
      either an infraclavicular block in the paracoracoid approach (Group 1) or an infraclavicular
      block in the costoclavicular approach (Group 2). All groups will have the same injectable
      volume (35 mls) and local anesthetic concentration (ropivacaine 0.5%). There will be 35 study
      patients for each group for a total of 70 patients.
