    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Establish the safety and toxicity profile of cytochlor and H4U when given in combination
           with external-beam radiotherapy for 2 weeks after treatment with the drugs alone in the
           previous week.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effectiveness of H4U to inhibit systemic cytidine deaminase (CD) during
           the course of treatment with cytochlor and H4U.

        -  Perform detailed pharmacokinetic studies to determine the levels of cytochlor and its
           metabolites in serum and in urine in weeks 1, 2, and 3 during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cytochlor.

      Patients receive cytochlor IV and tetrahydrouridine (H4U) IV over 5 minutes on 3 days in week
      1 and on days 1-5 in weeks 2 and 3. Patients also undergo external-beam radiotherapy 5 days a
      week in weeks 2 and 3 initiated 3-4 hours after infusions of cytochlor and H4U. Treatment may
      repeat in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly
      thereafter.
