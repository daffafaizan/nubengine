        -  Group 1: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with mild hepatic impairment (with a
           Child Pugh score of ≥ 5 to ≤ 6) will be enrolled in Group 1.

        -  Group 2: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (with
           a Child Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 2.

        -  Group 3: Approximately 8 male or female subjects with severe hepatic impairment (with a
           Child Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 3.

        -  Group 4: Approximately 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic function
           will be enrolled in Group 4. Subjects in Group 4 will be matched to subjects in Group 2
           with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]).

        -  Group 5: Approximately 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic function
           will be enrolled in Group 5. Subjects in Group 5 will be matched to subjects in Group 3
           with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 13.6 kg [30 pounds]).

      Subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic
      function may start the study in parallel.
