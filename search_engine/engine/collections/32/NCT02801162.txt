      heterogeneous patient population consisting of patients scheduled for hybrid atrial
      fibrillation surgery, patients scheduled for heart valve surgery, complex cardiac surgery
      with deep cooling, spine surgery or patients with expected major blood loss. The investigator
      will compare the ABG values obtained with the traditional ABG measurement system of the
      hospital.

      The availability of a disposable patient-dedicated blood gas analyser allows rapid, frequent
      measurement of blood gases in theatre without the loss of theatre staff. As well as
      facilitating measurement in the unstable patient, this approach opens up the possibility for
      more frequent measurement to identify patient deterioration before a crisis occurs.

      The conventional laboratory ABG method uses sensor technology for pH, pCO2, pO2, sodium,
      potassium, calcium, glucose and lactate levels. It measures hemoglobin concentration via
      spectrophotometry methodology at a set wavelength of 467-672 nm. The blood gas laboratory
      uses ABL90 Flex (Radiometer®). The optical system is based on a 138-wavelength
      spectrophotometer with a measuring range of 467-672 nm. The spectrophotometer is connected
      via an optical fiber to a combined hemolyzer and measuring chamber.
