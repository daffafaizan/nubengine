      risk of having dementia in later life is about 74% higher for middle-aged obese individuals
      than those with normal BMI. Estrogen deprivation has also been found to impair cognition.
      Thus, obese postmenopausal women are likely to be at risk of having cognitive impairment. The
      common recommendation for obesity management is dietary and exercise intervention. Research
      evidence has demonstrated that either dietary intervention or moderate-vigorous intensity
      exercise enhance cognitive function in obese adults. This study aims to examine the effects
      of 12-week home-based dietary intervention combined with physical-cognitive exergaming on
      cognitive performance and circulating biomarkers of obese postmenopausal women through a
      randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      groups: 1) dietary intervention 2) dietary intervention combined with physical-cognitive
      exergaming, and 3) control group. Outcome measures including cognitive performance (i.e.
      executive function, episodic memory, attention, language, and global cognition), circulating
      biomarkers (i.e. BDNF level, metabolic parameters, inflammation markers, and adiponectin
      levels) as well as physical performance will be determined at baseline and after 12-week
      intervention. Findings from this study may offer a feasible and effective intervention
      program to improve cognitive performance along with its responsible circulating biomarkers in
      obese postmenopausal women.
