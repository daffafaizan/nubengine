      disproportionately affects women. Currently there are only a few alternatives to antibiotics
      for treatment of UTI. Although symptomatic relief occurs more quickly in women treated with
      oral antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs, patients appear to successfully resolve their UTI
      without antibiotic therapy. While antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy, there are growing
      concerns about collateral effects impacting healthy microbiomes and anti-bacterial resistance
      patterns. Recent estimates from the CDC indicate that more than 2.8 million
      antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the U.S. each year, and more than 35,000 people die
      as a result.

      The proposed research fills a key knowledge gap that will be critical in determining the role
      of a non-antibiotic substance with the potential to treat UTIs by modulating the urinary and
      gut microbiome to restore health and minimize the reliance on traditional antibiotic therapy
      while also preventing antibiotic resistance. In addition, this study will provide early
      evidence of the short-term symptom and urinary and gut microbiome changes following ingestion
      of two botanical food substances (cranberry and quillaja) that have the potential for
      beneficial effects on the microbiome and UTI symptoms.
