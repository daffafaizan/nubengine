      protocol for patients with erectile dysfunction. On screening patients will undergo
      evaluation by thorough medical history and by questionnaires for evaluation of sexual
      function. A one-month active treatment with PDE5i will be provided followed by re-evaluation
      using the same questionnaires. Then another one-month period without PDE5i medication
      (washout period ) will be done and finally on the following visit evaluation will include the
      same questionnaires and if fit for inclusion- additional objective evaluation of endothelial
      function using the Flow mediated dilatation technique and penile blood flow measurement by
      doppler ultrasound of the Penis will be performed. At the end of this screening pahse the
      first shock wave session will be performed. Altogether 12 treatment sessions will be
      performed - 6 treatments twice a week followed by a 3 week no-treatment interval and again 6
      treatments twice a week. Follow-up which will include the same evaluation as in the first
