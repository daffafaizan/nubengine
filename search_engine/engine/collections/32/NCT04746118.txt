      challenge in the treatment of hypertension in Brazil and worldwide. In this context, besides
      the availability and use of antihypertensive drugs, the best therapeutic approach should
      start with the stratification of cardiovascular risk, and contextualized modification of life
      habits. In this view, the present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of diet change and
      other non-pharmacological treatments oriented to reduce the blood pressure in adults
      diagnosed with prehypertension, hypertension, and resistant hypertension. Therefore, it
      includes the analysis of these 3 groups: i. pre-hypertension (to evaluate strategies adopted
      as primary prevention); ii. hypertension in general (to assess blood pressure control and
      reduce cardiovascular risk reduction), and iii. resistant hypertension (individuals using 3
      or more drugs without blood pressure control who have more endothelial dysfunction and target
      organ damage to assess secondary and tertiary prevention with possible blood pressure
      control, reduction in the number of drugs in use and subclinical lesions regression).
      Non-pharmacological approach includes adoption of healthy lifestyles, weight loss, reduced
      sodium intake, regular physical activity, and integrative practices capable of maintaining
      biopsychosocial balance. Since those interventions seems to be the best way to reach blood
      pressure control, we intend to use individual interventions and group actions to increase the
      population's adherence contributing effectively to public policies within primary care.
