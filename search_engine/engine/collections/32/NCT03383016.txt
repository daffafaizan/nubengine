      candidate biological markers potentially modifiable by environmental exposures (diet and
      physical activity) and the two-year risk of prostate cancer in a newly recruited cohort of
      men at high-risk of prostate cancer showing no evidence of cancer.

      Four hospitals in the province of Quebec (Canada) participate to the recruitment of 3,080 men
      at high-risk for prostate cancer, i.e. men who had a first negative prostate biopsy or whose
      Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) level is between 2.5 and 10 ng / ml without previous
      prostate biopsy.

      The candidate biomarkers that will be tested are:

        1. The ratio of ω-3/ ω-6 fatty acid content of red blood cell membranes,

        2. Oxidized low density lipoprotein cholesterol

        3. Adiponectin

        4. Insulin growth factor-1

        5. The ratio of dihydrotestosterone glucuronide derivatives over estradiol

      A biobank, composed of biological material (whole blood, plasma, serum, lymphocyte layer and
      excess tissue collected from prostate biopsy or prostate surgery) and clinical data is being
      created. Questionnaires are used to compile information on socio-demographic aspects, family
      and personal medical history, quality of life, lifestyle like food and sexual habits.
