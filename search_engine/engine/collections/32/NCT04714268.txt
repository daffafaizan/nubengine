      surgeries, and have become the therapeutic benchmark for a large number of pathologies thanks
      in particular to advances in image-guided therapy. Therenva offers a comprehensive and
      consistent lightweight navigation solution (EndoNautÂ®) for endovascular procedures. This
      navigation station makes it possible to secure and guide the interventional gesture by
      providing relevant information extracted during the preoperative phase. This information is
      rendered in augmented reality using artificial intelligence algorithms and digital
      simulation. This alternative solution to a hybrid room, but which offers equivalent
      functionality, is compatible with all operating rooms, regardless of the interventional
      environment. Benefits of imaging fusion remain to be assessed on a larger scale. The aim of
      this multicenter study is to demonstrate that the use of EndoNaut for aortoiliac endovascular
      procedures has a clinical impact for the patient (reduction in irradiation and the volume of
      contrast product) as well as for the nursing staff (reduction irradiation) compared to
      procedures performed without EndoNaut.
