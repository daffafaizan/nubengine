    
      The study will be conducted in two (2) parts and each part will consist of a ramp-up period,
      dose escalation and dose expansion portions. The duration of the ramp-up period will depend
      on the dose schedule being tested and will be conducted for both monotherapy and combination
      therapy. The ramp-up will consist of treatment with APG-2575 given once a day starting at 20
      mg on Day 1, 50 mg on Day 2, 100 mg on Day 3, 200 mg on Day 4, 400 mg on Day 5Â¸ 600 mg on Day
      6, 800 mg on Day 7, 1000 mg on Day 8 and 1200 mg on Day 9. Scheduled maximum cohort doses for
      evaluation will start at 200 mg of APG-2575 to a maximum of 1200 mg of APG-2575.
      Consequently, patients with a scheduled maximum dose of 200 mg will have a 3-day ramp-up
      period, those scheduled at 400 mg, a 4-day ramp-up, and those scheduled at 600 mg, a 5-day
      ramp-up, etc, see Figure 1. Part 1 will study APG-2575 at different dose levels as
      monotherapy using a 3+3 dose escalation design with dose expansion at RP2D. Part 2 will be
      combination of APG-2575 with rituximab or acalabrutinib or voruciclib Part 2 will be a 3+3
      dose escalation of combination APG-2575 plus rituximab or acalabrutinib or voruciclib.
      Expansion cohorts at RP2D for the respective combinations will be conducted to further
      evaluate safety and anticancer activity
