      postoperatively. Major surgical procedures account for substantial systemic inflammatory
      activation. Interestingly, animal models have shown that surgery rather than anaesthetics
      trigger a neurocognitive decline. An increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation of
      immune cells mediate this post operative cognitive decline. There is growing support that
      systemic inflammation can activate the innate immune system of the brain leading to
      inflammation in the brain ('neuroinflammation'). This neuroinflammation is suggested to play
      a pivotal role in postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive decline due to
      surgery-related systemic inflammation. However little evidence is available on the extend of
      the neuroinflammation and which biochemical pathways are dysregulated in the brain after
      surgery.

      Thoracic aortic surgery offers the unique opportunity to study the trajectory of protein
      expression in CSF prior to and after surgery in a non-invasive matter. It is standard of care
      that an external lumbar drain (ELD) is placed the day prior to surgery and this ELD will
      remain in place during three postoperative days.

      To advance the understanding of the impact of major surgery to the brain, the investigators
      wish to study the trajectory of protein expression prior to and after thoracic aortic
      surgery.
