      study to evaluate the effect of ertugliflozin 5mg once daily (p.o.) for 52 weeks on the
      ventricular arrhythmic burden and markers of physical and mental well-being as well as
      biomarker for Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with
      mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) patients with ICDÂ±CRT therapy. The study will be
      conducted in 5 to 7 experienced sites in Austria with an aim to enrol 402 patients to
      evaluate the overall study hypothesis.

      Therefore, three study visits will be carried out (baseline, 1-year follow-up visit and a
      telephone visit 4 weeks after visit 2). As part of the two on-site study visits,
      study-specific measures, a blood sample and an echocardiographic examination will be
      performed. The trial is completed by a telephone visit 4 weeks after the second on-site visit
      (week 52).

      It is anticipated that the study will run for 30 months.
