    
      This is a single center, fixed-sequence, drug-drug interaction study to assess the effects of
      multiple oral doses of tucatinib on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of metformin
      in healthy subjects. The primary objective of the study is to assess the effects of tucatinib
      on the single-dose PK of metformin. Secondary objectives of the study are to (1) assess the
      safety and tolerability of metformin when coadministered with tucatinib and (2) assess the
      effects of tucatinib on renal function using iohexol as glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
      marker.
