      combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients with refractory adult solid tumors. II.
      Investigate the clinical pharmacokinetics of intravenous flavopiridol when administered in
      combination with paclitaxel in these patients. III. Obtain preliminary data on the
      therapeutic activity of flavopiridol when administered in combination with paclitaxel in
      these patients. IV. Evaluate surrogate markers of activity such as inhibition of PKC or CDK1
      in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours on day 1. On day 2, patients receive cisplatin IV over 20 minutes followed by a 24 hour
      infusion of flavopiridol. Courses are repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Sequential dose escalation of flavopiridol is followed
      by sequential dose escalation of cisplatin. Dose escalation in cohorts of 3-6 patients each
      continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are
      followed every 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 46-73 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 more
      months.
