      measure compounds in breath that may change with sleep-wake state and compounds that vary by
      time of day. Participants will be fitted with a plastic mask connected to the device for a
      breath analysis test for about 20 minutes. Then, participants may be asked to lie down and
      take a nap or to remain sitting/lying down for 1-2 hours. After such time, participants will
      be asked to complete another ~20 minute breath analysis test. Participants will be asked to
      complete questionnaires throughout the study session. Investigators may ask participants to
      provide up to two saliva samples during the study session. Participants will also be asked to
      complete a pre-study diary to document sleep/wake times, diet, and medications for the day
      before the study session. Participants may be asked if they would be willing to take part in
      an additional study session on another day.
