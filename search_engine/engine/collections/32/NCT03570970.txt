      multiple-dose tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies. The tolerability and pharmacokinetic
      studies are performed simultaneously. Three doses, 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1000 mg are proposed
      for multiple-dose tolerability and pharmacokinetic studies. The subjects are divided into two
      groups, 12 subjects in each group, half males and half females. 250 mg group is performed
      firstly. After completion of observation and confirming that the drug can be safely
      tolerated, study on 500 mg group is then performed. After completion of observation and
      confirming that the drug can be safely tolerated, study on 1000 mg group is then performed.
      Each subject only receives one dose, intravenous drip, once daily, for 7 consecutive days.
      During the trial, close attention is paid to the tolerability of subjects, and blood samples
      4 mL is collected from cubital vein respectively before dosing, 0.25 h, 0.5 h, 0.75 h, 1 h,
      1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 5h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h after dosing on Day 1 (0 h); before dosing (0 h),
      0.25 h, 0.5 h, 0.75 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 5 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h after
      dosing on Day 7 for pharmacokinetic study. Blood samples are collected before dosing on Day
      4, 5 and 6 to determine the trough concentration for observing the pharmacokinetic profiles
      of benapenem and its major metabolites in the body after continuous dosing. The next dose
      group can be studied only when the observation of the previous dose group is completed and it
      is confirmed that the drug is safely tolerated
