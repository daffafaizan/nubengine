      tumors are generally oval in shape, and often highly vascular. On T2 weighted MR imaging
      exams, or T1 exams with contrast, uterine fibroids are easily identifiable. They occur in
      20-25% of women of reproductive age and can cause a variety of problems generally described
      as either bleeding or mass effects from the fibroid. InSightec has developed an Enhanced
      Sonication (ES) technique for the ablation of these fibroids. This mode of tissue ablation
      has been added to the already FDA approved ExAblate system. The goal of this ES technique is
      to provide an additional treatment tool that will enhance the treatment effect without
      additional risks while preserving ALL clinical features of the current commercially approved
      version.
