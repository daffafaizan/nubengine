      collecting variables such as gambling behavior, drug and alcohol use, psychiatry and medical
      history, family history, impulsivity, quality of life, self-esteem, and cognition. For some
      individuals who meet criteria as being impulsive, they will be randomized to receive an
      intervention to help reduce their impulsivity.
