      sensors) cannot reliably prevent adverse events unless the investigators assimilate the data
      produced from these devices and provide it to the clinician in a format that is easy to
      comprehend. The expert system that the investigators are developing will provide intelligent
      synthesis of data. The clinician focus can then be directed toward the patient rather than
      continual observation of the monitors.

      Clinicians need an expert system to augment vigilance and situation awareness, and to aid in
      decision making to prevent patient harm.

      The development of an expert system to assist the everyday anesthesiologist in the operating
      room is a significant challenge that is in urgent need of being addressed. Assistance is
      required in interpreting the overwhelming stream of physiological data, intelligently
      extracting key features from these data, and bringing them to the attention of the clinician.
