      -dapaglifozin - reduces PA levels, target organ damage, fat profile and change the adipokines
      levels in patients with resistant hypertension with DM2. Methods and design: This crossover
      randomized, double-blind, interventional study controlled by standard therapy will include 20
      patients with resistant hypertension and type 2 diabetes, followed in Outpatient Clinic
      specialized in Resistant Hypertension at clinical Hospital-UNICAMP. They will be randomly
      assigned into two groups (1) initially treated with dapagliflozin in combination with their
      usual antihypertensive therapy and metformin, at 12 weeks (n = 10) or group (2) Control
      initially treated with glibenclamide at a dose of 5mg daily in combination with
      antihypertensive therapy usual and metformin, at 12 weeks (n = 10). Office ambulatory and
      home BP measurements; anthropometric measurements, determination of vascular stiffness by
      pulse wave velocity, echocardiogram, body bioimpedance, enzyme immunoassays for the
      determination of adipokines, and lab tests to evaluate biochemical parameters will be
      performed pre- and after the use of both treatments. Glycemic parameters, and weight will be
      assessed every 4 weeks. Results and conclusion: The use of SGLT2 inhibitor in these patients
      may provide new strategies for treatment of patients with resistant hypertension.
