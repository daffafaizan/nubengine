      individuals, families and society. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most
      important causes of disability worldwide, in both developing and developed countries. Major
      depressive disorder is reported to be the most common mood disorder, with a lifetime
      prevalence of about 15% and as high as 25% in women. Major depressive disorder is
      characterized by the presence of 1 or more major depressive episodes that presents with
      depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy,
      feelings of guilt or low self-worth, and poor concentration.

      This is a multicenter extension study designed to allow eligible patients who have completed
      short-term efficacy and safety studies LuAA21004_315 (NCT01153009), LuAA21004_316
      (NCT01163266) and LuAA21004_317 (NCT01179516) to receive the 52-week treatment with
      vortioxetine in this open-label extension study. Participants are expected to return to the
      site for approximately 13 visits.

      A safety follow-up call will be made 4 weeks after completion of the 52-week treatment
      period.
