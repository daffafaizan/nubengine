        1. To date, there are no evidence for prophylactic drugs treating post-traumatic headache.
           Post-traumatic headache patients are notoriously known to be refractory to prophylactic
           treatment and have usually tried several prophylactic drugs such as amitriptylin, which
           is recommended as a prophylactic drug in migraine and chronic tension-type headache, and
           other drugs developed for the treatment of primary headache disorders. First step is
           therefore to show if there is an effect at all following erenumab treatment in these
           refractory PPTH patients.

        2. The refractory nature of PPTH will lower the bias that could occur through placebo
           effects.

        3. The treatment period is also quite long, and the endpoint is assessed in the last month
           of treatment, which will also minimize a placebo effect.

        4. Furthermore, this relatively small exploratory open label study is needed to show if
           there is an effect of erenumab in post-traumatic headache at all and what this effect
           is, before initiating larger multicenter double-blind studies in this patient group.
