      survival, immunotherapy combination with anti-tumor angiogenesis agents have some curative
      effection according to recent studies. It seems there has been clinical evidence to improve
      the immune microenvironment of the tumor, while in the case of only liver metastasis, the
      tumor's characteristics may not be consistent with other tumors. This study was to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of such patients by combining Apatinib and SHR-1210. This
      study will include approximately 20 patients with solid tumors with only liver metastases
      (progression after first-line treatment). The investigators will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Apatinib combined with SHR-1210 in these patients. If possible we would check the
      patients' ctDNA and some infection factors.
