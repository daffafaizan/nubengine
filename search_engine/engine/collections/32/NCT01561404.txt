      inhibitor-based immunosuppression may alter the physical exercise capacity in renal
      transplant patients.

      This is based on recent data obtained. Regarding metabolism there is evidence that inhibition
      of mTOR, reduces muscle glucose utilization, as well as, increase fatty acid oxidation. On
      the other hand, has shown that drugs based on mTOR inhibitors in the context of excess of
      nutrients improves intracellular glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. Through these
      mechanisms could increase resistance to physical exercise, which would result in an
      improvement in the quality of life of patients. Nevertheless, there isn't any paper that has
      explored this hypothesis accurately.
