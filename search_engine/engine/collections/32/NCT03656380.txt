    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, parallel-arm, placebo controlled trial of
      mepolizumab. After the first 3 month blinded phase, there will be a second 3 month blinded
      phase where all patients receive active medication, but the dose will be lower in the
      subjects initially randomized to the placebo arm.

      In the first arm, subjects will receive mepolizumab 300 mg SQ monthly for 3 months. In the
      second arm, subjects will receive a placebo SQ injection monthly for 3 months. Both groups
      will have the injection administered under direct observation in a Clinical & Translational
      Research Center (CTRC) or other clinic to ensure proper administration and compliance. Each
      visit will also provide an opportunity for symptom questionnaires to be completed and for
      blood samples to be drawn. After 3 months (the time point where the primary outcome is
      assessed), all subjects initially randomized to active treatment will continue with
      mepolizumab dosing 300 mg SQ monthly, and will remain blinded. All subjects initially
      randomized to placebo will receive mepolizumab 100mg SQ monthly, and will remain blinded. Of
      note, no dietary changes, changes in baseline Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) medication dose,
      changes in inhaled or intranasal steroid doses, or administration or oral, topical/swallowed,
      or systemic steroids will be allowed during the study period. Subjects will undergo endoscopy
      after the first blinded phase (at 3 months) and after the second blinded phase (after 6
      months).
