      (DLPFC) is an FDA approved treatment for depression, a growing and converging database
      suggests the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) may be even more critical to the neurobiology of
      depression and antidepressant treatment response. This study will compare the efficacy of
      high frequency transcranial madntic stimulation on these two sections of the brain.
