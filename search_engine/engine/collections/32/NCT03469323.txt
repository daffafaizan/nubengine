      thoracic surgery. A safe and effective surgical environment is established via an iatrogenic
      open pneumothorax producing the operated lung fully collapsed. However, the initial
      respiratory response to open pneumothorax is both tachypnea and carbon dioxide rebreathing,
      which would jeopardize the quality of collapse of the operated lung and delay the performance
      of intrathoracic vagal block. Intravenous opioid is effective to attenuate ventilatory
      responses but herein with risk of persistent respiratory depression.

      Methods: The investigators hypothesize that mini-dose succinylcholine 0.15 mg/kg can induce
      ultra-short period of apnea, by which the ventilatory responses to open pneumothorax were
      abolished and may facilitate rapid and satisfying collapse of the operated lung during
      nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study design,
      30 patients will be allocated to receive either succinylcholine (n=15) or placebo (n=15) in
      the beginning of open pneumothorax. The effectiveness of succinylcholine will be measured by
      the surgeon's evaluation of the quality of lung collapse, while the safety will be evaluated
      by determination of arterial blood gases within 20 minutes of one-lung spontaneous breathing.

      Expected results: Mini-dose succinylcholine can facilitate early lung collapse without
      jeopardizing the ventilatory function during nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery with one-lung
      spontaneous breathing, which may make nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery easier and safer.
