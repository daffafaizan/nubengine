    
      This program consists of providing intervention, by a IBAIP trained and certified healthcare
      professional, with the child and his family, starting a few days before hospital discharge
      and continuing at home until the corrected age of 6 months. It focuses on the child's
      behaviors and consists of assisting the family in its interactions with the child so that
      these are adapted and responsive to the child's development needs over time through repeated
      interventions.

      A cluster randomization will be used meaning the centers are randomized, not the individual
      patients. The centers will be randomized before the inclusion of patients in order to allow
      the physiotherapists or psychomotor therapists to be trained and certified to the IBAIP
      before the start of the trial.
