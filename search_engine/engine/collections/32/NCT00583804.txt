    
      The design of this study is to determine the efficacy of improving upper extremity function
      in tetraplegic subjects after receiving an implantable device for neuromuscular control.
      Evaluations will be made so as to document changes in performance of manipulative tasks when
      using the stimulation system.

      Subjects who consent to participate in this project will have an implantable stimulator
      surgically placed in the upper extremity for control of the upper extremity. A series of
      tests will be performed before implantation, and repeated at intervals after implantation to
      assess changes in each subject's performance.

      This study is a non-randomized feasibility study with concurrent (neuroprosthesis on and off)
      and longitudinal (pre- and post-implantation/training) self-controls.

      Subjects participating in the study can expect to be actively involved in the study for two
      years after implantation and followed for life thereafter. The screening procedures take up
      to two days, depending on the specific evaluations necessary to determine candidacy.
      Pre-surgical exercise is conducted for at least two weeks. The implantation surgery itself
      lasts one day, with three to seven days of post-surgical hospitalization. Following an
      eight-week exercise program and a twelve-week training program, subjects are discharged from
      the active rehabilitation phase. They are followed quarterly for one year, and then annually
      thereafter.

      The device is referred to as the Implanted Stimulator-Telemeter (IST) -12. The device uses
      functional electrical stimulation (FES) to activate paralyzed muscles.
