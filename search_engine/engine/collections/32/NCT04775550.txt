    
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether the combination of daratumumab
      (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade) and dexamethasone works in
      treating smoldering multiple myeloma and preventing progression to active or symptomatic
      multiple myeloma.

      This combination of drugs are considered "investigational" which means it has not been
      approved in this combination for smoldering myeloma by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Daratumumab (also called Darzalex Faspro)

        -  Bortezomib (also called Velcade)

        -  Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid)

        -  Dexamethasone

      Participants may be treated for up to 24 months and will be followed for up to 3 years.

      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of an
      investigational drug(s). The investigational drugs used in this research study are
      daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade) and
      dexamethasone. "Investigational" means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration)
      has not approved the combination of daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid),
      bortezomib (Velcade) and dexamethasone as a treatment regimen for the specific disease.
