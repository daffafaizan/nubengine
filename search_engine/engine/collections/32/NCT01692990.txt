    
      In a randomized cross-over design, 20 normal-weight healthy subjects (10 males, 10 females)
      were given 10 of 0.5-mL capsules/day of fish oil and soybean oil for 3 weeks. In the end of
      each period they were given a standard breakfast and asked to report their appetite on visual
      analogue scales (VAS) immediately before and after the meal. The results were analyzed in
      accordance with the paired design under consideration of both supplement sequence and gender.
