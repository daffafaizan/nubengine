      failure among HIV patients in resource poor settings whether the clinicians use an Electronic
      Medical Record (EMR) system with a Computerized Decision Support (CDSS) or an EMR without a
      CDSS. In this study, 20 clinics were assigned to the intervention (EMR+CDSS) arm and
      non-intervention arm (EMR only) and will be followed up for 12 months to assess whether there
      are any differences in time taken to detect immunological treatment failure based on CD4 cell
      count.
