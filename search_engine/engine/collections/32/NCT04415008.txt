      High dose cytarabine will be given after complete remission achieved. The primary endpoint
      was relapse-free survival. Genetic mutations and measurable residual disease (MRD) will be
      detected at diagnosis and after chemotherapy. The risk stratification according to genetic
      mutations and MRD will also be explored.
