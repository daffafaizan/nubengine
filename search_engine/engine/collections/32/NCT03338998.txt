    
      This is the first trial of BAF312 in ICH patients to study efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability, compared to placebo. BAF312 is a drug that could potentially limit brain
      inflammation after ICH, and thereby improve neurological outcome for stroke patients.

      In this study, ICH patients meeting study criteria will be randomized at 1:1 ratio into
      either active or placebo group. The first i.v. treatment must starts within 24 hours of ICH
      event. Participating patients will also be followed up for additional 76 days after treatment
      on neurological and safety conditions in 3 clinic visits.

      BAF312 treatment includes the following identified risks: transient effects on heart rate and
      rhythm (bradyarrhythmia and 2nd degree AV block) at treatment initiation that are completely
      avoided by initial up-titration; liver enzyme elevation; lymphopenia due to lymphocyte
      redistribution (expected effect of BAF312); macular edema; and varicella zoster (VZV)
      infection.
