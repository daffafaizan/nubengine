      efficacy of rociletinib administered in combination with MPDL3280A.

      Phase 1: This will be the dose finding phase of the study. Patients will be enrolled to
      available Dosing Cohort. Patients who have progressed after prior first- or second-generation
      EGFR TKI, regardless of T790M mutation status, will be enrolled.

      Phase 2: Patients will be enrolled into 2 groups. Group A will enroll eligible first-line
      patients who are EGFR TKI treatment-naïve and chemotherapy-naïve. Group B will enroll
      eligible patients who have progressed after prior first- or second-generation EGFR TKI,
      regardless of T790M mutation status.
