      anti-DEC-205 p24 monoclonal antibody plus poly ICLC, as an adjuvant, is safe and induces
      either cellular or humoral immunogenicity in healthy volunteers. We propose to assess the
      quality of immunity elicited by DEC targeted vaccines in humans. Immunogenicity after HIV
      antigen delivery directly to dendritic cells could provide the proof-of-concept that
      dendritic cell targeted protein vaccines may serve as a stand-alone vaccine strategy or in
      combination with other vaccine modalities against HIV or other diseases.

      The main hypothesis of this study is to assess the delivery of HIV antigens via immunization
      with anti-DEC-205 p24 monoclonal antibody (DCVax-001) plus poly ICLC (Hiltonol) is safe and
      induces either cellular or humoral immunogenicity in HIV-uninfected, healthy volunteers.
