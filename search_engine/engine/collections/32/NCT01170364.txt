      participate in a 3-week, randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial of sibutramine 15mg or
      placebo daily. At the end of weeks 1 and 3, subjects will be asked to participate in a
      two-day/three-night stay in the Residential Laboratory or Biological Studies Unit of the New
      York State Psychiatric Institute for comprehensive assessments. The major outcome variable
      will be the difference in total daily caloric intake between sibutramine and placebo.

      Assessments will concentrate on three main components of eating behavior: eating patterns,
      psychological processing, and neurocognitive function. Eating behavior studies will examine
      objective variables such as meal size, meal frequency, and subjective aspects of eating such
      as hunger and fullness. Psychological studies will measure hedonics, including craving,
      behavioral restraint, and impulsivity. Neurocognitive function assessment will gather
      information about decision-making, such as the effects of distractors (food and non-food) on
      task performance. Additionally, drawing from the field of behavioral neuroeconomics, tasks
      that assess decision-making and the influence of irrational factors on decisions will be
      assessed. Neuroimaging (fMRI) procedures will also be conducted, and will augment the
      psychological and neurocognitive assessments by providing a window into the underlying neural
      circuitry involved.

      Following the double-blind phase, participants will be offered open treatment with
      sibutramine for weight loss.
