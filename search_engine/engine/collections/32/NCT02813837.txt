      antigen receptor T cells therapy in treating patients with CD19 positive malignant B-cell
      derived leukemia and lymphoma that is relapsed (after stem cell transplantation or
      chemotherapy) or refractory to chemotherapy. When patients enroll in this trial, autologous
      CD19CART cells were generated from the mononuclear cells of the patient's peripheral blood
      (PB). During the term of cell preparation of CD19CART cells, patients will receive a
      conditioning regimen. One day after completing conditioning regimen, the patient will be
      given infusions of CD19CART cells into the vein over a period of 1 to 3 days. Patients will
      be monitored for a response, toxic effects, and the expansion and persistence of circulating
      CD19CART cells.
