      related to its ability to block peripheral nociceptor transmission after tissue damage but
      also in preventing sensitization of the central nervous system. Levobupivacaine is new,
      long-acting bupivacaine, amide-type local anesthetic and is thought to be less cardio and
      neurotoxic. However, few studies showed that local infiltration of levobupivacaine reduces
      the intensity of postoperative pain. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective Î±2-adrenoceptor
      agonist recently introduced to anesthesia practice producing dose-dependent sedation,
      anxiolysis, and analgesia (involving spinal and supraspinal sites), without respiratory
      depression. Dexmedetomidine is being used off-label as an adjunctive agent in pediatric
      patients for sedation and analgesia; in the critical care unit, during non-invasive (
      Magnetic resonance imaging) and invasive procedures ( cardiac catheterization and endoscopy).
      It may also decrease opioid usage and anesthesia requirements as seen from adult data prevent
      emergence delirium and postanesthesia shivering.
