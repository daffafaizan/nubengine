      tongue-palate contact, has well-established usefulness as a biofeedback tool in speech
      therapy. While EPG has also been shown to be capable of revealing the details of
      linguopalatal interactions during swallowing, its applicability in swallowing therapy has not
      been evaluated to date. This study will determine if EPG can facilitate bolus propulsion in
      patients presenting with swallowing problems of the oral phase. Ten patients with oral
      dysphagia will be selected to serve as subjects based on specific inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, and each will be custom-fitted with a pseudo-palate. Each patient will undergo four
      45-minute sessions of biofeedback training with emphasis on developing systematic
      front-to-back anchoring of the tongue against the palate during propulsion of liquid and
      semisolid boluses. Ultrasound imaging will be used to determine swallow durations and
      identify oral deficits of swallowing before the EPG biofeedback training, and to identify any
      changes that may result from the training. Quantitative measurements will also be made of the
      swallow-related EPG contact timing and pattern before and after training and compared for
      each individual subject as a function of training and bolus volume. Appropriate statistical
      analyses will be conducted.
