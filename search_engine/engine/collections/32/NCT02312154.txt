      balanced (1:1), split-face randomized clinical trial. Twenty-four participants completed the
      study, and no participants withdrew due to adverse effects. Each participant submitted to a
      single treatment with a NASHA injection to one side of the lower cheek. One dermatologist who
      was blinded as to the treatment side evaluated the skin hydration, melanin content, erythema,
      and elasticity of both cheeks using a corneometer, a mexameter, and a reviscometer,
      respectively, at each follow-up visit (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postinjection). The
      subjects and two independent investigators assessed the clinical improvement using the Global
      Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at the every visit. Adverse events were self-reported by
      the patients completing a questionnaire.
