      ischemia of the uterine muscle, which consequently causes pelvic pain. A large number of
      drugs have been studied for pain relief in dysmenorrhea patients, with non-steroid
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) being the most effective with the overall success rate of
      more than 75%. Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is an inhibitor that augments the vasodilatory
      effects of nitric oxide by preventing the degradation of Cyclic guanosine monophosphate
      (cGMP) in the uterine muscle. Sildenafil is commonly used in the treatment of male erectile
      dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension in children and adults, and in vitro fertilization. To
      date it has not been used in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.
