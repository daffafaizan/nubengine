      includes agitation, aggression, excitement and violence. An investigation showed that about
      26% psychotic patients were brought to the psychiatric emergency room because of the
      psychotic agitation symptoms. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy between
      risperidone oral solution combination clonazepam oral and haloperidol IM injection on
      controlling psychotic agitation in patients of acute schizophrenia and
      schizophrenic-affective disorder.

      The secondary objectives are: (1) to explore the possibility of decreasing efficacy of acute
      6 weeks treatment from IM injection to oral; (2) to compare the safety between risperidone
      oral solution combination clonazepam oral and haloperidol IM injection.
