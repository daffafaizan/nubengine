      Transplant (PBSCT) which requires appropriate and effective management. Mucositis is a
      condition in which there is inflammation and ulceration of the mouth, throat and gut caused
      by damage to the mucosal barrier induced by chemo- and radiotherapy. Symptoms include pain,
      nausea, abdominal cramping, and vomiting. This study will investigate whether ATL-104, when
      administered as a swallowable mouthwash, is safe and well tolerated in patients undergoing
      PBSCT and to investigate its potential to reduce the level of severity of mucositis
      associated with PBSCT.
