      infection, and the scant available data on transgender men (TM) suggests they are also at
      risk. TW have accounted for only 0.2% of all participants in bio-behavioral HIV prevention
      trials using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and TM have typically not been included. TW and
      TM adolescents have received even less attention in PrEP trials.

      Although tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), the FDA-approved PrEP drug,
      would not be expected to interact with cross-sex hormone therapy (cs-HT; estradiol and
      testosterone) based on known mechanisms and data from studies with hormonal contraceptives,
      there are no data that prove this. Given this lack of data, TW and TM youth on cs-HT have
      decreased PrEP uptake and adherence due to concerns that PrEP may reduce the effectiveness of
      cs-HT. To address these critical scientific gaps in PrEP safety for transgender youth and to
      plan for appropriate implementation, the investigators propose the following study in 3
      integrated phases. In Phase 1, investigators will conduct a PK study exploring the
      interactions of cs-HT for both TW and TM on TDF/FTC. Simultaneously, in Phase 2,
      investigators will collect ethnographic data via focus groups and in-depth interviews to
      inform the development of a tailored gender-affirmative intervention to improve uptake and
      adherence to PrEP in transgender youth. In Phase 3, investigators will conduct a small
      demonstration trial of PrEP use in TW and TM youth, utilizing the ethnographically developed
      intervention to improve uptake and adherence, while also monitoring renal and bone safety
      outcomes.
