      oxidative stress and alterations in sperm parameters. Inflammation also affect the glands of
      the genital tract. This can eventually leads to male infertility, long after the initial
      infection. But 10% of men who seek treatment for infertility have such a leucospermia, while
      it is a potentially treatable cause.

      Main aim of this study: Search of development of an inflammatory genital tract syndrome in
      patients with urethritis proven and treated at 6 months after the end of treatment.This group
      of patients will be compared to a control group with no urethritis and no history of
      urogenital infection. Monocentric, prospective trial.

      Primary endpoint: Seminal elastase value to 6 months after the end of treatment. (500ng/ml or
      greater)

      Secondary objective:

        -  Search for a genital inflammation in patients with urethritis proven and treated at 12
           months after the end of treatment

        -  Search for oxidative stress in patients with urethritis proven and treated at 6 and 12
           months after the end of treatment

        -  Study of the frequency of relapses infectious and / or passages at the stage of chronic
           infection after acute urethritis

        -  Assessment of the parallel evolution of the quality of sperm in the two groups

      Progress of research. Time frame Search :

        -  Duration of inclusions: 12 months

        -  Duration of patient follow-up: 12 months for control group, 14 months at most for
           patients taking into account the duration of treatment for urethritis which is 4 to 6
           weeks

        -  Total duration of the study: 26 months

      Patients & Methods: French monocentric, prospective trial. 300 subjects are planned to be
      included for 150 subjects in each group
