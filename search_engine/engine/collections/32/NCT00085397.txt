      Primary

        -  Compare the tumor-specific immune response, in terms of the number of gp100-specific
           cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, T-cell production of interferon gamma, or T-cell proliferation
           in response to in vitro exposure to gp100 and tumor lysate, in patients with stage III
           or IV melanoma treated with autologous dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with gp100 antigen vs
           autologous DC fused with autologous tumor cells.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the safety and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the therapeutic effect of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients undergo leukapheresis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are cultured to
      generate dendritic cells (DC).

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgical harvesting of tumor cells for subsequent fusion.
           Patients receive vaccination comprising DC fused with autologous tumor cells
           subcutaneously on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Patients who
           achieve a partial (PR) or complete response (CR) may receive an additional 3 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vaccination comprising DC pulsed with gp100 antigen IV on day
           1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Patients who achieve a PR or CR may
           receive an additional 6 courses.

      In both arms, patients are followed monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
