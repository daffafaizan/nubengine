      study visit, parent-administered questionnaires will be used to collect information on the
      following: (a) the participant's demographic background (age, gender, and race), (b)
      socio-economic status (parents' income and housing condition), (c) participant's oral health
      practice (feeding histories, diet habits, oral hygiene measures, and dental attendance), and
      (d) systemic diseases. During the study visit, the participant's complete medical and dental
      history will be obtained and reviewed, and a dental exam will be performed in order to
      determine participants' caries status, and intraoral pictures may be taken of participants'
      teeth.

      Participants will not be allowed to brush or clean teeth using any type of oral hygiene
      procedures for 8 hours prior to sample collection. Saliva and plaque (The solf
      white-yellowish material on the tooth surface) will be collected. The Investigator will use a
      small probe to measure the pH of the dental plaque that builds up on the teeth. The
      participant will be asked to dip one finger into a glass containing a buffer solution and the
      probe will be placed on the teeth from which plaque will be taken.

      Dental plaque will be collected from the participants between the ages of 2 and 5 with at
      least two teeth and who allow the dental examination and the sample collection procedures to
      be done safely. Plaque samples will be collected by gently scrapping the tooth using a
      sterile instrument. If the participant does not have enough plaque samples, they will be
      asked to return on the following day. Saliva will be collected by using cotton swabs or by
      asking the participant to spit into a sterile plastic container.
