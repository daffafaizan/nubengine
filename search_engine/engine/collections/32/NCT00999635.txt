      preventative management of neuropathic diabetic feet, assessing effects on peak pressure,
      forefoot pressure time integral, total contact area, forefoot rate of loading, duration of
      load as a percentage of stance, quality of life, perceived foot health and cost.

      Method Pilot work investigating the physical properties of materials used to fabricate
      insoles informed material selection. A single-blind randomised control trial recruited 119
      neuropathic participants with diabetes from two Primary Care Trusts and randomly allocated
      them to either custom-made functional insoles or prefabricated insoles. Data was collected at
      issue and 6-month follow-up, using the F-scan in-shoe pressure measurement system. Patient
      perceptions were assessed with the Bristol Foot Score and Audit of Diabetes Dependant Quality
      of Life. Further analyses were carried out on two subgroups; 1) insole effect on peak
      pressure in 44 participants with pronated feet, over a 6-month follow-up period; 2) insole
      durability, investigated in a second subgroup of 60 participants for 12-months. Durability
      was evaluated in terms of change in insole thickness and reduction in peak pressure.

      To increase the robustness of results, data analysis was calculated using three strategies;
      1) pure intention-to-treat analysis, including all 119 participants randomised to an
      intervention; 2) intention-to-treat analysis, using all available data; 3) as-treated
      analysis, including those participants self-reporting full insole compliance, defined as 60%
      or more daytime wear.
