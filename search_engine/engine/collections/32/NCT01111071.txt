      infarction but have lacked patient-level data. Those with individual-level data have been
      limited by:

        -  use of in-hospital mortality as an outcome measure, which can be affected by length of
           stay,

        -  restriction to patients aged 65 and over, or otherwise selected patients, and

        -  patient-level explanatory factors lacking clinical detail, particularly medications
           given in hospital.

      MINAP patient-level data allow the investigation of hospital variation in mortality
      (in-hospital and 30-day) in a group of unselected patients, taking into account clinical
      details such as medication use in hospital, as well as features of the hospitals providing
      care. The proposed study will establish the extent of variation between hospitals in England
      and Wales, whether this varies by ACS diagnosis, whether the variation has reduced over time
      and finally which patient-level or hospital-level factors explain any variation found.

      A statistical analytic protocol for this study, dated 15.4.2010, is available on request.

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).
