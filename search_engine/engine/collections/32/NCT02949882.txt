    
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of a probiotic intervention and a non-probiotic
      intervention on bowel habits of elderly (>80 years on average) in several nursing homes in
      the Netherlands.

      A randomized, double-blind, superiority, multicentre trial. In this trial a probiotic
      fermented milk drink will be compared to a non-probiotic drink on its potential to improve
      bowel habits. Both drinks are commercially available in the supermarket. After a run-in
      period of 2 weeks, 260 subjects will be randomized (1:1) into either the probiotic fermented
      milk arm (n=130) or the non-probiotic drink arm (n=130), both for a period of 10 weeks.

      The study population consists of 260 frail elderly of relatively high age (>80 years old on
      average) living in several nursing homes in The Netherlands. One arm receives daily one
      bottle (65 ml) of Yakult Original (YOR), a probiotic fermented milk drink containing at least
      6,5*10^9 colony forming units (cfu) of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS), for 10 consecutive
      weeks without changing the regular diet. The other arm will receive a dairy milk drink (AH
      Basic Dairy Peach Drink, 65 mL) for 10 consecutive weeks, also without changing the regular
      diet.

      The change in bowel habits of the subjects will be measured according to two main study
      parameters; (a) Stool-quality according to the 7-point Bristol stool chart, and (b)
      defecation frequency, measured as number of stools per time unit.
