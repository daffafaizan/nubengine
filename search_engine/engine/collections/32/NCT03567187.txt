      cryoneurolysis in people with unilateral ankle osteoarthritis (OA). The investigators will
      treat 1) the Superficial Fibular Nerve (SFN), Sural Nerve (SN) and Saphenous Nerve and/or 2)
      the Deep Fibular Nerve (DFN) with cryoneurolysis using the ioveraÂ° device. The primary study
      endpoint, clinically significant improvement in pain 12 weeks after each treatment, will be
      assessed using the FAOS pain subscale. If a participant is a non-responder (<20% improvement
      in pain within the 12 weeks following baseline), then the other treatment will be offered
      (e.g. if start with superficial group, then offer the DFN).

      The secondary outcomes will be improvement in quality of life (FAOS-QoL), activities of daily
      living (FAOS-ADL) and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain.

      The tertiary outcome will be improvement in physical performance measures (40m fast-paced
      walking test, standing balance test).
