    
      This trial consists of 4 treatment arms: 3 LY2623091 dose levels and eplerenone. Each
      participant will participate in 2 treatment periods, with a minimum wash-out period of 28
      days between dosing in the 2 treatment periods. Dosing days will be numbered 1-21 in each of
      the 2 treatment periods. Participants will receive different treatments in periods 1 and 2.
      Participants will be housed as inpatients during the days of the controlled diet
      administration and the oral potassium challenge and until at least 24 hours after its
      completion (Days -3 to 1; Days 19 to 22, in each treatment period). Otherwise the study will
      be done on an outpatient basis, with participants returning to the clinic for evaluations
      during each treatment period (Days 3 or 4, 7, and 14).
