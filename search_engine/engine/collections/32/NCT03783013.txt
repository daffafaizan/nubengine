      chronic inflammation. Short term inflammation is an important part of the body's response to
      injury, but long term inflammation, as happens in the state of obesity, can result in a
      multitude of secondary problems, like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Using a
      novel tomato-soy juice, we aim to demonstrate the potential of tomato-soy juice for reducing
      inflammation in adults.
