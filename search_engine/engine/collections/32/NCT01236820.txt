      (CKD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) is an essential indicator
      of CVD.The higher the plasma LDL level, the higher the risk of CVD. LDL is a heterogenous
      substance composed of different mass and size. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) is the oxidation product
      of LDL and is the most important component of LDL associated with CVD. The oxLDL is mostly
      trapped within tissue and not easily to be detected from blood. L5 iw a kind of
      electronegative LDL and is associated with CVD in smokers and diabetic patients, even if
      these patients have normal plasma LDL. Uremia patients have lipid profile different from that
      of general people,while HD Patients have lower LDL and CKD patients have LDL higher than that
      of general population. Thus LDL plasma level cannot fully explain the high risk of CVD in CKD
      and HD patients. As patients with normal LDL but high L5 are prone to have CVD, we suspect
      there might be association of L5 with CVD in both CKD and HD patients.
