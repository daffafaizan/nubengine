      Aim 1: To determine whether diagnosis and prophylaxis of corneal abrasions by village health
      workers will reduce the incidence of corneal ulceration in rural South India. The
      investigators hypothesize that communities in which village eye health workers are available
      to diagnose and prophylax corneal abrasions will have a significantly lower incidence of
      corneal ulceration compared to communities without this service.

      Aim 2: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a village eye worker program to prevent corneal
      ulcers. The investigators hypothesize that preventing corneal ulcers through a village eye
      worker program will be more cost-effective than the current standard of treating corneal
      ulcers after patients present at health care facilities.

      Aim 3: To determine the incidence of corneal ulceration in this South Indian population. The
      investigators anticipate that the incidence of ulcers is lower than estimated in our 1995
      incidence survey, but still far higher than that observed in the developed world.
