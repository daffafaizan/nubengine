      brought to guide the study of risk assessment and early detection of cancers. This proposed
      study aims to develop a non-invasive DNA methylation-based assay system elucidating a panel
      of aberrantly hypermethylated genes from urothelial tumors and urine sediments, to improve
      the risk assessment of urothelial carcinoma; such as early diagnosis, prognosis, and
      prediction of response to therapeutic regimes. This proposal will establish several
      techniques to study the methylation status on gene promoter regions. Three tasks will be
      achieved in this study: (1) Profiling the aberrant DNA methylation in urothelial carcinoma
      and determining potential prediction biomarkers. (2) Establishing a non-invasive assay by
      detecting DNA hypermethylation status in exfoliated cells collected from void urine; (3)
      Mapping the DNA hypermethylation changes from normal to malignant urothelial tumors and
      studying the underlying mechanism. Through the collaboration of a genetic toxicologist
      (Te-Chang Lee, PhD, IBMS), a urologist (Yeong-Shiau Pu, MD/PhD, NTUH) and epidemiologists
      (Hung-Yi Chiou, PhD, Taipei Medical University), we will explore the risk biomarkers for
      urothelial carcinoma.
