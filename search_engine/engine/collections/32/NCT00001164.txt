      viral-induced abnormalities, patients with neurological degenerations, and normal controls be
      evaluated with various in vitro studies of immunologic, genetic, and virologic function. This
      is to include studies of peripheral blood (cells and serum) as well as studies of skin
      obtained with a biopsy instrument. In addition, studies of gastrointestinal function will be
      performed where appropriate.
