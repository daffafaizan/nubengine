    
      This is a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled (an inactive
      substance is given to one group of participants while active drug is given to another group
      of participants to see if there is a difference in response), parallel-group (study drugs
      given to participants in all treatment groups during the same time period) to evaluate the
      efficacy (capacity of the investigational drug to produce an effect), safety, and
      tolerability of fulranumab administered as adjunctive therapy (in combination with other drug
      therapy) to participants with chronic moderate to severe pain and functional impairment from
      knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA) that is not adequately controlled by current pain therapy.
      The duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be up to 67
      weeks (includes a screening period of 3 weeks, a double-blind treatment period of 16 weeks,
      and a post-treatment follow-up period of up to 48 weeks). All participants will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatments (placebo, fulranumab 1mg, fulranumab 3mg) and
      given a single injection subcutaneously (under the skin) once every 4 weeks for up to 16
      weeks. In addition, participants may elect to receive adjunctive therapy (ie, double-blind
      supplemental oral analgesic medication or matching placebo) throughout the double-blind
      treatment period. Blood samples will be collected from each participant at time points during
      the study. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, physical
      examinations, laboratory tests and vital signs which will be monitored throughout the study.
