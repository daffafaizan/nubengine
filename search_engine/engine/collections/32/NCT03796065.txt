      for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery
      by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation
      and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong
      feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as
      barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in
      refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a
      family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family
      functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2 Effectiveness-Implementation
      Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2)
      identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers
      by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3)
      strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying
      CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities,
      service providers, and academic stakeholders.
