      Rehabilitation (PR) is very small. The current model of a center-based PR program fails to
      address the needs of many patients with COPD. The most common patient barrier to attendance
      is travel to center-based programs, particularly for frail patients with more severe COPD who
      need transportation assistance. Home-based, unsupervised PR has been proposed as an
      alternative model to hospital-based programs and has been found to be safe and effective.

      In this pilot study researchers will investigate barriers, facilitators and adherence to a
      home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program after hospitalization. The results of this pilot
      study will inform the second part of this study as a randomized control study under a
      different grant (Study 2/R33). Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used for the
      evaluation.

      10 patients will be enrolled in this pilot study and allocated to a home-based PR in order to
      polish the intervention before the randomized portion of the study. This pilot is supported
      by a grant mechanism (R61) explicitly oriented to adjust the intervention and identify
      barriers for the next randomized portion of this study (Study 2) supported by a separate
      grant mechanism (R33).
