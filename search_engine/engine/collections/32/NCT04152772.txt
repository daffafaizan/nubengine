      weeks. Ninety participants will be exposed to a fear conditioning, extinction and recall
      paradigm at three separate study visits; one of these study visits will include active or
      sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for a period of 15-20 minutes. Additional
      study procedures will include a screening period and two optional MRI scans, one done on
      study day 2 and one done on study day 5.

      SUB-STUDY: The objective of this sub-study is to test performance differences between
      configural and elemental contextual processing in individuals across the PTSD spectrum using
      an online, panel-based platform. Following a within-subjects study design, 500 adult
      participants, 18 years and older, will be asked to complete experimental tasks that assesses
      configural and elemental contextual learning and memory. They will also provide demographic
      information and complete questionnaires.
