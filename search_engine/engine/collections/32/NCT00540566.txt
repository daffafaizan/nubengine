      tissue perfusion, oxygen consumption, and cell/matrix development. Each measurement requires
      less than 5 minutes to execute. The measurements will be taken before and after skin
      treatment.This non-invasive, non-contact technique has great potential as a means to diagnose
      different skin problems without the need to obtain a piece of tissue from the skin.
