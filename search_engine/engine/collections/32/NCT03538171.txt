      well they work compared to exemestane alone in treating Chinese patients with hormone
      receptor-positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancers.

      Estrogen can drive the growth of breast cancer cells. Exemestane may fight breast cancer by
      lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes from tissue aromatase. Entinostat may enhance
      the anti-tumor effect of exemestane in breast cancer by helping to overcome tumor resistance
      via epigenetic modifications. Previous Phase II trial in US breast cancer patients have
      demonstrated significant effects of combined therapy in slowing disease progression and on
      patient survival when compared to exemestane alone. It is not yet known whether exemestane is
      more effective when combined with entinostat in Chinese patients with advanced breast cancer.
      In this parallel, randomized, double blind, active controlled study, we will study the effect
      of entinostat/placebo in combination with exemestane in Chinese patients with hormone
      receptor-positive, HER2 receptor-negative, locally advance or metastatic breast cancer, who
      have experienced disease progression with prior endocrine therapies.
