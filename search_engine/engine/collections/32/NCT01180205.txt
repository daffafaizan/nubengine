      mono-center study to primarily compare the effects on endothelial function of the combination
      of telmisartan and amlodipine versus olmesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive
      patients at risk beyond blood pressure. Additionally, key secondary endpoints for this trial
      are the changes in plaque and intima media complex echogenicity and the change in arterial
      stiffness after 26 weeks of treatment.

      576 patients will be included in the study after a screening period of two weeks and then
      randomised in one of the two treatment groups. Pretreatment with ARBs, ACE-Inhibitors,
      amlodipine and diuretics will be stopped last day before visit 2. At visit 2 the treatment
      with either telmisartan and amlodipine or olmesartan and hydrochlorothiazide starts, so that
      no medication is stopped without having been replaced by the study medication. After two
      weeks treatment all patients will be up-titrated and having the maintenance dose for the
      following 24 weeks. The trial will be performed at one center in Germany with access to
      patients with hypertension. Patients will be recruited from the Department of Cardiology of
      the university Mainz. There will be a promotion flyer and an information booklet about the
      study for cardiologists practicising near Mainz, who like to sent their patient to the study
      center. Sponsor of the trial is the university Mainz.

      Stefan Blankenberg, MD has been designated as Principal Investigator for this national,
      mono-center trial.

      The study will be completed when the last patient had his last visit and the telephone follow
      - up two weeks later will be performed. This latest patient contact is defined as end of
      trial.
