      breast that combines the benefits of a 3-D anatomical technique (Digital Tomosynthesis) with
      those of a functional imaging technique (Molecular Breast Imaging). Combining data from these
      2 modalities would provide co-registered functional and anatomical information on the breast,
      in the same way that PET/CT does today in oncology. This should greatly facilitate the
      evaluation and biopsy of lesions seen on MBI but occult on conventional mammography.
