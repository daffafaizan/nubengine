      measured at first visit, followed by visits at week4 , week 8 and week 12. Blood samples will
      be drawn at week 4 and week 12 for following analyses of drug plasma concentrations. SNPs in
      CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and calcium channel v 1.2 will be genotyped using SNPstream.

      The differences in the decrease of blood pressures and the durg plasma concentrations between
      genotypes will be analyzed.
