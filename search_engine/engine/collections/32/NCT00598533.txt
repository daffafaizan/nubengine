      Probucol-eluting stent with a polymer based Zotarolimus-eluting stent. Patients with
      symptomatic coronary artery disease without cardiogenic shock who will undergo coronary
      angiography and willing to participate in the trial will receive a loading dose of 600mg
      clopidogrel at least 2 hours before the procedure. They will be randomized to receive one of
      the above mentioned stents.
