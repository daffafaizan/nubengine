      chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, etc. These
      patients may be anemic prior to the surgery, and are at increased risk for further blood loss
      as a result of the fracture and surgical operation. However, intra-operative or
      post-operative blood transfusions also increase the risk of renal and cardiac complications
      in this population.

      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti-fibrinolytic medication that has transformed total joint
      replacement management regarding blood loss prevention. Geriatric patients requiring emergent
      hip fracture repair may significantly benefit from routine administration of TXA prior to the
      procedure to decrease the risk of blood loss. Thus, treatment may further reduce the
      percentage of patients who experience blood transfusions and complications associated with
      transfusions.

      The investigators will examine if administration of TXA prior to incision in the geriatric
      hip fracture patient population decreases the risk of intra-operative or post-operative blood
      transfusions compared to placebo.
