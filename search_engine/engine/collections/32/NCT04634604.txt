      treatment with either intravitreous bevacizumab 0.063 mg or peripheral retinal laser
      ablation. Study exams will be at weeks 1, 2, and 4 weeks, and at 2 and 4-months
      post-treatment (and re-treatment when indicated). Additional study exams will occur at
      adjusted age 6 months, 1 year, and then annually for 5 more years. Non-study examinations
      will be at clinician discretion and are likely to occur more often. The primary outcome will
      be treatment success, defined as no worsening of ROP 5-13 days after treatment (or
      re-treatment if indicated), no plus disease or severe neovascularization 2 weeks to 6 months
      after treatment (or re-treatment if indicated), and no unfavorable structural outcome (or
      prior scleral buckle or vitrectomy) at 6 months adjusted age. Important secondary outcomes
      include the number of re-treatments, extent of retinal vascularization, refractive error,
      neurodevelopment assessed by the Bayley-4 test, IQ and neuropsychiatric testing, visual
      acuity, visual fields, and systemic morbidities.
