      epithelial brushes followed by a segmental instillation of allergen (grass mix or house dust
      mite) alone, in combination with Diesel particles, further in combination with Diesel
      particles without organic compounds and saline as control into four different lung segments.
      After 24 hours, during a second bronchoscopy, BAL samples will be collected in these
      challenged segments in order to obtain cells and lavage fluid for cell biological and
      immunological analysis.
