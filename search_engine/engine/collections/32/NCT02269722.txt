      cardiac catheterization with respect to achieving hemostasis and the incidence of radial
      artery occlusion. The investigators hypothesize that shorter radial artery clamp times
      following cardiac catheterization will achieve similar hemostasis to longer clamp times with
      a decrease in the incidence of radial artery occlusion.
