      (the LRS ThermoSuit(R) System) to cool patients who are comatose following resuscitation from
      cardiac arrest. This device cools by circulating cold water directly against the skin of the
      patient. Cooling to a state of mild hypothermia (32 to 34 degrees C, maintained for 12 to 24
      hours) is recognized by the American Heart Association, European Resuscitation Council, and
      the Canadian Association of Emergency Care Physicians as a promising therapy for such
      patients, and is likely to be most effective if administered quickly following resuscitation.
      It is hypothesized that this new device will cool patients much more quickly than by
      historical means. Patients will be monitored for physiologic parameters such as body
      temperature during the cooling therapy, and will be tracked for neurological outcomes
      following treatment.
