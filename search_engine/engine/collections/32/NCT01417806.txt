      the combination of SOM230 and topotecan in patients with SCLC who relapsed or progressed
      after front-line chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SOM230 in combination with topotecan in this population.
      The primary end point is progression free survival. The secondary objective is response rate
      duration of response , overall survival , safety and tolerability. Patient who is eligible
      for the study will received topotecan 1.5mg/m2 on day 1-5 and SOM230 60mg on day 1 every 28
      days until tumor progression or toxicity limit further treatment. Contrast-enhanced CT scans
      will be performed at baseline and every 2 months (or sooner if clinically indicated) to
      assess the response, duration of response, and time to tumor progression Patients will be
      allowed to remain on therapy if treatment is tolerated and if there is no evidence of
      progression for a maximum of 1 year or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
