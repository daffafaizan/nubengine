      some retrospective studies and preclinical studies, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is
      suggested to be more favorable than inhalation anesthesia regarding cancer recurrence and
      survival after surgery. However, there is no randomized controlled study to determine this
      difference in colon cancer patients.
