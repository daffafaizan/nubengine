      therapeutic effect of the IMUNOR速 preparation, which is commonly used to treat patients with
      laboratory or clinical manifestations of immunity disorders. Administration of
      immunomodulation treatment will be based upon a willing informed consent with the
      administration of the drug and based upon random selection. The study subjects will receive
      IMUNOR速 preventively; the anticipated preventive effect when using one packing (4 vials) is 6
      weeks, and 12 weeks when using two packings. Should any signs of acute illness appear
      (increased body temperature, cough, loss of smell and taste, etc.), a treatment dose of
      IMUNOR速, i.e. 1 vial/day (total of 4 vials) will be administered immediately. Monitoring of
      individual patients will take 6 weeks (1 packing) or 12 weeks (2 packings) from the beginning
      of IMUNOR速 administration. The clinical condition of study subjects will be monitored on a
      daily basis. At the same time, possible onset of symptoms will be recorded.

      The obtained data will be compared with a control group consisting of patients followed by
      the Department of Preventive 'Medicine, University Hospital Ostrava.
