      system in clinical practice to enhance the rehabilitation of service members with lower limb
      dysfunction. Up to 100 subjects will be consented, with the expectation that 80% (e.g., n=80)
      will complete the study with a complete dataset. Baseline sessions will consist of 7 minutes
      of walking at a self-selected speed between 0.7 and 1.3 m/s, after which participants will
      take the PLUS-M 12 Item Short Form and PROMIS-29 questionnaires, as well as a short survey.
      Participants will complete the questionnaires again at 1 month and 3 month. Providers who
      observed/operated the KinetiGait system will also take a short survey on ease of use and
      satisfaction.
