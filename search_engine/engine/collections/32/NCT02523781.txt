      assessing demographic data, knowledge about risks in the future, perception of cardiovascular
      risk, anxiety about that risk and satisfaction about information received or collected.

      Then, women in the intervention group will receive the pamphlet. One month after, women in
      both groups will receive a questionnaire similar to the first one assessing knowledge about
      risks in the future, perception of cardiovascular risk, anxiety about that risk and
      satisfaction about information received or collected, including the pamphlet for the
      intervention group.

      The pamphlet was validated by a multidisciplany team including patients, doctors, nurses,
      education specialists and communication specialists.

      The questionnaire was also validated by the same multidisciplinary team. Section on knowledge
      and anxiety were remodeled from previously validated questionnaires Section on perception of
      cardiovascular risk was reproduced and translated with permission from its author.
