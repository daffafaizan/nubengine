    
      The study will be conducted in two parts.

      Part 1: For the initial evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetic exposure and pharmacodynamic
      response, subjects will be tapered off antihypertensive background therapy.The initial
      starting dose will be a sub-therapeutic dose. Dose escalation will continue with a maximum of
      a doubling of the previous dose until either 1) a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identified
      or 2) modeling of the pharmacokinetic (PK) data indicate that maximum exposure (Cmax) at the
      next planned dose level would exceed a maximum drug concentration (Cmax) which was the
      maximum observed drug concentration following a single subcutaneous administration in Study
      PB1046-PT-CL-0001.

      Part 2: The dose group which is capable of providing a Cmax exposure which is capable of
      eliciting a clinically relevant hemodynamic response, will be expanded to enroll an
      additional 12 subjects (6 active and 6 placebo).
