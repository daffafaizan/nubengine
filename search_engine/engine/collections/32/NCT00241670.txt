      combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Cytoreductive surgery is generally
      considered beneficial but complete resection of contrast enhancing tumor is achieved in less
      than 20 % of patients, one reason being the difficulty in discerning marginal, enhancing
      tumor intraoperatively.

      Five-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) leads to the accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in
      malignant gliomas, a phenomenon under exploration for intraoperative identification and
      resection of these tumors. This study investigated the benefit derived from
      fluorescent-guided resections using 5-ALA on surgical radicality, progression-free survival
      and morbidity.
