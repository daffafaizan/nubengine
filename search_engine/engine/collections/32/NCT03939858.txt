      • To determine the feasibility of performing bioenergetic profiling in glioblastoma patients
      receiving chemoradiation by ascertaining the proportion of patients who have enough white
      blood cells in a 16 mL blood to successfully perform the profiling assays.

      Secondary Objectives:

      • To determine if either pre-radiotherapy bioenergetic profile or the change in bioenergetic
      profile from pre-radiotherapy to post-radiotherapy are predictive of subacute cognitive
      decline after radiation.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo neurocognitive testing over 1 hour using a customized battery of
      tests designed for brain tumor patients at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center.
      Patients also undergo blood collection at baseline and at 1 and 3 months post radiotherapy.
