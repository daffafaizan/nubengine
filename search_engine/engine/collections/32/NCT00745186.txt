      levels, in patients with diabetes. It primarily functions as a counter-regulatory hormone by
      opposing the actions of insulin to maintain blood glucose levels. A major problem for
      diabetic patients with hypoglycemia is the development of defective counter regulatory
      responses including reduced or absent glucagon responses to hypoglycemia. Mayne Glucagon for
      Injection has been developed as an alternative to currently marketed products.

      Administration of exogenous glucagon i.e., not produced in the body, has been shown to be
      effective in the treatment of low blood sugar in patients with diabetes. Mayne has developed
      a product, Glucagon for Injection, which is an alternative to currently marketed products.
      The only difference is the source of the active ingredient. The formulation, routes of
      administration, dosage regimen and indications of Mayne Glucagon for Injection are identical
      to those currently registered for the marketed product.

      A total of 28 healthy volunteers will be recruited into this study at one investigational
      site.
