      a gynaecological outpatient clinic for a number of years. The aim of such follow-up is to
      detect recurrence, improve survival and reduce adverse effects of the treatment. The national
      guide for oncological gynaecology recommends follow-up by a specialist for five years at
      intervals depending on cancer type. Several review studies on follow-up of endometrial,
      cervical and ovarian cancer patients show large international variations in follow-up
      routines. There are only retrospective studies available, and they indicate that most
      recurrences are discovered within the first three years after completed treatment, and, in
      most cases, by the women themselves. More intensive surveillance does not appear to affect
      the time for discovery of recurrence.

      A few randomised controlled studies and retrospective cohort studies have been published that
      focus on follow-up of colon cancer and breast cancer patients by general practitioners versus
      by hospital specialists. These studies have not shown any significant differences between the
      groups in terms of detection of recurrence, incidence of serious clinical events connected
      with recurrence or health-related quality of life.

      The investigators therefore plan to perform a study in which both gynaecological cancer
      patients and their regular general practitioners are asked about their views on patient
      follow-up after completed treatment. The investigators especially wish to focus on the
      collaboration aspect.
