      according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The three drop aids used in this study
      will be the Fabrication Autodrop Eye Drop Guide, Owen Mumford OP 6100 Autosqueeze, and the
      Simply Touch Eye Drop Applicator. Patients will be randomly placed on one of these drops aids
      for a total of 3 study groups or the no drop aid control, for a total of 4 groups. Prior to
      use of the drop aid, patients will be instructed on how to use the drop aid by a resident
      physician and a pre- intervention intraocular pressure check will be performed by the
      resident physician using an applicator. Intraocular pressure is the only adjustable risk
      factor for glaucoma; thus, glaucoma treatments slow progression of glaucoma by reducing
      intraocular pressure. In addition, patients will be requested to deliver their drops with the
      drop aid with every use. Furthermore, each patient will record the number of days taken to
      complete the glaucoma medication bottle while using the drop aid. At the 3 and 6 week marks,
      the patient will fill out a satisfaction survey. Patients will need to return to the clinic
      at the 6 week mark and can fill out the satisfaction survey at the clinic in addition to
      checking the intraocular pressure post-intervention. Thus, the number of subject contact will
      be two, pre and post-intervention, the duration of participation for each subject will be 6
      weeks, and the patient will also be required to fill out two satisfaction surveys. The
      effectiveness of the drop aids will be compared to the two controls and measured with any
      changes in intraocular pressure readings, length of time to medication completion, and
      patient satisfaction according to the surveys.
