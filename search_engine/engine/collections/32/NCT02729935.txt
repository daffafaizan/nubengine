      parecoxib 30 min before surgery and Control Group C: an equal volume of saline.

      Lumber subarachnoid block was administered with 2 ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 2.5 Âµg
      Sufentanyl. Intra-operatively, urinary catherization was performed with a 16 Fr Foley's
      catheter, and the balloon was inflated with 10 ml distilled water. The CRBD was assessed at
      0, 1, 2, and 6 h after patient's arrival in the post-anaesthesia care unit. Severity of CRBD
      was graded as none, mild, moderate and severe.
