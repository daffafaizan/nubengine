      a disease modifying antirheumatic drug. It has a long history of being safe and well
      tolerated at typical doses. HCQ has antiviral activity in vitro against coronaviruses, and
      specifically Covid-19. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine
      (HCQ) for pre exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among health care workers at high risk of occupational
      exposure to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the eligible cohort that declines treatment.
