      treatment arms, differing by the addition of tirapazamine to the therapeutic regimen.
      Treatment consists of two 21-day cycles of induction chemotherapy, followed by radiotherapy
      (RT).

      Induction chemotherapy was cisplatin 100 mg/m2 per day administered over 4 hours on Study
      Days 1 and 22 (ie, 1st day of both induction cycles) with continuous infusion (CI) 5-FU at a
      dose of 1000 mg/m2 per day for 120 hours per cycle starting on Study Days 1 and 22 (ie, days
      1 to 5 of both induction cycles).

      Patients who achieve at least partial response proceeded to chemoradiotherapy (CRT)
      consisting of localized RT + cisplatin IV + 5-FU +/- tirapazamine. Location of RT was based
      on whether the site had a CR or PR. Radiotherapy began on day 43 (week 1), and continued for
      5.5 weeks. Subjects with no response or progressive disease proceeded to salvage surgery.

      A total of 63 patients were accrued for this study over approximately 5 years. 1 subject
      withdrew consent prior to treatment for personal reasons.
