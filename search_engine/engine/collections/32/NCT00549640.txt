      of a coin). They will either receive methylphenidate or a placebo. Everyone in study will
      receive nicotine dependence counseling based on the intervention manual "Smoke Free and
      Living It". Everyone will be asked to complete weekly study visits for 8 weeks and one
      follow-up phone call at week 16 and a final study visit at week 24. The target quit day is
      the day after visit 4 (week 2 + 1 day). In the first two weeks after starting study
      medication they will slowly build up to 3 pills a day. For weeks 2 through 8 they will
      continue to take 3 pills a day.
