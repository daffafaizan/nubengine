      will be interviewed to determine if he/she has any exclusion criteria.

      If there is no contraindication, and agreement is achieved,consent forms will be signed.

      Volunteers will be examined by a lactic acid test to determine if he/she has normal or
      sensitive skin. In this test, a Finn's cell (plastic cell, size 1*1 cm) with lactic acid (50
      microliter, 10%w/v) will be placed on the volunteer's cheek for ten minutes. The volunteer
      will be defined as "sensitive" or "normal" according to the degree of discomfort they report.

      Patch-tests will be performed in the standard method. The materials to be tested will be
      placed in Finn's cells and attached to the participants healthy skin's back by a plaster
      (Micropore).The chambers will be left on the skin for 48 hours. The test will be read by a
      specialist one hour after chambers' removal and 48 hours afterwards. Any erythema,edema,
      blisters, pustules or erosions on the skin in the patch area will be considered a positive
      response, and will be evaluated by clinical tools as being of the irritant or the allergic
      type. in case of uncertainty we may use a confocal microscope for in vivo diagnosis.

      Ingredients: appropriate concentrations and solvents of the test materials will be prepared
      according to accepted standards (refer to: Anton C. De Groot: Patch Testing, 3ed Edition,
      Wapserveen, The Netherlands, 2009).Leave on products will be tested 'as is'. Rinse off
      products will be diluted to 5% and 0.5%.

      If the skin stays normal after the patch removal, it means that contact with the material did
      not cause allergy or irritation.
