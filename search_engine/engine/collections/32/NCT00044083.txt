      cognitive function. For example, COMT inhibitors can slightly improve working
      memory/executive function. Differences in the response between individuals might be related
      to a number of factors, including variations in the genes. The recent finding that a
      polymorphism in the catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene, which produces a 4 fold change
      in enzyme activity, accounts for 4 percent of the variance in performance of working memory
      tasks in humans suggest that COMT genotype may predict response to COMT inhibitors. In the
      present investigation our goal is to examine, in normal controls and patients with
      schizophrenia, the effect of a centrally acting (tolcapone) and of a peripherally acting
      (entacapone) COMT inhibitor on cognitive function. We predict that both normal controls and
      patients with schizophrenia with the val/val genotype will have a significant, though
      transient, improvement in working memory in subjects treated with tolcapone but not in those
      treated with entacapone. Furthermore, in conjunction with other NIMH imaging protocols, we
      would like to examine the neurophysiological correlates related to working memory. We
      predict, in tolcapone treated subjects, improved measures in prefrontal 'efficiency' in
      subjects and patients specifically with the val/val genotype. The present protocol will
      provide new insights on the importance of this genetic polymorphism in the regulation of
      aminergic-controlled cognitive function in normal individuals. Furthermore, this protocol
      will test whether COMT inhibitors offer a new treatment-based on genotype - for cognitive
      impairment in schizophrenia. No IND is required for the present study.
