      sweeteners consumption is considered safe and beneficial owing to their low caloric content.
      However, recent studies demonstrated that consumption of commonly used artificial sweeteners
      formulations drives the development of glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects.
      However,the effects of artificial sweeter on glucose metabolism in newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetic patients remains unknown. Thus, different doses of sweeteners will be given to newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients to investigate the effects of artificial sweeteners on
      glucose metabolism.
