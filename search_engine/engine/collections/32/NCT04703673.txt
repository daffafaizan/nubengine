      rhinosinusitis patients under self-medication with the 1,8 - cineole preparation Sinolpan® or
      Sinolpan® forte (Sinolpan® group) or with a nasally applied α-sympathomimetic (control group)
      is investigated during conditions of daily life. Patients who seek advice from a pharmacy
      regarding the treatment of their symptoms and who choose Sinolpan® (forte) or a nasal
      α-sympathomimetic can participate in this study and are asked to complete a questionnaire
      before and after the treatment. For organizational reasons, the recruitment of patients for
      the Sinolpan® group (planned number of patients: 500) or the control group (planned number of
      patients: 50) is conducted in different pharmacies.

      The primary objective of this anonymous data collection is to assess the quality of life in
      patients with rhinosinusitis. The German version of the Rhinosinusitis Quality of Life
      questionnaire, which was only recently validated in a doctoral thesis, is used for this
      purpose. Additionally, for patients in the Sinolpan® group who also suffer from bronchitis,
      the bronchitis severity score is determined. In addition, data on side effects and
      tolerability of the treatment as well as on patients' satisfaction are collected.
