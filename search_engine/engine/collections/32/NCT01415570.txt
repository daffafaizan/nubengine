      (CKD) in minorities, they have greater survival compared to non-Hispanic Whites with CKD. The
      investigators hypothesize that survival advantages of minority CKD patients (pts) result from
      biologically plausible mechanisms related to differences in nutritional status & diet (main
      hypothesis) or differences in bone-&-minerals and/or psychosocial & coping status (2
      alternative hypotheses). Differences in these conditions may lead to different degrees of
      protein-energy wasting, inflammation, oxidative stress, & platelet activation, leading to
      thrombo-embolic & cardiovascular (CV) events. Discovering the biology of CKD racial survival
      disparities may lead to improving outcomes in both CKD and others chronic diseases.

      During this 5-year study the principal investigator (Dr. Kalantar-Zadeh) will also help a
      number of early-career investigators to design and develop additional studies including
      research in minority populations with chronic diseases using data and resources of this
      study.
