    
      This is a controlled, double-blinded, comparative clinical evaluation conducted monocentric
      at the premised of Bernafon AG in Bern, Switzerland.

      For this study, Bernafon AG will carry out testing with participants with hearing loss to
      validate the performance of a new digital signal processing (DSP). System testing of the DSP
      shows an improved signal, yet it must be tested with humans to be sure of an improvement in
      real-life situations. The current study will compare the new DSP to the one that is used in
      the Bernafon hearing aids that are CE- marked and currently available on the market. The goal
      is to determine whether the new DSP is better in real-life situations than the current
      system.

      Primary Endpoint: The primary objective is to assess the new DSP system with various hearing
      losses and levels of amplification. Speech testing will be used to analyse the speech
      perception of participants.

      Secondary Endpoint: The secondary objective is to verify the overall performance of the new
      device. Acceptable noise levels will be measured as well as further speech testing.
      Questionnaires will be used to measure subjective responses to the performance.

      Other Endpoints: The subjective performance of an optimized fitting versus a standard fitting
      and the acceptance of new domes will be measured with questionnaires.

      Safety Endpoint: The study aims to identify any new risk factors and to ensure the safety of
      the device with the newly implemented DSP system before releasing it to the market.
