      GvHD in early stage and that the count of CEC represent a marker of endothelial damage, we
      want to correlate the presence of donor CEC at engraftment with a putative protective
      function against GVHD manifestations. We will enroll patients affected by hematologic
      disorders undergoing allo-HSCT. At time of engraftment and at + 3 months after allo-HSCT, CEC
      identified and counted by means of the CellSearch system, will be recovered from the counting
      cartridge and further sorted at the single cell level. STR profile of each single CEC
      recovered will be performed in order to define host versus donor origin of each CEC analysed.

      Through the conduct of this study, we expect to upfront identify patients who will or will
      not manifest GvHD. This result will allow definitely different clinical approaches: stringent
      monitoring and early therapeutic intervention, before refractory disease's development, in
      the formers, while, sparing unnecessarily expensive testing or heavier treatment in the
      latters.
