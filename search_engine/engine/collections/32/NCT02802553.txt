    
      Primary Objective -Positive fluorescence signal in SLNs imaged by the Smart Goggles system.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Confirmation of ICG within lesions per histologic tissue exam by SLN biopsy.

        -  Comparison of lesions detected by the Smart Goggles vs. lesions detected using
           SPY/Quest/PDE vs. gold standard of gamma probe and blue dyes.

      Exploratory Objectives

      -Collection of preliminary data for a future, powered study for lymphatic mapping in breast
      cancer

      Study Design This is an unpowered pilot study to determine the sensitivity of the new Smart
      Goggles device, for detection of ICG fluorescence in SLNs of breast cancers in a clinical
      setting. The investigators have chosen to examine ICG as the contrast agent and breast cancer
      as the clinical target, because this agent is FDA-approved and is regularly used for
      lymphatic mapping (skin cancers). The study team will be applying ICG for the same length of
      time as the standard-of-care procedures including radiotracers and blue dyes. The study
      involves a single visit, lasting ~3-4 hours total. Multiple SLN biopsies will be performed if
      multiple SLNs are identified.
