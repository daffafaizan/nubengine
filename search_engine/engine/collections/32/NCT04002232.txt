    
      This is a randomized split mouth double blinded clinical trial. The CPP-ACP-NaF varnish is
      commercially available and is used for the treatment of tooth hypersensitivity under FDA 510K
      K102808. The placebo for this study is the same product without the CPP-ACP-NaF component.
      Patients with planned orthodontic therapy that include tooth extractions will have
      orthodontic brackets attached to the to-be-extracted teeth. Each patient will have the
      CPP-ACP-NaF varnish and the varnish base (without CPP-ACP-NaF) applied to teeth immediately
      after orthodontic brackets have been applied. The specific teeth (left or right) will be
      randomly determined as to the application of the varnish or placebo. In this experimental
      design each patient has CPP-ACP-NaF applied to one side and placebo applied to the other
      side.

      When the teeth are extracted they are transferred to the Carey Laboratory for in vitro
      evaluations.
