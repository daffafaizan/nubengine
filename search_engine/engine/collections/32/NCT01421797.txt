      progesterone and testosterone which is more marked in early puberty. Specifically, we
      hypothesize that dexamethasone administration at 22:00 will be associated with a dampened
      progesterone and testosterone rise the subsequent morning in normal girls. We also propose
      that the adrenal gland is the source of the excess androgen production in young obese girls,
      and that dexamethasone will decrease their early morning testosterone and progesterone
      levels. We will explore the hypothesis that functional adrenal hyperandrogenism, or ACTH
      hyperresponsiveness, is one mechanism underlying this excess adrenal androgen production seen
      in obesity.
