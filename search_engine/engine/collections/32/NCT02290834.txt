        -  This study is being done to test for "chemo-brain" in older adults with breast cancer
           treated with chemotherapy, and to identify people who are most likely to be affected.
           The investigators will look at thinking abilities and brain images before and after
           chemotherapy to see if it can help identify people at risk for cognitive side effects of
           the treatment, and to better understand effects of treatment on brain structure and
           function.

        -  The investigators are looking for participants who have either been recently recently
           diagnosed breast cancer participant or a healthy volunteer.

        -  What is involved in the study:

             -  Memory and Thinking Tests

             -  Imaging: Either MRI/or MRI and PET Scans
