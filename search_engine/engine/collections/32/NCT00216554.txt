      preventing and treating bipolar disorder. But the use of antipsychotic drugs is more
      effective in patients suffering severe episodes of mania as it elicits behavioral changes and
      spurs the effects of mood stabilizers. Antipsychotic drugs are used for patients who failed
      to respond to mood stabilizers or for the acute management of manic episodes associated with
      bipolar disorders.

      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risperidone as an adjunctive therapy
      to mood stabilizers in the long-term treatment (6months) of bipolar disorder using various
      assessment instruments, including the Young Mania Rating Scale. The Simpson-Angus Rating
      Scale will be also employed to assess the presence of extrapyramidal side effects and other
      adverse events. The patients will receive orally 0.5, 1, 2 mg risperidone tablet once daily
      for 6 months
