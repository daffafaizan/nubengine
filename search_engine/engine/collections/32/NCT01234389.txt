      reference electrode between which a biopsy sample is administered. Afterwards, acquired
      voltage-values could be analysed for characteristics typical for H. pylori infection
      (ammonia). According to Sydney classification, biopsies are taken from gastric antrum and
      corpus for electrochemical H. pylori detection, HUT and immunohistochemistry (IHC). HUT
      results are evaluated after 24 hours. Furthermore, every patient will receive 13C-urea breath
      test. IHC is designated as the gold standard of H. pylori diagnosis.
