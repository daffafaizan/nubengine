      plexus block (CISB) over general anesthesia (GA) only have been previously reported. However,
      few studies extended their observations beyond 48 postoperative hours, and no study has
      compared the effects of SISB and CISB as sole anesthesia modalities with GA only. We
      undertook this randomized trial to compare the recovery profile of patients receiving SISB,
      CISB or GA for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery through the first postoperative week.
      Our primary hypothesis was that highest NRS pain rating (worst pain score) at the end of the
      study week is lower for patients in the CISB group than for patients in the SISB or GA
      groups.

      Methods After Institutional Review Board approval and informed consents were obtained, 71
      patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III, ≥18 years of
      age, and BMI≤35 kg/m2, scheduled for elective outpatient arthroscopic rotator cuff repair,
      were enrolled. CISB patients received 20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine as bolus through the catheter
      whereas SISB patients received the same volume of injection through a needle. CISB patients
      received an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at 5mL/h with a patient controlled bolus of 5 mL
      hourly. GA only patients received a standardized general anesthetic. All patients were
      prescribed acetaminophen (500mg) with hydrocodone (7.5mg) every 4h as needed. CISB was
      discontinued 48 h after surgery. Postoperative highest pain scores (NRS) through the first
      postoperative week, time-to-first pain, analgesic consumption, fast-tracked postoperative
      care unit (PACU) bypass rate, length of PACU stay, time-to-discharge home, sleep duration,
      and related adverse effects were recorded in the PACU and at home on postoperative days 1, 2,
      3, and 7.
