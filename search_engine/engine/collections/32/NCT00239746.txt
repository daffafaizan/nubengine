      Eligible participants will complete an enrollment visit to include: a physical exam, a
      neurological exam, neuropsychological testing, and a minor blood draw. At the second visit,
      approximately 2 weeks later, participants will undergo a baseline lumbar puncture, and will
      be issued either ibuprofen or placebo to take once daily for 6-12 weeks. Both the
      participants and the clinicians will be masked to treatment assignment. After 6-12 weeks, the
      participants will undergo a second, and final, lumbar puncture. This will complete
      participant involvement in the study.
