      as Part I of an ongoing prospective long-term study on VKHD. The main purpose was to
      understand the course of clinical and subclinical choroidal inflammation in patients
      receiving early and high-dose corticosteroid followed by high-dose oral prednisone and a very
      slow tapper. All patients were followed with clinical and posterior segment imaging (PSI)
      exams, i.e. fundus picture, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography and
      enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography, at inclusion, 1st month, and thereof
      every three months. Full-field electroretinogram was performed at inclusion, 1st month, and
      thereof every six months. Flare was defined as appearance or increase/worsening of
      inflammatory signs after the initial six-month from disease onset during the predefined
      treatment protocol. Inflammatory signs were cells in anterior chamber, macular edema;
      subclinical inflammatory signs were mainly those observed by PSI exams. Scotopic full-field
      electroretinogram results between 12 and 24 month were the main outcome. Clinical data was
      analyzed in the full-field electroretinogram-based groups.
