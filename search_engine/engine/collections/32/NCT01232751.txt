    
      Primary Objective: to determine the effect of intake of one dose of isoflavones, as compared
      to placebo, for eight weeks on gene-expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)
      in post-menopausal, equol-producing women.

      Secondary Objectives: to determine the association between isoflavone plasma levels and
      gene-expression in PBMCs; to determine the variation of isoflavone plasma levels between
      subjects after intake of isoflavones for four and eight weeks; to explore whether PBMC
      gene-expression markers identified after 8 weeks isoflavone intervention are already present
      after 4 weeks intervention; to explore whether the severity of previous menopausal complaints
      is related to the effect of isoflavones on PBMC gene-expression; and to explore the
      association between isoflavone levels in plasma and spot urine.

      Study design: Double-blind placebo controlled crossover intervention study

      Study population: Thirty-six healthy females, 45-70 years, post-menopausal and
      equol-producing

      Intervention: Two intervention periods of eight weeks with a isoflavone supplement or a
      placebo and a washout period of 8 weeks in between.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is gene-expression in PBMCs
      measured by micro-arrays.
