    
      This is a randomized, evaluator-blinded, active-controlled, multi-center, split-face
      comparison study of Emervel Classic Lidocaine versus JuvedermÂ® Ultra in the treatment of
      moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds. Two physicians, an Unblinded Injecting
      Investigator and a Blinded Evaluating Investigator, are required at each study center. The
      Unblinded Injecting Investigator must be different from the Blinded Evaluating Investigator.
