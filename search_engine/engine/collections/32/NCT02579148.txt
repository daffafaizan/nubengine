      some preclinical studies. However, inadequate cell homing to damaged sites limited its
      functions. The investigators explore the effect of HUCMSC on improving erectile function of
      diabetic men, and whether collagen scaffolds contribute to long-term cell retention in the
      corpus cavernous and improves erectile function of diabetic men.
