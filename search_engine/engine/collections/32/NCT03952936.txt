    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation for an
      individual who has chronic central vestibular deficits due to cerebellar dysfunction. Due to
      the lack of treatment for chronic cerebellar dysfunction with Physical Therapy, the
      investigators hope to produce a protocol for chronic cerebellar dysfunction utilizing balance
      training, vestibular rehabilitation, or any other rehabilitation technique that may alleviate
      or eliminate symptoms.

      Investigators will test the subject initially at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 6 months post start
      date to assess for symptom improvement.
