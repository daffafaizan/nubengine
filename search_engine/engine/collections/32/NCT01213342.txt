      which causes damage to the exposed ocular surface and is associated with symptoms of ocular
      discomfort. If left untreated, severe dry eyes can lead to desiccation of the corneal
      epithelium, increased discomfort and sometimes loss of vision. Abundant evidence from animal
      models and clinical evaluations confirm that inflammation is an integral part of all moderate
      and severe Dry Eye Disease (DED) states and is likely to be significant in the pathogenesis
      leading to the chronicity of DED. Omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) have been shown to
      have anti-inflammatory effects and inhibit multiple aspects of inflammatory response.

      DED is a common and growing problem as our population ages, causing chronic pain and visual
      disturbance that is not adequately treated with current approaches. If left untreated, severe
      dry eyes can lead to desiccation of the corneal epithelium, increased discomfort and
      sometimes loss of vision.The benefits are the possibility of alleviating or eliminating these
      symptoms of DED and the clinical data that will be gained on the safety and efficacy of
      omega-3s, which are already being marketed over-the-counter for the treatment of DED without
      any hard scientific data. The potential benefits of treatment outweigh the minimal risk of
      participation.

      This study hopes to discover more about the efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 EFA's in the
      treatment of dry eye and ocular surface disease.
