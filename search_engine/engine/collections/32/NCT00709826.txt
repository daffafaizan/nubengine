      placebo and gemcitabine/erlotinib as measured by progression-free survival to test the
      hypothesis that down regulation of COX-2 and EGFR pathways in patients with up-regulated
      COX-2 expression in tumors will have a clinical benefit compared with Gemcitabine/Erlotinib
      only.
