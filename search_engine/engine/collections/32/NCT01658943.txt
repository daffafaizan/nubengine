    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with the
      combination of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate (selumetinib) and MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206)
      compared to those treated with mFOLFOX.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the frequency and severity of toxicity associated with the combination of
      AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 compared to those with mFOLFOX in this patient
      population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
      treated with the combination of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206 compared to those
      treated with mFOLFOX.

      II. To assess objective tumor response in the subset of patients with measurable disease
      (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response) in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer treated with the combination of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206
      compared to those treated with mFOLFOX.

      III. To bank tissue and blood for future translational medicine studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and
      fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1-2 and 15-16 (mFOLFOX).

      ARM II: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and
      selumetinib PO daily on days 1-28.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3
      years.
