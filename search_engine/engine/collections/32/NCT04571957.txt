        -  Primary objective:

        -  To study the effect of donor optimization protocol in donors with biopsy proven NASH

        -  To study thebiochemical (LFTSs & INR) recovery in donors with NASH after major
           hepatectomy

        -  To compare their biochemical recovery parameters (LFTs & INR) with that of non NASH
           donors.

        -  Secondary objectives:

        -  To study incidence of NASH among live liver donors

        -  To study their respective recipients' outcomes

        -  To study the morbidity among LLDs with NASH after major hepatectomy

      Methodology:

        -  Study population:Patients underwentLDLT from June 2011 to January 2019 at Institute of
           Liver & Biliary Sciences, New Delhi

        -  Study design:Retrospective study

        -  Study period:from June 2011 to January 2019

        -  Sample size with justification:All consecutive LLDs with at least one year of follow up
           post-operatively

        -  Intervention: none

        -  Monitoring and assessment:none Statistical Analysis:Categorical variables were presented
           as number (percentage) and were compared using the Chi-square test. Continuous variables
           were presented as mean (standard deviation, SD) and were compared using Mann-Whitney U
           Test.

      Adverse Effects: None Stopping Rule of Study: None

      Expected Outcome of the Project: Adherence to a strict dietary and lifestyle modifications
      plan will cause histological reversal of NASH and fibrosis in LLDs. Their clinical and
      biochemical recovery following the major hepatectomy will be similar to that of non-NASH
      LLDs.
