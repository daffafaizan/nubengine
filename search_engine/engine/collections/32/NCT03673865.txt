      facial fractures to treat. The complex bone anatomy and the proximity of adjacent vital
      structures make reconstruction of these fractures challenging. Inadequate orbital fracture
      reconstruction leads to cosmetic and functional complications. Cosmetic complications include
      enophthalmos, which is defined as posterior displacement of the eyeball within the orbit due
      to changes in the volume of the orbit (bone) relative to its contents (the eyeball and
      orbital fat). Functional complications include diplopia, defined as a type of vision disorder
      in which two images are seen of a single object.

      This is a prospective randomized clinical study with longitudinal follow-up. The study
      duration is 2 years, and it will be conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH). The study
      targets low-income, urban adults suffering blunt facial trauma who are diagnosed with
      unilateral orbital fracture.

      The purpose of this study is to compare pre-adapted patient-specific orbital implants
      utilizing an office-based 3-D printer versus standard non-adapted orbital implants. Main aims
      of the study are to 1) preoperatively generate a patient-specific model to pre-adapt the
      titanium mesh for use in unilateral orbital fractures; 2) accurately restore the orbital
      volume to pre-injury levels; 3) prevent postoperative complications including enophthalmos
      and diplopia; and 4) decrease the operative time, therefore decreasing overall cost and
      increasing value.
