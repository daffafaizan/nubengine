      I. To examine the effectiveness of anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate (oxaloacetate) in reducing
      cognitive complaints in breast cancer patients over the course of 8 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tolerability of oxaloacetate. II. To examine whether oxaloacetate has an
      effect on the neurocognitive domain of executive function.

      III. To examine whether oxaloacetate has an effect on patient reported fatigue, insomnia, and
      depressive symptoms.

      IV. To collect blood for assessment of inflammatory markers and glutamate levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anhydrous enol-oxaloacetate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks in the
      absence of worsening symptoms or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
