      the most common gastrointestinal complaints posed by the general population. These are
      hallmark symptoms in patients with functional gut disorders like irritable bowel syndrome but
      have also been linked to conditions such as gut hypersensitivity, altered gut microbiota and
      altered gut motility. The main issue with grasping the full impact of these symptoms on a
      patients' quality of life is that they are largely subjective and thus almost impossible to
      standardize. However, given their pervasiveness there is merit attempting to gauge their
      severity in as objective a manner as possible in order to track disease progress and response
      to treatment. GRS can be widely irregular and requiring patients to call into the office to
      answer questionnaires post treatment or keep handwritten logs to turn in later can lead to
      inaccurate data collection that can hinder accurate diagnosis and management. The ubiquitous
      nature of smartphones and user-friendly interfaces of electronic applications allow for
      information to be logged/accessed remotely and securely, each log would have their own time
      stamp and be recorded in an organized, consistent manner.
