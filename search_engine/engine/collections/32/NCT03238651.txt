      people who have NHL or people who have relapsed and/or refractory NHL. This study will assess
      the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of single-agent TAK-659 in East Asian
      participants with NHL.

      The study will enroll approximately 33 to 47 participants, including at least 6 Japanese at
      RP2D dose level. Participants will be assigned to one of the following treatment groups:

      Dose Escalation Part: TAK-659 Expansion Part: TAK-659 RP2D

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan and Republic of Korea. The maximum
      duration of participation in dose escalation part of the study is up to 12 months, unless in
      the opinion of the investigator and sponsor the participant would derive benefit from
      continued therapy beyond 12 months. In expansion part, participants who stop treatment for
      any other reason other than PD will continue to have PFS follow-up at the site every 2 months
      from the last dose of study drug up to 6 months or until PD. Participants will be followed 28
      days after last dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy,
      whichever occurs first, for a follow up assessment.
