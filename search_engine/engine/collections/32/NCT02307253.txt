      procedure.

      The use of nitinol should guarantee a better needle flexibility with a theoretical advantage
      on the use of this needle for lesions that need to be sampled through the duodenum. Moreover,
      samples for histologic examination seems to be easy to interpret than cytologic ones allowing
      evaluate of the overall architecture of the tissue, better performance of immunohistochemical
      staining, and may be of additional value to perform tissue profiling that in the future will
      be very important to guide individualized therapies

      The existing data on the performance of the Flex needle for EUS-guided transduodenal biopsy
      are coming form a single study performed in one single center. Thus, the reproducibility of
      these results is unknown and multicenter prospective studies are warranted to answer this
      important question.
