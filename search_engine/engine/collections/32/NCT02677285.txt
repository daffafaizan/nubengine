        1. The investigators will study how bioimpedance measurement results correlate with
           conventional wound healing monitoring.

        2. The investigators will seek the best methods for handling, interpreting and presenting
           bioimpedance measurement results.

        3. The investigators will find out if impedance measurement is applicable to clinical use.
