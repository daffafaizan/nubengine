      that could possibly respond to treatment in a drug study. The drug ranolazine (trade name
      Ranexa) is a FDA-approved medication to treat chest pain in patients with heart disease.
      Ranolazine has been studied in mice with myotonia congenita. The data from this animal model
      suggest that ranolazine may improve the symptoms and signs of myotonia. All individuals that
      participate will be placed on active drug. The investigators want to see if this drug is safe
      to take without causing too many side effects for people with myotonia congenita,
      paramyotonia congenital and myotonic dystrophy type 1. Participants will go to The Ohio State
      University for study visits. Participants will take ranolazine for four weeks. Participants
      can expect a total of 4 study visits and 2 phone calls over the 5 week period.
