    
      Up to 65 adult patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus will be enrolled and given access
      to a new feature within the patient portal at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The new
      feature will be available via the patient portal native app (i.e., My Health at Vanderbilt
      (MHAV) app) for mobile devices (smartphone or tablet). The new feature will allow patients
      to: (1) receive notifications when the patient is due for certain types of diabetes
      monitoring and preventative care and (2) initiate an order for the care.

      Study participants will complete questionnaires electronically via email at three time
      points: baseline (T0), immediately after first use of the intervention (T1), and two-month
      follow-up (T2) to as assess study outcomes including usability and pre-post change in
      secondary psychosocial outcomes.
