      ischemic stroke on the neurological outcome and to determine the side effects of intravenous
      fluids. Due to its cost effectiveness and wide accessibility, the possible application or use
      of IV fluid infusion as first line treatment can aide in the treatment of more acute ischemic
      stroke patients worldwide. This novel information will aide physicians with more
      comprehensive understanding of the efficacy of utilizing IV fluid in future treatment plans
      for patients with acute ischemic stroke.
