      undergo autologous stem cell transplantation, and who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      are eligible to enter this study. The only changes to the standard of care is the addition of
      plerixafor to a G-CSF mobilization regimen on the day prior to apheresis and the collection
      of blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis by
      CD34+ fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Blood samples for PK and CD34+
      FACS analyses will be obtained prior to and after the first dose of plerixafor. Participants
      will undergo mobilization with G-CSF (10 µg/kg daily) and will receive plerixafor (240 µg/kg)
      on each day prior to apheresis. Participants will be apheresed for up to 5 consecutive days
      in order to collect the target number of CD34+ stem cells, (≥5*10^6 cells/kg). After
      apheresis, all participants will be treated with high dose chemotherapy in preparation for
      transplantation. Participants will be transplanted with cells obtained from the G-CSF plus
      plerixafor mobilization regimen. In the event that a sufficient number of cells for
      transplantation are not obtained from the collection, cells may be retained and pooled for
      transplantation at the investigator's discretion.

      The primary endpoint is the proportion of HD participants who collect ≥5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg
      with this mobilization regimen. The secondary endpoints include the safety of this
      mobilization regimen, the proportion of participants who collect ≥2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg, the
      change in CD34+ cells circulating in the peripheral blood after a dose of plerixafor, and the
      number of days of apheresis required to obtain ≥5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg. In addition, success
      of the transplantation will be evaluated by measuring the time to engraftment of PMNs and
      PLTs. Participants will be followed for 12 months to assess transplant durability.
