      hormonotherapy. But, when patients don't react no recommendations exist.

      Estramustine phosphate is currently prescribed for prostate cancer. The estramustine
      phosphate is an active anti-tumoral agent by oral route, associating a nitrogenous mustard
      with the estradiol, it settles on membrane receptor and the cytotoxic component acts
      essentially by dismantling microtubules inhibiting the mitosis.

      Estramustine could be a therapeutic option when currently therapy are exhausted for patients
      reactive to hormonotherapy previous lines or chemotherapy.
