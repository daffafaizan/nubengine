      I. To determine the transplant related mortality (TRM) of this reduced intensity
      transplantation (RIT) combination in a patient population that is usually not eligible for a
      full myeloablative allogeneic transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate engraftment, safety, clinical response, evidence of graft-versus-malignancy
      effect/graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and overall outcomes of treatment with our RIT
      regimen across a variety of hematological conditions.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -5
      to -2 and melphalan* IV over 30 minutes on day -2. Patients then undergo total-body
      irradiation on day -1 and allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      Note: *Patients with chromosomal breakage syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis
      congenita, receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4 hours on day -4 to -2 instead of
      melphalan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
