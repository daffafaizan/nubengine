      (MM). Current evidence indicates that quality of response is an important prognostic factor
      for long-term survival in MM. There are only very few data on molecular remissions (MolR)
      determined by the most sensitive technique, allele-specific-oligonucleotide - real-time
      quantitative - polymerase chain reaction (ASO-RQ-PCR) in MM, and there are no data available
      on molecular responses after bortezomib-based induction therapy followed by HDT-ASCT. The
      main aim of this study is to determine molecular response rate after ASCT following
      bortezomib-based induction treatment compared to a historical control group with conventional
      VAD induction treatment. A sensitivity of ASO-RQ-PCR technique will be compared to
      immunofixation and with immunophenotyping by flow cytometry.
