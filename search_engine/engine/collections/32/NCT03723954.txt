      relationship between the outcome of a football match and cardiovascular mortality in men over
      45 years of age. An excess mortality was reported among football fans on June 22nd 1996, day
      of the elimination of the Dutch by the French team during the penalty shoot-out of the
      European Champions League. A more recent study by Ute Wilbert-Lampen et al., confirmed the
      relationship between football matches of the 2006 World Cup and the occurrence of
      cardiovascular events such as rhythm disorders and coronary syndromes among football fans.
      Two factors favoring increased cardiovascular risk appear to emerge from these different
      studies: high-level football matches (most often played at home) and strong support and
      passion for one's sports team. However, the physiopathological mechanisms involved have not
      been fully understood yet. In addition, very little data exists on sports other than
      football. The investigators research hypothesis is that cardiovascular events induced by the
      passion of a sports fan could not be unique to only one sport. The Ryder Cup, one of the
      biggest sporting events in the world, is the ideal event to collect consolidation elements
      for the investigators hypothesis.

      The main phase of the Ryder Heart study will take place during the Ryder Cup from the 28th
      till the 30th of September 2018.
