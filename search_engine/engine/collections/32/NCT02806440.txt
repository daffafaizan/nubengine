      fatigue, sleep disorder, mood disturbance etc. The prevalence is estimated to be 2-8%.

      Treatment of pain in patients with fibromyalgia is often based on opioids. However, opioids
      may lead to tolerance, addiction and hyperalgesia and alternative treatments are therefore
      warranted.

      Low dose naltrexone (3-5mg) (LDN) has shown promising results in the treatment of pain in
      patients with fibromyalgia, but there is a need for further research.

      At the typical dose of naltrexone, 50 mg, it is an opioid antagonist. However LDN
      demonstrates analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, possibly involving an antagonism of
      microglia in the CNS.

      The investigators hypothesize, that LDN has a better pain relieving effect than placebo in in
      patients with fibromyalgia (FM). The investigators also hypothesize that LDN has a better
      effect upon experimentally induced pain in FM-patients, compared to placebo. A tentative
      mechanism is a central facilitation of the endogenous pain inbitory system.
