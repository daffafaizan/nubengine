      will be calculated by multiplying the urinary sodium concentration in mE /L by 24-hour
      urinary volume. Two to three urinary Na+ samples will be collected within six months.

      3.3.3 ABLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING - 24 HOURS Ambulatorial blood pressure monitoring 24-hour
      will be performed using a Mobil-O-GraphÂ® compact digital device (version 12, ambulatory
      pressure monitor, 2000, UK). Individuals will be instructed to maintain their normal
      activities of daily living. The device will be pre-programmed to measure blood pressure
      within 24 hours at 30-minute intervals every hour during the waking period and at 1-hour
      intervals during sleep. This device will evaluate the following parameters: systolic and
      peripheral diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, systolic central
      aortic pressure, central diastolic aortic pressure (cDBP), central pulse pressure (cPP),
      augmentation index corrected for 75 bpm (AI75%) and pulse wave velocity (PWV).
