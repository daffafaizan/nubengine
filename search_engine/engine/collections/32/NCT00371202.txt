      groups: 25 patients underwent DLK with the big bubble technique and the other 25 patients
      underwent PK with the standard technique using hessburg - Barron trephine. One surgeon
      performed all operations using a 16 bites separate 10-0 nylon sutures. We used A-scan
      ultrasonic biometry for measuring vitreous length (VL) before surgery. If VLâ‰¥15.50mm, a
      trephine 0.25mm larger than recipient and if VL was <15.50mm, a trephine 0.50 mm larger than
      recipient were considered. Selective suture removal was started 3 months after operation.
      quality of vision endothelial cell changes and correlation between refractive outcome and VL
      in relation to donor-recipient disparity, were measured and analyzed in both PK and DLK 15
      mos postoperatively.
