      by excessive accumulation of body fat, resulting in weight gain. Hence, the aim of this study
      was to evaluate the effects of the Astragalus and Notoginseng extrats on obesity control by a
      randomized double-blind and crossover human trial. Subjects with simple obesity (body mass
      index (BMI) ≥ 27 or body fat ≥ 30%) ingested 5 extrats (n = 19) capsules or placebo (n = 19)
      perday for 12 weeks of a stage. Anthropometric measurements (body weight, body fat, blood
      pressure) and blood biochemical markers including fasting blood glucose (FBG), albumin, total
      cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen
      (BUN), AST, ALT were examined every six weeks.
