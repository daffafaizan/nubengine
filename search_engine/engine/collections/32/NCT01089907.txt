      collect bone marrow (10c.c.) at diagnosis, remission and relapse. We will do the following
      genes in addition to gene-chip including IKZF1,ETV6, EBF1, NR3C1, RAG1/G2, TCF3, BTLA,
      PAX5,LEF1, ERG and VPREB1.We will study the gene dosages and degree of methylation. The
      estimated patients numbers will be 300-400. Then we will correlate these data with
      patients'age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, cytogenetic abnormalities, response to the
      chemotherapy and prognosis.
