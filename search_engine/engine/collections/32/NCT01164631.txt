      were on the waiting list for adenotonsillectomy at the ENT Department of FMUSP. The patients
      were randomly divided into two groups and were subsequently compared after a six month
      interval. The first group included 24 patients who where treated with the Bioajusta X
      appliance and the second group included 16 patients who served as controls, and,thus, did not
      received any treatment. Cephalometric analysis was used to assess the growth direction by
      comparing the relationship of the vertical jaw based upon the angle of the palatal plane with
      the mandibular plane (ANS-PNS/Go-M).Pharyngeal size was measured using acoustic
      pharyngometry. The parents filled out a questionnaire with respect to the respiratory
      symptoms of their children.
