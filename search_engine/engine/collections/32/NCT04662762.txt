      patients. Patients were randomly allocated to a nursing intervention group or a usual care
      group. In patients from the intervention group, a nursing intervention programme was
      performed 3 months after admission, based on education, support and patient monitoring to
      improve therapeutic adherence and a 6 month phone call. The main outcome measured was
      therapeutic adherence at 12 months, as defined by a combination of adherence measurement
      tools (Morisky-Green and Hayness-Sacket scales, attendance at visits and withdrawal of
      medication from the pharmacy). Therapeutic adherence was assessed by nurses blinded to the
      assignment group.
