      (thyroid hormone status within the normal range). Usually, levothyroxine is taken orally in
      the morning on a daily basis. In clinical practice, the investigators have observed that this
      levothyroxine replacement is sub-optimal resulting in higher levels of thyroid stimulating
      hormone. Based on this observation, the investigators conducted this study to examine whether
      timing of oral intake of levothyroxine during the holy month of Ramadan will affect
      achievement of euthyroidism. They recruited 96 hypothyroid patients taking levothyroxine,
      attending Hamad endocrine outpatient clinics, who were fasting during Ramadan( May-June
      2017)and for whom there is no clinical contraindication to fasting. Patients were randomly
      assigned to two time points for taking levothyroxine:

      A. 30 minutes before the Iftar meal B. 30 minutes before Suhour The primary outcome was the
      change in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) before and after Ramadan. The null hypothesis is
      that there is no difference in TSH between the two groups.

      The findings from the study will help in the clinical care of patients with hypothyroidism in
      Ramadan. Hypothyroidism is common worldwide and many Muslims will require the appropriate
      advice regarding management of hypothyroidism in Ramadan.
