    
      During Part A, a cohort of subjects received a single dose of GSK2118436 alone (Day 1) and
      then repeat doses of GSK1120212 for (Day 2 through Day 15). The dose regimen of GSK1120212
      were continuous dosing. A second single dose of GSK2118436 was administered on Day 15
      concomitantly with GSK1120212. Day 16 through Day 28 was a washout period, during which no
      study medication was administered. Starting on Day 29, subjects who elected to continue
      participation in the study were doses with GSK2118436. The dose of GSK2118436 after Day 29
      might be altered based on emerging data from the first-time-in human study BRF112680. The
      dose might be increased to a dose level that has been completed and determined to be less
      than or equal to the maximum tolerated dose in that study.

      Part B of the study enrolled cohorts in escalating doses to identify a set of allowable doses
      to be expanded in Part C. Subjects were enrolled in a 3+3 cohort design, with provisional
      dose levels of both drugs. The decision regarding escalation to the next dose levels of
      GSK1120212 and GSK2118436 was further guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model. The
      first cohort started at low doses for both drugs. Doses up to 300 mg/day for GSK2118436 and
      up to 3 mg QD for GSK1120212 were studied. The starting dose might be lowered based on
      emerging data from other studies and from Part A.

      Expansion cohorts enrolled in Part C at dose levels of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 as defined
      in Part B. One of the selected doses might include GSK2118436 administered as monotherapy at
      a tolerable dose (less than or equal to the maximum tolerated dose) determined in BRF112680.
      Part C was a randomized open-label Phase II portion of the study, and consisted of expansion
      cohorts investigating 2 to 3 dose levels of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 dosing in combination,
      and GSK2118436 administered as monotherapy. Subjects were assigned to treatment arms in a
      randomized fashion to compare tolerability and safety. Population PK parameters, clinical
      activity, durability of response and safety of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 dosed orally in
      combination and GSK2118436 as monotherapy were evaluated.

      Part D consisted of evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of GSK2118436 HPMC capsules
      administered as monotherapy and in combination with GSK1120212. Pharmacokinetics of
      GSK2118436 was assessed following a single dose on Day 1 and after repeat dosing (Day 21) and
      compared between combination and monotherapy. The pharmacokinetics of GSK1120212 was also be
      assessed. Safety, tolerability and clinical activity were evaluated in 4 dosing cohorts.
      These cohorts might be expanded for additional safety data. Subjects were randomized to
      different cohorts.
