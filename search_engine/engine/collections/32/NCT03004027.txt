      accordance with CONSORT guidelines (http://www.consort-statement.org). Data will be collected
      online using Qualtrics. Participants will be required to answer all fields on Qualtrics, as a
      way of managing potential missing data.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: (i) psychological self-help
      augmented with implementation intentions, (ii) standard psychological self-help or (iii) a no
      intervention waiting list control. Qualtrics will be used to randomly allocate participants
      to one of the three groups.

      A sample size analysis has been conducted and calculated assuming two measures, three groups,
      an alpha of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an effect size of 0.25; a total sample size of 120
      participants would be needed (i.e. 40 per group). Allowing for an attrition rate of 20%, 144
      participants would need to be recruited (i.e. 48 per group). Although participants will be
      randomised to condition, it is best practice for any differences at baseline to be controlled
      for in analyses and thus a between factors repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) will
      be conducted.
