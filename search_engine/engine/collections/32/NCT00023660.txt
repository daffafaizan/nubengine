        -  Determine treatment-related toxicity rates in patients with locally advanced cervical
           cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy concurrently with
           celecoxib, fluorouracil, and cisplatin.

        -  Determine whether this regimen increases locoregional control rates, distant control,
           disease-free survival, and overall survival in these patients.

        -  Determine whether first-failure patterns in patients treated with this regimen are
           changed compared to historical controls.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo external beam pelvic radiotherapy once daily five days a weeks for 5 weeks
      beginning on day 1. Within 8 weeks, patients undergo low-dose or high-dose brachytherapy.
      Patients also receive concurrent chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil IV continuously over
      days 2-5, 23-26, and 44-47 and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1, 22, and 43. Oral
      celecoxib is administered twice daily beginning on day 1 and continuing for 12 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 83 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
