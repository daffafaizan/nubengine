      regimens in the first line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. Docetaxel or pemetrexed
      have been proven effective as second-line treatment of patients with NSCLC. In a study
      conducted by our group the combination of irinotecan/cisplatin demonstrated higher response
      rates over cisplatin monotherapy in patients progressing after first-line
      docetaxel/gemcitabine. Moreover, pemetrexed has been combined with the platinums (ie,
      cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin) in NSCLC to yield clinical activity similar to that
      of other platinum-based doublets. The efficacy of different platinum-based combinations in
      patients pretreated with non-platinum based first-line chemotherapy is not known.
