      created for COVID-19 patients will be included in the study. These patients will be divided
      into 3 groups as outpatient follow-up, hospital follow-up and follow-up with a mechanical
      ventilator in intensive care. In addition, patients who have completed the 14-day treatment
      period, which is considered as the turning point time of the world health organization by
      looking at the patients 3 times, every 5-7 days, which is the accepted incubation period,
      will be included in the study. In these patients, hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, MPV, PDW
      and CRP values will be examined for 3 weekly measurements. Changes in COVID-19 disease
      follow-up and treatment of MPV and PDW values, which have not been studied so far, will be
      investigated.
