    
      This is a single-treatment-group, open-label (patients and study personnel will know the
      identity of the treatments given), single-center study. The primary goal of this study is to
      provide early access to TMC114 administered with low-dose ritonavir (TMC114/r) and other
      antiretrovirals (ARVs, agents that are used to treat viral infections). This study is
      intended for HIV-1-infected patients who have not received previous HIV treatment
      (treatment-naive patients) or have received early treatment without TMC114 regimens and who
      are ineligible to participate in any other sponsored HIV-1 study. This study will monitor and
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of TMC114/r in combination with ARVs during the course of
      the study. Treatment with TMC114/r will be continued until virologic failure (the inability
      to achieve or maintain suppression of viral replication), treatment-limiting toxicity, loss
      to follow-up, study withdrawal, pregnancy, until discontinuation of TMC114 development or
      when TMC114 becomes reimbursable for treatment-naive patients or when TMC114 becomes
      commercially available for treatment-experienced patients.
