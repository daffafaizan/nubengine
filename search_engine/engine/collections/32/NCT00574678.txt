      breast, ovarian or colon cancer versus "normal male and female patients" for differences that
      show promise as a diagnostic indicator. If such differences can be found, then their
      diagnostic potential will be assessed and developed further in a subsequent study. The
      long-term goal of this project will be to develop a screening tool for the detection of
      breast and/or other cancers.
