      information regarding the term 'emotional resilience' and its mediating factors. Through
      weekly lessons and assignments, it will guide participants to developing an internal
      perspective on their strength sources, as well as practice self-calming and self-controlling
      exercises.

      The main goals of the course are to:

        1. Measure the effects on the emotional resilience and confidence of participants.

        2. Assess differences in the course's affect on students from the faculty of sciences
           compared with students from the faculty of social studies.

        3. Understand the mechanisms of the effects.

      Results will be measured using the study questionnaire, to be filled out by the participants
      before, after, and three months after the completion of the course. The questionnaire will
      include validated questionnaires with good psychometric qualities. The study protocol was
      approved by Tel Hai College institutional review board. All participants, in the intervention
      (course participants) and in the control group (students of both faculties that didn't attend
      the course), received information about the program and the study and were asked to provide
      informed consent.
