      children. Idiopathic seizures are the most common (67.6%) type of seizure seen in the 0-15
      year age group. The highest incidence is in the first year of life. In the United States, 5
      percent of individuals experience a seizure of some type by the age of 20.

      Seizures have multiple etiologies. These include hypoglycemia, congenital causes,
      toxic/metabolic causes, infection, neoplasm, perinatal causes, and trauma. The medical
      evaluation often includes blood work, imaging of the brain, and performing an
      electroencephalogram. Currently, there is no consensus as to the work-up of children
      presenting with unprovoked seizures.

      Hypoglycemia presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms and severity. In children,
      hypoglycemia can lead to seizures and coma. In neonates and infants, however, the symptoms
      are even more varied and nonspecific. They can include cyanotic spells, apnea, respiratory
      distress, refusal to feed, and myoclonic jerks. The varied symptoms of hypoglycemia make the
      disorder difficult to diagnose.

      The study will have parents checking blood sugars for 14 days and a one time ammonia level.
      Blood sugar checks will be first thing in the morning and one hour after a meal. If the study
      identifies a subset of patients with idiopathic seizures who have hypoglycemia, this finding
      may have implications for future glucose screening recommendations.
