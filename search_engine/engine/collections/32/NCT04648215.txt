      36 patients: Intervention (Lavender oil), Placebo Intervention (Grapeseed Oil), or Control
      (Standard of Care). Following a determination of meeting inclusion criteria on admission and
      completing informed consent, subjects will be randomized to one of three groups on admission.
      This is a 4 day study with pre- intervention (baseline) sleep data on quality and duration of
      sleep using the Verrans & Halpern- Snyder Sleep Scale collected on Day 2, following admission
      day.

      For the intervention, indirect aromatherapy, a 2x2 gauze with 2 drops of either oil (lavender
      or grapeseed is pinned it to the subjects' nightgown (right scapula area) for two sequential
      nights (Time 1 and Time 2) (Day 2 and 3) and removed in the morning after 10 hours . Sleep
      Quality and Duration are then measured in the morning, Time 1 and Time 2, (Day 3 and Day 4)
      by the Verran & Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale analogue. The control group receives standard of
      care in the evenings and the same data as the intervention groups are collected for sleep
      quality and duration, pre-intervention and Time 1 and Time 2 ..

      The differences in the scores for sleep quality and duration will be compared from
      pre-intervention to Time 1 and Time 2 for each group .
