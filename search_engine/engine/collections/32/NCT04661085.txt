      identified by the World Health Organisation as a major public health threat. Despite efforts
      to optimize antibiotic consumption in Denmark, the total consumption in the hospital sector
      increased from 2009-2018 and the incidence of multi-resistance bacteria (MRB) is increasing.
      A Danish multicenter study has shown that every 20th patient in the emergency department has
      MRB. Patients with an infection of unknown origin tend to be prescribed a broad-spectrum
      antibiotic, as physicians endeavour to target probable origins in the body. The uncertainty
      associated with the diagnosis may lead to an overconsumption of antibiotics, which
      contributes to increased development of resistant bacteria and threatens future treatment
      options.

      The aim of this study is to characterize patients admitted to the ED suspected with
      infection. The study will have three objectives:

        -  To describe the distribution of ED infections according to the registered diagnosis in
           the medical record compared to a clinical expert panel assessment

        -  To identify clinically relevant information available at admission associated with a
           patients infection of unknown origin.

        -  To investigate the association between an adverse event and clinically relevant
           information for patients with infection of unknown origin

      The investigators' hypothesis is that with an improvement of knowledge about patients with an
      infection of unknown origin, a more accurate diagnosis can be made leading to a more
      appropriate antibiotic therapy and contributing to the fight against resistance to
      antibiotics.
