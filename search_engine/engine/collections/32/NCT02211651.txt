      States more than two thirds of women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. These women
      will have children at high risk for developing obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). There is
      an acute need for preventing these complications in children so that we can break the cycle
      of obesity and T2DM. Numerous interventions have attempted but failed to improve outcomes in
      obese pregnancies by weight loss. Clinicians do not currently have specific recommendation
      for identifying the obese mothers and risk and for the prevention of infant's complication in
      healthy obese pregnancies.

      The global objective of this study is to identify the relevant maternal phenotype at risk and
      the mechanism(s) of fetal environment predisposing the offspring for T2DM. This will enhance
      T2DM early screening and prevention.

      The global hypothesis is that dysfunctional adipose tissue secretes angiostatic and
      pro-inflammatory factors that lead to the formation of a dysfunctional placenta, which
      through a hypoxic and inflamed environment alters the epigenome to program the fetus for
      T2DM.
