      of Range of Motion (ROM) following HTO. Comparison of the Opening wedge and Closing wedge
      methods.

      Time-dependent improvement in functional outcome following High tibial Osteotomy. Medial
      opening wedge vs Lateral closing wedge. A two-year prospective randomized study involving 70
      patients.

      In a prospective randomized study, we plan to include 70 patients aged 30-60 years operated
      with valgus high tibial osteotomy. 2 groups: 35 opening wedge, and 35 closing wedge
      osteotomies. Data are collected by independent investigators (physiotherapists)
      preoperatively and at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Knee injury
      and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and ROM are determined at all follow-ups.
