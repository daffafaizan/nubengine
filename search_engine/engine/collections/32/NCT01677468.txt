      standardize the embolic endpoints of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It determined the antegrade arterial flow and residual tumor
      blush as follows: I, normal-normal; II, reduced-reduced; III, reduced-none; IV, none-none.
      SACE level II and III indicates intermediate-levels of embolization, whereas IV indicates
      overembolization. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether survival of patients who
      underwent TACE with unresectable HCC can benefit from intermediate-levels of embolization.
