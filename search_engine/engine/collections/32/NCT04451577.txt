    
      The analysis will include:

        -  study the expression levels of molecules known to mediated viral infection, like the
           Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and genetic variants in these genes, which could
           be related to susceptibility to the viral infection and/or to the severity of the
           clinical course of the disease

        -  compare the frequency of genetic variants potentially related with COVID-19
           susceptibility/severity in different subgroups of patients, ranging from individuals
           positive for the virus but asymptomatic to individuals affected by COVID-19 with ARDS
           requiring admission to ICU

        -  germline DNA analysis to search for genetic factors predisposing or protecting against
           severe pulmonary affection in COVID-19 infected participants. To this aim DNA will be
           analyzed by a GWAS (Genome Wide Association Study) approach by using the GSA Illumina
           chip. The obtained data will also be used to try to develop a polygenic risk score to
           stratify individuals with a particularly high or low risk for severe disease course

        -  explore the contribution of rare variants by studying the exome

        -  sepsis and ARDS biomarkers developed at ICH (e.g. PTX3, sIL-1R2, MSF) analysis to
           address their prognostic potential in Covid-19 patients

        -  PBMC analysis by FACS to investigate the immunophenotype and correlate it to the
           clinical outcome

        -  microbiota analysis of residual BAL and pharyngeal swab to evaluate whether different
           microbial or metabolome profiles are associated to worsen disease or to protection

        -  plasma and saliva/sputum test for anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgE and IgA) and
           for microbiota analysis
