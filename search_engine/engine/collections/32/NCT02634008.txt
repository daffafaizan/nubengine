      HCV infection is hypothesised to result in the vast majority of patients achieving SVR. In
      this setting, it is anticipated that therapy can be shortened relative to that used in
      established chronic infection. A short course IFN-free strategy is likely to be highly
      attractive to both patients and clinicians and if proven may further encourage early HCV
      testing and diagnosis.

      In this pilot study, the investigators plan to explore the safety, efficacy and feasibility
      of the IFN-sparing combination for treatment of recently acquired HCV infection.

      Cohort One: paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir, dasabuvir with/without ribavirin (HCV genotype
      1 only) Cohort Two (and Three): glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (HCV genotypes 1-6)
