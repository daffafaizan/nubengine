      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the bile duct or gallbladder treated with bortezomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

      II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. Correlate the
      degree of proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood with degree of proteasome inhibition in
      tumor specimens of patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate phenotypic expression of NF-kB, p53, and other molecular markers in biliary
      washings and tumor biopsies with clinical outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

      V. Correlate treatment with this drug with changes in phenotypic expression of molecular
      markers in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
