    
      Ebola virus (EBOV) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients
      presenting clinical illness. Currently, no agent is approved in the U.S. or elsewhere for the
      therapeutic treatment of EBOV. The current standard of care for EBOV infection is limited to
      supportive treatment.

      ZMapp TM, a combination of three chimeric human/murine monoclonal antibodies against the EBOV
      surface glycoprotein found on virions and infected cells, is being developed as a treatment
      for Ebola virus disease. This is a Phase 1a, open-label study to assess the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous administration of ZMapp tm in healthy adult
      volunteers. Three subjects will receive a single intravenous dose of 50mg/kg infusion and be
      evaluated on study Days 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 90. Samples will be collected for
      pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments at baseline, during, and following infusion.
      Subjects will be monitored and assessed for safety and the incidence of adverse events over
      the course of the study.
