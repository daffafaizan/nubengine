      will improve endothelial function and vascular fibrinolytic balance in type 2 DM. As
      discussed above, their roles in the increased prevalence of thrombotic events occurring in
      diabetics have not been defined. More recent data supports insulin as profibrinolytic and
      hyperglycemia to cause endothelial dysfunction. Conclusive studies are lacking in diabetic
      subjects. Furthermore, preliminary data from this lab indicates that in non-diabetic
      controls, hyperglycemia results in a prothrombotic state by increasing plasma PAI-1 and
      reducing tPA levels. The proposed protocol will study the separate and combined effects of
      hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on endothelial function and fibrinolytic balance in Type 2
      DM.
