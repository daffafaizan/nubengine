      this particular patient population through an assessment of inpatient days, intravenous
      nutrition, and analgesia requirements within 100 days post-transplantation. We will also
      explore the research participants' rates of immune reconstitution, specifically T and
      B-lymphocytes and NK cells, within the first year of HSCT.
