      face cream comprised of natural agents with adipogenic and lipolytic activities. The
      combination of adipogenic and lipolytic impulses is theorized to be more effective in
      promoting regeneration and healthy cell size in the dermal white adipose tissue than other
      approaches (e.g., adipogenic + lipogenic or anti-adipogenic + lipolytic). The health of the
      dermal white adipose tissue is reflected by the strength and elasticity of the skin and the
      distribution of volume in the face.
