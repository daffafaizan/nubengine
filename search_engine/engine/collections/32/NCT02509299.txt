    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. It is a progressive disease, characterized by lung function impairment with airway
      obstruction.

      Patients with COPD suffer exacerbations; the frequency of these exacerbations increases with
      the severity of the disease. It has been previously shown that the level of health-related
      quality of life of COPD subjects deteriorates considerably with increasing severity of
      disease and that the deterioration is linearly related to a decrease in FEV1 % predicted
      normal values.
