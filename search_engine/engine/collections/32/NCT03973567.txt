      abnormal activation patterns of brain regions in patients with refractory FD in resting
      state, and to observe the changes of brain functions after antidepressant treatment, in order
      to find scientific evidence for exploring the etiology, neuropathological mechanism and the
      mechanism of antidepressant treatment of refractory FD.
