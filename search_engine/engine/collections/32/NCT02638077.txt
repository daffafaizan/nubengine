    
      Multi-center, prospective, registry study

      2000 DTC patients undergo the first-time thyroidectomy and identified as intermediate or high
      risk of recurrence will be recruited. Doctors can treat the patients based on disease
      conditions. Investigators will record data which are related to study endpoints.

      Primary endpoint(s):

        1. Proportion of patients who underwent total/near-total thyroidectomy

        2. Proportion of patients who were treated by 131I after undergoing total/near-total
           thyroidectomy

        3. Proportion of patients who achieved serum TSH target value

        4. Proportion of patients who did not achieve serum TSH target value although they were
           treated by TSH suppression therapy

      Secondary endpoint(s):

        1. Time to achieve serum TSH target value

        2. Dosage of L-T4 for patients who achieved and did not achieve serum TSH target value

        3. Dosage of L-T4 per kilogram of body weight for patients who achieved and did not achieve
           serum TSH target value

        4. Proportion of excellent response/Acceptable response/Biochemical incomplete
           response/Structural incomplete response to initial management in patients who undergo
           total or near-total thyroidectomy and RAI remnant ablation after one year follow-up

        5. Recurrence rate after one year follow-up

        6. AEs related to L-T4 (or thyroid tablet)treatment
