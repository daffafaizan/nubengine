      demand for effective palliative treatment. There is little scientific information describing
      the effects of palliative radiotherapy among patients treated for soft-tissue tumors of the
      pelvis. This is a treatment that is used relatively frequently, but delivered heterogeneously
      since the optimum fractionation schedule has yet to be established. This study aims to define
      the effects of one such fractionation schedule (3Gy x 10-13) and thus, establish a foundation
      for future fractionation studies.
