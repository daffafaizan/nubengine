      drugs has proven to be only temporary. d4T, a new nucleoside analog with a favorable toxicity
      profile and demonstrated activity against HIV, offers an additional therapeutic option. It is
      reasonably assumed that the benefit of an antiretroviral agent in terms of delaying clinical
      disease progression is directly related to its ability to achieve and sustain viral
      suppression; thus, this study measures effects on viral load and CD4 count.

      Patients are randomized in a blinded fashion to receive AZT or placebo in combination with
      open-label d4T or ddI for up to 48 weeks. AS PER AMENDMENT 3/21/97: The study is now composed
      of three arms: open-label d4T versus open-label ddI plus blinded AZT placebo versus blinded
      AZT plus open-label ddI. Patients originally assigned to the d4T + AZT arm, which was closed
      10/96, will be given the option of discontinuing AZT and remaining on d4T monotherapy or
      discontinuing all study drugs. In addition, all study participants will be asked to
      participate in a pharmacology substudy.
