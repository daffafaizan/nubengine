      proposed study will use a novel biofeedback procedure to try to enhance the ability of
      relaxation to engage pain inhibition. Specifically, a biofeedback system will be used to
      provide training in conditioned pain regulation. The biofeedback system will monitor the
      trainee's level of sympathetic arousal and use it to control the intensity of painful
      stimulations delivered to the trainee during biofeedback. So when the trainee successfully
      relaxes (and reduced arousal), the intensity is lowered and produces pain relief. Efficacy of
      the training will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in which healthy, pain-free
      trainees are assigned to receive 3 training sessions or 3 sessions of a control procedure (2
      other procedures will serve as controls; 3 groups total). The aim will be to assess whether
      the training results in inhibition of experimental pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex
      (NFR, a physiological marker of spinal pain signaling) to determine whether brain-to-spinal
      cord inhibitory circuits are engaged.
