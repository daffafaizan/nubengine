      called a relational agent on health outcomes in people with atrial fibrillation. The study
      will enroll 240 patients who reside in Pittsburgh-area with this condition and will randomize
      them to the intervention or control. Intervention participants will receive a smartphone with
      the agent, which simulates conversation. In addition they will receive an AliveCor Kardia for
      heart rate and rhythm monitoring, an FDA-approved, widely used instrument that pairs with the
      smartphone. Control participants will receive a smartphone with WebMD, a brochure published
      by the AHA that describes AF, and an AliveCor Kardia. The intervention will last 4 months and
      participants will have visits at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 months. The study will evaluate the
      improvement in quality of life, medical adherence and health care utilization resulting from
      the intervention.
