      glans. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common pathological type. Lymph node metastasis is
      a crucial factor that leads to poor prognosis of penile cancer. The 5-year OS of penile
      cancer patients without lymph node metastasis is 90%. Still, it goes down sharply in patients
      with inguinal lymph node metastasis and pelvic lymph node metastasis, which is 50% and 0%,
      respectively.

      Using neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat patients with locally advanced penile cancer (T4, any
      N stage, or any T stage, N3) may improve their prognosis. TIP (Paclitaxel + Ifosfamide +
      Cisplatin) regimen is the first line neoadjuvant treatment recommended by NCCN guidelines.
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a vital role in the development of penile
      cancer. It's also an important therapeutic target for penile cancer. PD-1 is an immune
      checkpoint molecule on the surface of T cells. In recent years, immune-checkpoint inhibitors
      targeting PD-1 have shown good efficacy in a variety of tumors. Some phase II / III clinical
      trials have shown that PD-1 inhibitors can improve the prognosis of patients with lung
      squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and cervical cancer. Previous
      studies have found that PD-L1 is highly expressed in 40% - 60% of penile cancer, suggesting
      that penile cancer patients may benefit from immunotherapy.

      The management of penile cancer with lymph node metastasis is difficult, especially for N2-3
      stage. This phase II study aim to explore an effective combination therapy for locally
      advanced penile cancer. 29 patients need to be enrolled.TIP & nimotuzumab & triprilimab will
      be administered per 21-day until surgery, evidence of disease progression or onset of
      unacceptable toxicity.
