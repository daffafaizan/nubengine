      has superior analgesic effect than the monotherapies and that the FDC of Tramadol and
      Diclofenac 25/25 has non-inferior analgesic effect than the monotherapies. There was an
      Enrollment Period, a blinded Treatment Period, and a Follow-up Period. Previously used
      analgesic medication was washed out for at least 24 hours before surgery. The Treatment
      Period starts on Day 1 with dental surgery and treatment allocation. Treatment was started
      within 4 hours after the end of surgery if the participant's pain intensity had reached at
      least 5 points on the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). Each participant received 3
      doses of one of the four treatments within 24 hours. One fourth of the participants received
      the fixed-dose combination tablet at a low dose, one fourth at the higher dose, one fourth
      received 50 mg of the comparator tramadol alone, and one fourth 50 mg of the comparator
      diclofenac alone.

      The first 2 doses of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) were taken at the site, the
      last dose in an out-patient setting. Participants returned to the site at 24 hours after the
      first dose. A Follow-up Period included a final visit at the site or a phone call on Day 14
      to assess the participant's safety.
