      neurodevelopmental problems. Recent studies report an incidence of PAIS of 1 per 2300
      full-term infants born alive. Adverse consequences of PAIS include hemiplegia, cognitive
      dysfunction, epilepsy and speech problems. In 50-75% of infants, neonatal stroke leads to
      abnormal neuromotor and -developmental outcome or epilepsy. The estimated annual mortality
      rate of neonatal stroke is 3.49/100,000 annually. Current treatment options for PAIS mainly
      focus on controlling convulsions and associated infections. There is no treatment available
      that leads to reduction of neonatal brain damage in this severely affected group of infants.
      This leads to life-long consequences of PAIS and forms a large burden for patients and
      society. The overall aim of this project is to meet this need by developing a cell based
      treatment strategy. Animal models of neonatal brain injury provide evidence for the
      feasibility and efficacy of intranasal mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) application in the
      treatment of PAIS. Additionally, results from human trials with MSCs in the treatment of
      adult stroke or other pathologic conditions provide evidence that MSC treatment is safe. This
      project aims at making the first step towards clinical application of MSCs to treat PAIS.
      Successful completion of this project will provide the first evidence of the safety and
      feasibility of MSCs to treat brain damage in newborn infants. This study will assess safety
      and feasibility of bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs, administered by the nasal route, in
      neonates who suffered from PAIS.
