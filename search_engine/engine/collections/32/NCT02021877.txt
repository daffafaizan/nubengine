      suffered mild, moderate or severe brain trauma. This data will be added up to the existing
      large TBI databases from IMPACT as well as to the retrospective brain trauma data sets
      collected at the Turku University Hospital after the year 1995 and to the prospectively
      collected existing data set from the University of Cambridge.

      Data will contain patient characteristics, injury mechanisms, and patients' physiological
      status and findings immediately after the incident as well as through the processes of
      diagnostics, emergency treatment and in-hospital care. All data during these phases will
      follow the recommendations of Common Data Elements (advanced version) in TBI studies by the
      IMPACT investigators.

      Immediate head CT will be performed according to the existing guidelines, and head MRI with
      modern techniques as soon as the patient's wellbeing will allow the imaging to be done.

      During the intensive care unit (ICU) visit a database of EEG signals will be collected and
      the relevant information components will be extracted to provide inputs for the care decision
      algorithm. The aim is to investigate the feasibility of continuous EEG monitoring on the
      detection of epileptic seizures and other adverse events to enable rapid intervention during
      the patient's ICU stay and to improve outcome prediction.

      The investigators will also search new metabolomic, lipidomic, and genetic biomarkers related
      to TBIs through analyzing blood samples drawn in different time points.

      Based on all these factors, simulation models will be brought up as to help clinicians
      determine the earliest possible prognosis and to decide, whether patient would benefit from a
      particular care during the acute phase of a TBI.
