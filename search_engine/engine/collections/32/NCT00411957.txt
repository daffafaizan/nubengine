      in ATV doses which may improve adherence while reducing toxicity and cost. There are limited
      prospective studies evaluating pharmacokinetic and long term efficacy and safety of
      atazanavir/ritonavir once daily dose in combination of NRTIs in HIV-1 pretreated patients. We
      believe that the PK parameters of ATV/RTV given at 200/100mg daily in Thai patients will be
      equivalent to the ATV/RTV 300/100mg once daily dosing in Caucasian patients when combined
      with 2NRTIs, and that the once daily regimen will have better safety, tolerability profile,
      and cost saving while maintaining good CD4 and VL outcome. If, the pharmacokinetic profile of
      ATV/RTV 200/100 mg OD + 2NRTIs is in acceptable range or comparable with standard dose of
      ATV/RTV 300/100 mg OD, long term efficacy will be explored later.
