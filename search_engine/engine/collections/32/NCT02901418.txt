      hepatitis B who had achieved HBeAg positive and HBV DNA > 106 copies/ml and their newborns
      who were born with HBsAg positive. Before injecting hepatitis b vaccine and HBIG for
      newborns, we tested their vein blood HBsAg levels, and the venous blood HBsAg positive
      newborns were randomly divided into the control group and the interventional group in which
      group we injected the additional 200 IU HBIG within 24 hours after birth, in addition to
      routine injection. We gathered the neonatal venous blood of 0, 7 and 30 days to test the
      level of anti HBs, HBsAg and HBV DNA., then detected the level of anti HBs, HBsAg and HBV DNA
      when these children were seven months.According to the venous blood HBsAg state of neonatus
      at birth, exploring the efficiency of personalized blocking method of HBV MTCT in high-risk
      newborns.
