      postmenopausal women using lactate thresholds to individualize the accelerometer cut-points.

      Postmenopausal women will be recruited from local advertisements in public health centers.
      Each woman will perfom on different days a progressive discontinuous submaximal
      walking-running test and several constant speed tests wearing an accelerometer to identify
      the individual lactate threshold (LT), the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) and the
      corresponding accelerometer activity counts/min (cpm). Participants then will wear an
      actigraph accelerometer (wGT3X-BT) for seven days.

      Linear regression equations will be developed for each participant to determine accelerometer
      activity counts for each intensity level: 1) sedentary behaviour (<200 cpm), 2) light
      intensity (200 cpm to activity counts at LT), 3) moderate intensity (activity counts between
      LT and MLSS) and 4) vigorous intensity (activity counts >MLSS). Physical activity levels will
      be measured using both, individualized approach and Sasaki, Jonh and FreedsonÂ´s (2011)
      absolute cut-points obtained through walking and running activities eliciting 3-6 MET
      intensities (2689-6166 cpm), considering it a "moderate" effort.
