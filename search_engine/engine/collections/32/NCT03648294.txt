      prognostic factors associated.Exhaustive retrospective review of all consecutive patients
      undergoing adrenalectomy for PA between 2002 and 2013 in our department. All patients
      underwent preoperative: clinical evaluation (age, sex, height, weight, systolic and diastolic
      BP under treatment, identification of anti-hypertension treatment), biological evaluation
      (potassium, renin, aldosterone) and radiological evaluation (CT and/or MRI). Blood pressure
      was assessed postoperatively at 1 month, 1 year, then at the date of the latest news. The
      patients were classified into three categories: cured (no antihypertensive therapy in
      postoperative associated with strictly lower blood pressures of 140/90mmHg), improved
      (decreased number of drugs or number unchanged but with better blood pressure control), and
      refractory (no change in the number of drug and blood pressure, or deterioration of one or
      other of these two parameters).
