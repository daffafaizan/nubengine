      smartphones to the photodetector in smartwatches, will be explored and device and form-factor
      variability will be investigated. The objective is to define the accuracy of optical sensing
      systems in the detection of atrial fibrillation versus a reference traditional 12-lead ECG
      signal. Therefore, 2 groups will be created where different technologies will be investigated
      i.e. Group 1 will use various mobile devices and Group 2 will use various wearable devices.
      The recruitment of patients will be carried out in the framework of the usual care practice,
      where patients can be recruited at different moments throughout their current care-cycle.

      Group 1: Smartphone based sensor: Here, the user needs to place the finger on the smartphone
      camera for 60 seconds to obtain high quality PPG waveforms. These waveforms are analysed
      using automated algorithms and stored under a unique anonymized study ID.

      Group 2: Smartwatch based sensor: Here, a wearable device is used that is placed on the wrist
      and will record a PPG signal, similar as the smartphone camera, but with a specific PPG
      sensor. The data is extracted and processed by the FibriCheck software and the algorithms
      generate a diagnostic output which is stored under a unique anonymized study ID.

      The hardware involved originates from different providers. Since FibriCheck is certified as
      stand-alone software, it is expected that it functions independently from different hardware
      sources. This hypothesis will be addressed in this study.

      Smartphone devices that will be used in this research: Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Apple, LGE,
      Lenovo and ZTE devices. Wearable devices that will be used in this research: Apple and Fitbit
      smartwatch devices.
