      disease prognosis and outcomes among general and critically ill children .They enrolled all
      patients consecutively admitted to pediatric intensive care unit PICU) , therefore , being
      underweight may have resulted from endocrine diseases, genetic syndromes or other systemic
      underlying illnesses .

      The impact of low body weight on outcomes of acutely critically ill but previously healthy
      children is still unknown.

      Many studies evaluate the clinical status and outcome by pediatric index of mortality (PIM2)
      as a popular and reliable predictive score .

      In this study, we will investigate the impact of being underweight or proper weight on
      mortality and morbidity among acute critically ill children with no genetic, endocrine, or
      chronic systemic illness at PICU admission
