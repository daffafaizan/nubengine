      children between 9-14 with disruptive behaviors. The intervention uses telehealth visits
      along with written and online resources to teach them parent management skills. To evaluate
      the acceptability of this intervention and the feasibility of our methods, the investigators
      will recruit 20 parent-child dyads to participate in this study. This is a mixed methods
      pilot feasibility RCT design. The investigators designed this study to test the acceptability
      of the intervention to parents and test the feasibility of our recruitment, retention,
      measurement, and delivery mechanisms for both the experimental and comparison conditions. The
      investigators will use a block randomization method to separate parent-child dyads into
      either treatment or comparison groups. The treatment condition involves 3 telehealth visits
      and a set of parenting resources. The enhanced treatment as usual condition will involve
      contact with a "care navigator" that will assess behavior problems in the child and help the
      parents find an appropriate referral to care in their community. Both groups will be followed
      for 10 weeks, provide outcome data, and participate in semi-structured qualitative interviews
      to accept acceptability.
