      (paragard) and levonorgestrel IUD (Mirena). The effectiveness of IUDs is very similar to
      tubal sterilization[1], with an overall unintended pregnancy rate of less than 1% in the
      first year, and lower failure rates in subsequent years. The cervix of a nulliparous woman
      has a smaller diameter and can lead to more difficult and uncomfortable IUD insertions.
      Because of misoprostol's known ability to cause cervical dilation, some family planning
      providers give their patients a dose of this drug prior to insertion. The goal of this study
      is to evaluate whether misoprostol prior to IUD insertion in nulliparous women eases
      insertion and decreases pain. The null hypothesis is that misoprostol does not influence
      difficulty of insertion or patient perception of pain. The primary outcome is the ability to
      insert the IUD without dilation of the cervix or using ultrasound for guidance.
