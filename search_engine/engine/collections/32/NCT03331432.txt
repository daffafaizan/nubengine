      vivo studies and experiments in rodents. However, it remains unknown if maintenance of
      cellular function with the use of dietary supplement tauroursodeoxycholic acid enhances
      vascular function in humans. The investigators test the hypothesis that daily administration
      of this dietary supplement enhances vascular function, particularly, insulin-stimulated leg
      blood flow and glucose disposal.
