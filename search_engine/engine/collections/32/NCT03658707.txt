      Turkish mother tongue translators who also speak English in advanced level. Then these
      translations will be combined into one translation and translated back to English. The
      pre-final version will be composed and tested on a group of patients with SIS. If necessary,
      readjustments will be made, and the validity of the final version will be investigated in 116
      patients with SIS. Additionally, for the test-retest reliability, 59 patients will fill out
      the questionnaire again after 3-7 days.
