        2. Subjects

           - A single-center, randomized, observer-blinded study was performed at Korea University
           Hospital in Anam. Outpatients were prospectively enrolled. Each group of the patients
           will receive PEG-Asc or PEG-Asc with simethicone before colonoscopy.

        3. Sampling design: Consecutive recruitment of consenting patients

        4. Variables Predictor

             1. group 1 (PEG-Asc) received 1 L solution of PEG-Asc at 7 p.m the evening before
                colonoscopy and another 1 L solution of PEG-Asc at 5 hours before procedure;

             2. group 2 (PEG-Asc with simethicone) received 1 L solution of PEG-Asc at 7 p.m the
                evening before colonoscopy and another 1 L solution of PEG-Asc at 5 hours before
                procedure;Two packs (200 mg/10 mL each) of simethicone (400 mg) was mixed with last
                500 mL of additional clear fluid.

        5. Primary Outcome: Quality of bowel preparation [Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, bubble
           score]

        6. Secondary Outcome: Patients and endoscopists' compliance[Tolerability, palatability of
           patient, fatigue score of endoscopist]
