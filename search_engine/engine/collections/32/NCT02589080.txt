      referred phantom limb sensations or pain. In the case that the patient does experience
      referred sensations on the stump the investigators will map the areas where the sensation
      occurs on the stump and utilize this for placement of the surface actuators. In the opposite
      case, actuators will instead be placed in a matrix structure at the residual limb.

      As a first step towards applying mechanical stimulation, the sensation thresholds (the level
      of stimulation where the subject first reports a sensation) have to be determined. The
      outcome of this procedure is a minimum of stimulation amplitude that can be applied for each
      stimulation site.

      A first choice would be to use the referred map to place actuators. However, amputees have
      different phantom maps and also the number of areas varies.

      A therapy will be defined based on the use of sensory feedback system integrated with the
      amputees hand prosthesis. The subject should use the hand prosthesis, with sensory feedback,
      for a duration of minimum 2 h per day during a 4 week period.

      Preferably, the system should be used actively in normal daily activities.
