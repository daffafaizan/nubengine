    
      Mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of
      mucopurulent discharge from the cervix and other signs of inflammation such as easily induced
      cervical bleeding. This phase III study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of no
      treatment (placebo) versus empiric treatment with a single dose of cefixime 400 mg and
      azithromycin 1 gram for clinical cure of MPC at 2 months of follow-up. Secondary aims of the
      study are: to compare the pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) rate and adverse event rates
      between no treatment (placebo) versus empiric treatment; explore the role of bacterial
      vaginosis and Mycoplasma genitalium in the persistence of MPC; evaluate microbiological cure
      rate of M. genitalium in women treated with cefixime and azithromycin versus placebo; and
      present the clinical cure, partial response and failure proportions at 2-3 weeks and 2 months
      for each study arm. Participants will include 772 women greater than or equal to 18 years of
      age from Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) or Family Planning (FP) clinics in good general
      health with MPC in New Orleans, LA; Birmingham, AL; Jackson, MS; Los Angeles, CA; and an
      additional site to be determined. Research specimens will be obtained at the time of the
      pelvic examination. As part of the study protocol, 3 cervical and 4 vaginal swabs will be
      collected at screening, follow-up visit 1, and follow-up visit 2. Eligible participants with
      clinical MPC at the time of their pelvic examination (cervical mucopus or easily induced
      cervical bleeding), will be consented, screened, enrolled, and randomized to one of the
      following arms: Group 1: empiric treatment: a single dose of cefixime 400 mg (1 capsule oral
      at 400 mg) and azithromycin 1 gm (2 capsules oral at 500 mg each) or Group 2: no treatment:
      placebo pills that look identical to the above medications. Subjects will be involved in
      study related procedures for 2 months.
