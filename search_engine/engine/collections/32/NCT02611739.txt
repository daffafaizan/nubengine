      treatment arm; 10 boys and 10 girls per treatment arm) will be recruited. The feasibility of
      the trial protocol to evaluate the impact of distraction via the humanoid robot on pain
      intensity and distress during SCP needle insertion compared to an active control in children
      with cancer will be explored. The effectiveness outcome includes the examination of the robot
      programmed to distract children during the procedure, reduce pain intensity and distress
      compared to an active control intervention (i.e. dancing robot).
