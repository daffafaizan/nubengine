    
      Neurogenic bladder after stroke is a commonly encountered medical condition which slows down
      the recovery process and exacerbates the functional status of the patient. The neurogenic
      bladder may possibly affect the quality of life of patients with stroke.

      Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the quality of
      life and the neurogenic bladder in Turkish stroke survivors.

      Methods: 71 patients with stroke were included in the study. Patients were divided into two
      groups: the First group consisted of patients with neurogenic bladder and the Second group
      consisted of patients without neurogenic bladder. Short Form-36 (SF-36), Barthel Index (BI),
      Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Mini-Mental Test (MMT) and Beck Depression Inventory
      (BDI) questionnaires were applied to both groups for clinical evaluations.
