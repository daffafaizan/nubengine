      hypoglycemia by comparing, in a randomized study, 24 hour control with USS Virginia versus
      sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy in subjects with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemia
      unawareness and/or risk for hypoglycemia. We will also evaluate the effectiveness of the
      control system to improve hypoglycemia counterregulation, hypoglycemia awareness, and overall
      glycemic control. To achieve this goal, we will conduct pre- and post-intervention inpatient
      assessments of hypoglycemia counterregulation and symptom awareness. Subjects randomized to
      USS Virginia will participate in two training visits at a monitored outpatient setting for
      the step-wise deployment of the cell phone based Artificial Pancreas (AP) System at home. The
      first training visit includes training on the study pump and AP System followed by 1 week use
      of AP System at home in Pump mode. The second training visit includes additional training on
      USS Virginia+AP System and confirmation of independent use by the subject followed by 4 week
      use of the AP System at home in Closed Loop mode. Subjects randomized to sensor-augmented
      pump therapy will complete 5 weeks of CGM with the home pump.
