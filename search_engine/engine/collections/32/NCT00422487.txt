    
      The current study is designed to test the short-term effectiveness and tolerability of
      MBX-2044 in patients with type 2 diabetes who are currently being controlled with up to one
      or two non-TZD hypoglycemic agent(s) including sulfonylureas, meglitinides, metformin,
      α-glucosidase inhibitors or Byetta®. Eligible patients will be enrolled into one of the
      following treatment cohorts receiving either placebo or MBX-2044 at 1.5, 4.5, 15, 30, or 60
      mg/day in a double-blinded study for a 14-day treatment period. Patients will be evaluated
      for adverse events and vital signs daily. All efficacy and laboratory safety measures will be
      assessed after 2 weeks. This study will provide important information regarding the
      glucose-lowering efficacy of MBX-2044 and the safety of MBX-2044 (especially weight gain and
      edema) in diabetics. It will also provide important information about the appropriate doses
      to be used in subsequent longer-term studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MBX-2044
      alone and in combination with other anti-diabetic agents.
