    
      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of a directly-observed, largely-intermittent, six-month regimen of
      rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol among patients with culture confirmed isoniazid-resistant
      M. tuberculosis.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To describe the rate, severity and timing of toxicities and drug intolerances associated with
      this treatment regimen.

      To describe the utility of this regimen among patients who are unable to continue the
      standard 4-drug regimen due to the development of intolerance to isoniazid
