    
      Down syndrome (DS) is a chromosomal anomaly characterized by the presence of an extra copy of
      genetic material on the 21st chromosome. Sensory, motor, cognitive and perceptual impairments
      can be seen in children with DS. These impairments probably affect the development and
      learning of their various fundamental and complex actions. Those children experience
      decreased motor proficiency, reduced social participation and lower life quality.

      Fine motor skills are important for children's everyday functioning such as dressing,
      feeding, bathing, holding objects, cutting etc. In addition, fine motor skills are related to
      cognitive, social and academic abilities in children.

      This study will be conducted to investigate and compare the effects of Cognitive Orientation
      to Daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) and Conductive Education (CE) on fine motor skills,
      activity, and participation limitations in children with DS. Children with DS aged 7-18 years
      will be included.

      Random allocation software will be used to assign CO-OP or CE to participants. Both CO-OP and
      CE interventions will last 12 weeks and be conducted for 2 sessions per week. Both
      intervention will be applied as groups including 3-4 children. Following 12-week wash-out
      period, interventions will be changed for each group. Two meetings before and during the
      study will be done in order to inform parents about the interventions and their effects.
      Another investigator who is blind about the groups will conduct the assessments before and
      after both first and second treatment durations so 4 assessments will be done in total. At
      the end of whole treatment schedule, a satisfaction form will be asked from the parents for
      feedback about both interventions.
