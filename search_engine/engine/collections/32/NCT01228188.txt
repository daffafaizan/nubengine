      vitrectomy with ILM peeling. Improvement of visual acuity is around 80% including stage II to
      IV. With macular hole greater than 400 μm there is higher risk of surgical failure and visual
      acuity is usually less than 0.2. Large macular holes are more likely to have flat-open type
      closure, which is anatomical success but has limited improvement in visual acuity. Inverted
      ILM repositioning will form a scaffold for glial cells, which allows their migration and
      proliferation. This process will close the macular hole and secure it from re-opening, and
      will reduce the risk of flat-open type of closure.

      The aim of this study is to estimate the efficiency and safety of inverted ILM repositioning
      in the treatment of macular hole with a minimum diameter exceeding 400 μm and compare results
      with the currently used methods of surgical large macular holes treatment.
