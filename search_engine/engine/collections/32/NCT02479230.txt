    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety of gemcitabine hydrochloride (GEM) + alpha-type-1 dendritic cell
      (αDC1)-tumor blood vessel antigen (TBVA) vaccination (tumor blood vessel antigen
      peptide-pulsed alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell vaccine).

      II. Assess the clinical response of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) to GEM + αDC1-TBVA
      vaccination.

      III. Determine the clinical efficacy of GEM + αDC1-TBVA vaccination in generating T-helper 1
      cell (Tc1) immunity.

      IV. Correlate changes in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells
      (Tregs) with the generation of anti-TBVA T-cell immunity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Beginning 3, 7, or 10 days later, patients
      receive tumor blood vessel antigen peptide-pulsed alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cell
      vaccine intradermally (ID) followed by a second vaccination 7 days later. Courses may repeat
      after at least 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
