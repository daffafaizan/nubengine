      Control-to-Range (CTR) closed-loop (CL) with sensor augmented pump therapy (SAP).
      Approximately 126 subjects will be entered into the randomized trial at approximately seven
      clinical sites in the United States, such that at least 110 subjects complete the randomized
      trial. A maximum of 200 subjects may be enrolled in the study in order to achieve the goal of
      randomizing 126 subjects.

      In order to have a broad range of glycemic control among the subjects, a study goal will be
      to have a minimum of 50 subjects with HbA1c â‰¥ 7.5% and 50 with HbA1c < 7.5%.
