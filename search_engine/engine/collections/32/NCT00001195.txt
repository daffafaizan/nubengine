      years for use in establishing the normal ranges of levels of hormones and the variations in
      genes that are important for hormones to act. Such hormone values are extremely important to
      allow endocrinologists to determine when hormone levels are truly abnormal in children
      suspected of an illness. Because the values of some hormones change with body size, we will
      obtain measurements of body composition when studying such hormones. Children participating
      in this study may be studied in the outpatient clinic (at most 2 blood draws) or as
      inpatients on the pediatric ward (for frequent blood sampling using an intravenous line over
      a 24-hour period). Other studies that may be performed as part of this study include
      ultrasound examinations of the thyroid, adrenal, ovaries or testes, and x-ray of the hand and
      wrist for bone age determination.
