      diagnostic and management challenges to the development of safe feeding and airway protection
      strategies among infants convalescing in the neonatal intensive care units; thus contributing
      to prolonged lengths of stay, recurrent hospitalizations, and death. GERD is frequently
      diagnosed by inadequate criteria, and the relative risks, benefits and indications of GERD
      therapies are unclear. Significant gaps in knowledge exist in understanding the complex
      causal or adaptive aerodigestive protective reflex mechanisms implicated in GERD in infants.
      The long-term goal is to improve digestive health, nutrition, and infant development through
      the design of simplified personalized treatment paradigms by better understanding the
      pathophysiology of aerodigestive reflexes.

      The current objective is to conduct a prospective single center randomized blinded controlled
      trial comparing the short term effects of the investigators innovative feeding strategy
      bundle (study approach) versus standard feeding approach (conventional approach).
