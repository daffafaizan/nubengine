      post-operatively on pain and edema following surgical extraction of mesio-angularly impacted
      mandibular 3rd molars.

      This is a comparative clinical study. This study will be conducted in Oral Maxillofacial
      Surgery department of DIKIOHS, DUHS Teaching Hospital, Ojha, Karachi, Pakistan. Time duration
      of this study will be 2 months. A total of 100 patients will be considered in the study (50
      in each group). Sample size was calculated through OpenEpi, taking mean values of
      post-operative 3rd day swelling (cm) of group A (12.15±0.78), group B (13.85±0.78) [Ref #],
      95% confidence interval (two sided) and 80% of the power of the test. The sample size came
      out to be 8 patients (4 in each group). The sampling technique is Convenience Sampling.
      Patients will be randomly distributed into two groups; Group A & Group B. Group A will
      receive dexamethasone 8mg Intra-muscularly 1 hour pre-operatively while Group B will receive
      the same immediately after surgery. All surgeries will be performed by the same maxillofacial
      surgeon and duration of surgery will be around 30-45 minutes.
