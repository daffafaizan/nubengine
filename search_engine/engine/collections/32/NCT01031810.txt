      the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study indicate that only
      about half of patients attain remission from MDD, even after multiple antidepressant
      medication trials. Further, no biomarker has been validated which can select an effective
      treatment for such patients, presenting critical unmet intellectual and clinical challenges.
      The recent landmark finding of an markedly elevated level of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in
      the brains of depressed patients with MDD compared to controls, using positron emission
      tomography (PET) with a positron-emitting carbon isotope, (carbon 11 [11C]) labeled monoamine
      oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), has provided an unparalleled opportunity to address these
      challenges. It has long been known that MAOIs are effective for some patients with
      treatment-resistant MDD, although their side effect profile makes them highly unacceptable
      both to patients and physicians, severely curtailing their utility.

      This study seeks to: 1) replicate this study using PET scans in 20 subjects with MDD but
      extending it to patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). (Results from these
      participants with be compared to those from 10 non-depressed controls; 2) explore the
      correlation of the brain MAO-A level biomarker to treatment outcome by treating the 20
      PET-imaged TRD patients with an MAOI, hypothesizing that their MAOI response will be related
      to their level of MAO-A. Brain MAO-A is an ideal candidate biomarker for this study since it
      appears to be significantly abnormally elevated in MDD, yet it has a broad range of values
      even among depressed patients. Most importantly, the MAO-A biomarker is known to be the
      single pharmacologic target of the treatment, making it appear likely that outcome with MAOI
      treatment will be related to MAO-A.
