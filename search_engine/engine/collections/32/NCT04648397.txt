      have a negative impact on cognitive function and self-reported wellbeing. The way food is
      consumed (e.g. chewing duration) may regulate blood glucose levels. The underlying mechanism
      that links consumption speed to metabolic responses, satiation and health is largely unknown.

      This study aims to assess the impact of speed of consumption of two starch-based foods
      varying in fibre content, on blood glucose levels in normal healthy subjects. Furthermore,
      the mediating roles of salivary amylase and particle size on blood glucose levels are
      studied.

      The study has a randomized cross-over design. Each subject consumes two different
      test-lunches (chick peas and brown rice) in duplicate at either long or short duration. Their
      breakfast will be standardized during these 8 test days. For a duration of 12 days, blood
      glucose levels will be monitored via a continuous glucose device. Furthermore expectorated
      boluses will be collected for assessment of amylase activity and food particle size.
