    
      This is a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Healthy male subjects
      will be randomly assigned to receive EYP001a or placebo.

      In the SAD part, up to 6 cohorts will receive EYP001a single doses of 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg,
      250 mg, 500 mg, and 800 mg. In the MAD part, 4 cohorts will receive EYP001a doses of 60, 120,
      250 and 500 mg, once daily for 14 days over 15-day period. Each cohort will include 6 active
      & 2 placebo subjects. Dose escalation will depend on evaluation of safety parameters.

      Participation will include up to 21-day screening period followed by dosing period (1 to 15
      days). A follow-up evaluation will occur at 6 Â± 2 days post final dose.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, laboratory values, ECG
      parameters, and vital signs.
