      obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) will be exposed to food cues and with
      concomitant infusion of glucagon Like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist or saline, to
      assess the involvement of endogenous GLP-1, secreted in response to a meal. Measurements
      activation of CNS circuits involved in satiety and reward will be performed using blood
      oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      The second aim will be addressed in cross-over randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in the T2DM
      patients only. Patients will be randomly assigned liraglutide vs insulin glargine treatment,
      during a treatment period of 12 weeks each with a 12-week washout period in between. The
      investigators will perform the same fMRI protocol.

      The third aim will be addressed in a study with obese individuals who are scheduled for a
      gastric bypass surgery. The same protocol as for the first aim will be performed and this
      will be before and after the surgery in the same individuals.
