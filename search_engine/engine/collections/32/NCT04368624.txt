      individuals with phenylalanine abnormalities, and to monitor dietary and/or drug effects over
      time. To do this 50 children and adults with phenylalanine abnormalities and up to 50
      unaffected controls will be recruited to this study. The 50 affected individuals will have
      their metabolomic profile analyzed from up to 3 skin-stripping samples over time and compared
      to their serum amino acid profile in both dried blood spots and a typical blood sample. The
      unaffected controls will provide one skin-stripping sample. Clinical data regarding
      compliance with dietary therapy and other medications will be collected to determine other
      effects on the metabolome.
