      exposures such as environmental tobacco smoke, insects, mold, woodstoves, as well as
      demographic information about the child and housing type, income,also biologic information
      about parental asthma. Questions included symptoms of respiratory illness as well as wheezing
      and medication use. Civil engineering department measured traffic on local roadways and
      gathered traffic information from state and municipal sources regarding traffic on arterioles
      and major traffic arteries. All information was entered into geographical information system
      (GIS) including the closest cross-streets to the child's home and the school location.
      Traffic exposure variables are being developed for each child and will be added to the
      database on indoor exposures. A regression model will be used to determine the significance
      of traffic exposure in receiving a diagnosis of asthma for children five to seven years of
      age.
