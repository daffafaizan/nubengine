      disease (AD) and 91 elderly healthy subjects were enrolled. A computerized test using the
      experiment software E-primeÂ® was designed to assess reaction times (in ms) in different
      experimental conditions after a training trial (neutral, stimulation, stress, stimulation
      after stress, extinction) and relation between the performances to the test and the Apathy
      Inventory (AI) scores (lack of initiative, lack of interest, emotional blunting) were
      observed.

      METHOD: Using a computerized test, each patient is asked to press a button (mouse of the
      computer) each time the screen of the computer becomes completely white. After pressing the
      button, a randomized colorized geometric figure appears on the screen, and disappears
      automatically after a few seconds, replaced by a new white screen. Reaction time (in ms)
      between a white screen and a press of the button is analysed. After a training trial,
      reaction times are analysed in different experimental conditions: neutral - stimulation1
      (patient gets points when pressing the button) - stress (alarm) - stimulation2 (patient gets
      points when pressing, after the stress trial) - extinction (similar to neutral condition).
