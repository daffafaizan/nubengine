      epidemic since November 2019. As of March 10, 2020, it had caused more than 160,000 cases of
      corona virus disease (COVID-19), including more than 6,500 deaths worldwide. France is one of
      the main epidemic outbreaks with more than 5,000 confirmed cases and the number of diagnosed
      patients is increasing every day.

      The number of confirmed paediatric cases is relatively low, and the mortality rate in
      children is close to zero. This contrast suggests that children are more likely to present
      pauci-symptomatic or even asymptomatic forms of the disease, which are therefore undiagnosed
      in most cases. Given the rapid spread of this virus, and the fact that indigenous cases
      without an obvious chain of transmission now appear to be frequent in France, it is possible
      that the pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic child may play a role in the transmission of the
      pathogen and the dynamics of the epidemic, as documented for other respiratory pathogens such
      as influenza. Based on this hypothesis, the closure of children's communities has been
      organized in France and other highly endemic countries.
