        -  To investigate the impact of VitD and mineral supplementation and biochemistry in
           infancy on health outcomes at the age of 5 years in childhood (bones, teeth, muscles,
           heart, lungs) after preterm birth (Preterm Child group)

        -  To investigate the impact of VitD and mineral supplementation and biochemistry in
           infancy on health outcomes at the age of 24-25 years in adulthood (bones, teeth,
           muscles, heart, lungs) after preterm birth (Preterm Adult group)

      Subjects:

        -  Preterm Child group; Children, who were born prematurely before before 32 gestation
           weeks and before 34 gestation weeks with very low birth weight (VLBW, < 1500g) in Oulu
           University Hospital and/or cared in Neonatal Unit with VitD concentration measured
           before discharge during the years 2014 to 2017.

        -  Preterm Adult group; Adults, who were born prematurely before 32 gestation weeks and
           before 34 gestation weeks with very low birth weight (VLBW, < 1500g) in Oulu University
           Hospital and/or cared in Neonatal Intensive Unit during the years 1994 to 1997. For
           power calculation, the amount of participants for the adult group was done by estimating
           the inadequately low vitamin D concentration (< 50 nmol/l) to be found in 28 % of
           preterm born adults. (In Northern Finnish birth cohort 28 % at the age of 31 had serum
           25-OH vitamin D concentration < 50 nmol/l in 1997). With the estimation of
           supplementation to decrease the percentage of participants with low vitamin D to 9 %,
           the required amount of participants would be minimum of 56 per group. Furthermore, if
           the level after supplementation is estimated to be low only in 2,8 %, the amount would
           be required as 29 cases per group.

      Methods in protocol:

      At the first visit and in the end of intervention; measurements of length, weight, head
      circumference, waist-to-hip ratio will be done; muscular power is assessed by grip test of
      both hands; lung function test with bronchodilatation is done at the first appointment; heart
      ultrasound, blood pressure measurement and bicycle stress test with a circadian
      electrocardiography will be done in the beginning and at the end; bone mineralisation will be
      measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and ultrasound methods; VitD consentration
      will be measured 4 months interval during the follow up. The control peers participate only
      the first visit. The child group will be assessed only once and without bicycle stress test.
