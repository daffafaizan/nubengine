      and the Main biomarkers screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be
      taken during leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA202 product.

      MANUFACTURING: IMA202 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

      TREATMENT: Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will occur in the days
      before the IMA202 product infusion to improve the duration of time that IMA202 product stays
      in the body. The patient will be admitted to the hospital during the treatment.

      After the IMA202 product infusion, a low dose of IL-2 will be given twice daily for a period
      of time.

      Patients will be closely monitored for safety and for a total of 3 years post IMA202
      infusion.
