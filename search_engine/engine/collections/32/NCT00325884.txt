      lesions) has a higher rate of restenosis after angioplasty than disease in regions not
      involving branch points. Post-procedural angiographic outcomes and in-hospital outcomes have
      been documented for a variety of techniques, but none have examined the long-term clinical
      outcomes.

      Long-term clinical outcomes are important from the patients point of view and also determine
      the use of resources. Knowledge of the long-term outcomes from the various techniques used to
      treat bifurcation lesions would be important in determining guidelines for the treatment of
      bifurcation lesions. If simple techniques offer similar or better outcomes than more complex
      strategies, then this would justify simpler techniques such as main vessel stenting that
      would use less resources, expose the patient to less radiation, and contrast related to
      prolonged angioplasty procedures.

      Comparisons: We will compare the long-term outcomes of simple versus complex stent
      techniques, and determine other risk factors for long-term outcome
