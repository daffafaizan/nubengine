    
      1. Chest Hospital in accordance with the clinical requirements of the treatment required to
           extract ML hydrothorax sent to hospital pathology department for exfoliated Cell
           diagnosis and production of cell wax block, while the additional responsibility for the
           extraction of hydrothorax 500ml, and collect 10ml venous blood sample, Venous blood
           samples are stored in either the A cell-free DNA Blood collection Tube (STRECK tube) or
           the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA) anticoagulant tube.

        2. Amoy Diagnostics Co., Ltd. (AmoyDx) is responsible for plasma separation after sampling
           2 hours, plasma is frozen by the chest Hospital, AmoyDx completes the purification of
           peripheral blood cells genomic DNA , and which is divided into 6 parts ,5 of which are
           send to in vitro diagnostic products (IVD) enterprises to perform NGS-Panel detection.

        3. 100ml hydrothorax is send to each IVD enterprise.

        4. Each IVD enterprise carries on the hydrothorax cell free DNA and peripheral blood cell
           genomic DNA NGS-Panel detection according to their own protocol.

        5. Each IVD enterprise will complete the test within 7-10 working days and fill out the
           results in accordance with the report template provided by this research project
           (provided by Guangzhou Burning Rock Medical Examination Institute Co., Ltd.) and submit
           to sponsor by email.

        6. Sponsor would use whole exon panel (WES) to obtain an TMB value if needed.

        7. Employ four-grid analysis to evaluate positive compliance rate, negative compliance
           rate, total compliance rate of all submitted data.

        8. Employ kappa test to evaluate the consistency of each two detections.
