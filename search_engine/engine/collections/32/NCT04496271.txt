      performance and quality of the new successor of the Marvel family shows an improved benefit
      over Phonak Aud√©o Marvel before going into the System Validation. Therefore this study will
      be a comparative study. The study will determine if hearing impaired users wearing the
      successor hearing aids, have better initial acceptance with the new precalculation, better
      sound quality and speech intelligibility, more clarity and loudness comfort in soft and loud
      environments compared to Phonak Marvel RIC (Receiver in channel) hearing aids. Another
      objective of the study is to compare the listening effort with the two different study
      devices.
