      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate, as measured by clinical exam and imaging studies,
           in patients with stage I-III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant Abraxane in
           combination with lapatinib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathologic complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), and angiogenesis (vW,
           CD34) markers, measured before and after treatment, with tumor response in these
           patients.

        -  Conduct other correlative studies, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
           HER2/neu, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and transforming growth factor (TGF-Î²),
           before and after treatment with this regimen to assess tumor response in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group 1: The first 10 patients receive Abraxane IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral
           lapatinib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group 2: The next 20 patients receive Abraxane and lapatinib (at a higher dose) as in
           group 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection and tumor biopsies periodically for correlative biomarker
      studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued to this study.
