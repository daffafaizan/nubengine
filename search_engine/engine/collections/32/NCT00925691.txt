      studies suggested that the septal position which provided a more physiological conduction
      pattern would improve left ventricular function and dimensions and the patients' outcome.

      The SEPTAL-PM study is a parallel randomized prospective simple-blinded and multicenter
      national study with a follow-up duration of 18 month. A total of 180 patients will be
      enrolled.

      It was designed to demonstrate that in patients requiring permanent RV pacing for high degree
      atrio-ventricular conduction disorders the septal pacing would preserve the LVEF and LV
      dimensions but also the quality of life and the exercise tolerance.

      The primary endpoint is the evolution of the LVEF assessed by contrast echocardiography. The
      secondary endpoints are: the quality of life SF 36 questionnaire, the NYHA class, the
      6-minute-walk test, the QRS duration, the LV end-systolic and diastolic volumes, the NT-pro
      BNP, MMP 2-9 and TIMP-1 dosages, stimulation and detection ventricular thresholds.

      Other reported parameters are: the probes position and electric parameters, all causes of
      mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisations for cardiovascular causes, serious
      adverse events.
