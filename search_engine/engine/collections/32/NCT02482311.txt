    
      This study is being conducted in two parts, designated Parts A and B. Part A is a safety
      lead-in consisting of a cohort of approximately 12 patients with advanced solid tumours.

      Part B expansion cohorts will investigate AZD1775 monotherapy in advanced tumour types with
      molecular biomarkers of interest. The tumour types to be evaluated are: 1) ovarian cancer
      (BRCA1/2 mutation [PARP-failures]), 2) ovarian cancer (BRCA wild-type) with more than three
      prior lines of treatment, 3) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and 4) small-cell lung
      cancer (SCLC).
