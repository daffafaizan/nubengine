      surgical excision. Excision margins vary by tumor size, anatomic location, histological
      subtype, and surgeon preference. Published recommendations and follow up observation times
      vary. Current clinical practice supports the 4 mm excision margin; however, this can be a
      disservice to the patient by potentially excising additional normal tissue unnecessarily and
      yielding larger scars. Considering healthcare costs, both the excision and repair components
      are usually billed by size measurements. Determining the narrowest excision margin to give an
      acceptable clinical cure could feasibly reduce this expenditure.
