    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single-blind comparison study examining the
      outcomes of subjects with chronic axial low back pain that originates in the lumbar facet
      joints undergoing a procedure to create a radiofrequency lesion in the medial branch nerves
      with either Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation (CRFA) or Conventional (Standard) Radiofrequency
      Ablation (SRFA). Approximately 188 participants from approximately 15 sites will be enrolled
      into this study, with subjects undergoing either CRFA or SRFA in a 1:1 randomization scheme.
      Follow-up will be conducted for 12 months post-treatment, with the primary endpoint being
      completed at month 6. Pain, overall outcome, quality of life, pain medication use, and
      adverse events will be compared between the two treatment groups to determine success.
