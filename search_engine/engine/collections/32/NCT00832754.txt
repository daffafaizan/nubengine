    
      Two-stage, four component study Stage I - Component A: Accuracy of RDT and the outcome of
      treatment based on RDT results Primary outcome:What is the sensitivity and specificity of
      Paracheck cassettes in Ghana to diagnose malaria?

      Stage 1 - Component B: delivery system determinants of effective RDT based ACT Primary
      outcome: What are the delivery system determinants of effective RDT based ACT?

      Stage 2 - Component A: effects of restricted use of ACTs based on RDT results: a randomised
      controlled trial Primary outcome: Incidence of malaria (fever + any level of parasite
      density) in < 48 month-old children

      Stage 2 - component B: Cost effectiveness analysis:

      Primary outcome:What is the cost effectiveness of RDT based ACT for treatment of children
