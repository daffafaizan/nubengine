      Patients - Adult patients with presumptive candidemia. Patients with severe neutropenia
      (<500) APACHE II scores > 20, or significant liver disease will be excluded. All will give
      written informed consent (Pappas et al. CID. Oct 1, 2007).

      Drugs - Patients will receive either CFG: 70 mg loading dose (LD) followed by 50 mg once
      daily (qd) (8 patients), MFG: 100 mg qd (8 patients) or MFG: 200 mg qd (8 patients). All
      agents will be given by slow IV infusion (MFG will be supplied by Astellas).

      Sera - Blood samples will be collected at the end of the infusion (peak) and at 12 h and 24 h
      (trough) after the beginning of an infusion (day 3-4).

      Each patients sera will be tested (MIC and cidal activity) against their own Candida isolate
      (if isolated). In addition, recent clinical isolates of C. glabrata will also be tested
      against patient sera (time-kill) to verify previous in vitro and animal PD studies (Cota.
      AAC. Nov. 2006; Wiederhold. AAC. May 2007).

      Results:

        -  Patient outcome, including Candida eradication, will be documented for each patient by
           repeat culture.

        -  Serum concentrations (lab to be determined) and PK analysis of each echinocandin will be
           determined for each patient.

        -  Serum cidal titers will be measured against each of the Candida isolates for each agent
           at each time period. Median and geometric mean Peak and duration of cidal activity will
           then be determined and compared.
