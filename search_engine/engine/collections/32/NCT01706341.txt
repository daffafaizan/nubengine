      hyperinsulinemia, and neonatal hypoglycemia. However, the effect of small dose of glucose is
      unclear. We conducted a pilot study of small dose of glucose. We investigated the effect of a
      glucose-containing fluid on the blood sugar of the umbilical artery. We found that in the
      case of no-glucose-containing fluid, there were some cases in which umbilical arterial
      concentration of glucose was less than 50 mg/dl, which might cause neonatal hypoglycemia. In
      addition, in the case of 1%-glucose-containing fluid, mean umbilical arterial concentration
      of glucose was 97 mg/dl.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of administering a small dose of
      glucose on the pregnant women and their neonates during cesarean section. We investigate the
      safety and efficacy of use of a glucose-containing solution for the pregnant women and the
      neonates.
