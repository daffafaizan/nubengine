    
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized study that will enroll patients that are
      referred for an angiogram and will compare 3 different durations of radial clamp
      applications. Patients will be randomly assigned to either 10, 20 or 30-minute clamp
      applications. The clamps will be gradually released at the end of the assigned durations and
      participants will be assessed for the radial artery occlusion, hematoma, and other bleeding
      events.
