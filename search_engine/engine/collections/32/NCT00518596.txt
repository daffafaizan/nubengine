    
      Phase II is a hospital based intervention (n = 297 infants) measuring the colonizing ability,
      safety, and tolerance of a probiotic supplement, Lactobacillus plantarum in the neonatal gut.
      Newborn infants â‰¥ 35 weeks of gestation will be randomized to receive either L. plantarum
      preparations (containing 109 organisms) or placebo preparations orally once a day for the
      first 7 days of life. The final stage of the project will be a community-based randomized
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial of L. plantarum enrolling over 8,000 newborns to
      examine the efficacy of probiotic supplementation in reducing neonatal infection in Indian
      neonates.
