      line（1L） platinum-based chemotherapy; however, responses are not durable and prognosis is
      poor. Currently no maintenance treatments are approved in SCLC to prolong the durability of
      efficacy achieved with 1L chemotherapy. Immuno-oncology agents have demonstrated efficacy in
      the treatment of ED-SCLC when administered across different lines of therapy. Tislelizumab
      (Anti-PD-1 antibody) Combine Etoposide+ platinum （EP） had improved median Overall survival
      （mOS ） to 15.6m of 1L ED-SCLC in the Rationale 206 study. Anlotinib ( RTKi ) had
      significantly improved PFS & OS of 3L(third line) ED-SCLC in the ALTER 1202. This phase II
      study is designed to explore the effect and safety of the combination as maintenance therapy
      for ED-SCLC after 1L chemotherapy
