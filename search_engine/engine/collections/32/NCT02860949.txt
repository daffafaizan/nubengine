      spinal anesthesia and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) for 24 hours post surgery. The
      surgical technique and postoperative medication protocols were identical in both groups. The
      visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain during activity and at rest, and morphine consumption
      were recorded at 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours postoperatively. LAI-related side effects, blood
      loss, length of hospital stay, and VAS for satisfaction were monitored. The reviewer was
      blinded to treatment groups.
