      their written informed consent for study participation will be assigned to one of 7 cohorts
      determined by indication:

        -  Cohort 1: Rare sarcoma

        -  Cohort 2: Rare ovarian cancer

        -  Cohort 3: Primary central nervous system lymphomas

        -  Cohort 4: Rare thyroid cancer

        -  Cohort 5: Rare malignant neuroendocrine cancer

        -  Cohort 6: Germ-cell cancer

        -  Cohort 7: NK/T-cell lymphoma

      Between 20 and 50 patients will be enrolled in each cohort with the exception of the cohort 1
      for which up to 80 patients may be enrolled (extension introduced under amendment 5 of this
      protocol). Following the amendment 6, up to a maximum of 50 additional patients may be
      included in the Sarcoma (cohort 1), Rare ovarian cancer (cohort 2) or Primary central nervous
      system lymphoma (cohort 3) cohorts, within the limit of 350 patients to be included in total.

      The study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all
      patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly
      sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in
      the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from
      the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.
