      immobility. The monitoring of hypnosis and immobility has been established in clinical
      practise, however for the evaluation of antinociception a valid monitoring is missing.

      The Surgical Pleth Index (SPI; former named Surgical Stress Index-SSI) is a multivariate
      index derived non invasively from finger plethysmographic signal. It has been demonstrated to
      correlate with surgical stress intensity. In the setting of total intravenous anesthesia TIVA
      our group could show beneficial effects of SPI guided analgesia in terms of remifentanil
      consumption, hemodynamic stability and incidence of unwanted events.

      Therefore, we wanted examine whether these beneficial effects of SPI guided anesthesia can be
      transferred to a setting of balanced anesthesia using a volatile anesthetic sevoflurane and
      the opioid sufentanil.

      The following hypotheses have been made:

        1. SPI guided analgesia will result in less sufentanil consumption

        2. SPI guided analgesia will result in more hemodynamic stability and faster recovery of
           the patient after anesthesia, and less opioid use in post operative period
