      types of advanced cancers. The human immune system can recognize the products of somatic
      genetic alterations in tumors, or neo-antigens, which are not expressed on normal cells.
      These neoantigens are an attractive immune target because their selective expression on
      tumors can minimize immune tolerance as well as the risk of side effects such as autoimmune
      reaction.

      Although neoantigens are ideal targets for cancer immunotherapies, most neoantigens arise
      from unique mutations and are not shared between individual patients. Thus,
      neoantigen-directed immunotherapy will need to be personalized. Novel technical advances in
      next-generation sequencing allow fast and systematic prediction of cancer neoantigens for
      each individual patient. Initial attempts of therapeutic cancer vaccination targeting
      individual neo-antigens have proven non-toxic and met their immunological endpoints.

      In this study investigators will use the proprietary platform PIONEER for fast and accurate
      identification of a neo-antigen vaccine tailored to each individual patient. The vaccine,
      based on 5-15 peptides derived from a patient's tumor individual neo-antigens, will be
      formulated with a novel adjuvant to strengthen CD8+ T cell immunity to cancer. Immune
      checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 will be administered both before, during and
      after vaccination to unleash the activity of vaccine-induced immune responses.
