      setting according to the product label were documented. The follow-up observation period was
      for 2 years and focused on safety information and maintenance of efficacy during a normal
      clinical setting. Follow-up with participants was via regular office visits at intervals as
      determined by routine clinical practice or as recommended by national guidelines.
