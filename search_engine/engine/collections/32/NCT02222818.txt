    
      The CRTee study is an IDE, prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, crossover
      clinical study, conducted worldwide and designed to demonstrate that the amount of effective
      CRT pacing during AF (atrial fibrillation) when CAFRPlus (Conducted AF Response Plus) is
      applied is not inferior to the amount of effective CRT pacing during AF when CAFR (Conducted
      AF Response) is applied.

      The study will be conducted at up to 30 centers located in the United States, Europe and
      Middle East and Africa (MEA).
