      Patients with acute ischemic stroke will also be included with carotid artery stenosis <50%
      (study 3). The patient group will undergo a clinical neurological examination, ultrasound of
      the neck-arteries and a blood sample. The majority will also have a CT-angiography of the
      neck arteries and a cerebral MRI or CT. Carotid plaques removed by surgery (carotid
      end-arterectomy) and thrombs removed by thrombectomy will undergo histological analyses.

      Study 1:

      Plasma markers will be analysed and compared to clinical symptoms, ultrasound assessment of
      the plaque, cerebral MRI (or CT).

      Study 2:

      Results from advanced ultrasound of the carotid plaque including assessment of plaque
      morphology will be compared to histology of the removed plaque. Plasma markers and clinic
      will be related to the findings. The correlation between the different diagnostic modalities
      and the histologic conclusion will be assessed.

      Study 3:

      This study focus on plasma markers in an acute ischemic stroke due to a carotid plaque
      compared to an acute ischemic stroke with a cardial embolic source. Thrombi removed from the
      cerebral artery by thrombectomy will undergo histological analysis and the results will be
      compared to plasma markers and stroke aetiology.
