      thromboembolism. In the last few years direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are available for
      clinical use, mostly in prevention of stroke and systemic embolisms in patients with
      nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis. Numerous
      studies confirmed that minor oral surgical procedures in patients taking VKA with therapeutic
      (International Normalized Ratio) INR levels can be safely performed without therapy
      interruption if proper local haemostatic measures are applied. Similar recommendations were
      given for the dental treatment of patients taking DOACs, but there is a lack of clinical
      studies. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of bleeding complications after
      oral surgery in patients who continue their DOACs or VKA medications.
