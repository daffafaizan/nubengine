      agreement to take part in the study, an initial questionnaire folder (containing the WBQ and
      FABQ) was sent by email and by post to each of the physicians drawn by randomization. Upon
      inclusion, demographic data was collected from the physicians (gender, age, place of
      practice, and length of time in practice), as well as any personal or family history of neck
      pain or whiplash. The physicians were also asked how often they encountered cases of
      whiplash.

      Information about knowledge of whiplash injury was also sought. This included continuing
      medical training or recent reading (within the previous 3 years), and in particular knowledge
      of the different severity grades established by the Quebec Task Force classification, the
      radiologic recommendations of the Canadian C-Spine Rule, and lastly the latest HAS
      recommendation on physical therapy in post-whiplash neck pain.

      Once the first questionnaire folder had been completed, a second folder was then sent to all
      physicians participating in the study. The intervention group was instructed to complete the
      questionnaires at least 48 hours after the intervention that is, after reading the
      information booklet.

      The same items were included as in the initial folder, with an additional questionnaire
      enabling the intervention group to qualitatively assess the information booklet. If there was
      no response, reminders were sent by email, then by telephone, and lastly by post.
