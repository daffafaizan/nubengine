      safety of Nastech's insulin nasal spray compared with a rapid acting insulin (i.e., insulin
      aspart) in Type 2 diabetics. Insulin aspart is marketed as NovoLog® in the United States and
      NovoRapid® in Europe.

      The target for the patient titration scheme is that the 60 minute glucose reading does not
      increase more than 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) above the fasting glucose level AND does not result
      in hypoglycemia at any time within four hours post meal.

      NovoLog doses will be chosen based on a patient's current prandial insulin dose, or a dose of
      25% of their basal insulin dose or 8 IU if on oral antidiabetic therapy only. Then patients
      will be titrated up or down for up to three additional consecutive treatments from the
      initial dose (potential of 4 doses of NovoLog). Once a patient reaches their target titrated
      dose with NovoLog they are then titrated with nasal insulin.

      The nasal doses will correspond to the injectable dose based on bioavailability. For example,
      the nasal formulation being tested in this study has a 17%-28% bioavailability compared to
      NovoLog. Therefore a 25 IU nasal dose corresponds to a 4-7 IU NovoLog injectable dose. The
      patients will be titrated up or down per dose with nasal insulin for up to three additional
      consecutive treatments from the initial dose (potential of 4 doses of nasal insulin). Once a
      patient has been successfully titrated with NovoLog and then nasal insulin, they will be
      randomized to a two-way crossover where they will be given NovoLog and Nasal insulin. There
      will be at least a 20 hour washout period between titration and randomization stages.
      Patients will be monitored for symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia. If needed, treatment
      with oral carbohydrates such as glucose tablets, fruit juices, non-diet soda will be
      provided. In the event a patient is unable to take oral glucose, intravenous 20% glucose
      solution (D20) will be available.
