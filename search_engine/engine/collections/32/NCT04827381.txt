      promote patient and family engagement in care. With advances in natural language processing,
      an opportunity exists to maximize the value of visit recordings for patients by automatically
      annotate key visit information (e.g., medications, tests & imaging) with linkages to
      trustworthy online resources. These resources can be curated in an audio-based personal
      health library (PHL). In this project, the investigators will conduct a three-arm
      patient-randomized pilot trial in older adults with multimorbidity in ambulatory care
      settings to determine the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of an audio-based PHL
      developed with older adults and caregivers, HealthPAL. Participants in the intervention arms
      will receive access to an audio-based PHL with either 1) a clinic visit recording where key
      information is annotated and hyperlinks to trustworthy health information are provided
      (HealthPAL), 2) a clinic visit recording without annotations or hyperlinks, or 3) the third
      group of participants will receive usual care (control) with no recordings. Usability metrics
      and satisfaction will be assessed at two weeks. Preliminary data on the impact of HealthPAL
      on patient ability to seek, find and use health information with high confidence and patient
      activation, as well caregiver preparedness will also be gathered.
