      but is difficult to diagnose. Traditionally, diaphragm function is measured by evaluating
      inspiratory muscle strength via maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). However, this technique
      relies on a volitional maximal effort and can be challenging for patients to perform.

      An alternative to measuring inspiratory muscle strength is the sniff inspiratory pressure
      approach. During short, sharp sniffs, the diaphragm is maximally activated.

      Currently, there are no reported values of the normal range of maximal diaphragm thickness
      during a sniff maneuver. This study will define the normal range of values for sniff maximal
      diaphragm thickening fraction, maximal thickening against an occluded airway, and diaphragm
      thickening during resting tidal breathing in healthy subjects.
