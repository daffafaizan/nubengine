    
      This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, prospective, multinational Phase III
      confirmative study with 2 treatment groups and an adaptive design (Bauer and Köhne, 1994).
      The study is designed to compare the efficacy of treatment with abnobaVISCUM® 900 with
      Mitomycin C (MMC). Patients with completely resected superficial bladder carcinoma (Stage Ta)
      with an intermediate risk classification according to the European Association of Urology
      (EAU, update 2013) and with one immediately post operative MMC 40 mg intravesical
      instillation will be eligible for inclusion in the study.

      The study comprises a screening period of not more than 6 weeks, a treatment period of 12
      months for abnobaVISCUM® 900 and MMC and a follow-up period of 12 months. Patients will be
      screened within 6 weeks after the transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) and the
      immediately post operative MMC 40 mg intravesical instillation. A re-resection should be
      performed before inclusion if indicated. Every patient is to provide written informed consent
      before any study related procedures will be performed.
