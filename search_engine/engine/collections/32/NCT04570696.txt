      follow-up consultation. If the patient agrees to participate to this study, a non-opposition
      form will be signed.

      If blood tests are prescribed during the consultation, the unused plasma samples that are not
      required to perform the prescribed analyses will be collected and anonymized in order to
      measure the TGA and TFPI levels.

      TFPI plasmatic level and TFPI activity measurements will be performed by a quantitative ELISA
      assay (Total TFPI ELISA kit®, R&d Systems) and a chromogenic assay (Actichrom TFPI®, Cryopep)
      respectively.

      TGA will be performed on a Fluoroskan® machine using 3 different levels of Tissue Factor
      (TF): 1, 5 and 20 pM. In order to study the relation between different levels of TFPI
      inhibitors and TGA parameters, TGA will also be performed by spiking blood samples with
      several concentrations of TFPI inhibitor. For each TGA performed, ETP (Endogenous Thrombin
      Potential, nM/min), peak (nM) and lagtime (min) will be analyzed.

      Clinical data will be collected from the computerized patient record: date of birth, age,
      gender, haemophilia type (A or B) and its severity, ongoing treatments and deficient factor
      level.

      The goal of this study is to measure the TFPI plasma level in haemophilia patients. The
      second objective is to assess the effects of TFPI inhibition on thrombin generation. This
      study should provide with original data on TFPI plasma levels and the effect of TFPI on
      thrombin generation in haemophilia patients. This should help to define the monitoring of
      TFPI inhibitors in Haemophilia.

      There is no additional risk for the patient since only unused blood samples, not needed for
      the prescribed blood tests, will be collected.
