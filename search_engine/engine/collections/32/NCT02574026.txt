      temporo-spatial mapping of their brain activity, both sensory and motor, induced by a simple
      behavioral task, consisting on tapping with the finger on a detection pad. This will be done
      in a light and then dark environment, on a rythm spontaneous and then paced by sound bips.
      Accelerometric recording will provide the three dimensionnal displacements of the finger as
      well as the time code.

      Brain activity is simultaneously recorded using MEG (306 channels) and EEG (64 channels. Data
      will be processed by an INPLS algorithm to detect the predictors of activity, their location
      and time-course.

      3D mapping data will be matched with the patient's anatomy provided by 1.5T MRI previously
      performed.

      The aim of the study is to prepare the strategy of implantation of multielectrodes ECoG
      implants to restore motility in tetraplegic patients in a human BCI protocol currently under
      development.
