    
      Mebendazole has three polymorphic forms, identified as A, B and C. All of them are in accord
      with the US Pharmacopeia specifications (USP XXI) but they have distinct physiochemical
      characteristics (Himmelreich et al, 1977) and different therapeutic activities in
      experimentally infected mice with Trichinella spiralis infections (Rodriguez-Caabeiro et al,
      1987). The original mebendazole tablets which were used to treat human infections had more
      than 90% of polymorph C (Van den Bossche et al, 1982), but most pharmacopeias currently do
      not specify the proportion of polymorph C that a tablet of mebendazole should contain, and
      the assay specified for measurement of the active ingredient measures all polymorphs
      together. There is some evidence to show that unlike polymorph C, polymorph A is ineffective
      in the treatment of hookworm and whipworm infections (Charoenlarp et al, 1993). The State
      Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation of Sri Lanka produces both 500 mg and 100 mg tablets
      of mebendazole according to specifications laid down in the US Pharmacopeia. These tablets
      contain a mixture of polymorphs A and C. It is possible that increasing the content of
      mebendazole polymorph C in single dose tablets may improve cure rates and egg reduction
      rates, especially against hookworm and whipworm infections, where much variation in efficacy
      has been observed.
