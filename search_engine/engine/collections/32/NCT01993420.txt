    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, within-subject control, study enrolling 20 subjects with
      atopic dermatitis and designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy
      of DRM02.

      Safety will be assessed during the study, through adverse events, local skin responses,
      urinalysis, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical examination and vital
      signs.

      Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through the Physician's Lesion Assessment (PLA) and the
      Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) from only the two lesions identified at the baseline
      visit.
