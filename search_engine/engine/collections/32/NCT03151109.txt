      implant fixation and stability over time. To address this issue an extended peg glenoid
      baseplate is used and area around plate is augmented with bone (auto or allo)graft material
      to encourage bony callous growth around the implant. This study is to look at this area of
      concern and determine if glenoid bone loss is occurring in the patients where these measures
      have been taken to deter its development.
