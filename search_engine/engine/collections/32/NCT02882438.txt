      capsules, hydrogel and spray. GKB&GL were in filled in hard gelatin capsules as three
      formulae (GKB caps, GL caps and both as mixture in caps). Also, GKB&GL were formulated in
      hydrogel using 2% carbopol 934 as three formulae (GKB only, GL only and both as mixture). The
      same also were formulated as spray using alcohol, water and glycerol in concentration of 60%,
      20% and 20% respectively. The study included 5 trials, involving 35 participants. The oral
      formulae were tried on 30 participants having Tenia Pedis. Fluconazole was as standard
      antifungal drug.The antifungal activity of all gel formulae was determined by Agar
      well-diffusion method. It is also important to follow up and collect data, preferably for six
      months for local and systemic activity, to establish whether or not the infection recurred or
      not. In future clinical trials, research should consider the costs of the different treatment
      approaches.
