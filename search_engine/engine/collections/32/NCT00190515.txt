      for curatively resected colorectal cancer in Japan. In order to evaluate a clinical benefit
      of oral anticancer drugs in adjuvant chemotherapy, we conducted randomized controlled trial
      comparing the oral combination chemotherapy, UFT+LV, to the standard intravenous combination
      chemotherapy, 5-FU+l-LV, in stage III colorectal cancer.

      UFT+LV: UFT 300mg/m2/day and LV 75mg/day, orally for 28days with 7days rest, repeated five
      times every 5 weeks.

      5-FU+l-LV: 5-FU 500mg/m2, l-LV 250mg/m2, weekly administration for 6 times, repeated three
      times every 8 weeks.

      Primary endpoints are disease-free survival and secondary endpoints are overall survival and
      adverse event rate.
