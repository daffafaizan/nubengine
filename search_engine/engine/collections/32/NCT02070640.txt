    
      This study is designed to determine the clinical utility of intravenous indocyanine green
      (ICG) injection pre-operatively for cholecystectomy, followed by visualizuation of the
      biliary tree with a near-infrared light source and camera. Testing will be done during an
      abdominal surgery which requires gallbladder removal. Subjects will be recruited during
      consult for their surgical procedure. The study itself will take an estimated 5 minutes
      during the procedure. 2.5mg of ICG will be injected intravenously 60-30 minutes before
      surgery, and following perfusion of the biliary tree, images will be recorded and visibility
      of the appropriate anatomy will be assessed using a near-infrared light source and camera. If
      fluorescence has faded prior to adequate visualization, a repeat dose of 2.5mg IV ICG may be
      given. Following the completion of imaging, the standard procedure for cholecystectomy will
      be performed including intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), which is standard of care.
      Subject post-operative recovery will be monitored for the duration of their hospital stay.
      Adverse events will be monitored at the patient's routine follow up visit.
