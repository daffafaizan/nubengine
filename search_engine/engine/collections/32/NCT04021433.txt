      patients' quality of life, social and occupational function. MDD also significantly increase
      suicide rate. About a third of the patients with MDD suffer from moderate to severe symptoms
      that are fully or partially unresponsive to accepted pharmaco and / or psycho therapy.
      Ketamine is a widely used anesthetic. Multiple studies done over the recent years had shown
      its therapeutic effects in resistant depressive patients. Unlike regular antidepressants,
      ketamine exerts its effect within hours to few days which implies an alternative mechanism of
      action not fully studied. So far, there are only few reports on using repeated ketamine
      administration to maintain the antidepressant effect or on intra-muscular or sub-cutaneous
      application that can be safer and more tolerable than the intravenous route.

      In the present study, the investigators aim to openly assess the safety, tolerability and
      effectiveness of repeated, individually tailored IM or SC ketamine for treatment resistant
      major depression. The investigators intend to explore questions regarding optimal dose,
      treatment frequency and duration. The investigators will also assess potential cognitive
      effects of long-term ketamine treatment and look for possible treatment outcome predictors
      using the Neurotrax computerized cognitive battery.
