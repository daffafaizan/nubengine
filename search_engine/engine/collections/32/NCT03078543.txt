    
      The ANTHEM PS Study is a prospective, multicentre, cohort study to collect relevant patient
      reported, clinical, surgical and radiological data from 143 subjects implanted with the
      ANTHEM™PS Knee System for degenerative joint disease in up to 6 clinical sites globally.
      Total study duration for study participants will be 10 years with post-operative follow-up
      visits planned for 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 7.5 years and 10 years. The study will
      evaluate the 10 year implant survivorship and the safety and outcome of the ANTHEM™PS Knee
      System over 10 years. This is a post-market study of the ANTHEM™PS Total Knee System.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority (8% margin) of 10 year
      implant survivorship of the ANTHEM™PS Total Knee System in patients undergoing total knee
      arthroplasty for osteoarthritis compared to reported literature.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate shorter and long term safety and
      outcomes of the ANTHEM™ PS Total Knee System.
