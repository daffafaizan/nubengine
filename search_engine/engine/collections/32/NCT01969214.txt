      diarrhoea recovery time post 1st intake of IQP-MM-101 in an open label, single arm,
      multicentre study over a 72 hours period. There were 2 clinic visits: the screening visit and
      final visit.

      At baseline visit (visit 1), written informed consents were collected. Each patients were
      given a diary and the following data were collected: demographics, vital signs, physical
      examination results, use of concomitant medication, previous medical history, and case
      history of the acute diarrhoea episode including date of first watery stool, number of stools
      over the past 24 hours, and presence of other associated symptoms over the past 24 hours
      (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain).

      Subjects recorded the following data in the diary: date and hour of bowel movement, stool
      consistency (Bristol stool scale) presence of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal
      pain and study IP consumption (number, date, and time of tablets taken) and time of vomiting
      (if any) each day during the treatment period. Additionally, subjects recorded the time
      absent from work and a subjective evaluation of their "energy for everyday life".

      Visit 2 took place after 72 hours treatment period. Following data was collected:

        -  Vital signs, physical examination

        -  Adverse events

        -  Use of concomitant medication

        -  Compliance (returned IP and diary)

        -  Global evaluation of efficacy and safety by subjects and investigators

      During the 72-hour treatment period, all subjects were instructed to consumed IQP-MM-101
      according to the following dosage: one (1) tablet, three (3) times a day dissolved in at
      least 125mL (half a glass) of water.
