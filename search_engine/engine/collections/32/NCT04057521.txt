      integrated care management quality improvement model designed to provide comprehensive care
      coordination for Medicaid insured minority children and young adults with chronic health
      conditions living in Chicago. This program, called CHECK (Coordinated HEalthcare for Complex
      Kids), was funded by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation (CMMI) Award.
      The CHECK model took a broad approach to health promotion by addressing social determinants
      of health, caregiver wellness and mental health needs; in addition to disease management. The
      program targeted children and young adults from birth to age 25 with diagnoses of asthma,
      diabetes, sickle cell disease, seizure disorder or prematurity. All participants were
      enrolled in either the traditional (fee-for-service) state Medicaid program or a Medicaid
      Managed Care Organization (MCO) in Illinois. CHECK provided access to care coordination
      delivered by community health workers; mental health services and health education.

      CHECK was designed as a demonstration program and participants were enrolled passively over
      time and received different services depending on their level of risk and need. One primary
      aim of the CHECK program was to decrease Medicaid expenditures over a three-year period by
      decreasing unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

      Though CHECK was designed as a care delivery demonstration program, in April, 2016 we had the
      opportunity to prospectively randomize 6,259 participants who met eligibility criteria for
      CHECK, for the purpose of program evaluation.
