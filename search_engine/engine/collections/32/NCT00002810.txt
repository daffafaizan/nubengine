        -  Assess overall and progression-free survival following high-dose melphalan and
           autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with primary
           amyloidosis.

        -  Evaluate the toxic effects associated with this treatment regimen.

        -  Evaluate the function of involved organs, especially the heart, lungs, and nervous
           system, before and after treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor (G-CSF) for 5 days and then collected by leukapheresis. Patients receive high-dose
      melphalan on 2 consecutive days, followed by 1 day of rest, then by PBSC transplantation.
      G-CSF is given from 1 day after transplantation until the neutrophil count is greater than
      1,500 for 3 consecutive days.

      Patients are followed at 100 days and 1 year post-transplant.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A very small number of patients are expected to be accrued over 5-10
      years.
