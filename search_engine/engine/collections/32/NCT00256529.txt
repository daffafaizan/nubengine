      their dysphagia will be asked to enroll. If patients have undergone previous work up for
      dysphagia such as manometry, 24-hour probe, or barium swallow they can still participate in
      this study. Informed consent will take place prior to enrollment. After patients present with
      dysphagia they will fill-out a questionnaire regarding their dysphagia symptoms. An EGD with
      biopsies will then be performed. Biopsies will be taken from 4 quadrants in the proximal and
      distal esophagus. The distal esophagus biopsies will be taken 5 cm proximal to the Z-line.
      Proximal biopsies will be taken anywhere proximal to 30 cm from the incisors.
