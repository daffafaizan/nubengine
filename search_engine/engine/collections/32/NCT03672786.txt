      that occurs on a cellular and systemic level in which micronutrients play an important role
      in regulating the processes that sustain athletic performance. Objective: The investigators
      measured changes in gene expression of whole blood in elite athletes and sedentary subjects
      and compared gene modulation before and after nutritional intervention with micronutrients.
      Methods: Thirteen elite athletes and thirteen sedentary controls were enrolled in the present
      study. Blood samples were taken from athletes and sedentary age- and gender-matched subjects.
      The study design was carried out over a period of 4 months where three time points were
      established: (T0) baseline conditions in the sedentary and handball groups; (T2) after two
      months of supplementation; (T4) after two months in the absence of nutritional
      supplementation. Differential gene expression was evaluated in 112 genes using RT-qPCR
      analysis with the QuantStudioTM 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System.
