    
      Potential subjects aged 6 years to 12 years, 11 months old with DSM 5 ARFID, and weight equal
      to or between 75 to 88% EBW who are medically stable for outpatient treatment and their
      families will be recruited through Stanford University, pediatricians, mental health experts,
      clinics treating EDs, and local parents' groups. Those eligible for the program will be
      invited to read and sign informed consent forms and complete the baseline assessment.
      Participants will then be randomized to FBT-ARFID with medical management for 14 sessions
      provided over 4 months or manualized Non-Specific Care (NSC) with medical management for 4
      months. NSC will consist of 14 sessions over 4 months.

      There will be 5 major assessment time points: Baseline, 1 month, 2 months, End Of Treatment
      (4 months), and 6-month post-treatment Follow-Up. Both the child and the parent will complete
      measures at these time points. In addition, parents will complete short survey assessments
      after each of the 14 treatment sessions.
