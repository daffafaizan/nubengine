      pediatric practices using blood already collected at the 1-year well child visit. We
      hypothesize that providing cotinine biomarker results to pediatricians, personalized cotinine
      feedback to parents about their child's toxin exposure, and offering support to all household
      tobacco users to quit tobacco use (Biomarker Informed Outreach (BIO)) when added to the
      Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure (CEASE) intervention will increase delivery
      of tobacco cessation assistance, increase household cessation, reduce tobacco smoke exposure
      in children, and be cost-effective. This is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with
      family-level randomization to either CEASE+BIO or CEASE arms at the child's 1-year well child
      visit. To compare the effectiveness of CEASE+BIO vs. CEASE, we will follow-up with enrolled
      parents at the 2-year well child visit to assess parental quit rate and children's tobacco
      smoke exposure.
