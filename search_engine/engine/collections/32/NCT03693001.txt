      consenting patients with IC and FM, with repeated subjective and urological measures
      conducted before and after a therapeutic protocol. The study duration was set to 3 months.
      Patients were exposed to breathing 100% oxygen at 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA) in a
      multiplace pressure chamber for 90 minutes using an oro-nasal mask. Patients undertook a
      cycle of 20 sessions for 5 days per week for four weeks. After one week of suspension, a
      second cycle of 20 sessions was completed.
