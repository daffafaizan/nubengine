    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish that a dose of 150 mg/m² of nonradiolabeled anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody
           AHN-12 results in normal biodistribution, normal-organ estimated radiation-absorbed dose
           of less than 20 Gy, and estimated radiation-absorbed dose of no more than 13 Gy to the
           red marrow.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody
           AHN-12 (^90Y-AHN-12).

        -  To determine the human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response.

        -  To define, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of ^90Y-AHN-12.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody AHN-12
      (^90Y-AHN-12).

        -  Biodistribution: Patients receive nonradiolabeled monoclonal antibody AHN-12 IV and an
           imaging dose of indium Y 111 monoclonal antibody AHN-12 (^111In-AHN-12) IV over 10
           minutes on day 0. Patients undergo whole-body gamma-camera imaging immediately following
           infusion, at 4-6 hours, and on days 1, 3, 4, and 7. Blood samples are collected prior to
           each imaging for dosimetry calculations and pharmacokinetics.

      Patients also undergo bone marrow biopsy 16-24 hours after infusion for dosimetry
      calculations. Patients with the expected biodistribution of ^111In-AHN-12, an estimated
      radiation-absorbed dose to the normal organ of < 20 Gy, an estimated radiation-absorbed dose
      to the red marrow of ≤ 13 Gy, and a negative human anti-mouse antibody at day 7 proceed to
      the therapy portion.

        -  Treatment: Patients receive nonradiolabeled anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody AHN-12 IV over
           60 minutes and escalating therapy doses of yttrium Y 90 anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody
           AHN-12 (^90Y-AHN-12) IV over 10 minutes on day 7 or 8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.
