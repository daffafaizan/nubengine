    
      This is a longitudinal, single arm, 19-week study to investigate the utility of digital
      assessments to measure the efficacy of exercise-based physical therapy (PT) for reducing pain
      and improving function in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

      A total of 60 participants will be included. Participants will receive a supervised
      exercise-based PT for 12 weeks and will undergo multiple assessments of strength, balance,
      gait and joint movement while being monitored with a motion capture system and wrist and
      lumbar wearable sensors. Additionally, participants' activities will be monitored in the real
      world with the same wrist and lumbar wearable sensors. After completion of the PT program,
      participants will be monitored for an additional 6-week period to measure persistence of
      treatment effect. During that time, they will continue to follow an exercise program at home.

      The primary objective will be to measure the effect of exercise-based PT on functional
      performance and pain reduction using both patient reported outcomes questionnaires (PROs) and
      digital metrics obtained from the laboratory assessments and wearable sensors worn in the
      real world. Pain phenotyping questionnaires and quantitative sensory testing assessments will
      also be used to evaluate the effect of specific pain phenotypes in treatment response.

      A substudy will be undertaken to assess reproducibility of sensor-based measures during
      physical performance testing across at-home and in-lab implementation, as well as,
      reproducibility of these measures over repeated at-home implementation.
