      targeted approaches to transfusion during cesarean delivery. ROTEM-based transfusion for PPH
      has been advocated as a mechanism to lower overall requirement of blood components transfused
      and lower the incidence of transfusion-associated pulmonary morbidity in a small study of
      women undergoing cesarean delivery. However, larger-scale randomized evaluation of this
      transfusion approach is warranted for women who experience hemorrhage after vaginal or
      cesarean delivery. A lower serum fibrinogen level (< 200 mg/dL) at the onset of PPH has a
      positive predictive value of 100% for progression to severe PPH. However, serum fibrinogen
      testing has a turnaround time of one hour and is therefore not useful for acute management of
      PPH. ROTEM provides point-of-care results that have been validated as surrogate markers for
      serum fibrinogen, within 10 minutes. However, whether ROTEM data alters empiric management of
      acute PPH is unknown. A comparison of transfusion management decisions and costs incurred for
      transfused products and transfusion-related morbidity (duration of hospitalization, intensive
      care unit, respiratory complications) will be performed.
