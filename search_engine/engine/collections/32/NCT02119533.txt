      detecting structural (visible on CT scan) and non-structural (concussive) brain injury. The
      study will recruit brain injured subjects and non-brain injured controls from the Bellevue
      Hospital Emergency Department and neurosurgery services for eye-tracking as well as studies
      that assess the extent of brain injury. The investigators will determine if disconjugate gaze
      on eye tracking is significantly associated with abnormal functional, neuro-cognitive, and
      psychiatric outcomes.

      The investigators hypothesize that individuals who demonstrate sustained disconjugate gaze on
      the eye tracking task from the time of injury to 1 month will have elevated functional
      impairment in multiple domains of life (work, interpersonal relationships), will be poor
      performers on neuro-cognitive tasks (working memory, executive functioning, verbal memory,
      impulsivity), and will be significantly more symptomatic of posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) and depression than those who demonstrate conjugate eye tracking in the normal range
      at one month. Achievement of the investigators aims will provide the first evidence that eye
      tracking is a valid physiologic outcome measure for brain injury.
