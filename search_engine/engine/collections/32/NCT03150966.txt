      corresponding physician and Neurologist. As the aim of the current study was the assessment
      of nanocurcumin in MS patients, the peripheral blood collection was collected in two steps.
      After the first blood collection via venipuncture, 25 patients received nanocurcumin capsules
      each day and the remaining 25 patients took placebo for 6 months. Accordingly, the second
      sampling from the mentioned population was collected after 6 months. 9 patients were excluded
      from the study: 3 did not provide informed consent, 5 lived quite far away from the place in
      which follow-up examinations were performed, and 1 patient developed cancer. In all cases, 15
      ml of blood was utilized for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolation. PBMC is
      used to measure the expression levels of miRNA-106b, miRNA-25 and miRNA-326. In this regard,
      specific kits extracted miRNA from cells is used. Then the version of miRNA using
      Quantitative Real time polymerase chain reaction(qPCR).Then the frequency of Treg and Th17
      cells in peripheral blood of patients will be examined by Flowcytometry and compared to the
      control group. The expression of key transcription factor (Foxp3) and specific cytokines
      (TGF-β) related to the Treg cells and key transcription factor (RORγt) and specific
      cytokines, interleukin-17(IL-17), related to the Th17 are measured by Quantitative Real time
      PCR. Elisa methos is used to assess the amount of the cytokine TGF-β and IL-17 in cultured
      cells.
