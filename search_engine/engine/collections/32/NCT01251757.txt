      single greatest challenge for chronic-disease management. Many studies have linked medication
      non-adherence to treatment failure; unnecessary and dangerous intensification of therapy; and
      excess health care costs, hospitalizations, and deaths. Although some interventions have been
      shown to significantly enhance medication adherence, the strategies used are often complex,
      labor-intensive, and of variable effectiveness. Simple interventions designed to make
      small-but-significant improvements in population-based adherence may thus offer a novel,
      cost-effective, and easily-disseminated alternative to current approaches for enhancing
      adherence. The proposed PATIENT study will use health information technology (automated phone
      calls and access to an electronic medical record) to test two such interventions and compare
      them to each other and to usual care alone.
