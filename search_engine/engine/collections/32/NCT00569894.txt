           asthma, wheezing, pre-specified grouped diagnoses, and rare events potentially related

           groups.

        -  To assess the safety of annual FluMist re-vaccination [Rates of MAEs in the subset of
           children who receive FluMist in â‰¥2 consecutive years will be compared to rates in
           first-time vaccinees during the same season.]

        -  To assess the safety of FluMist vaccination in children previously vaccinated with
           trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) [Rates of MAEs in the subset of children
           who received one or more prior TIV vaccinations will be compared to rates in children
