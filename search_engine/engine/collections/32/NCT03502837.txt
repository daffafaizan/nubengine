      consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC); however, precise and
      accurate quantitative indices to estimate cerebral activation to different auditory stimuli
      remain scarce. In this study, investigators assessed the response of different brain regions
      to emotional stimuli using ERP(Event-related potential),and further investigated the brain
      activation network.
