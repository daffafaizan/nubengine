      However, bowel preparation assessment involved subjectivity and uncertainty. We constructed a
      deep learning based system to calculate the proportion of Boston Bowel Prep Scale (BBPS)
      score of 0-1 during withdrawal phase and performed a prospective observational study to
      validate the threshold of the adequate proportion.The multi-center study is aimed to verify
      the extrapolation and robustness of the scoring threshold based on artificial intelligence
      intestinal cleanliness evaluation system explored in the early stage, and propose a more
      accurate and quantifiable threshold for evaluating the eligibility of intestinal preparation.
