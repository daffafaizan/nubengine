    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a live, oral, combined Shigella-ETEC
      vaccine candidate, known as strain CVD 1208S-122, is safe and immunogenic. This will be a
      phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating, single-center study, involving
      three vaccine dosage escalation cohorts (10^8, 10^9, and 10^10 cfu vaccine organisms). Each
      of the three dose-escalation cohorts will consist of 8 study participants who will be
      randomly allocated to receive either vaccine (n=6) or placebo (n=2), as a single, oral dose.
      An independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review the available safety data for
      Cohorts 1 - 3 through 7 days post-vaccination before proceeding to the enrollment of the next
      cohort. The fourth cohort will be an adaptive design cohort consisting of 30 study
      participants to be randomly allocated to receive either two doses of vaccine (n=12), one dose
      of vaccine (n=12), or two doses of placebo (n=6), with the dosage selection based on the
      highest well-tolerated dose in the dose-escalation cohorts (1 - 3), as determined by the SMC.

      Each of the dose-escalation cohorts (1 - 3) will receive the oral dose of blinded study
      product while in the inpatient setting. During the following subsequent 96 hours (4 days),
      participants will remain on the inpatient research isolation ward to be closely monitored,
      and each stool will be collected by study staff. The evaluation and monitoring of
      participants enrolled in the fourth cohort will be conducted entirely in the outpatient
      setting.
