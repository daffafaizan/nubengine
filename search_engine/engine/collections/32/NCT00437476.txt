    
      This is a pilot, randomised, open label, controlled clinical trial. All eligible patients
      (CD4 count > 200 and no PI resistance)will receive 26 weeks induction HAART (LPV/r + selected
      NUCS). At the end of induction period (Phase I), all subjects with negative HIV-RNA from at
      least two months, Hb > 11 g/dL and CD4 count > 350 cells/mmc will be randomised (1:1), to
      receive LPV/r new tabs (200/50 mg, 2 cpr BID) monotherapy (arm A) or to continue the same
      HAART (arm B), associated to anti-HCV therapy for other 48 weeks (Phase II). The number of
      subjects to recruit will be 60 subjects to start the induction-phase with the aim to
      randomize, at least 25 subjects in each arm of the study. The total number of subjects to
      randomize will be 50. The Group A: will receive LPV/r + selected NRTIs for 26 weeks, followed
      by LPV/r monotherapy and anti HCV drugs for 48 weeks. Group B: will receive LPV/r+ selected
      NRTIs for 24 weeks, followed by the same HAART and anti-HCV drugs for 48 weeks. At the end of
      the co-treatment for HCV/HIV, each subject will be treated for HIV infection according to
      physician decision.All the patients will be followed-up for 24 weeks after the end of
      anti-HCV drugs for the evaluation of SVR.As anti-HCV drugs the patients will receive PEG-IFNa
      2a 180 mcg/week + Ribavirin 1-1.2 g/day . At the end of week 12 of combined therapy, only
      patients who will reach an early virological response will continue anti-HCV drugs.
