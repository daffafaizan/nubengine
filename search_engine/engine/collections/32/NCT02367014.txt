      into 3 cohorts of 12 subjects each to evaluate treatment with 3 ascending doses of
      intravenous elamipretide (0.01, 0.10, and 0.25 mg/kg/hr infused for 2 hours). After each
      cohort, a Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) determined if dose escalation to the next higher dose
      of elamipretide was warranted. Each cohort went through 3 distinct periods: Screening,
      Treatment, and Follow-up.

      The Screening Period started with informed consent and may have lasted up to 40 days. During
      this period, screening procedures to determine subject eligibility for the study occurred,
      including confirmation of disease, which incorporated a committee review of the
      investigator-submitted diagnosis and genetic results. The Treatment Period began on Day 1
      (Visit 2) and lasted for 5 days (until Day 5 [Visit 6]). Within each cohort, 9 subjects were
      randomized to active drug and 3 subjects were randomized to placebo on Day 1 and subjects
      received treatment once a day for 5 consecutive days. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy
      measures were performed at pre-specified times. The Follow-up Period began at the time of
      discharge on Day 5. Subjects returned to the study center for the Follow-up Visit on Day 7
      (+1 day).
