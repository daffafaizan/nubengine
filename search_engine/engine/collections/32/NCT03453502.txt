      is an effective means of increasing breast milk feeding.Twenty-seven hospitals in China will
      participate in the study, which aims to increase breastfeeding rate in the NICU and reduce
      the clinical complications in very low birth weight infants and extremely low birth weight
      infants. This study compared the clinical data of very low birth weight infants and extremely
      low birth weight infants in three phases：Before-intervention phase，Intervention phase and
      Sustainability phase. During the Intervention phase and Sustainability phase multiple
      intervention bundles of quality improvement were implemented.The investigators will compare
      breast milk feeding rate and neonatal outcomes in different phases.
