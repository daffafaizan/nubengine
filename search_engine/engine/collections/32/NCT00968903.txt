      of advanced osteoarthritis total hip arthroplasty is still associated with postoperative pain
      and delayed rehabilitation. The investigators therefore decided to evaluate the effects of
      pre-operative methylprednisolone (125mg iv) versus placebo on postoperative outcome in a well
      defined fast-track setup after hip arthroplasty.
