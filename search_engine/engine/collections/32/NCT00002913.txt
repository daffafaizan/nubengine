      I. Determine the maximum tolerated doses of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan administered
      together with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian
      cancer.

      II. Describe and quantitate the clinical toxic effects of combination chemotherapy with
      paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan with or without G-CSF.

      III. Assess preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this combination chemotherapy in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV on day 1, followed by topotecan
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning
      on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed as clinically indicated.
