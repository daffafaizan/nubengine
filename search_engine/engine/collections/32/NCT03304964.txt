      After assessing eligibility during a 4-week screening period, 1 treatment group of 8 subjects
      (8 active; 0 placebo) will be randomized to a treatment sequence (D followed by E, or E
      followed by D):

        -  Treatment D: single oral dose of 200 mg FP-025 under fasted conditions, and

        -  Treatment E: single oral dose of 200 mg FP-025 after intake of a high-fat, high-calorie
           breakfast (fed condition).
