      have seizures, and many suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness and poor quality of life.
      Evidence from case studies suggests that treatment of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA)-stoppage in breathing during sleep-can reduce the frequency of seizures in people with
      epilepsy that is resistant to antiepileptic medication.

      In this study, individuals with symptoms of OSA and 2 or more seizures a month who meet study
      criteria will undergo polysomnography, a test that continuously monitors normal and abnormal
      physiological activity during sleep. Those individuals who test positive for OSA will be
      randomized to either therapeutic or placebo continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-a mask
      treatment for sleep apnea-for 10 weeks, during which time seizure frequency, daytime
      sleepiness, health-related quality of life, and CPAP compliance will be assessed.
