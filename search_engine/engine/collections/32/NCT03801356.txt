      value of diagnostic SNRBs in patients who present with lumbar foraminal stenosis and
      radiculopathy. Specifically, the proposed study will address the question of whether there is
      a degree or length of response to SNRB, which predicts an excellent surgical outcome. The
      hypothesis is that diagnostic SNRBs, when performed correctly, are useful in localizing the
      level of involvement in LSS and improve the accuracy and efficacy of surgical intervention.
      Use of diagnostic SNRBs will thus be used to clarify the clinical picture, giving the surgeon
      the information to make the right decision to operate or not, and, in the case of operation,
      predicting the optimal level(s) for surgical intervention. In addition, the investigators
      plan to identify and fully characterize a standard threshold level and time of nerve block
      response that will optimize the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of SNRB in predicting
      surgical outcomes.
