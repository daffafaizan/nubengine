      In WP-I, the preferred dose of the agent for imaging of margins in oral cancer will be
      determined. The signal-to-noise ratio will be determined in dose group A (n=7), which will
      receive 0.05 mg/kg of the tracer, 16-20 hours before surgery. After an interim evaluation of
      this ratio, the second dose group B (n=7) will receive either a higher or a lower dosage (to
      be determined) of the tracer. After inclusion of all patients (n=14), the dose with the
      highest intraoperative signal-to-noise ratio will be selected.

      Work package II:

      In WP-II, an expansion cohort (n=15) will be added to the group of patients that had received
      the selected dose in WP-I. In this group of 22 patients, it will be determined if FLI can
      improve the rate of adequate surgical resection margins. As secondary research questions, the
      following aspects will be assessed:

        -  sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of FLI;

        -  colocalization with immunohistochemistry;

        -  change in surgical management; incremental operation time;

        -  FLI of excised cervical lymph nodes.
