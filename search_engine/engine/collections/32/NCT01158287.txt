      Primary

        -  To determine the disease control rate (complete response, partial response, and stable
           disease) of sorafenib tosylate after 4 months in patients with relapsed esophageal or
           gastric adenocarcinoma previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the tolerability and toxicity in patients treated with this drug.

        -  To assess biomarkers associated with response/resistance to therapy. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice a day on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tumor samples may be collected periodically and analyzed for biological markers.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
