      once a day, daily for the past 12 months. The study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind
      within-subject repeated mesaures design. Participants will ingest a sequence of ketum and
      placebo drinks prepared by pharmacologists at USM Centre for Drug Research and their pain
      tolerance will be measured by the cold pressor task after ingesting ketum or placebo.
