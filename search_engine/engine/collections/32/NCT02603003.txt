      cells play a key role in the process of distant metastasis.In recent years, research results
      have shown that CTCs may become a emerging marker and new target in the treatment of lung
      cancer. The investigators' study will elaborate the clinical significance of CTCs intervented
      by TCM in lung cancer from the diagnosis and clinical staging,metastasis and recurrence,
      individual treatment and prognosis and so on, in order to provide a new direction for the
      treatment of lung cancer.
