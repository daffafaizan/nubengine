      profile in ICU patients with specific co-morbidities such as obesity, hypoalbumenia, and
      severe liverfunction disturbances. Also, ICU patients are known to experience changes in
      pharmacokinetics (PK) due to changes in hemodynamics, extracorporeal elimination techniques,
      interacting comedication, etc. Based on criteria outlined below, micafungin may prove to be
      the drug of choice in this cohort of patients. Therefore it seems prudent to conduct a trial
      in a cohort of patients who receive micafungin but with co-variates that may be of influence
      to the pharmacokinetic profile. To build a valid pharmacokinetic model, all patients on
      micafungin will be included in the analysis and used for model building. Co-variates that
      will be explored are at least: obesitas, liverfunction, albumin, creatinin-clearance.
      Simulations will be performed to determine if adequate exposure is reached under different
      patho-physiological conditions.

      In conclusion: this trial is on determining the PK of micafungin in a non-selected cohort of
      patients with suspected or proven invasive fungal infections. Most important covariates will
      be modelled using advanced mathematical techniques. Micafungin may prove to be beneficial
      over the other two echinocandins in terms of limited factors that impact PK. This has to be
      proven in a prospective trial.
