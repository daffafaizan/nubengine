    
      A phase 2b trial, self-contained, open-label, controlled, randomized study in three parallel
      arms, two of them formed by groups of healthy or infected school children, both receiving
      three (3) injections at D0, W4 (Week 4), W8; both groups receiving 50 μg Sm14 vaccine
      candidate solution, combined with 2.5μg GLA-SE. The third group is composed by non-vaccinated
      infected school children.

      Sm14: recombinant protein produced in yeast following Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)
      conditions, presented in vials containing 0.55 ml solution Sm14, 0.4 ml solution is diluted
      with 0.4 ml of GLA (Synthetic Glucopyranosyl lipid A) for intramuscular administration.

      Medical examinations are performed at D0 (before injection, 1 hr and 4 hr after), and a
      safety evaluation at 24 hrs and 48 hrs, after each injection.

      Blood analysis: Liver function tests - renal function tests - blood counts, at W-1 before
      inclusion, and at W9 and W21 during the follow-up.

      Blood samples for immune response analysis at D0, W12 and W21.
