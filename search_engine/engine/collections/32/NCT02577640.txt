      over 3 billion dollars annually. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by chronic
      inflammation and progressive scarring, leading to abdominal pain, irreversible damage to the
      pancreas and the loss of both exocrine and endocrine function. Additionally, chronic
      pancreatic inflammation is a risk factor for pancreas cancer. There are no current treatments
      to modify the natural history of this disorder. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic options
      for this disease represents a high priority, and could fill an unmet medical need to improve
      quality of life, reduce risk of malignant transformation, and limit exorbitant medical costs
      associated with patient care. The investigators have assembled a multi-disciplinary research
      team to pursue an alternative, non-pharmacologic approach to limiting inflammatory cascades
      in (Chronic Pancreatitis) CP patients. They will assess compliance, toxicity and measure the
      changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression from a soy based dietary bread product using
      a classic 3+3 dose escalation study design in subjects with chronic pancreatitis.
