      healthy group of women admitted for delivery will act as a matched control and will have
      their blood sampled at similar time points. The primary outcome variables will include the
      total number of micro-particles, the number of micro-particles from each cell line (platelet,
      placental, endothelial etc.), and protein markers The knowledge gained from this study has
      the potential to develop a diagnostic test for PAS with the ability to improve management and
      outcomes for mother and baby through earlier diagnosis.
