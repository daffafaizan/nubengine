      cytoreduction and platinum/taxane containing chemotherapy have a significant chance of
      entering complete clinical remission but about 70% will eventually relapse. Many patients
      respond to additional cytotoxic treatment with partial or complete responses, yet
      approximately 100% of these patients will ultimately progress. Novel consolidation strategies
      following treatment for recurrent disease are needed and an immunologic approach is an
      attractive option.
