      adolescent substance use among 13-15-year-old teens. The program consists of 5 levels. Levels
      1 to 4 are 15-25 minutes; level 5 allots time for message production done offline. Activities
      lead students to engage in critique and analysis of arguments present/absent from pro-ATOD
      and other popular product messages and to begin the process of refuting and counter-arguing
      these messages. These skills are reinforced in level 5 using an active involvement strategy
      in which youth plan and produce anti-ATOD messages. Users first plan their message via an
      online worksheet, which requires engagement with and application of media literacy concepts
      rather than focus exclusively on technology and/or production features. Next, participants
      design their posters/videos and upload their messages to a social media site as part of a
      contest, where they recruit peers and family to like or comment on their message.
