        -  B7-H3 is expressed in 70% of patients with glioblastoma

        -  B7-H3 is not expressed in normal tissues especially not in central nervous system.
           Therefore, it is an attractive GBM target for CAR-T therapy

        -  The investigators constructed a retroviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor
           (CAR) targeting B7-H3, which can mediate CAR transfer into patient T cells with high
           efficiency.

      Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability intratumoral/intracerebroventricular injection
           of B7-H3 CAR-T when used in between Temozolomide cycles

        -  To compare the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of R/R GBM
           patients treated with B7-H3 CAR-T in between Temozolomide cycles to the historical
           Temozolomide data

        -  To access the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of B7-H3 CAR-T in between
           Temozolomide cycles

      Design

      Patients autologous T cells are activated and transduced with retrovirus containing B7-H3
      CAR. CAR-T cells are expanded ex vivo and infused back to patients via intratumoral or
      intracerebroventricular injection through an Ommaya catheter. 3 injections of CAR-T are
      planned at two different doses with 1-2 weeks intervals. The CAR-T injections occur in
      between Temozolomide (TMZ) cycles. Temozolomide treatment in the cycle of CAR-T injections
      will be stopped and resumed next cycle. Patients may receive additional CAR-T cycles at the
      discretion of the principal investigator and oncologist.
