      abortions before the 20th week gestational age, occurred in about 1% to 5% couples. The
      causes of RM include uterine factors, endocrine factors, thromobophilic factors, immunologic
      factors and genetic factors. The hydatidiform mole (HM) can be divided into two separate
      syndromes: complete mole (CHM) and partial mole (PHM). In the West, CHMs occur in
      approximately 1 in every 1500 pregnancies. The incidence is higher in Latin America,
      Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The cause of RM and HM are not known for the vast
      majority of cases. The NLRP (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, Leucine rich Repeat
      and Pyrin domain containing) family, also referred to as NALP family, is well known for its
      roles in apoptosis and inflammation. Expression studies showed that twelve of the fourteen
      members of NLRP family express differentially in human oocytes and preimplantation embryonic
      cells, especially NLRP7, indicating important role of NLRP family in female reproduction.
      Since 2006, mutations of NLRP7 have been found in women with repeated occurrence of molar
      pregnancy, repeated stillbirth or early spontaneous abortion. In women who experienced RM/HM,
      we also found some novel mutations/genetic variants of NLRP7. Taken together, these finding
      suggest RM and HM may share the same genetic etiology in some cases. In addition, NLRP7 is a
      strong candidate gene for RM/HM. A recent report showed chaotic cleavage abnormalities of
      embryos in patients with NLRP7 variants.
