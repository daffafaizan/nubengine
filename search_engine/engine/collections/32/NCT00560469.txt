      groups of obese subjects, selected to be similar in age, gender and BMI. Based on the results
      of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and hyperinsulinemic-glucose clamp, one group will
      be obese and insulin resistant (OIR) and one will be obese and insulin sensitive (OIS).
      Subjects will undergo measurement of body fat and fat distribution, oral glucose tolerance,
      in vivo insulin sensitivity, percutaneous needle biopsies of subcutaneous abdominal and
      gluteal fat and in vivo measurement of SVC and adipocyte turnover using the D2O DNA labeling
      technique. Adipocyte size and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines
      will be compared in the two groups. Primary cultures of preadipocytes will be derived from
      subjects and proliferation and differentiation measured in vitro and compared to in vivo
      measures.

      Measurement of adipocyte proliferation and differentiation in vivo: The stable isotope
      technique of Hellerstein et al. for the measurement of slowly dividing cells is based on the
      incorporation of deuterium oxide (D2O) into DNA. This method has been used to estimate rates
      of turnover of adipocytes and stromal vascular cells in healthy normal volunteers. It has
      not, to date, been employed to compare groups of subjects who may differ in their adipogenic
      propensity. A major objective of the study, therefore, is to evaluate the utility of this
      approach for quantifying in vivo differences in adipocyte and SVC turnover between groups
      that vary by insulin sensitivity and to compare the in vivo measures obtained using this
      technique with in vitro measures of adipogenesis.
