      single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study. Five
      cohorts of 10 subjects will be dosed in ascending order, beginning with a single dose of 50
      mg of ARN-6039. Subsequent cohorts will be administered single doses of 100 mg, 150 mg, 200
      mg, or 300 mg. Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated prior to each
      dose escalation using the assessment of all available safety and pharmacokinetic data.

      In Cohorts 1 through 4, subjects will receive a single dose of ARN-6039 or matching placebo
      under fasted conditions. In Cohort 5, subjects will be administered a single dose of ARN-6039
      or a single dose of matching placebo under fasted conditions in Period 1 and under fed
      conditions in Period 2 with a minimum 5-day washout period between each dose.

      To support the administration of ARN-6039 in humans, preclinical toxicology studies performed
      in rats and dogs demonstrated tolerability exceeding the intended therapeutic dose. In
      addition, the safety and efficacy of ARN-6039 has been demonstrated in model systems and is
      anticipated to be well tolerated in humans. This study will be the first administration of
      ARN-6039 in human subjects.
