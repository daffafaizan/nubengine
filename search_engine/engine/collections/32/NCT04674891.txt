      among which neck pain is the most common problem reported to physicians, orthopedics and
      physical therapists. Even before reporting to clinics there is long history of using over the
      counter pain killers. Pain avoidance behaviors let the cervical spine stiff so much that a
      clinician help is sought. There is huge literature regarding the management of chronic neck
      pain and yet after the decades of research there are gaps in treatment options. In modern age
      of health care, it is common goal of every healthcare to make patient self-sufficient as
      early as possible. The self-care models have tremendous advantages. The current study has
      compared the effects of cervical stabilization exercises and isometric exercises. The current
      study was novel in a way that there is limited literature about treating Chronic Neck Pain
      Patients with effects of physiotherapy on respiratory strength in improving forward head
      posture. All the methods were employed to see if they improve ranges along with accompanying
      pain and disability.
