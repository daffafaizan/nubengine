      levels of β2-microspheres before operation. Also, the patients were interviewed one day
      before the surgery and on postoperative days 1-3 by the Confusion Assessment Method and then
      divided them into POD and non-POD groups. The aim of the present study was to assess whether
      higher levels of β2-microspheres could predict the occurrence of POD.
