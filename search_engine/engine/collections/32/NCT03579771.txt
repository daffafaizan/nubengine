    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To assess the feasibility of therapeutic approach that includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      including gemcitabine hydrochloride (gemcitabine), cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel for
      high-risk but technically resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and is completed with
      surgical resection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the radiological response rate to neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy according to
      the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

      II. To determine the R0 resection rate.

      III. To determine patient recurrence-free survival (RFS).

      IV. To identify patient overall survival (OS) rate.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive nab-paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, cisplatin IV over 60
      minutes, and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Participants with stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) then
      undergo standard of care hepatectomy with portal lymphadenectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 4 months for 3 years.
