    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of
      intrathecal topotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, in patients with meningeal malignancies
      refractory to conventional therapy (radiation therapy and chemotherapy). A safe dose of
      topotecan that can be recommended for intrathecal administration in subsequent phase II
      studies will be established in a limited dosage escalation schedule. The CSF pharmacokinetics
      of intrathecal topotecan will also be studied. Topotecan will be administered intrathecally
      on a bi-weekly basis for four to six weeks, followed by weekly administration for 1 month,
      twice monthly administration for four months and then monthly IT administration.
