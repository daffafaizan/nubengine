      joint disease of the hip. In this surgery, the entire joint is replaced by inserting an
      acetabular component into the pelvis, a femoral stem down the thigh bone (which has a ball on
      it to articulate in the acetabulum). However for the younger patient, long-term fixation and
      the prospect of multiple revisions remain a notable concern. Long-term results of THA in this
      patient population have been disappointing. Studies cite failure rates of 21% to 33% at less
      than 10 years follow up. The Conserve Plus Hip System differs from total hip arthroplasty as
      it uses less bone stock from the femoral bone. The prosthesis is designed so that the head of
      the femoral bone is resurfaced rather than replaced. Consequently, bone stock of the femur is
      conserved. The bone conserving nature of this implant allows the surgeon to convert to a
      total hip arthroplasty with ease should a time arise when the patient requires revision
      arthroplasty. The Conserve Plus Hip System is also different from the THA as the bearing
      surface is metal on metal, rather than the conventional metal on polyethylene. This metal on
      metal bearing surface provides lower wear. Theoretically, this type of hip replacement may be
      a viable alternative to THA for the younger patient.
