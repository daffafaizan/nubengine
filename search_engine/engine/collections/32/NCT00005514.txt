      In the first five years of the study analyses were performed on food consumption data
      collected through semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires at baseline and during
      follow-up in the Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts.
      Dietary patterns were derived from the food consumption data using factor analysis, cluster
      analysis, and dietary indexes (based on prevailing dietary recommendations). In addition,
      using existing datasets from dietary validation studies in sub-samples of the two cohorts,
      the reproducibility and validity of dietary patterns defined by factor/cluster analysis and
      dietary indexes were evaluated. Further, using prospectively collected and stored bloods in
      the NHS (n-32,826) during 1989-1990 and the HPFS (n-18,000) during 1993-1994, the
      investigators examined whether observed associations between dietary patterns and CHD were
      explained by (or mediated through) plasma biochemical measurements (including serum lipids,
      thrombotic factors, antioxidants, fasting insulin, and homocysteine levels) in a nested
      case-control design; and they assessed prospectively the relationship between dietary
      patterns and these biomarkers in the control samples.

      The study was renewed in 2005 to apply novel statistical methods (such as confirmatory factor
      analysis and structural equation modeling) to validate various dietary patterns and examine
      their associations with risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and total mortality
      in two large ongoing cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (n=121,700) and Health
      Professionals' Follow-up Study (n=51,529). In addition to evaluating prevailing dietary
      recommendations, the study will also examine the role of the Mediterranean-type dietary
      pattern, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, and the
      Atkins-type diet in predicting health outcomes. Using repeated measurements of diet, the
      study will examine the impact of changes in eating patterns and diet quality over time on
      subsequent risk of diabetes, CVD, and total mortality. In addition, it will examine
      relationships between major dietary patterns and novel plasma biomarkers of inflammation and
      endothelial function and whether such relationships are mediated through obesity. Finally,
      the study will test interactions between dietary patterns and individual single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of several promising candidate genes in the inflammation
      and endothelial dysfunction pathway on risk of coronary heart disease, including PPARa,
      PPARy, Adiponectin (AdipoQ), PON1, IL-6, TNF-a, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-Selectin, NOS3, ACE gene,
      and angiotensinogen (ANG) genes.
