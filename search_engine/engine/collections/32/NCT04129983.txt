      groups. They underwent hearing tests, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, and routine
      hospital admissions. One group was given prednisone for 1 mg / kg body weight × 7 days +
      somatosensory stimulation × 30 days, the other group was given prednisone for 1 mg / kg body
      weight × 7 days + hyperbaric oxygen × 15 days, and repeated electrical audiometry every week.
      One month and three months after the experiment, repeated audiometry.
