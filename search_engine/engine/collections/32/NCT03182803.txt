      safety of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing mesothelin-CAR-T (mesoCAR-T) for patients
      with mesothelin positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors. MesoCAR-T
      can specificly and effectively kill the mesothelin positive cancer cells, CTLA-4 and PD-1
      antibodies are secreted from the CAR-T cells could improve immunosuppression
      microenvironment, new CAR-T cells contain the advantages of CAR-T and immune checkpoint
      inhibitor, which is a promising therapeutic method for advanced solid tumors.

      The new CAR-T therapy is applied to clinical practice as bellow. T cells are prepared from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells by leukapheresis, then activated and engineered to CTLA-4
      and PD-1 antibodies expressing and chimeric antigen receptor targeting mesothelin. Cells are
      proliferated in culture and returned to the patients by venous transfusion. A total of 40
      patients may be enrolled in the study. The total duration of the study is expected to be
      approximately 24 months.
