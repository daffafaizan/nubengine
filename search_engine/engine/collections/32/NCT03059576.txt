      environmental factors to behavior and other phenotypes. These models are most often used to
      separate genetic from environmental causes in the family resemblance methodology. These
      models based on twins have been previously carried out in chronobiology. In fact, during the
      years 1993 and 1994, Paul Linkowski et al., performed two relevant studies on the circadian
      system to analyze the relative contributions of hereditary and/or environmental factors of
      cortisol secretion and blood pressure, respectively, and concluded that genetic factors
      control some of the characteristics of cortisol and diastolic blood pressure circadian
      rhythmicity. The heritability of other circadian markers has also demonstrated such as
      morningness- eveningness (44%), sleep-related variables have also pointed to a relevant role
      of genetics with heritability estimates of sleep duration between 17% and 55%. However, to
      the investigators knowledge, the heritability of other relevant chronobiological markers,
      measured in free living conditions such as body temperature, actigraphy and sleep has not
      been studied.

      These goals will be achieved through a specific approach:

        -  Observational (Aim 1): To study the potential effect of the genetic and environmental
           factor in the circadian system health in order to improve the chronobiological therapies
           in the clinical practice (n=106).
