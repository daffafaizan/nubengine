      be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy according to the standard clinical protocol of
      the NKI-AVL. During treatment, the biological behaviour of the tumour will be monitored with
      serial quantitative FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/CT scans. From these images, the time during
      treatment where a 50% reduction in FDG uptake relative to day 1 is reached (T50) will be
      derived. The T50 of progression-free surviving patients will be compared with that of
      relapsed or deceased patients, in order to find a value that predicts early treatment
      failure. An additional FDG PET/CT scan at the same day as regular follow up CT scan will be
      made, two months after treatment, to have a baseline after treatment for follow up.
