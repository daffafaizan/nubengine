      epidural injection prior to wound closure of either Ropivaciane® or saline.All pre-surgical
      activities and anesthesia will proceed as usual, with the addition of a single epidural
      injection immediately prior to wound closure 2 levels, or 10cm above the operated spinal
      level. Experimental groups will receive 0.2% Ropivaciane® (10 ml; dose shown to be effective
      without transient weakness), 9 and the control group will receive 0.9% saline solution (10
      ml). Accurate placement into the space will be verified by the injection of contrast medium
      (iohexol, 180 mgl/ml) under fluoroscopic guidance. Epidural solutions will be prepared prior
      to surgery by pharmacy and coded; surgeons will administer according to the patient's code
      maintaining the double-blind procedure. It is important to note that treatment as usual
      differs between open and MIS cohorts. The question of interest is whether the addition of the
      epidural analgesic to current practices for each surgery type results in increased positive
      outcomes, whether this is due to synergistic effects or not. Following operative treatment,
      Foley Urinary catheter will be removed 24 hours post-operatively, unless otherwise clinically
      indicated.
