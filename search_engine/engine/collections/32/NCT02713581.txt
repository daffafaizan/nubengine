      activation profiles as a function of laboratory thrombophilia parameters. Essentially: Is
      IgG-dependent cell activation associated with the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies
      (or their subtypes?), or do these profiles indicate something beyond the nosology of
      anti-phospholipid syndrome?
