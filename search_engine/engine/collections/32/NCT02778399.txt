    
      The study is a prospective, dose-finding, randomized, parallel group, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled phase 2b study investigating the efficacy and safety of OBE2109 in the
      treatment of 330 women with moderate-to-severe endometriosis associated pain.

      Subject will be randomized to one of 6 treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio (1 placebo
      group, 5 dose groups with different dosage/regimen).

      Eligible subjects will be offered the opportunity to continue treatment with OBE2109 in an
      extension phase. Subjects who do not continue in the extension will enter the treatment-free
      follow-up phase of the study.
