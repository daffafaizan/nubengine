      associated with significant healthcare and patient costs, and increased patient morbidity and
      mortality.

      Specialist post operative dressings with negative pressure wound therapy are available, and
      the WHO do recommended for use in high risk wounds, taking resources into account. However no
      further recommendations are available.

      This study will explore the rate of post-operative wound infections in adult patients
      undergoing open abdominal surgery on the bowel, and compare the rate of wound infections in
      these patients in relation to three different dressing types used after their operation. The
      study aims to determine if any of the dressings used within the study are associated with
      lower post-operative wound infection rates, and compare the overall costs of using each
      dressing type, including both direct healthcare costs and societal costs. Finally, it will
      evaluate participant's quality of life outcomes after open abdominal surgery, specifically
      relating to their wound.
