      effects on the patients perceived function and quality of life both pre- and
      post-operatively. Patients report deterioration during this long wait, commonly over 6 months
      in Ontario. The proposed study intends to evaluate the impact of two different educational
      methods for patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. This prospective randomized clinical
      trial will assign patients to two different educational groups: one of solely standard care,
      and the other of standard care with the addition of presentation of a 10 minute educational
      video informing spine patients about their condition, treatment options, prioritization on
      the wait list and post-operative care. Outcome measures will be assessed through four
      different questionnaires concerning specific conditions, pain, quality of life, etc., both
      pre-operatively and post-operatively. Providing patients with this accurate information may
      coincide with positive outcome measures. The more successful educational program, as found by
      this study, may then be provided to all spine patients. This educational program may bring
      about an increase in overall well-being of spine patients by having a positive impact on the
      quality of life both pre- and post-operatively.
