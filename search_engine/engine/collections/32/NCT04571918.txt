      responsible for the clinical testing and the patient are both blinded. The surgeon knows
      which group the patient is in but is not responsible for any of the testing. We will
      randomize with envelopes perioperatively. The participants are randomized in hence "ballon"
      or "not ballon". In advance of the randomization the surgeon will evaluate if the patient is
      candidate for partial suture before randomization. We plan to stratify the patients with
      partial suture to ensure homogeneity between the groups.

      The operation will start with arthroscopic debridement and biceps tenotomy in both groups.
      The patients are thereby evaluated for partial suture and randomized. The insertion of the
      subacromial spacer is done at the end of the operation for those patients randomized to the
      group "balloon". Peroperatively the surgeon will classify the grade of osteoarthritis with
      Outerbridge classification and the state of the rotator cuff and the long head of the biceps
      tendon.

      Postoperative mobilization will be the following:

        -  0-2 weeks: Immobilization in a sling. The participant is advised to do simple exercises
           for shoulder mobilization. Restriction of movement above shoulder level.

        -  2-6 weeks: Free mobilization. Advised to avoid heavy lifting.

        -  6-12 weeks: Work on increasing range of motion, gradually introduce weight lifting.
