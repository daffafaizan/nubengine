      with ASD. The data for pharmacologic treatment of repetitive behaviours in this disorder has
      also become difficult to interpret given that the last two large multisite trials of
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in autism are reported to be negative for the
      treatment of repetitive behaviours. Only the associated symptom of irritability has 2 drugs
      with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications, whereas no systematic data exists on the
      pharmacologic treatment of anxiety in ASD, and response to rates to stimulants for
      hyperactivity are lower than what is seen in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
      In addition, there are no biological markers of treatment response identified in this
      population at this point. This study will examine the potential efficacy and safety of
      arbaclofen for social function, and will explore biological markers of safety and treatment
      response.
