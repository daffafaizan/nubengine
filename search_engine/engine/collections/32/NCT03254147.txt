      initiating an oral anticoagulant for NVAF, the incidence rates of emergency surgery, major
      bleeding due to trauma, and major bleeding due to fracture, overall and stratified by age
      (<64, 65-74, >75). The secondary objective is to estimate the overall and age stratified
      incidence of cardiac tamponade and peri-cardiocentesis.
