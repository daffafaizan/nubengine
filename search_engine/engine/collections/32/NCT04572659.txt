      assisted reproduction treatment (artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization). Couples
      were assigned to one of three study groups: group intervention, couple intervention or no
      intervention (control group). Patients in the first group (group intervention) attended six
      group psychotherapy sessions. Patients in the second group attended six psychotherapy
      sessions (particular sessions in this case). The patients in the third group received no
      psycho-social intervention. Assignation to each group was not randomized, it depended on
      scheduling availability of the patients. Patients attended one session every week or 15 days.
      Each session lasted 90 minutes. Sessions were designed to minimize the possible negative
      psycho -social impact of infertility and its treatment. Different aspects were approached in
      these sessions including emotion expression, social coping, communication skills, emotion
      management in different social situations, identification of dysfunctional thoughts,
      cognitive restructuring, and cognitive distortions. The outcomes measured were: anxiety,
      depression, life quality, coping and perceived social support. These variables were assessed
      before ART, after ART and in a follow-up performed six months after ART. Psychological
      variables were assessed using different well-recognized inventories.
