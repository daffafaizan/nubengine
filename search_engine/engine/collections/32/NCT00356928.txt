        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of allogeneic CD8-positive T-cell-depleted,
           haploidentical donor lymphocytes when given after cyclophosphamide in patients with
           myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide on days 1 and 2. Patients then undergo infusion of
      allogeneic T-cell depleted donor lymphocytes on day 3.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of CD8-positive T-cell-depleted haploidentical
      donor lymphocytes until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
