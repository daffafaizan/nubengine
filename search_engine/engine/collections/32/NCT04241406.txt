      cord stimulation (tSCS) can evoque spinal reflex activity. The activation of propioceptive
      afferent would then activated motoneurons innervated at the same metameric and adjacent
      levels. The possibility of activating neural networks with non-invasive stimulation method
      opens a therapeutic window for the treatment of different neurological disorders. So the
      purpose of this study is quantify the modulation of the excitability of alpha motor neurone
      when the application of the current is in the central nervous system compared with a sham
      group.
