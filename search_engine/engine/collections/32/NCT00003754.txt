      in patients with recurrent or refractory pediatric malignancies.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide 4 times daily. Cyclophosphamide is administered IV
      over 1 hour once every 4 weeks, beginning on the same day as thalidomide. Treatment continues
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tumor response is assessed
      every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-80 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
