      parenting effectiveness and child coping-competence in preschoolers as a means of reducing
      risk of child maltreatment (and related adverse developmental outcomes). Purdue University
      will examine the impact of partnership (organizational involvement in recruitment and
      retention), cash incentives, and a motivational goal setting component on participation and
      engagement in the Parenting Our Children to Excellence program, a group intervention for
      parents and caregivers of preschool children.
