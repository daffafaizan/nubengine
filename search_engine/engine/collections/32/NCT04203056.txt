    
      This is a single-site 12-month open-label randomized study comparing the efficacy of the
      FDA-approved long-acting formulation of aripiprazole lauroxil to the efficacy of oral
      aripiprazole among patients with a recent onset of schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or
      schizoaffective (depressed) disorder. All assessments and treatment will take place at the
      UCLA Aftercare Research Program (300 UCLA Medical Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095), which is a
      program that specializes in the treatment and study of individuals with a recent onset of
      schizophrenia. The primary goal is to evaluate the efficacy of aripiprazole lauroxil compared
      to oral aripiprazole in preventing the re-emergence of psychotic symptoms in patients with a
      recent onset of schizophrenia. All patients on oral medications will, at least initially, be
      treated with oral aripiprazole.
