      long-term biologic outcomes, soft tissue thickness is a critical component to esthetic dental
      implant restorations. While the subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG) has been
      recognized as the gold standard for gingival augmentation, several studies have reported
      acellular dermal matrix (ADM) may produce similar outcomes. Healthy patients with a thin
      biotype were selected on the basis of an eligibility criteria and randomized to the control
      (sCTG) or test (ADM) group. Measurements were completed by a masked examiner at baseline and
      at implant uncovering. Patient reported outcomes were recorded, as well. A power analysis
      suggested 20 subjects be recruited. The gain in PMT at 1mm, 3mm and 5mm from the expected CEJ
      and recipient site wound dehiscence were measured and recorded in both groups at different
      time points by a calibrated, masked examiner. Patient-related outcome measures (PROMs), such
      as pain and level of satisfaction with final outcome, were also recorded for all study
      participants.
