      oocytes. Capacitation can be measured, but the available technics are expensive, inaccurate
      and complex. A new method to evaluate sperm capacitation was developed in Bar Ilan
      University, Israel. We intend to measure the capacitation of semen that is used for
      fertilizing human oocytes in patients treated at the IVF unit at Assaf Harofeh Medical
      Center.By this, to evaluate the potential of the new method to predict human oocyte
      fertilization.If the method will be found valuable, it will enable to develop new
      drugs/methods that may improve sperm capacitation and by this to improve oocyte fertilization
      leading to more embryos, pregnancies and deliveries.
