      the sinonasal tract, oral mucosa, skin, musculoskeletal system, pulmonary parenchyma, or
      other disease features that warranted an administration of 20 mg/day or more within the last
      12 months. At the time of enrollment, participants will need to be taking prednisone at a
      dose of ≥ 5mg/day and ≤ 20 mg/day. All enrolled participants will be instructed to reduce the
      daily dose of prednisone according to their treating physician. Once participants reach a
      prednisone dose of 5mg/day, they will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to continue prednisone at
      5 mg/day or to taper prednisone to 0 mg/day. Participants will be followed for approximately
      six months from reaching a prednisone dose of 5 mg/day.

      The primary study outcome is the proportion of participants who increase prednisone for
      disease relapse within 6 months of randomization. Participant data collected via this study
      will be combined with that from a complementary study conducted at Vasculitis Clinical
      Research Consortium (VCRC) clinical centers.
