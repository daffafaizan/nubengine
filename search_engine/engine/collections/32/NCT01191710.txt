      GnRH analogues, the current study aimed to explore whether progesterone control in the late
      follicular phase differs when GnRH-agonist is used as compared to GnRH-antagonist and if so
      to what extend does the progesterone rise have an impact on the probability of achieving a
      pregnancy.
