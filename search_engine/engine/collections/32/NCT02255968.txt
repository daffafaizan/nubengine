      EDP-788 will be increased with each successive cohort. In addition, a 4th cohort may be
      enrolled, depending on clinical findings (tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics) observed in
      the first 3 cohorts. In each cohort, 8 subjects will receive a q12h oral dose regimen of
      EDP-788 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects). All subjects receive multiple doses of study
      drug (EDP-788 or placebo).
