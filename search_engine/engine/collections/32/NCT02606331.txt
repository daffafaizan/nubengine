      adults, to avoid treatment or seek alternative options such as implants or veneers with less
      than optimal results.

      Therefore, the search for methods that decrease the treatment duration is a main challenge in
      orthodontic research. Decreased duration of therapy seems to be related not only to better
      patient compliance, but also to reduced treatment -related root resorption , better
      periodontal health and lower risk of caries and white spots. Adjunct to the proper selection
      of brackets, wires, biomechanic systems, force levels, and anchorage systems, an array of
      novel techniques has been introduced to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. These
      techniques can be briefly categorized as surgical and non-surgical. However The surgical
      approach is the most clinically used and most tested with known predictions and stable
      results. The invasiveness of surgical procedures, requiring full mucoperiosteal flaps, might
      have been a drawback for their widespread acceptance among orthodontists and patients.
      Therefore, more conservative flapless corticotomy techniques have recently been proposed.
      Although various techniques of flapless corticotomy have been reported to be successful in
      practice, scientific evidence for their effectiveness so far has been limited to case series
      and a handful of clinical trials, generally with small groups. Therefore further controlled
      prospective studies are needed to study the effectiveness of flapless corticotomy in
      accelerating orthodontic tooth movement .
