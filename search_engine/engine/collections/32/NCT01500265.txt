    
      260 naive untreated patients, 220 patients treated with TDF and 220 patients treated with ETV
      and consecutively recruited in this interventional study, will have at baseline and every
      three months, a determination of phosphorus, creatinine, uric acid in plasma and urine
      samples for determination of TMPi / GFR and FEUA, and an evaluation of urinary calcium level.
      Depending on local opportunities, every six months, a urine sample will be stored in a
      declared biological collection to perform Î²2-microglobuline and cystatin dosage. A 25-OHD3
      and PTH dosage will be conducted annually. A sample of genomic DNA will be collected after
      informed consent of the patient from a saliva sample (Saliva autocollection kits) in order to
      investigate genetic polymorphism in transporters responsible for the renal elimination of TDF
      and ETV. A serum sample will be stored at baseline, at one year and at endpoint for the
      retrospective dosage of bone markers (bone PAlk, PINP and CTX).
