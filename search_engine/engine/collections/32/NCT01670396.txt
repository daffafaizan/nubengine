      stents, the restenosis rate is still high in the high-risk group. G protein plays important
      roles in the signal transduction leading to vascular smooth muscle proliferation. The initial
      and subsequent studies suggest that the T allele of C825T polymorphism is associated with
      enhanced transmembrane signaling via Gi proteins.
