      placebo for the prevention of relapse to smoking in recently abstinent smokers. Subjects who
      meet eligibility criteria will enter a 4-week open label treatment period during which they
      will receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Subjects who have achieved at least one week
      of abstinence during the last week of an open label treatment period will be randomized to
      either GSK598809 or placebo in the double-blind treatment period and followed for another 12
      weeks.
