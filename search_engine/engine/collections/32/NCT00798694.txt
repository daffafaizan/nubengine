      will be using Xalatan for at least one month before enrollment. Both groups will be using one
      drop at bedtime of Xalatan in the right eye and one drop at bedtime of Travatan Z in the left
      eye. Both of these drops are presently on the market and approved by the FDA for treatment of
      lowering eye pressure. Because this study will be masked, the examining clinician will not
      know what study drop each patient has been using.
