      daily with placebo in the prevention of depression associated with mild/moderate traumatic
      brain injury and to enhance cognitive function. Research exploring the use of selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of post-traumatic depression generally
      validates this approach (Horsfield et al., 2002). However, the literature suggests that
      serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine may be more effective in the
      treatment of depression.
