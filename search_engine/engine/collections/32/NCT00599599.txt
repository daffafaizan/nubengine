      weekly symptom monitoring (described below) and will complete measures of PTSD, adherence,
      and QOL pre- and post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Secondary
      analyses will examine the impact of the intervention on disorders commonly comorbid with PTSD
      (i.e., anxiety, mood, and substance abuse/dependence disorders).
