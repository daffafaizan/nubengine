      only about half of patients. In this prospective study, the investigators prospectively
      combined low dose ruxolitinib and 1mg/kg methylprednisolone in the initial treatment of acute
      GVHD. In order to effectively control GVHD without exposing acute GVHD patients to more
      intense and prolonged immunosuppression, we used ruxolitinib (20mg/day, 10mg/day, 5mg/day,
      2.5mg/day) combined with 1mg/kg methylprednisolone. To ally steroid-related complications, we
      decreased steroid exposure time (39 days) and cumulative methylprednisolone doses (15.4
      mg/kg) to spare the associated toxicity of glucocorticoid therapy.
