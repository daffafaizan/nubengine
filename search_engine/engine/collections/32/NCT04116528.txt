      demonstrate significantly greater anti-suicidal effects beginning at day 7 and maintained for
      the entire four weeks of the study as well as longer times to recurrence than will those who
      receive ketamine followed by placebo. As secondary analyses, the investigators will test
      whether there is a relationship of improvement in sleep and pain to change in suicide
      ratings.

      Aim 2: To assess the potential role played by the opioid properties of a single infusion of
      ketamine, investigators will for the ketamine portion determine ketamine and metabolite blood
      levels during and after the infusion as well as pupillary changes and correlate them to
      anti-suicidal response at Day 1. Investigators will also collect blood to determine
      buprenorphine blood levels, prolactin as well as collecting data on pupillary changes and
      then assess for potential relationships with anti-suicidal response.
