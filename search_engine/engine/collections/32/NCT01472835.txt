      randomized in a crossover fashion to receive diagnostic nerve blocks either with or without
      intravenous sedation. Among those who obtain some benefit and return for a 2nd block, this
      2nd procedure will be done with sedation if the first was done without sedation, and vice
      versa. Midazolam and fentanyl will be used for intravenous sedation, titrated to anxiolysis
      and analgesia. Pain scores (0-10 numerical rating scale, or NRS) and an activity log will be
      recorded over the 8-hours following the blocks via a pain diary. The first follow-up visit
      will be 4 weeks after the procedure. Patients who obtain some benefit but continue to report
      significant pain or who might otherwise benefit from a repeat procedure will have this second
      procedure performed with sedation if no sedation was given for the first procedure, and
      without sedation if sedation was administered for the first procedure. The post-procedure
      pain data will be recorded in the same fashion as the initial nerve block. The second
      follow-up visit will be 4 weeks after the 2nd block.
