      every year are suffering from an acute exacerbation of a chronic, recurrent headache
      disorder. The role of the ED in treating these patients has been ill-defined. Often emergency
      physicians will treat the acute exacerbation and will not attend to the natural history of
      the disease. However, about two thirds of primary headache patients will suffer a recurrent
      headache in the 24 hours after discharge from the ED. And, many patients will continue to
      suffer recurrent headaches for months after their ED discharge.

      The purpose of this study is to learn how often headaches recur and to try to find a way to
      predict who will have a recurrent headache after ED discharge.

      After standard ED treatment for headache, participants in the study will be asked to answer
      questions about prior headaches and medical history, and some census-like questions about
      race/ethnicity, salary, and education via a 20-minute interview with a research associate.
      The researchers will follow-up with 10-minute telephone calls to each participant's home in
      24 hours and in 3 months with additional questions. Total length of time for study
      participation is approximately 40 minutes.
