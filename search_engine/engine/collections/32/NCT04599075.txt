      birth. Some providers are comfortable continuing patients on their subcutaneous insulin pump
      during labor while others transition these patients to intravenous insulin infusions.
      Previous literature has retrospectively shown this to be both a feasible and safe option.

      The investigators aim to compare subcutaneous insulin pump versus intravenous insulin
      infusion with regard to obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
