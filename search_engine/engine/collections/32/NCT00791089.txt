      therapy often is ineffective to eliminate recurrent episodes of AF. In recent years
      radiofrequency catheter ablation has emerged as a highly effective treatment strategy in
      patients with paroxysmal and chronic AF.6, 7 However, AF may recur within days to weeks after
      a successful ablation procedure in up to 50% of the patients, probably because of an
      inflammatory response to thermal injury caused by radiofrequency energy application. These
      early recurrences of AF after ablation do not necessarily predict long-term clinical outcome
      and 30-50% of patients who develop early recurrences ultimately remain in sinus rhythm
      without the need for additional ablation.8 However, early recurrences of AF may be associated
      with significant morbidity due to troubling symptoms of rapid ventricular rates, multiple
      hospital visits and cardioversions, need for antiarrhythmic drug therapy and prolongation in
      duration of anticoagulant therapy. It is also possible that if early recurrences of AF after
      ablation can be avoided, the probability of remaining in sinus rhythm during long-term
      follow-up may be higher, as maintenance of sinus rhythm early-on may facilitate reverse left
      atrial remodeling. A similar phenomenon may occur in post-operative AF, that develops in ~30%
      of patients who undergo cardiac surgery. Post-operative AF is often transient and usually
      resolves within 3 months after the surgery. Perioperative treatment with omega-3 fatty acids
      has been reported to decrease the incidence of postoperative AF after coronary artery by-pass
      surgery.4 Because the pathogenetic factors that play a role in postoperative AF and early
      recurrences of AF after radiofrequency catheter ablation may be similar, it is plausible that
      treatment with omega-3 fatty acids before and after ablation will be associated with a
      reduction in the incidence of early recurrences of AF.
