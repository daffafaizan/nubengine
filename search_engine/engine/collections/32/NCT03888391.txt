    
      Children, ages 8-12 years, participated in a 5 week double-blind, sham-controlled study of
      active Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (TNS). Participants randomized to sham in the
      double-blind, were then invited into a 4-week open TNS trial. Participants who met positive
      response criteria to active TNS, either during the original double-blind study or the
      open-treatment followup, were invited to continue their TNS treatment in a 12-month open
      extension phase.

      Participants who continued in the 12-month extension returned for study visits every 3 months
      to assess ongoing response and safety/tolerability data. Unless otherwise noted, baseline
      line assessments in the 12-month extension are taken from the final visit of the preceding
      active treatment trial, i.e. the visit at which positive response criteria were met.
