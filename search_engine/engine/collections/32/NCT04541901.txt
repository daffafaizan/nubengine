      movement patterns at rest and after a fatigue protocol by means of inertial sensors. The
      participants will be assessed regarding their perceptions by the Swimmer's Perception of
      Effort Questionnaire (SPEQ), muscle stiffness by a myotonometer, skin temperature by a
      thermographic infrared camera and coordination by the Coordination Index and Continuous
      Relative Phase (CRP). Then, the athletes will perform the fatigue protocol again followed by
      five interventions in a crossover design separated by 24hr: i) superficial massage, ii) deep
      massage iii) cold-water immersion iv) immersion in thermoneutral water and v) control (no
      intervention). All procedures will be performed for an experimental task of shoulder
      elevation and the sport-specific gesture (front crawl simulation in swim bench). The
      statistical analysis will be conducted in SPSS software. To analyze fractal properties of
      time series the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) will be used where (α) varies from 0,5
      to 1,5, interpreted as random series and Brownian noise, respectively. To compared pre and
      post assessments from initial testing the paired t test will be used. To compare perceptions,
      muscle stiffness and temperature between groups after fatigue protocol and intervention a
      Mixed ANOVA will be used with Greenhouse-Geisser corrections and Bonferroni post-hoc if
      necessary. Descriptive data will be presented as mean and standard deviations. All analysis
      will assume level of significance of P< 0,05.
