    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if exercise, fasting, or eating prior to
      a molecular breast imaging study will have an effect on the uptake of the radiotracer Tc-99m
      sestamibi in the breast tissue.

      Tc-99m sestamibi is primarily extracted by the liver. Changes in hepatic blood flow may
      therefore influence the amount of radiotracer available for uptake in the breast tissue.
