      patients.Correct and adequate antibiotic coverage is essential but can be complex as a result
      of fluid resuscitation, hypoalbuminemia, organ dysfunction, the application of extracorporeal
      support modalities and the impact of critical illness on pharmacokinetics(PK).Such changes
      will significantly distort the normal anti-biotic PK profile, resulting in drug exposure that
      is markedly different from the 'healthy volunteer.'The apparent volume of distribution is one
      of important PK parameters.Vd determines the loading dose. This review article considers
      these issues in detail, summarizing the key changes in antibiotic Vd in the critically ill,
      and providing general suggestions how to optimization of antibiotic dosing to manage Vd
      challenges.50 patients who receives the theapy of imipenem are included in this study.Whether
      hypoalbuminemia, organ dysfunction, the application of extracorporeal support modalities and
      the impact of critical illness on Vd will be evaluted.
