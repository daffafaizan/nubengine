      testing of NT-proBNP in patients presenting with acute dyspnea to the Emergency Medical
      Service (EMS).Patients will be enrolled in the Emergency Medical Services of participating
      German hospitals (Klinikum Nürnberg, Klinikum Fürth, Universitätsklinikum Jena). To be
      enrolled in the study, each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria and
      none of the exclusion criteria.

      Patients with acute dyspnea randomized to the POCT group will get a NT-proBNP-POCT
      measurement in the EMS. The emergency physician of the EMS will decide to apply predefined
      treatment strategies according to the resulting working hypothesis. Patients with acute
      dyspnea randomized to the standard care group will NOT get NT-proBNP measurement at the
      scene. The emergency physician of the ED will construct the working hypothesis following
      current treatment recommendations. The major focus of the study is to initiate treatment of
      heart failure as early as possible.
