      of life of partially dentate adult patients with a reduced posterior dental arch will be
      satisfied and improved without having the posterior teeth replaced with a removable
      prosthesis, as compared to having the use of such prosthesis.

      Objectives: To conduct a randomized controlled trial amongst partially dentate adult patients
      with a reduced posterior dental arch (3-5 pairs of posterior occluding pairs of teeth) and
      where these patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group would be
      provided with a metal- based removable partial denture (RPDP) to replace the posterior teeth,
      the other will receive no treatment.

      Daily functioning ability and patient satisfaction between the groups (with/without RPDP)
      would then be compared.
