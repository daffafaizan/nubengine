    
      The objective was to determine whether vaginal ovule with tea extract once-daily for 5-7 days
      improves symptoms of intermediate vaginal flora and prevents the development of bacterial
      vaginosis.

      Composite primary endpoint designed as a drop in the Nugent score, vaginal pH, or improvement
      of subjective symptoms was compared between the active and vehicle (polyethylene-glycol) arm
      after 7 days of application and following 7 days after the application.

      Secondary outcome measures were (1) Correction of the vaginal environment (as previously
      defined) 7 days after the completion of the prescribed 7-day regimen (day 14); (2) change in
      each parameter separately; (3) change in individual subjective symptoms, (4) exploratory
      analysis of the microbial environment at each subject visit.

      The study was approved and supervised by the National authority and Ethics committee and
      prospectively registered in the Czech national medical device trial registry RZPRO and the
      European medical device trial registry EUDAMED.
