      The prevalence of physical health problems among patients suffering from psychiatric
      illnesses is above that seen in the average population (1). Cardiovascular diseases (2) and
      metabolic disorders (3;4) are common in persons diagnosed with schizophrenia (5;6). A fact
      that has been known for many years (7), and there has been no decrease in the prevalence of
      physical illness in connection with the decentralization of the psychiatric treatment which
      has taken place in the Western world during the last 30-40 years (8).

      Meta-analyses describe increased physical morbidity among patients with psychiatric diseases
      and increased mortality on account of somatic diseases (7). One of the reasons for the
      increased mortality could be the use of second generation antipsychotics that in some cases
      cause weight gain and metabolic syndrome which is associated with a two to threefold increase
      in cardiovascular mortality and a twofold increase in all-cause mortality (3;9). These
      effects would be expected to contribute to even higher mortality in the following years (10).

      The use of more than one antipsychotic drug, polypharmacy, might also play a role (11;12).
      Psychiatric societies, national and international health authorities advise against the use
      of polypharmacy (13).

      The quality of the general health care in patients with severe mental illness and the
      consensus about the prevention of somatic illness in this group of vulnerable patients need
      to be improved and there is evidence signifying the importance of the situation (14;15).

      We need more knowledge about how to integrate the prevention and care of somatic illness to
      this group of patients with severe psychiatric illness.

      This study investigates ways to improve the physical health of people with a psychiatric
      diagnosis.
