      will be commenced at 375mg daily and increased to 500mg then to 750, and 1000mg daily at
      weekly intervals. After 4 weeks the dose will be increased to 1500mg daily and, after a
      further one month, the study dose of 2000mg daily2 will be instigated. Immediately before
      randomization (to exclude patients unable to tolerate MRI because of claustrophobia), and 6
      and 12 months after commencing treatment participants will undergo MR examination.
