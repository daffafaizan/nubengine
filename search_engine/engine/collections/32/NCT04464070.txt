      humans. Because the levels of PGD2 and its metabolite, PGD-M, are low in human urine, the
      investigators will use the model of niacin-induced flushing which is associated with a
      increased release of PGD2 from skin cells. It has been demonstrated that increased formation
      of PGD2 is associated with increased levels of urinary 11-dehydro-TxB2 in patients with
      mastocytosis.

      In order to test whether niacin-induced biosynthesis of PGD2 is associated with formation of
      11-dehydro-TxB2 the investigators will measure prostaglandin metabolites in blood and urine
      of volunteers receiving niacin. In addition, subjects will be treated with low or high dose
      aspirin prior to niacin to analyze the contribution of cyclooxygenase enzymes to biosynthesis
      of PGD2.

      Arm 1: Subjects will receive 500 mg niacin. The subjects will collect urine (3-10 ml each)
      before niacin and every one-two hours after niacin for 10 h. Subjects will have blood drawn
      (2 teaspoons) before and at 0.5-1 h after niacin.

      Arm 2: Subjects will take 81 mg aspirin (1 tablet of low-dose aspirin) daily for 7 days
      before niacin. Urine collection will be before and after aspirin, before niacin, and then in
      intervals as in arm 1. There will be a blood collection before niacin and 0.5-1 h after
      niacin.

      Arm 3: Subjects will take 325 mg aspirin (1 tablet of regular strength aspirin) daily for 7
      days before niacin. Urine collection will be before and after aspirin, before niacin, and
      then in intervals as in arm 1.

      Arm 4: Subjects will be infused with 10 Î¼g of deuterated PGD2 in a forearm vein over the
      course of 30 min. Subjects will collect a urine sample before and every two hours after
      deuterated PGD2 for 10 h.
