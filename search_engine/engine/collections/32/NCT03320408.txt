      and the evolution of serum levels of proteases and cytokines over time. A repeated measures
      analysis will be done to use all longitudinal data available.

      The Pearl AAA biobank will be established to enable the PARIS study, but also aims to
      facilitate future research. Such future research should fall under the scientific aims of the
      Pearl AAA, which are:

        -  To gain insight in the pathogenesis of AAA

        -  To gain more knowledge in the rupture risk of AAA

        -  To evaluate and potentially improve treatment of AAA

      The 'Parelsnoer Institute' will facilitate the biobank Pearl AAA with certain aspects such
      as, but not limited to the following:

        -  Standardized operating procedures for the collection and storage of the biosamples
           across all participating hospitals

        -  Information architect to establish a data dictionary in which all variables are defined

        -  Standardized procedures for coding of patient data before storage

        -  Standardized digital infrastructure to enhance storage of patient data and imaging data
