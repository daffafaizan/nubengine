    
      This study has two phases: "Discovery" cohort and "Validation" cohort.

      The "Discovery" phase of this study will obtain tissue samples in a retrospective manner. The
      investigators will perform genome-scale DNA Methylation analysis to obtain a panel of
      candidate methylated DNA biomarkers. Twenty archival primary serous epithelial ovarian cancer
      and twenty archival normal ovarian and salpingeal tissues will be identified by running a
      report of diagnosis.

      During the "Validation" phase of this study, blood and tissue samples will be obtained in a
      prospective manner. The patients will be undergoing consultation for undiagnosed pelvic mass
      and are being scheduled for a diagnostic laparoscopic biopsy. At the time of their
      consultation, patients will be recruited and consented for this phase of the study.
