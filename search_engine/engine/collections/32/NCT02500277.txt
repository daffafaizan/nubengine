    
      Consecutive patients with exudative pleural effusions who are planned to undergo semirigid
      thoracoscopy will be enrolled in the study if they satisfy the inclusion criteria. They will
      be randomized in 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization sequence to the following
      groups:

      Group A: Four pleural biopsy specimens obtained using the flexible cryoprobe followed by
      eight pleural biopsy specimens obtained using the flexible thoracoscopic forceps OR Group B:
      The above two procedures will be performed in the reverse order The biopsies will be
      performed from different areas of the involved pleura with the two techniques. Thoracoscopy
      will be performed in the bronchoscopy suite on spontaneously breathing subjects (fasting for
      8 h) under conscious sedation (using midazolam, pentazocine, and tramadol) observing complete
      aseptic precautions.
