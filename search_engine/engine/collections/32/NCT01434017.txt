      nausea and vomiting (PONV). Causes are principally trigeminal nerve stimulation and presence
      of blood in the stomach. Consequences are disagreement, unsatisfactory, delayed discharge,
      and overnight admission in day-cases. More barely, patients may also have suture and
      esophagus rupture, aspiration of gastric contents, dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.

      Several medications may prevent and treat PONV, such as steroids, antidopaminergic drugs and
      serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists. The objective of this study is to compare three prophylactic
      antiemetic treatments:

        -  dexamethasone alone (250 mcg/kg)

        -  dexamethasone (250 mcg/kg) + droperidol (10 mcg/kg)

        -  dexamethasone (250 mcg/kg) + ondansetron (150 mcg/kg).

      The hypothesis is that the combination of dexamethasone and droperidol is as effective as the
      combination of dexamethasone and ondansetron, both of them being more effective than
      dexamethasone alone. Moreover, droperidol is cheaper than ondansetron and may be recommended
      as a first-line treatment.
