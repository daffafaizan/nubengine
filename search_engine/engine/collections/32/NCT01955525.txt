      reduced dramatically. Even so, there remain huge differences in mortality between hospitals.
      For example, up to a third of patients with a heart attack who attend hospitals in England
      are more likely to die than would be expected. That is, the type of treatment and the risk of
      death depend upon where a patient lives and which hospital they attend. In part, the
      variation in death may be due to the services available at the hospital or to factors such as
      socioeconomic deprivation. It may also relate to other factors such as depression, cardiac
      rehabilitation, patient experience of hospital care and health quality of life.

      Using statistical approaches that include measures of quality of life, we propose to examine
      data about heart attacks in England and investigate the 'postcode lottery of care'. This
      research is a long term followup that promote improved patient care. In doing so, different
      factors affecting cardiac rehabilitation will be highlighted and healthcare policy changed so
      that all patients will have an equal chance of surviving a heart attack.
