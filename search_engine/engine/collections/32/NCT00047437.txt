      CHF affects approximately five million Americans and is the number one cause of hospital
      admission in individuals over the age of 65. Although exercise training improves several
      clinical measures in individuals with CHF (e.g., peak VO2, heart rate variability, and plasma
      norepinephrine levels), it is not known whether exercise training reduces mortality in
      individuals with CHF.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This multicenter randomized study will determine if exercise training reduces mortality and
      hospitalization rates in individuals with moderate to severe CHF. The secondary objective is
      to evaluate whether an exercise program designed for individuals with CHF improves quality of
      life and functioning, is economically advantageous, and prevents medical complications.

      Three thousand individuals with moderate to severe CHF will be randomly assigned to either
      standard medical therapy and education, or standard medical therapy and education plus a
      supervised exercise training program. The exercise training will include 36 supervised
      clinic-based training sessions followed by home-based exercise and periodic supervised
      sessions for reinforcement. Participants assigned to the supervised exercise training program
      will use either a treadmill or stationary bicycle, which will be provided for them.

      Recruitment Status: As of November 9, 2006, HF-ACTION has enrolled 2180 subjects and will
      conclude enrollment at the end of February, 2007, with an anticipated enrollment of
      approximately 2300 subjects.
