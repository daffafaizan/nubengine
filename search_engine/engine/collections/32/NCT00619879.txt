    
      Myeloablative hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) remains the standard of
      care for patients requiring HPCT. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the morbidity and
      mortality of myeloablative HPCT at Children's Memorial Hospital. It will also look to
      determine the toxicity of a single conditioning regimen consisting of total body irradiation
      (TBI), etoposide (VP-16), and Cyclophosphamide for patients with transplant eligible lymphoid
      malignant conditions or with transplant eligible myeloid malignant conditions who are
      receiving cord blood units, or to determine the toxicity of a single conditioning regimen
      consisting of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide for patients with transplant eligible myeloid
      malignant conditions who are not receiving cord blood units.
