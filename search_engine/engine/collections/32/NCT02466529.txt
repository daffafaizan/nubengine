      spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 1 in Taiwan. This study will provide further insights into
      the clinical course and pathogenesis of SMA. Several analyses will be conducted regarding
      overall survival, respiratory support, feeding and nutritional support. The following outcome
      variables will be examined: correlation between SMA genotype and phenotype, survival, age of
      onset, and age of confirmed diagnosis, proportion of patients using non-invasive and invasive
      respiratory support, time to first use of respiratory support, proportion of patients on
      permanent ventilation, and time to permanent ventilation, number and average duration of
      hospitalizations, proportion of patients with gastrostomy, number of non-serious and serious
      respiratory infections, trend of growth parameter (e.g., body weight).
