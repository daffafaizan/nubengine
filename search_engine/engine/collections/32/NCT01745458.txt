    
      SB-659032 is a selective and orally active inhibitor of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase
      A2 (Lp-PLA2) that is being developed for the treatment of atherosclerosis. This study is
      designed to assess whether inhibition of plasma Lp-PLA2 activity impacts platelet function as
      assessed by ex vivo platelet aggregation tests and in vivo plasma biomarkers. Blood samples
      for PK analysis and measurement of Lp-PLA2 activity will also be collected. Questionnaires
      will be completed to evaluate the frequency of odorrelated AEs with non-enteric coated
      formulation of SB-659032 relative to placebo. This will be a double blind, repeat dose,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, two period, period balanced, crossover study. There will be a
      minimum of a 21 day washout period between dosing in each period.
