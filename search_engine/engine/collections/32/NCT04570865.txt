      cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors for diabetic patients and reductions in composite primary
      outcomes of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as
      well as reductions in heart failure among patients with diabetes. The 2019 DAPA-HF trial
      studied whether the addition of the SCLT-2 inhibitor dapagliglozin could benefit patients
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), either with or without diabetes.
      Results indicated that that SGLT-2 inhibitors resulted in 4.9% absolute reduction in the
      cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure and a 2.3% absolute reduction in all-cause
      mortality in patients with and without diabetes. Dapagliflozin is FDA approved to reduce the
      risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF with or without Type 2
      diabtes. The mechanisms of cardiovascular benefit remain unclear, however it is likely to be
      driven by a reduction in heart failure death given that rates of myocardial infarction were
      similar between treatment arms.

      The CardioMEMS® system is an implantable device that can measure pulmonary artery systolic,
      diastolic and mean pressure on a daily basis. It has been shown convincingly that monitoring
      the MEMS device results in reduced pulmonary pressures and in turn a reduction in heart
      failure hospitalizations.

      The focus of this study is to investigate the use of Dapagliflozin in HFrEF (NYHA II-IV)
      patients with or without diabetes who have CardioMEMS® implanted to assess the impact on
      pulmonary artery pressure measurements after 12 weeks of therapy.
