    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-875. TAK-875 is being tested to treat
      people who have diabetes. This study will look at glycosylated hemoglobin (blood glucose
      combined with hemoglobin, also known as HbA1c) and blood sugar levels in people who take
      TAK-875 in addition to glimepiride and diet and exercise.

      The study will enroll approximately 260 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK-875 50 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study. This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall
      time to participate in this study is up to 44 weeks and participants will make up to 17
      visits to the clinic.

      Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients
      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.

      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for
      fasiglifam.
