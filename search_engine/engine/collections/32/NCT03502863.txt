      measure refractive value for a patient's eye for the conditions of myopia and astigmatism. It
      is intended for adults aged 22 to 55 years that have no prior correction with up to 3.00
      diopters (D) of myopia and up to 2.00 D of astigmatism, or those with prior correction up to
      10.00 D of myopia and require an over-refraction of no more than 2.75 D.

      The manual manifest refraction is performed by an eyecare specialist using a phoropter.

      The LogMAR Visual Acuity chart is used to measure visual acuity. The manual refraction will
      be used in this study for obtaining the refractive error of each eye.
