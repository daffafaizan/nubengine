      the 27th week following the onset of treatment and to assess the efficacy of the combination
      of Bevacizumab and Erlotinib in prolonging time to progression in subjects with inoperable
      and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Subjects will be treated with a combination of
      rhuMAb VEGF (Bevacizumab), in combination with Erlotinib and TTP will be assessed as per
      RECIST criteria. The disease will be evaluated at base line and every 9 weeks with CT
      scan/MRI and AFP levels. Subjects will be kept on the study till disease progression (as
      defined by RECIST criteria) or death.
