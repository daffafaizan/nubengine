      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single intravitreal injections of RC28-E in the
      patients with AMD.RC28-E is recombinant dual decoy receptor IgG1 Fc-fusion protein,can block
      VEGF-A and FGF-2. In preclinical studies suggested that RC28-E might be more effective in
      inhibiting pathological angiogenesis than other VEGF antagonists on CNV. Every subject will
      only accept one dose. In addition to safety and preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics and
      immunogenicity of RC28-E will be evaluated as well.
