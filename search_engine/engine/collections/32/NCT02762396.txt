    
      NOR-SYS II is as far as possible standardized concerning patients' history, ultrasound
      examination of pre-cerebral and femoral arteries, and standardized examinations performed by
      speech therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.

      The ultrasound-protocol for carotid and femoral arteries is the same as previously performed
      in the NOR-SYS study. The Methods have been published before.
