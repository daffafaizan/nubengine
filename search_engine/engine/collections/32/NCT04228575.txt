      recommend "personalizing" the delivery of ICBT, for example, by increasing the length of time
      therapist support is available or offering booster sessions after treatment has ended. To
      date, in terms of ICBT, there has been limited research on the impact of extending support
      after treatment materials have been delivered or offering a booster session.

      In this trial, the investigators will examine if the efficacy of ICBT is improved by offering
      an extended period of support to clients (from 8 weeks to 12 weeks) or by being offered a
      booster session at 16 weeks after treatment enrollment (yes vs no). Follow-up assessments
      will be conducted at 8, 16 and 26 weeks after treatment enrollment. Primary outcomes are
      reduced anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes include reduced panic, social anxiety,
      trauma, quality of life, disability, work productivity, and healthcare use. The impact of
      these factors on intervention usage (e.g., completion rates, log-ins, emails sent) and
      treatment satisfaction will also be examined.
