      in clinical practice. Functional dyspepsia is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic
      and recurrent gastroduodenal symptoms in the absence of any organic or metabolic disease that
      is likely to explain the symptoms. Functional dyspepsia has a high incidence in the
      population. A recent research showed that FD is present in 11% of the Italian general
      population. It dramatically reduces a patient's quality of life, with an economic impact due
      to frequent clinical consultations, medication, and time off work.

      Regular physical activity and exercise may be a way of life to reduce low levels of
      inflammation throughout the body, thereby reducing the risk of developing chronic diseases.
      Multiple studies have shown that after regular exercise, markers of inflammation and
      oxidative stress are reduced, while markers of inflammation and antioxidants are increased,
      reflecting the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of exercise.

      Rome IV was introduced in 2016. Rome IV introduced more precisely define the minimal
      thresholds for frequency and severity of each individual symptom, primarily for scientific
      purposes, but data still need to be collected to define thresholds based on the frequency
      and/or severity of symptoms that impair quality of life.

      Although some experts recommend exercise as a first-line treatment for functional dyspepsia,
      there is little data on the relationship between exercise and functional dyspepsia, which
      needs to be confirmed by further research. Investigators designed this randomized controlled
      study to assess the effect of exercise on patients with functional dyspepsia based on Rome IV
      criteria.
