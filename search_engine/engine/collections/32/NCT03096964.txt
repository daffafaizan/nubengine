      together with the expansion of Nordic walking (NW) interventions as a training method for the
      elderly, there is a need of preventive studies of RCTs and with methodological good quality
      approach to enable physical education, health and rehabilitation professionals to make
      decisions regarding the type, the volume and the intensity of NW exercise in promoting the
      health of the sedentary elderly. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate, through a
      randomized clinical trial, the effects of eight weeks of NW and FW training on quality of
      life (QoL), static balance, dynamic variability, self-selected treadmill walking speed
      (SSWSTreadmill), Locomotor rehabilitation (LRI) Parameters of Pendular Mechanism (external,
      internal and total mechanical work -Wext, Wint, Wtot, Recovery -R,Cost of Transport - C),
      Electromyographic parameters (Average signal and co-contraction of the AD, TB, VL, BF, AT and
      MG muscles), heart rate of exercise - HRexercise and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE), in
      sedentary elderly. of sedentary elderly. Experimental Design: Randomized Controlled Clinical
      Trial (RCT). Study Site: School of Physical Education, Physiotherapy and Dance (ESEFID),
      Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods: The
      sample comprised 33 sedentary participants randomly divided into two groups (Nordic walking
      group and Free walking group who will perform training for 8 weeks.
