      campus. All of which were randomly divided into two experimental groups RST(n=30), PLT (n=30)
      participated in training for six weeks on alternate days (i.e., three sessions per week) and
      one control group (n=30) did not train. The control group was instructed to maintain regular
      activities and avoid any strenuous physical activity during the study. No significant
      between-group baseline or pre-to-post-training differences in anthropometrics were observed.

      Under the Declaration of Helsinki, participants were informed about the study's possible
      risks and benefits, and all participants have signed informed consent before participation in
      the study. Ethical sub-committee of College of applied medical science, Majmaah, Saudi Arabia
      approved this study (Ethics Number: MUREC-Dec.15/COM-2020 / 13-2).
