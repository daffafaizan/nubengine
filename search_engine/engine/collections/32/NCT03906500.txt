      guided by theory, evidence, and empirical findings to reduce excessive drinking among Danish
      high school students. The study will employ a cluster-randomized controlled study design:
      based on sample size calculations investigators plan to include a random sample of at least
      12 high schools randomly 1:1 allocated to either intervention or control group.

      Timeline: Baseline data will be obtained from the Danish National Youth Study 2019, collected
      in January to March 2019. Delivery of intervention: August 2019 to January 2020. Follow-up
      survey: April to May 2020. Primary outcome measure: mean number of binge-drinking episodes
      within the last 30 days. Secondary outcome measures: weekly alcohol consumption, alcohol
      intake at last school party, alcohol intake at the school during last school party, number of
      students that agrees that they are able to have fun at a party without drinking, and the
      proportion of students that think alcohol plays a too dominant part at the school.
      Implementation will be monitored thorough process evaluation.
