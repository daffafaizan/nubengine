      from the loss of dopaminergic neuronal cells in the cerebral substantia. It is a progressive
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms including gait disturbance and
      balance instability. In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, dysfunction of the
      sensorimotor area of the basal ganglia typically occurs, leading to habitual control hurdles.
      Accordingly, cognitive efforts are required to perform habitual tasks such as walking, and
      the automaticity of walking is reduced. Walking performance in a dual-task condition has been
      used to assess gait automaticity in patients with Parkinson's disease.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method
      that can be used to change cortical activity. Recently, there has been growing attention on
      tDCS as an adjunct tool for rehabilitation. Several tDCS studies in patients with PD have
      reported the positive results of tDCS on motor function. However, few studies have reported
      the therapeutic effect of tDCS on the dual-task performance in PD. In addition, inconsistent
      results have been reported because tDCS protocol has been applied in various way. Therefore,
      this study aims to investigate an optimized stimulation site of tDCS that could improve the
      dual-task performance in patients with PD.
