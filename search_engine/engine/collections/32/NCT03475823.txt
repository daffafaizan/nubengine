      Scardica (SS or 'mountain tea') are likely responsible for the cognitive and mood effects of
      its consumption and this could be underpinned by the ability of such polyphenols to prevent
      monoamine neurotransmitter reuptake and to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF).

      The current randomised, placebo controlled, parallel groups study extends on the
      abovementioned small amount of literature; assessing both cognitive and mood outcomes in a
      sample of older (50-70 yrs) adults, as well as blood pressure (BP) and CBF, in a sub-sample,
      utilizing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The above will be assessed acutely (pre-dose and
      90- and 310-mins post dose) on day 1 and following 28 days consumption of either a placebo
      control, and active control of 240 mg ginkgo biloba, 475 mg SS or 950 mg SS.
