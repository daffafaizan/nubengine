    
      Every week, each patient report her symptoms and answer ten questions on the i-PAD. The
      connected watch reports the performance status (activtiy and time spent in bed or sitting),
      and the falls.

      If nurses or doctors detect any problem, they ask the patient for a telemedicine to try to
      help her. During the same time, nurses or doctors send a message on a secure plateform to the
      local team (nurse, General Practitioner, and pharmacists) and they reserve a place for an
      hospitalization if necessary.
