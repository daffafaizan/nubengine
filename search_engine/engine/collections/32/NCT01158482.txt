      their initial procedure for filter placement/retrieval, we will approach them for consent to
      participate in the study. If patients consent, we will follow clinical data from the
      procedure, and perform prospective follow-up over time to track clinical response and effects
      of the placement or removal procedure.

      Various real-world protocols involving advanced filter removal (including laser-assisted
      filter removal) will be investigated by conducting registry-based clinical trials.

      Participants will only be enrolled if they will be undergoing an IVC (Inferior Vena Cava)
      filter placement/retrieval procedure.
