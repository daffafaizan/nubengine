      may be essential for multiple physiologic functions. In recent years, vitamin D insufficiency
      has been linked to insulin resistance, inflammation, poor psychological health, obesity, type
      2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease - these are also commonly found in women with
      Polycystic Ovary syndrome (PCOS). We believe that vitamin D insufficiency contributes to
      insulin resistance, inflammation, and psychological distress in women with PCOS. These
      adverse effects may ultimately increase the risk for serious long-term complications in PCOS,
      including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The key objectives of this research
      study are to determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on insulin resistance,
      inflammation, mood and overall well-being in women with PCOS.

      The protocol has been modified by adding the following specific aim: To compare vascular
      function in healthy age and BMI similar matched women to PCOS women pre-treatment. Our
      hypothesis is that PCOS women will have greater attenuations in retinal vascular reactivity
      compared to healthy control women, demonstrating poorer endothelial function. We are
      currently recruiting healthy women who are age and BMI similar to the PCOS women and measure
      their retinal vascular reactivity for comparisons to the PCOS women's pre-treatment vascular
      reactivity. These healthy women will only have a baseline visit in which retinal vascular
      reactivity will be measured. They will not be enrolled in the placebo or Vitamin D
      randomization process as described above.
