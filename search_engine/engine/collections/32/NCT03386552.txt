      investigation for their infertility and have at least one year of unsuccessful attempts to
      achieve pregnancy. Following inclusion in the study, patients will be monitored with vaginal
      ultrasound to ensure a leading follicle of at least 18 mm.The subjects with one or two
      follicles ≥18 mm will be given Ovitrelle® (Merck), dose 250 ug (6500 IU) of Human Chorionic
      Gonadotropin (HCG), subcutaneously for ovulation induction. 12-24 h after the HCG injection,
      patients will be randomized and pertubated with either test or control solution.

      12 -24 hours after the pertubation insemination (IUI) will be given to all patients. A blood
      sample is taken 14-17 days after IUI, for analysis of serum HCG level and possible pregnancy.
      In case of positive answer a second confirmatory sample will be obtained 48-72 hours later.
      In case of confirmed elevated HCG, the clinical pregnancy (CP) will be assessed with vaginal
      ultrasound examination 6-7 week after IUI. Baby take home rate data will be collected for
      couples with clinical pregnancy.
