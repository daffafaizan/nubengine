      applicable to patients with chronic back pain. However, its application in women over 65
      years has not been adequately studied.

      Objective: This assessor-blind randomized clinical trial aims to study the effect of a mat
      Pilates exercise program on pain and functional ability of elderly women with chronic
      nonspecific low back pain.

      Methods: 60 non-active elderly women with chronic nonspecific low back pain (duration of
      symptoms more than 12 weeks) are expected to participate in this study. Participants will be
      divided into two groups of 30 people each; one being intervention and one control. The
      intervention group will follow a custom mat Pilates program (twice per week), while the
      control group will not follow any treatment. Primary outcomes will include pain with the
      visual analog scale for pain and functionality with the Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ).
      Secondary outcomes will include the balance with the Berg balance scale and the Timed Up and
      Go test, the number of painkillers administered, and the adherence to the exercise that will
      be evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study and re-evaluated three months after
      the end of the intervention. The treatment period will be 10 weeks.
