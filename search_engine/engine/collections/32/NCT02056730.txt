      the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland causes secondary
      hyperparathyroidism. They also found that high levels of FGF-23 is also a risk factor of
      vascular calcification.

      The Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) is a disorder caused by renal
      impairment cause abnormalities occurring in the body. Can be summarized into three main parts
      as follows : 1) The disorders of minerals and hormones (laboratory abnormalities) such as
      hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism. 2 ) The disorders of bone (bone
      abnormalities) , formerly known as renal osteodystrophy 3) The vascular calcification which
      results happened increase the risk of heart disease and stroke (cardiovascular disease) ,
      broken bones (fractures) and death rate (mortality).

      The secondary hyperparathyroidism. PTH secretion from parathyroid glands are more than normal
      and a major cause of the congestion of phosphate , reduced levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
      [1,25 (OH) 2D] in the blood and a decrease in blood calcium levels decreased calcium levels
      in the blood is low. will result in a calcium (calcium sensing receptor or CaSR) on
      parathyroid glands make parathyroid cell signaling and increased PTH secretion .

      That PTH increased continuously in the long run will cause the destruction of the bone called
      bone decay know "osteitis fibrosa". Some patients with a bone fracture. Important
      characteristics of osteitis fibrosa is an increase of bone destruction(osteoclastic bone
      resorption). In addition, the bone marrow may also be found associated with bone marrow
      fibrosis which causes anemia and did not respond to erythropoietin.
