      by an increasing number of specialists in Aesthetics due to their clinical performance
      regarding volume restoration, and favourable safety profile.

      During January - March 2018, it was performed a review of the scientific literature to find
      similar investigations to determine the minimal clinical significant difference between
      Baseline and a period of 30 days after the end the treatment.

      In a similar dermal filler study, Takanobu Mashiko et al used a 5-grade WSRS and showed that,
      at 4 weeks after treatment, they achieved a 1.7 ± 0.5 (mean ± SD) improvement between those
      visits.

      Considering the exploratory nature of this study and the fact that this investigation is
      first in-human, we choose to take a 0.5 WSRS decrease, at 90 days from the treatment start,
      as a minimal clinically significant difference. The standard deviation considered for the
      sample size calculation was set at 0.8 WSRS points.

      By using a one-sided Wilcoxon Signed-rank test (matched pairs), a significance level of 0.05
      and a power of 0.95 (probability of finding an effect when there is one), we calculated a
      total sample size of 31 subjects.
