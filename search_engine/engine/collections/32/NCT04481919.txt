      first few hours of ED evaluation and utilizing objective measures of diuretic response is
      needed. The investigators believe this would maximize diuretic efficiency, facilitate quicker
      resolution of congestion, avoid WHF and prolonged LOS, and reduce AHF readmissions. Propr
      data suggests low urine sodium predicts length of stay and outcomes after initial diuretic
      dosing in the outpatient and inpatient setting. Further, use of the pathway using spot urine
      sodium to titrate subsequent loop diuretic doses and maximize response in inpatients with AHF
      has shown compelling improvements in congestion and weight loss. However, a randomized trial
      is necessary to determine if initiating this protocol ,started in the ED, will improve AHF
      outcomes relative to structured usual care. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize use
      of spot urine guided diuretic therapy will: 1) result in significant improvement in global
      clinical status at 5 days relative to structured usual care, and 2) result in significant
      improvement in congestion at 5 days and in global rank at 30 days relative to structured
      usual care. Early protocolized treatment of patients with AHF will more rapidly improve
      dyspnea, avoid development of in-hospital WHF, result in greater decongestion at hospital
      discharge, and therefore prevent HF-related readmissions and CV death.
