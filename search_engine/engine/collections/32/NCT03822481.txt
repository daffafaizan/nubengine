      an individual must consider prior to eating, and revisit while eating. Mindfulness refers to
      being consciously aware in the present moment and being accepting to emotions, and in
      practice, ME can be defined as an awareness to thoughts, feelings and emotions related to
      current food consumption (e.g., portion size, feelings of hunger/satiety, and healthfulness
      of food). Being underpinned by both concepts, the MCD intervention prompts individuals to
      consider aspects of their meal by generating a more focused perspective to the experience of
      eating. Current applications of mindfulness in health-related settings are promising,
      benefits include long-term weight-loss, and decreases in symptoms associated with physical
      and psychiatric disorders. Although the MCD is similarly associated with weight-loss,
      existing literature on its utility within the bariatric surgery population is scant.
      Furthermore, as weight regain is often observed post-surgery, it is important to explore how
      the MCD can help BSP overcome this obstacles. Furthermore, as the MCD is yet to be applied to
      BSP, this research will also establish whether the MCD is effective in promoting mindfulness,
      ME and subsequent weight-loss in this population. The potential benefits of this research are
      broad, as it can help establish a novel approach to effective weight-loss in BSP, and equip
      health care practitioners with a cost-effective weight-loss intervention. This research will
      employ a mixed-method design, where participants will be asked to maintain use of the MCD
      when eating for a three month period, and at their usual care visit complete questionnaires
      and an interview. Participants will be recruited from Heartland Hospital's Bariatric Clinic.
