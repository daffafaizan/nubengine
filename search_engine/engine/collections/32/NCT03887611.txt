      increasing. Clinical studies have found that about 10%-15% of adults have thyroid nodules,
      most of which are benign nodules, only 7% of thyroid nodules tend to be malignant, but if not
      treated promptly, 5% of patients will still from benign to malignant. The incidence of
      thyroid cancer increases with age. According to the National Cancer Research Center, about
      64,300 new cases of thyroid cancer occurred in the world in 2016, and about 1,980 died of
      thyroid cancer. Timely and accurate detection of thyroid nodules and differentiation of
      benign and malignant are important for improving clinical treatment and improving patient
      prognosis.

      S-Detect technology is a computer-aided (CAD) system recently developed by Samsung Medical
      Center for thyroid ultrasound to assist in morphological analysis based on the Thyroid
      Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) description and final assessment.This provides a
      new way to identify the benign and malignant thyroid nodules.

      The ECI technique, unlike conventional strain-elastic imaging technology, performs an elastic
      analysis of the entire two-dimensional image. Moreover, when measuring the elastic ratio, it
      is only necessary to place a region of interest (ROI) at the nodule. Compared with the
      average elasticity of the surrounding area, it is more reflective of the elastic ratio of the
      mass to the surrounding tissue.
