    
      This is an open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention), single
      arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), prospective study (study following participants forward in time) to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of OROS methylphenidate in participants with ADHD (behavior disorder
      originating in childhood in which the essential features are signs of developmentally
      inappropriate inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity). The study duration will be of 12
      weeks per participant, which is divided into 2 parts Screening (within 14 days before study
      commences on Day -1) and treatment (8 weeks and will include titration period [from the
      initiation of the study treatment to determination of the individual's maintenance dose] and
      maintenance period [at least 4 weeks after determination of maintenance dose]). Participants
      will receive initial dose depending on their body weight. OROS methylphenidate hydrochloride
      (HCL) will be given orally once daily at an initial dose of 18 milligram (mg) for
      participants below 30 kilogram (kg) and 27 mg for those over 30 kg of body weight. The dose
      will be increased by 9 mg or 18 mg every week for up to Week 8, followed by a maximum
      maintenance dose of 54 mg orally once daily up to Week 12 during which the dose can be
      decreased by 9 mg depending on tolerability. Efficacy will be evaluated by Korean Version,
      ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) total score and Clinical Global Impression)-Severity / Impression
      rating scale CGI-S/I. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the trial.
