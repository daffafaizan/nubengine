      perform a MRI scan to describe the relation between backpain and disease affection in back
      muscles. After one year they are re-invited to perform another MRI scan to follow the disease
      progression.

      The MRI scan is done to measure the quantity and quality of the muscles in the back, thigh
      and calf. Further, investigators investigate the muscle function by measuring of muscle
      strength in legs and in the back together with three functional tests. A walking test (6MWT),
      a stair test (14SST), and a chair test (5-TSTST). Self-assessment of back pain is measured by
      a standardized questionnaire about backpain.
