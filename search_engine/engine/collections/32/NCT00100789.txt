        -  Determine overall and progression-free survival probability in patients with persistent,
           recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with
           gemcitabine and paclitaxel.

        -  Determine the confirmed and unconfirmed response (partial and complete) probability in
           patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and
      15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression, every 6 month for 2 years, and
      then annually for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-13 months.
