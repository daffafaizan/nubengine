        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine when administered with
           carboplatin and thoracic radiotherapy followed by adjuvant gemcitabine and carboplatin
           in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the MTD of gemcitabine and paclitaxel when administered with thoracic
           radiotherapy followed by adjuvant gemcitabine and carboplatin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Patients
      are sequentially assigned to 1 of 3 treatment regimens.

        -  Regimen A: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 22, 29, and
           43 and thoracic radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 1.

        -  Regimen B (closed to accrual as of 5/13/03): Patients receive gemcitabine and thoracic
           radiotherapy as in regimen A and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 22, 29,
           and 43.

        -  Regimen C: Patients receive gemcitabine and thoracic radiotherapy as in regimen A and
           paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 22, 29, and 43.

      At 3 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, all patients receive adjuvant gemcitabine
      IV over 30-60 minutes on days 71, 78, 92, and 99 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days
      71 and 92.

      The first 6 patients enrolled receive regimen A to determine the safety of the initial dose
      of gemcitabine. After completion of regimen A, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of gemcitabine in regimen B (closed to accrual as of 5/13/03) until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. In a separate sequence, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      alternating escalating doses of gemcitabine and paclitaxel in regimen C until the MTD is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 3 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 months, 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 29 months.
