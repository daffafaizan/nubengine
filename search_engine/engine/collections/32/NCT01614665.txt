      Inclusion Criteria and complying with the Exclusion Criteria prior to initiation of
      tacrolimus therapy will be enrolled.

      Participants will be randomized to treatment with either Advagraf® or Prograf®. The
      randomization will be on a 1:1 basis stratified by organ and centre.

      The study is divided in to two parts:

      Part A: The initial pharmacokinetic part of the study.

      Part B: A long term follow-up of one year. The main objective of Part A of the study is to
      collect PK data following administration of Advagraf® and Prograf® in de novo pediatric
      allograft recipients. Part B allows comparison of the safety and efficacy profiles of
      Advagraf® vs. Prograf® for longer term (52 weeks) post allograft transplantation.

      Part C: Continuation of long-term follow-up (from Day 365 onwards). Participants who have
      completed Part B and to whom continued treatment with Advagraf® is not currently available,
      will be offered participation in a continuation of long-term follow-up Part C. Part C will
      continue until Advagraf® becomes available to these participants or these participants'
      discontinuation, whichever is the earliest.

      This applies to participants in the following countries: Czech Republic, Italy, UK and Poland
      only.
