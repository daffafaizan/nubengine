      (cardiovascular) and peripheral (muscular) impairments underlying poor physical function by
      comparing older HIV-infected veterans randomized to combine aerobic and resistance exercise
      training versus usual care. The study hypothesis is that a progressive aerobic and resistance
      rehabilitation program will increase aerobic capacity and muscle strength, which will be
      mediated by improved diastolic function, increased muscle mass, and decreased systemic
      inflammation. To test this hypothesis, investigators will conduct a randomized 16-week trial
      of progressive aerobic and resistance training versus usual care control in 40 sedentary
      older (50+ years) HIV-infected veterans. The study will determine the effects of exercise
      training on aerobic capacity and diastolic function, and their relationship to changes in
      biomarkers of systemic inflammation and cardiac fibrosis (AIM 1). The study will also
      determine the effect of exercise training on strength and muscle mass, and their relationship
      to changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation (AIM 2).
