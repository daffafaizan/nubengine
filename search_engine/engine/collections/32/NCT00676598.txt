      outcomes of patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest in a limited number of clinical sites.
      Based on available data, current recommendations from the American Heart Association include
      a level 2a endorsement of therapeutic hypothermia for cardiac arrest from ventricular
      fibrillation with persistent coma, and a level 2b recommendation for cardiac arrest from any
      other rhythm. To date there have been no formal studies presented that demonstrate an
      improvement in outcome when a hypothermic protocol is implemented in a community hospital.
      The investigators plan to prospectively collect data on patients enrolled in the therapeutic
      hypothermia protocol to evaluate clinical outcomes and compare these outcomes with historic
      controls, with the hypothesis that patients enrolled in the hypothermic protocol will have
      improved neurologic outcomes.
