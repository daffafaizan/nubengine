      Patients either received cobitolimod 31 mg, 125 mg or 250 mg at two occasions or 125 mg or
      placebo at four occasions during a 3-weeks period. To ensure blindness, patients received
      active treatment at two occasions and placebo at the other two occasions. Blood, stool, and
      tissue samples was collected at various time points throughout the study to evaluate safety
      and efficacy. Primary endpoint was evaluated at week 6.
