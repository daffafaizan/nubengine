      ability to adhere to a prescribed therapeutic regimen, and efforts have been spent developing
      strategies to promote adherence. It is estimated that 20% to 50% of patients with chronic
      conditions are not adherent to their prescribed medication regimen, with non-adherence being
      defined as <80% adherence to prescribed, relevant medication. The treatment regimen often
      comprises several elements such as poly-pharmacy including insulin administration,
      self-monitoring of blood glucose, diet and physical exercise. It is thus not just a matter of
      'taking a pill or not' but implies lifestyle changes, knowledge and competence, and internal
      motivation for self-management. The investigators developed a consultation program based on
      dialogue tools. The EMMA program aims to support medication adherence and blood glucose
      control by facilitating rapport, exploring patient concerns and challenges, enabling
      knowledge exchange and supporting goal-setting and action-planning. A pilot test of the
      program appeared feasible and acceptable to patients and health care professionals and showed
      significant decrease on HbA1c. EMMA is now ready to be tested in a randomized controlled
      study (RCT) study.
