    
      This Phase 3 trial is an open-label extension study of the placebo-controlled, double-blind
      VRX-RET-E22-301 trial. Patients who have completed the VRX-RET-E22-301 trial and who meet
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be treated with 600-1200 mg/day of retigabine as an
      adjunct therapy to their current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or vagal nerve stimulation.
      Treatment will be continued until retigabine is commercially available, or until the program
      is discontinued. Patients will be recruited from 45-50 sites in the United States, Canada,
      Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. The safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with
      retigabine administered as adjunctive therapy in adult epilepsy patients with partial-onset
      seizures will be evaluated. In addition, the efficacy of long-term treatment with retigabine
      and patient quality of life will be assessed.
