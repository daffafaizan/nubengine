    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, cross-over clinical trail will be
      carrie out in 15 healthy, sedentary individuals of both genders, who meet the following
      inclusion criteria: 25 to 40 years of age, normal fasting plasma glucose (â‰¤ 5.5 mm/L), blood
      pressure (<130/90 mmHg), body mass index of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, no taking any medication known
      to affect glucose tolerance, nondrinkers and nonsmokers. No pregnant, and lactation estate
      for female participants. They will be select from the same neighborhood and socioeconomic
      status.

      After a fasting blood sample patients will be assigned at random-order through a
      closed-envelope selection, to receive one of two possible sequences during which they
      received either single oral doses of Medicago sativa or homologated placebo in 1,500 mg and
      were crossover with a difference of at least 7 days washout interval. Thirty minutes after
      each intervention patients underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerant test (OGTT). Area under the
      curve of glucose and insulin, phases of insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity will be
      calculate for each treatment period.
