      have shown that the combination of chemotherapeutic agents is superior to single therapeutic
      agent in overall response rate and progression free survival. The inclusion of the most
      active drugs in combination regimens can improve the percentage of patients achieving a
      pathological complete response (pCR). The chemotherapy agents gemcitabine, epirubicin, and
      paclitaxel have been used individually to treat breast cancer. While use of the combination
      of these three drugs has been studied in the metastatic setting, the combination has not been
      evaluated in locally advanced disease. In this study the combination of the three agents
      gemcitabine, epirubicin, and paclitaxel [Taxol] will be administered to patients with locally
      advanced breast cancer prior to surgery; pathologic response will be determined at the time
      of surgery. The main objective of this study is to determine the pathological response rate
      for these patients. Also because prior studies have suggested that only a specific subset of
      tumors responds to a specific chemotherapeutic agent and that this subset is determined by
      the gene expression profile of each tumor, preoperative therapy protocols such as this
      provide an ideal setting to identify gene expression pattern and gene copy number changes
      that may predict response to a specific therapy using high-throughput assay methods and
      RNAlater. Therefore, this study will also look at the feasibility of tissue collection and
      analysis in identifying predictive markers of complete pathological response.
