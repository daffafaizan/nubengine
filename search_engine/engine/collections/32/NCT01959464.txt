      her sexual partner have not been studied. However, a previous study performed by our group
      found that intercourse lowered the absorption of vaginal estrogen cream in women, and men
      absorbed a small but statistically significant amount of estradiol during intercourse.
      Vaginal progesterone gel may be used by women for several clinical indications, and if
      intercourse alters the absorption and distribution of vaginal progesterone, clinical outcomes
      may be compromised. If intercourse lowers absorption, the efficacy of the treatment could be
      reduced. If intercourse enhances absorption, side effects may be increased. Also, if the male
      sexual partner absorbs vaginal progesterone, undesirable side effects may occur.
