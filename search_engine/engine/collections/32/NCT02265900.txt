      dopamine release and neuroimflammation. We will also use functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity. Assessments will be conducted before and after a
      12-week exercise intervention and 3-year follow-up. Participants will be randomly allocated
      into either an aerobic or a stretching intervention. Clinical measures of motor function,
      cognition and mood will also be assessed.
