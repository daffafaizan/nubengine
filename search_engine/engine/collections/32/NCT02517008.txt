      childcare items (a cloth, baby diaper, and blanket) to women conditional upon delivering at a
      facility on facility delivery rates in rural Serenje and Chadiza Districts in Zambia.
      Facilities were randomized to either provide the intervention or not. Facility-level
      antenatal care (ANC) and delivery registers were used to measure the percentage of women
      attending antenatal care who delivered at a study facility during the intervention period.
      Results from the trial were then used to model the cost-effectiveness of mama kits at-scale
      in terms of cost per death averted.
