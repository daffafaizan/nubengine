      in cancer. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the safety and possible effect of targeting
      both EGFR using cetuximab along with ABL1 using nilotinib. Correlative studies assess the
      changes in tumor proteome in response to therapy and magnitude of ADCC as a marker of
      antibody activity.
