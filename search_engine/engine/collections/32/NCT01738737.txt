      investigated extensively, but research has focused primarily on the effect that the decrease
      in muscle strength has on the functionality in patients with OA. However, the reduced range
      of motion in affected joints is also an important risk factor for the occurrence of locomotor
      disability and other developing disability in patients with OA.

      Studies using stretching exercises are scarce in the Reid & Mc Nair (2010) specifically
      examined the range of motion can be improved in subjects with knee osteoarthritis, although
      this study did only stretching the hamstrings. The results indicate that there is immediate
      benefits of stretching in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee joint, providing evidence
      for the long term development of stretching programs for this population.

      In the literature are observed inconsistent results regarding the benefits of laser treatment
      in improving pain and function in individuals with knee OA. Also there are few studies that
      specify which dosage and frequency of laser must be used.

      In view of the increasing need to support the role of physiotherapy in evidence-based
      practice, this study is justified by the need to test the effectiveness of stretching
      exercises and elucidate the effectiveness of low intensity laser therapy in patients with
      knee OA.
