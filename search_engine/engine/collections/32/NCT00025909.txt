      plasma HIV RNA levels in infected patients, it has not resulted in eradication of virus. It
      is now clear that virus replication persists despite undetectable plasma viremia in
      individuals receiving HAART. In this regard, withdrawing HAART, even after prolonged periods
      of virus suppression, leads to an almost universal rapid rebound of plasma viremia. It is
      also now clear that prolonged, continuous HAART carries a risk of significant toxicity and
      side effects. In addition, the monetary cost of HAART is prohibitive for many individuals and
      countries. These recent observations may argue for a different approach to HAART with the
      goals of : 1) durable suppression of virus replication, without an attempt at eradication, 2)
      minimization of toxicity and side effects and improvement in patient life-style, and 3) a
      reduction in cost. Therefore, we propose to study the virologic and immunologic effects of
      short cycle intermittent versus continuous HAART in HIV-infected individuals as a possible
      means to achieve these goals. In a pilot study of patients successfully treated with HAART,
      we have demonstrated that cycles of 7 days on HAART followed by 7 days off HAART can maintain
      suppression of plasma, lymph node, and resting CD4+ T cell HIV while maintaining CD4+ T cell
      counts for up to 1 year. It is the purpose of this study to further evaluate these
      observations with a randomized, controlled, intent-to-treat trial.
