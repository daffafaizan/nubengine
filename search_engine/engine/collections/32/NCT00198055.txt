      interaction and communication in addition to restricted patterns of interests and activities.
      Research suggests that a dysregulation of the dopamine and serotonin systems contributes to
      these interfering behaviors in individuals with PDD. After benefits of typical neuroleptics
      were reported in subjects with PDD's, research shifted to the atypical antipsychotics, which
      have been shown to be better tolerated and effective in this population. However, the
      atypical antipsychotics have also been associated with adverse effects. Thus there remains a
      need for a novel pharmacotherapy that would be safe and effective for children and
      adolescents with PDD's including Asperger's disorder and PDD Not Otherwise Specified (PDD
      NOS). We hypothesize that aripiprazole will be effective for reducing aggression and
      repetitive behavior. We also hypothesize that aripiprazole will be well tolerated, with low
      risk for extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, or corrected QT interval
      (QTc) prolongation. In addition, this open-label study will serve to stimulate more
      definitive, controlled research.
