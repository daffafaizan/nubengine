      its muscle paralyzing effects, but there is a growing body of evidence to support a role in
      pain modulation. Symptomatic osteoarthritis is a leading cause of pain, functional
      impairment, and disability, with significant indirect costs to society. Preliminary evidence
      suggests that Btx-A has a significant nociceptive effect, when injected intra-articularly, in
      to painful joints. The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Btx-A injected
      intra-articularly in 60 subjects with moderate pain and functional impairment secondary to
      knee osteoarthritis, in a randomized, cortisone-controlled, double blind study, over a 6
      month follow up period. If Btx-A is shown to be of equal or greater efficacy than cortisone
      in this patient population, it may be an excellent second line treatment for osteoarthritis,
      in multiple joints, where surgery is contraindicated or deferred due to age, comorbidities,
      or patient preference. Further studies examining the mechanism of action at the biochemical
      level, the clinical effect of Btx-A in other joints (in both osteoarthritis and inflammatory
      arthritis), the efficacy of Btx-A compared to hyaluronic acid (the only currently available
      injectable alternative to cortisone), and the side effect profile (effect on adjacent muscle
      strength, joint position sense, and long-term outcomes) would be indicated.
