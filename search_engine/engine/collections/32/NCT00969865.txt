      evaluate the value of a highly individualized approach to atherosclerosis risk reduction. In
      this project we set out to compare the delivery of appropriate therapies and resource
      utilization using current national guidelines for the management of atherosclerosis and will
      compare this to using a highly individualized approach for atherosclerosis risk reduction,
      based on the evaluation of specific features in individuals and tailoring management based on
      this evaluation. We plan to show that utilizing the iCARE Program, more patients will receive
      appropriate diagnoses and subsequent therapies in a more efficient manner.
