      fracture. Bilateral fractures are reported in around one fifth to one third of all fractures
      of the mandibular condyles and are often combined with other fractures of the mandible or
      facial skeleton.

      The treatment of condylar fractures, and in particular of bilateral condylar fractures
      (BCFx), is complex due to many different fracture patterns, surgeon's preferences, local
      constraints of the health care system and patient characteristics. Briefly, BCFx can be
      treated using either closed treatment (CTx) (e.g. intermaxillary fixation [IMF] and/or
      functional therapy) or surgical treatment (i.e. open reduction and internal fixation [ORIF])
      in both fractures, or a combination of closed treatment and ORIF. The relationship of these
      treatments with the final outcome remains elusive, since the available literature does not
      report specific data for patients sustaining BCFx and has ignored or inadequately reported
      patient-reported outcomes. Consequently there is a lack of clinical evidence to assist the
      decision-making process.

      Therefore, the purpose of this registry is to collect data in a standardized manner regarding
      the treatment, the clinical and the patient-oriented outcomes, and the complications of BCFx.
