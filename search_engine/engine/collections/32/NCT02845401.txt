    
      A prospective case-control study of safety and clinical outcomes, and of innate and adaptive
      immune responses and their genetic predictors, in adult human subjects with HBeAg-CHB who
      either continue or stop nucleoside or nucleotide analog (NA) antiviral therapy. Immune
      responses will be studied using liver tissue and serial peripheral blood samples. The
      immunological factors selected have been chosen based on preliminary and inferential
      evidence. Immunologic findings will be correlated with different serologic, virologic and
      biochemical outcomes. Genetic predictors of the type of response and respective clinical
      outcomes will also be sought.
