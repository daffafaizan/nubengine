      agent with immunomodulatory and antiviral properties that has demonstrated in vitro activity
      against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Preliminary reports suggest potential
      efficacy in small human studies. Clinical trial data are needed to determine whether
      hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19.

      Study Aim: To compare the effect of hydroxychloroquine versus placebo on clinical outcomes,
      measured using the COVID Ordinal Outcomes Scale at Day 15, among adults with COVID-19
      requiring hospitalization.

      Study Hypothesis: Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, administration of
      hydroxychloroquine will improve clinical outcomes at Day 15.
