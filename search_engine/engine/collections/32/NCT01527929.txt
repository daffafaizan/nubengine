      within 5 business days of registration, with 21-day study treatment cycles. Cycle lengths may
      be extended up to a maximum of 14 additional days in case of unresolved toxicity. Patients
      continue to receive treatment until they experience, unacceptable toxicities/Adverse Events,
      disease progression, withdraw their consent, or the investigator decides to discontinue the
      patient, and the subsequent 30 days follow-up or study cut-off, whichever comes first.

      Patients may continue to be treated as long as they are benefiting from study treatment and
      have not met study withdrawn criteria.
