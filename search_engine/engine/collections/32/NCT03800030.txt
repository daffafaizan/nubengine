      aspects of cognitive control. In specific delta (2-4Hz) and beta (15-30Hz) are associated
      with increased levels of abstraction for learned rules; and theta (5-8Hz) and gamma (30-50Hz)
      has been associated with increased set-size or number of learned rules. Here we aim to find
      causal evidence in support of these previous correlational findings by applying
      cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in the specific frequency
      bands previously shown to be task-relevant. In a crossover design, we stimulate subjects with
      either delta-beta or theta-gamma tACS during performance of a hierarchical cognitive control
      task that manipulates the level of abstraction and set-size of rules that must be learned in
      order to make the correct button press.
