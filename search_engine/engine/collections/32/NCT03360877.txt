    
      This study is designed as a cross-sectional, non-randomized, two-site, four-phase study: an
      initial baseline period, two intervention periods, and a final interruption period.

      This is a descriptive study to collect information on the risk of HCAIs in the MSF-supported
      inpatient nutritional treatment centers. Information on key clinical indicators will be
      collected regularly according to the routine program procedures from the time of admission to
      discharge. All children will undergo a blood draw for culture at time of admission and at the
      time of any suspected hospital-acquired bloodstream infection. As part of active surveillance
      for bacterial colonization, including multi-drug resistant organisms, all children will
      undergo nasal and rectal swabs at the time of admission, suspected infection, and discharge.
      Data will provide an estimate of nosocomial infection incidence under routine circumstances
      and inform sample size calculations if further study is warranted.
