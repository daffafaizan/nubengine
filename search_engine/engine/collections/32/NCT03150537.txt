    
      Eighty healthy adults (18-49 years of age) will be randomized 1:1 to receive:

        -  A single dose of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV: Fluviralâ„¢: 0.5mL IM)

             -  Half will receive the vaccine using a pre-filled syringe

             -  Half will receive the vaccine using a multi-dose vial

        -  Or,the same vaccine delivered IM using the Medical International Technologies Inc. (MIT)
           compressed air vaccine delivery system (Med-Jet MIT H4 & Disposable Cartridge).

      Primary study outcomes will be i) safety (local and systemic reactions) followed for 21 days
      and ii) immunogenicity at 21 days using the standard serologic assays (eg: hemaggultination
      inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN)).

      Secondary outcomes will be time-motion analyses of vaccine preparation and administration to
      assess possible time-saving associated with Med-Jet H4 delivery.

      Although full blinding of the study is not possible give the very different vaccine delivery
      methods, all safety assessments and immunological parameters will be collected by
      nurses/technicians blinded to group assignment (ie: observer blind).
