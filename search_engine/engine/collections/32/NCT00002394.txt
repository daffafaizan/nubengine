    
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating study with up to 2 sequential cohorts. The first 15
      patients receive Lamisil for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, patients considered clinically cured
      (i.e., absence of removable, white plaques) are removed from treatment; patients not
      considered clinically cured receive an additional 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of 4
      weeks, treatment is discontinued, regardless of clinical cure outcome. If less than 80% of
      patients are clinically cured after the 4 weeks of treatment, a second cohort of 15 patients
      receive Lamisil on the same treatment regimen as first cohort (i.e., initial 2-week treatment
      period, with an additional 2 weeks of treatment for those patients who are not considered
      clinically cured after 2 weeks of treatment).
