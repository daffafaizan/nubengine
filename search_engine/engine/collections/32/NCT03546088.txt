      airway. The patient's comfort and optimum intubation conditions are paramount for success.
      The study proposes to analyse a series of patients with obstructive pharyngo-laryngeal
      pathology, following the degree of satisfaction, reliability of the procedure and any
      incidents or complications.

      Awake intubation could be the safest way to control difficult airway as the patient maintains
      spontaneous respiration and intact reflexes. Main concerns for the success of this procedure
      should be a good technique, a calm and cooperative patient and good preparation with careful
      topical anaesthesia and appropriate sedation. The tool used in this study will be a flexible
      nasolaryngoscope of 2.9 mm diameter and 300 mm working length which might offer an advantage
      over lengthier fiberscopes in matter of manoeuvrability and patient comfort. Prior intubation
      the patients will have an upper airway fiberscopic exam from nostrils to tracheae with the
      same tool.
