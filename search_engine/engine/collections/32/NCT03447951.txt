    
      BCLC stage B patients who are ineligible for operational or current locoregional therapy.
      Enrolled patients are randomly assigned to either of the two total doses, 20% or 30% of total
      tumor volume. PTS100 is administrated via intratumoral injection. The required total dose is
      given in separate injection days, with maximal daily dose up to 10 mL at first IP
      administration, and is adjusted based on each patient's tolerability along the treatment. The
      treatment course lasts up to completion of the total dose, and the efficacy is evaluated 28
      days afterwards.
