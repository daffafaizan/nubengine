      reducing preoperative anxiety. However the intervention was biased by concurrent pre-surgery
      education. Therefore this study aims to test the effects of a Preoperative Relaxation
      intervention and an Intensified Surgery Patient Education on pre- and postoperative wellbeing
      and health in Patients Undergoing colorectal surgery using a factorial design.
