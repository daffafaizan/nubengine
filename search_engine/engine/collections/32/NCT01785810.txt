      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To estimate the cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD by day 180 with the addition of
      maraviroc to a standard prophylaxis regimen in patients with hematologic malignancies
      undergoing reduced intensity allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (RIC SCT) from unrelated
      donors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the toxicity of a prolonged administration of maraviroc in patients undergoing
           RIC SCT.

        2. To estimate the rates of severe (grade 3-4) acute GVHD by day 100 and 180, grade 2-4
           acute GVHD by day 100, organ-specific acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, infections,
           non-relapse mortality, use of immunosuppressive therapies and 1-year survival in
           patients treated with maraviroc after RIC SCT.

        3. To assess the effect of treatment with maraviroc on immune recovery, engraftment and
           donor T-cell chimerism in peripheral blood and in target organs.

        4. To assess the effect of donor and recipient CCR5 genotype on the incidence of acute GVHD
           in patients receiving maraviroc as part of a GVHD prophylaxis regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a standard conditioning regimen with fludarabine and busulfan
      followed by a peripheral blood stem cell infusion from an unrelated donor, standard GVHD
      prophylaxis and standard antiviral and antifungal prophylaxis. In addition, all patients
      receive maraviroc from day -3 to d+ 90.

      Patients are followed for 1 year after the stem-cell infusion.
