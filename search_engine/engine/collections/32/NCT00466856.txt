      Primary

        -  Determine tumor response to selective internal radiation therapy with yttrium Y 90 resin
           microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) in patients with progressive liver metastases from
           neuroendocrine tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine the symptomatic relief of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the health-related quality of life of patients receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients have an catheter placed into the hepatic artery percutaneously through the
      groin and then undergo selective internal radiation therapy with yttrium Y 90 resin
      microspheres (Sir-Spheres®) via the catheter on day 1. Patients also receive octreotide
      acetate IV 1 hour prior to, during, and 2 hours after Sir-Spheres® injection. Patients may
      undergo above treatment in another lobe of the liver (if each lobe is treated separately) 4
      weeks later.

      Patients undergo functional performance, health-related quality of life, and symptom severity
      assessment prior to initial treatment and after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
