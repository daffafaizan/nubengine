      the severe patients need surgical treatment. The elderly are often complicated with many
      medical diseases and the perioperative risk is high, so minimally invasive surgery is a new
      choice for spinal surgeons to treat ADS. Modified lateral lumbar interbody fusion (CLIF) is
      an new modified spinal minimally invasive interbody fusion technique in the investigator's
      department. The results of preliminary studies showed that it has the advantages of less
      trauma, short operation time and fewer complications, and the clinical and imaging outcome
      are remarkable. Therefore, the present study aims to establish a multicenter, large sample
      prospective randomized controlled study to explore the technical advantages and surgical
      indications of the new technique in the treatment of ADS by comparing with the traditional
      posterior spinal interbody fusion; (2) to compare the postoperative clinical and imaging
      results and analyze the surgical complications and preventive measures; (3) to establish a
      long-term follow-up to further quantify the clinical and imaging outcome of the new
      technique. Therefore, this study will further verify the safety and effectiveness of the CLIF
      in the treatment of ADS on the basis of previous studies, and provide a new clinical approach
      for minimally invasive treatment of ADS.
