      February 2009 with a continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) and hybrid technique
      named sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED). The primary end point was death from any
      cause by day 30. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients were eligible for inclusion when serum
      creatinine was > 2 mg/dL, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) was initiated. The selected
      patients were treated with CVVHDF or SLED.
