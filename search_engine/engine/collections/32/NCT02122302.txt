    
      The following aims will be addressed:

      Aim 1: Refine and extend CarePrep content for targeted disorders.

      Working with experts at our sites, the study team will review CarePrep content in association
      with current literature and established instruments. Applying this data, a comprehensive pain
      assessment will be developed and content to target chronic pancreatic pain (CPP) will be
      prioritized. During Phase 1 of the study, the system will be deployed, patient testing begun,
      and feedback gathered to guide refinement. Patients will be asked to complete their online
      CarePrep assessment before their scheduled clinic visit; the report will be delivered to
      their attending physician prior to the clinic encounter. Patients who are unable to complete
      their assessment at home will have access to electronic tablets which will be provided in
      clinic.

      Aim 2: Test with patients, gather feedback, and conduct cognitive and structured interviews
      to assess validity.

      Research staff will conduct individual patient interviews to assess CarePrep validity, via
      the following ways: Cognitive interviews probing for CarePrep comprehension and ease of use,
      as well as measuring patients' rationale for selecting their online responses; structured
      interviews that will include a block of standardized questions that mirror the online
      CarePrep assessment (patients' interview responses will be compared to data from their online
      session to assess the sensitivity of CarePrep screening questions); and patients' ratings of
      CarePrep's accuracy will be collected to improve and validate system design.

      Aim 3: Assess feasibility.

      In Phase II of the study, physician and patient self-reports will be used to assess
      feasibility and utility. The objective of this phase is to deliver a system that supports a
      comprehensive health assessment and facilitates physician-patient communication so that
      physicians will adopt the system for routine care.
