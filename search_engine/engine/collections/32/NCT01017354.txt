        1. Active I (n=70): monthly high-dose vitamin D3 supplement dose (60'000 IU/month,
           equivalent to 2000 IU daily),

        2. Active II (n=70): or a monthly standard vitamin D3 supplement dose combined with 25(OH)D
           (24'000 IU/month, equivalent to 800 IU daily PLUS 300 mcg 25(OH)D, equivalent to 10 mcg
           per day)

        3. Control (n=70): compared to a standard vitamin D3 supplement dose (24'000 IU/month,
           equivalent to 800 IU daily)

      All individuals will be advised to consume calcium from natural food sources in a daily dose
      of 600-800 mgs a day, including milk products. Maximal intake of supplemental calcium is
      restricted to 250 mg per day.
