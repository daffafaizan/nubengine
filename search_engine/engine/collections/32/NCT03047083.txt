    
      The current study is a retrospective non-interventional study using real-world data collected
      from existing medical records to evaluate descriptively the treatment patterns and key
      healthcare resource use among AML patients with or without FLT3 mutation. The current study
      relies on secondary use of existing data, and there is no intervention involved. Patients who
      received the first AML treatment after the initial diagnosis, or were classified as
      relapsed/refractory (R/R), between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015 will be randomly
      selected to be included in this study, and the data from their existing medical records will
      be extracted. Eligible patients will be grouped based on FLT3 mutation status, intensive
      chemotherapy (IC) eligibility, and R/R status.

      For newly diagnosed patients, the index date will be defined as the initiation date of the
      first AML treatment following initial diagnosis. For the R/R patients, the index date will be
      defined as the date of the patient being classified as R/R. The study period will be the
      period from the index date to last follow-up date or death, whichever comes earlier. The
      endpoint measurements of this study are treatment patterns and key AML-related healthcare
      resources used during the study period.
