      are also a major source of morbidity and mortality. After general surgery, they usually do
      not require clinically significant management but the literature on this topic is obsolete.
      There is no literature data about their incidence during kidney surgery in the lateral
      position when the bed is scissored so the legs and head are low. The aim of this study was to
      define what types of arrhythmias are the most common during kidney cancer surgery, their
      incidence and whether combining general with epidural anesthesia prevents them.

      An approval from the Medical University of Warsaw Bioethical Committee has been obtained.
      Patients need to give written informed consent to participate in the study.

      It is anticipated that 50 patients with open kidney cancer surgery performed in the lateral
      position, under general or combined anesthesia will be enrolled.

      A Holter ECG monitor (3-chanel, leads CM5) will be applied at the evening before the surgery,
      tracing continuously for a period of 24 hours (7PM-7PM).

      Patients will be randomly allocated (random permuted blocks within strata) to receive general
      or combined epidural/general anesthesia. The anesthetic technique is standardized. All the
      data registered by the Holter ECG monitor will be analyzed and compared with the nursery and
      anesthesia records.
