    
      The Heart SMART Program is designed to offer a practical and efficacious stress management
      and resiliency intervention. It involves making participants aware of practices to enhance
      present moment awareness and engagement. It teaches learners to train their attention, and
      refine interpretation; utilizing principles of gratitude, compassion, acceptance, higher
      meaning and forgiveness. Participants will choose to use one of two delivery methods (either
      the face to face method or the on-line method) of the Heart SMART program.
