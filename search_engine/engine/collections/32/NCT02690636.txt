      cancer is equally effective and safe as conventional fractionated radiotherapy. Breast cancer
      patients with pathological positive lymph nodes (N1 - N2) operated with modified radical
      mastectomy will be randomized 1:1 and also those with breast conservative surgery with
      positive lymph nodes will be randomized 1:1 for receiving either adjuvant conventional
      radiotherapy 200cgy x 25 fractions with 200cgy x 5 fractions boost for those with intact
      breast versus hypofractionated radiotherapy 266cgyx16 fractions and 266 cgy x 4 fractions
      boost for those with intact breast. The patients will be followed for 5 years to monitor
      locoregional recurrence, cosmetic outcomes, ipsilateral arm lymph edema. Health economic
      perspectives will be monitored by calculating cost effective analysis for both treatment
      plans.
