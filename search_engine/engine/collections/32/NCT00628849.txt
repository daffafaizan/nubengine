    
      All patients will have ORIF of their fractured mandible under general anesthesia. Patients
      will either be treated with small 2 mm plates and screws according to Champy principles (or a
      modified Champy technique that utilizes additional 2mm plates/screws) or larger plates/screws
      (2.3mm or larger) according to the AO principles. No patients will have their teeth wired
      together so that all patients will be able to function normally. All patients will have an
      immediate post operative orthopantogram to verify adequacy of the fracture reduction.
      Patients will be discharged as soon as is medically appropriate.

      Patient Assessment

      Patients will be assessed regularly at 1 week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months to ensure
      continued healing of the fracture. This is a typical post-operative follow-up schedule for
      all fracture patients. As is the standard of care, orthopantogram x-rays will be taken at 6
      weeks and 3 months to assess fracture healing. Additional x-rays will only be taken if the
      clinical picture is suggestive of inadequate healing or infection. Additional data regarding
      the presence of infection, nonunion, fibrous union, malunion, malocclusion, facial nerve
      weakness and inferior alveolar nerve paresthesia will be recorded at each follow-up visit.
      Additional complications will also be recorded and managed as necessary.
