      systemic disease. There is an urgent need for better comprehension of the physiopathology of
      the disease and to discover new therapeutic pathways.

      The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, or HBP, is an important regulator of immunity and
      results in a post-transductional modification of proteins called O-GlcNAcylation and involved
      in inflammation and immunity.

      There is a very unbalanced sex ratio in favor of women in SLE suggesting a role of the X
      chromosome in the physiopathology of the disease. The human OGT gene (a key O-GlcNAcylation
      enzyme) is localized on the X chromosome, near the XIST gene responsible for the inactivation
      of one X chromosome by methylation.

      Moreover, genes encoding CD40L, CXCR3 and OGT have been shown to be demethylated and
      overexpressed in T cells of women with systemic systemic lupus erythematosus compared to men
      with the same pathology.

      The investigators hypothesize that O-GlcNAcylation is increased in the effector lymphocytes
      of SLE patients and involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. Therefore, inhibiting
      O-GlcNAcylation may be a promising therapeutic option in SLE.

      This study will recruit 100 patients with SLE followed in Bordeaux University Hospital. Among
      classical disease activity information, blood samples will be collected at study visit to
      study O-GlcNAcylation levels in immune cells. Fundamental research will be realized on
      patients' sample.

      Clinical and biological disease activity, treatment and outcomes will be studied in
      correlation with O-GlcNAcylation levels. Patients will be included within their usual
      follow-up. No extra visit will be needed and blood samples will be drawn at the same times as
      those drawn for clinical purposes.
