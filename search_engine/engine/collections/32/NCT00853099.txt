      randomized 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of adalimumab at either 160/80 mg at Week
      0/2 and 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4 to Week 50, 80/40 mg at Week 0/2 and
      40 mg eow starting at Week 4 to Week 50, or placebo eow starting at Week 0 to Week 50 under
      the double-blind condition. At or after Week 8, participants who have inadequate response
      during the double-blind period can switch to the rescue arm, where participants from the
      placebo group initially receive adalimumab 160 mg and 80 mg 2 weeks later and those from the
      adalimumab group receive adalimumab 40 mg initially and 2 weeks later under double-blind
      conditions. All participants in the rescue arm then receive 40 mg adalimumab eow until Week
      50. Participants who complete the 52-week double-blind period receive open-label adalimumab
      40 mg eow starting at Week 52 and continuing until the end of the study. Participants who
      have an inadequate response or disease flare can dose escalate to 80 mg eow at or after Week
      60. Participants who dose escalate to 80 mg eow and continue to have an inadequate response
      or disease flare are withdrawn from the study.
