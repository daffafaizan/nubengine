    
      This is a multi-centre, multinational, open-label, single-dose acute hemodynamic study
      followed by a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled study. Eligible
      subjects will undergo screening followed by randomized allocation to treatment group for the
      double-blind study, followed in turn by immediate enrollment in an open-label, single-dose
      acute hemodynamic study with ACT-293987 (NS-304) and 21 weeks of double-blind treatment
      during which subjects will receive either ACT-293987 (NS-304)or placebo twice daily (b.i.d.).
      Subjects who have completed the double-blind study can enter the open extension study and
      receive administration of ACT-293987 (NS-304) (separate protocol)if the subject wishes and
      the investigator considers it appropriate.

      Unblinding will occur on a subject-by-subject basis when the Week 17 data for the subject
      have been fixed.

      Approximately 44 subjects are to be randomized in a ratio of 3:1 to the two treatment groups,
      ACT-293987 (NS-304) and placebo (33 subjects to ACT-293987 (NS-304) and 11 subjects to
      placebo).

      Subjects will be randomized to the study following screening.
