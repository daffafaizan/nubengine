      (PCPs) treating patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). Physicians will be
      asked general medical questions in order to quantify their prescribing behavior and their
      perception of treatment performance. A retrospective patient chart review will then be
      performed and patient data will be collected to document patient characteristics and actual
      treatment outcomes. Upon qualification, specific instructions for chart review will be
      provided. Once the identified charts are pulled, the physicians are instructed to continue
      with the on-line survey. In total, there will be approximately 450 psychiatrists and 450
      primary care physicians participating in this trial.
