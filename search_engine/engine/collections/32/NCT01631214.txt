      romosozumab or weekly oral alendronate for 12 months. Randomization was stratified according
      to age (<75 vs. â‰¥75 years). After completion of the double-blind treatment period, all the
      participants were to receive open-label weekly oral alendronate until the end of the trial,
      with blinding to the initial treatment assignment maintained.

      The primary analysis was performed when clinical fracture events had been confirmed in at
      least 330 participants and all the participants had completed the month 24 visit. The study
      was to continue in an event-driven manner until at least 440 participants experienced a
      nonvertebral fracture or if the superiority of romosozumab was proven for nonvertebral
      fractures at the primary analysis.
