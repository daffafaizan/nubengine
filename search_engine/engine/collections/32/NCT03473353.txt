      medical scribes on (1) patient experience (e.g. patient satisfaction) (2) clinician
      experience (e.g. stress load, burnout, evaluation of the visit, amount of time spent after
      hours inputting notes), and (3) clinician-patient interaction (e.g. patient and clinician
      engagement during the visit).
