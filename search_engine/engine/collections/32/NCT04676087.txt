    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of mogamulizumab and ECP in
      Sezary syndrome (SS) and erythrodermic mycosis fungoides (MF).

      II. To determine the efficacy of the combination of mogamulizumab and extra-corporeal
      photopheresis in SS and erythrodermic MF.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess response by disease compartment, time to response, duration of response,
      progression free survival (PFS), and change in quality of life in patients with Sezary
      syndrome and erythrodermic MF treated with mogamulizumab and ECP.

      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess biomarkers of response and changes in immunologic response on serial blood
      samples and peripheral blood flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION (WEEKS 1-7): Patients receive mogamulizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 36 in the absence of disease progression progression and unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients also undergo extracorporeal photopheresis on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36
      in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      TREATMENT (CYCLES 1-12): Patients receive mogamulizumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15,
      and undergo extracorporeal photopheresis on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-6, then day 1 of
      subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE (CYCLES 13+): Patients with clinical benefit may continue extracorporeal
      photopheresis on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression and
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days, then every 3
      months for 3 years.
