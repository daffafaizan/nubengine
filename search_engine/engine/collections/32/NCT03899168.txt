      with expert (vs nonexpert) information, independent of their prior attitudes and consequent
      confirmation bias.

      This study aimed to investigate confirmation bias in mental health-related information
      searches, particularly (1) if high confidence worsens confirmation bias, (2) if social tags
      eliminate the influence of prior attitudes, and (3) if people successfully distinguish high
      and low source credibility.

      In total, 520 participants of a representative sample of the German Web-based population were
      recruited via a panel company. Among them, 48.1% (250/520) participants completed the fully
      automated study. Participants provided prior attitudes about antidepressants and
      psychotherapy. The investigators manipulated (1) confidence in prior attitudes when
      participants searched for blog posts about the treatment of depression, (2) tag popularity
      -either psychotherapy or antidepressant tags were more popular, and (3) source credibility
      with banners indicating high or low expertise of the tagging community. The investigators
      measured tag and blog post selection, and treatment efficacy ratings after navigation.
