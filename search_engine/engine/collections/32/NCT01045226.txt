      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility of proton radiation therapy (RT) using standard fractionation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine freedom from failure (FFF) (vs. biochemical/clinical progression-free
      survival) with standard fractionation.

      II. To determine the incidence of grade 2 or greater GU and GI toxicity with this regimen at
      6 months, 2 years and 3 years.

      III. To assess quality of life issues following completion of radiation therapy at 6 months
      and at 2 years.

      IV. To assess incidence of impotence after the use of proton therapy at 3 years.

      V. To determine freedom from biochemical failure (BF) at 5 years.

      VI. To determine clinical failure: local and/or distant at 5 years. VII. To determine salvage
      androgen deprivation (SAD) use at 5 years. VIII. To determine progression free survival:
      using clinical, biochemical and SAD as events at 5 years.

      IX. To determine overall survival at 5 years. X. To determine disease-specific survival at 5
      years.

      XI. Estimate prostate and normal structures movement during RT with the use of scans.

      XII. Correlate pathologic and radiologic findings with outcomes at 5 years. XIII. Correlate
      PSA and free PSA levels with outcomes at 5 years. XIV. Correlate testosterone levels and
      variation with proton therapy and outcomes at 5 years.

      XV. Develop a quality assurance process for proton prostate therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo proton radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for approximately 9 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 months, every 6 months for 5
      years, and then annually thereafter.
