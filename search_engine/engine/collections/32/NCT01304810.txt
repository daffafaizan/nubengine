      second year. These predecessor studies, Nabi-4514 (NCT#00836199) and Nabi-4515 (NCT#01102114)
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of 6 vaccinations of NicVAX or placebo as an aid to smoking
      cessation. The two phase III studies are one year in duration, and subjects who complete
      these studies are eligible to enroll in Nabi-4522. As the phase III studies are ongoing,
      subject assignment to NicVAX or placebo will remain masked. No intervention will be
      administered in Nabi-4522. Subjects will be followed for immunogenicity (anti-nicotine
      antibody level)and for safety.
