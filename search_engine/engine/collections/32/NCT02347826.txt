      between October 2013 and November 2014. The procedures has been executed in our aesthetic
      clinics in Milan, Bologna, Turin, Genoa, Rome, Asti, San Remo and Palermo.

      Among the 243 patients, 217 were females and 26 males, with age ranging from 19 to 76 years.
      103 patients underwent only facial lift, of which 12 only in the frontal area, 61 only on
      cheek and malar area, and 30 on both the areas.

      39 patients underwent only cervical lift, of those 14 by means of appliance of 1 or 2 wires,
      25 by means of appliance of more than 2 wires.

      101 patients underwent both facial and cervical non surgical lift. We sent to every patient a
      email questionnaire1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after treatment.

      In the questionnaire, patients has been asked to enter a value between 1 and 5 about
      subjective satisfaction regarding the aesthetic improvement (ranging from 1, poor, to 5,
      excellent), and discomfort related to treatment (ranging from 1, no perceived discomfort, to
      5, impossibility to execute working and social activities).

      The data has been analyzed and related to other factors such as:

        -  number of wires applied on each patient

        -  other aesthetic or regenerative medicine treatments executed on the same patient on the
           same year

        -  total expenditure related to aesthetic treatments in the same year
