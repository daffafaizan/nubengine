      failures in allogeneic transplantation for advanced hematologic malignancies. The most
      commonly utilized conditioning regimens consist of cyclophosphamide and total-body
      irradiation or busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Other agents such as etoposide or thiotepa are
      sometimes added to maximize the antileukemic effect. New conditioning regimens are however
      still needed to maximize efficacy and limit treatment-related deaths. Over the past several
      years, the investigators have evaluated several new conditioning regimens that incorporate
      fludarabine, a novel immunosuppressant that has limited toxicity and that has synergistic
      activity with alkylating agents. Recent data have suggested that fludarabine may be used in
      combination with standard doses of oral or IV busulfan, thus reducing the toxicity previously
      observed with cyclophosphamide/ busulfan regimens.
