      To utilize multiple naturally-occurring bioalkaloids, bioactive "compounds of interest" from
      multiple sources, to influence prostate, breast, and uterine cancer pathways in cancer
      patients and cancer patients in remission. Other cancer types may be applicable.

      To utilize specific naturally-occurring bioalkaloids and bioactive "compounds of interest" to
      suppress cancer proliferation-stimulation/growth activities induced by normal cancer
      metabolism including environmental estrogen impact, estrogen-mimicking compounds,
      estrogen-influencing and testosterone-type compounds.

      To utilize DNA interaction with proliferating cancer cells via intercalation, which has a
      binding impact activity that then impairs DNA polymerase furthering DNA strand breakage and
      complete apoptosis. In addition, these bioactive compounds through intercalation, prevent
      cancer-cell DNA strand breakage from re-connection and repair, (limitlessness) while
      depleting nuclear topoisomerase, the enzyme also targeted by a number of conventional
      chemotherapy routes. Finally; a number of the bioalkaloids binds to cancer telomeres capping
      them at specific number or reducing them to "one and done."

      Natural GRAS compounds, in previous studies that background this research, reduced secondary
      bonding of TMPRSS2-ERG fusing affecting testosterone & estrogen hormone influence in cell
      proliferation. Variant mRNAs of, for example, the TMPRSS2-ERG fusing pathway were affected
      whereas normalized mRNAs in all other cells were not, a mechanism and chemistry not readily
      understood.

      To utilize natural extracted plant compounds as a means to influence DIABLO (direct inhibitor
      of apoptosis binding protein with low isoelectric point) by downregulating over 350 genes
      which influence extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, and complement coagulation
      cascades were upregulated.

      To utilize applications of, or ingestion of, specifically grown plant species/subspecies,
      extract the "compounds of action" or "compounds of activity" but maintaining an
      "entourage-affect by protecting "multi-compound complex arrangement chemistry" to maintain
      normal metabolic functionality of the compounds of interest..

      BACKGROUND DATA:

      Pharmaceutica has, since the turn of the 1800s to the 1900s, tried to find, extract and/or
      synthesize plant & biological compounds that have the highest activity in a given medical
      treatment regime. In many cases the object was to get to the heart of the active compound,
      discarding non-active compounds,and, in other cases for various reasons including stockholder
      satisfaction, to be able to patent the synthesis chemistry and prevent duplication by
      competitors.

      The one point of this important to this work is that the natural multi-compounds were the
      "compounds of action" for centuries and in most cases, in the natural form they were utilized
      in pre-20th century medicine, while the action of control was usually much slower, the side
      affects were non-existent.

      Recent research (sic) now places a more important role of the "multi-compound" and the
      "entourage-effect' they have as cancer cells are quick to evolve, like viruses, and where the
      pharmaceutica "single compound of action" approach works well when ALL the cancer cells are
      eliminated, does not work well when surviving cells evolve to create resistance...a common
      outcome to most advanced stage cancers.

      The "entourage-effect" using the "multi-compound" natural extracted compounds appears to
      negate the evolution/resistance response of cancerous cells by having multiple "chemistries
      of action" involved the cancer-control process which then hides/disguises the metabolic
      pathway of control from the surviving cancer cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral natural supplements comprising indole-3-carbinol, perillyl
      alcohol, glucuronic acid, and flavonoids daily for 12 months. Patients also consume whole
      foods comprising indole-3-carbinol and a diet that eliminates exogenous growth hormones.

      Arm II: Patients do not receive natural supplements or consume whole foods or a special diet.

      Levels of compounds of interest are measured by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry,
      high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 6 months and
      monitored for a second 6 months period.
