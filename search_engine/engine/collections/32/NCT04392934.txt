      patients on pain, range of motion, muscle strength, joint position sense and functionality
      and its relation to the acromion shape. Fifty patients (26 female, 24 male) with SIS were
      evaluated in this study. Patiens were divided into 3 groups according to the their acromion
      morphology. A conservative physiotherapy method was applied to the patients. All patients
      were evaluated before and 4 weeks after the treatment.
