      arm define the treatment to be received in the first single dose phase (lasting 8 hours after
      the 1st treatment intake) and in the subsequent multiple-dose phase (lasting from the second
      treatment intake up to the 8 hours after the last intake). Namely:

        -  DKP/TRAM followed by DKP/TRAM;

        -  DKP followed by DKP;

        -  TRAM followed by TRAM;

        -  placebo followed by DKP;

        -  placebo followed by TRAM;

        -  placebo followed by DKP/TRAM;

      The analyses of endpoints pertinent to the single dose phase were performed combining all the
      3 treatment arms including placebo into one group, which resulted in the following 4 analysis
      groups: DKP/TRAM, DEXKETOPROFEN, TRAMADOL, and Placebo.

      The analysis of endpoints pertinent to the multiple dose phase were performed combining the
      treatment arms including the same active treatment, which resulted in the following 3
      analysis groups: DKP/TRAM, DEXKETOPROFEN, and TRAMADOL.
