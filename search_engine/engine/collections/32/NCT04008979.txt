      levels, 325 mg or 650 mg, of either PL-ASA or immediate release aspirin within a two week
      washout period between treatments. The primary objectives are to assess PK and PD
      bioequivalence and safety over a twenty four hour period for PL-ASA and immediate release
      aspirin at 325 mg and 650 mg dose strengths.
