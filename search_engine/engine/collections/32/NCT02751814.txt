      approximately 1 year. Surveys, anthropometric measures, and screen-time observations will
      take approximately 1 day each to complete, and the child will be given an accelerometer to
      wear at home for 7 days at both baseline and 1 year follow-up. Fundamental motor skill
      assessments will take place at baseline and 1 year follow-up after the 7 days of
      accelerometer wear. Staff members will spend approximately 2 weeks at each childcare center
      at baseline and 1 year follow-up to complete study procedures with each child.
