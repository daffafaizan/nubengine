    
      Domperidone is a dopamine-2 receptor antagonist. It acts as a prokinetic agent through its
      effects on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and the motor function of the stomach and small
      intestines. It does not cause any adverse neurological symptoms and has an excellent safety
      profile for long-term oral administration in recommended doses.

      In the United States, domperidone is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      and cannot be obtained by routine prescriptions or covered by health care insurance plans. It
      is also illegal to write a prescription for the subject to obtain the drug outside the U.S.
      Domperidone can be administered legally by obtaining a FDA Investigational New Drug (IND)
      application with Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.

      This study will follow FDA and IRB regulations and provide domperidone to subjects with
      gastrointestinal disorders who have failed from standard therapy.
