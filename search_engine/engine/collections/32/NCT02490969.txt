    
      Registry of an interventional Study-proved Strategy (BIC-8) using Copeptin and Troponin for
      the Early Rule-Out of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) in Patients with Suspected Acute
      Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and a low-to intermediate risk profile.

      Primary objective:

      To monitor the safety of the early rule-out strategy using combined testing of copeptin and
      troponin at admission of patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of ACS and a low- to
      intermediate risk profile, who are discharged or moved to another hospital after testing
      copeptin and troponin negative (defined as copeptin below 10 pmol/l and cardiac troponin
      below 99th percentile URL).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To monitor routine application of the early rule-out strategy, patient characteristics,
           risk profile of all patients tested for copeptin and troponin at admission, irrespective
           of their biomarker test result

        -  To monitor diagnoses, clinical course and outcome of all patients tested for copeptin
           and troponin at admission
