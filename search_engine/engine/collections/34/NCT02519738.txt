      significant problem. This tissue may cause drainage or bleeding that bothers patients and
      parents. Numerous methods of treatment are used for treatment of hypergranulation tissue, but
      no data exists to support one method of treatment over another. The investigators plan to
      perform a prospective randomized trial of three different therapies (silver nitrate
      cauterization, topical kenalog, and soapcloth abrasion) to identify the best treatment
      modality. Participants will be followed via office visit at four and eight weeks after
      initiation of therapy. Measurements of the granulation tissue and photographs will be
      obtained pre treatment and at each post treatment visit. In addition parents will be asked to
      fill out a pre and post treatment survey regarding improvement in symptoms. Investigators
      plan to enroll 120 patients total with the intention of having 40 participants in each group.
