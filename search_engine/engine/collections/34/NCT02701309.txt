    
      This trial is a proof-of-concept study using a prototype fiber optic fluorometer to acquire
      autofluorescence spectra in children aged 9 months to 5 years and determine the erythrocyte
      zinc protoporphyrin-IX fluorescence intensity from these spectra. The non-invasively
      determined fluorescence spectra are evaluated to provide a quantitative measure of the
      erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX/heme concentration ratio. These values are primarily
      compared to an erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX determined by HPLC from residual blood
      samples from the same subjects and secondarily to erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX/heme
      ratios determined using a commercial hematofluorometer (AVIV, model 206d) and other
      indicators of iron status, including hemoglobin, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin,
      transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptor

      This study could help to establish the non-invasive fluorescence measurement of zinc
      protoporphyrin-IX as a rapid, easy to use means for point-of-care screening for iron
      deficiency in resource-limited settings lacking laboratory infrastructure.
