      surgeons is for brow and lid ptosis. Although some patients that present for these entities
      require surgery, most will decline to have surgical intervention. Alternative treatments
      include brow lifting with botulinum toxins.

      Brow lifting with botulinum toxins may be performed by injecting the muscles responsible for
      brow and lid depression. These muscles include: the corrugators, procerus, medical aspect of
      the frontalis and the depressor component of the orbicularis oculi muscles. By relaxing these
      muscles, the brow elevators may be able to lift the brow and help both brow and lid ptosis.
      This trial is unique as it utilizes Dysport to treat an entire anatomic muscle group (the
      brow depressors) rather than injecting isolated muscles._
