      pain neurophysiology education and shoulder/neck exercises (n=21) or no intervention (n=22).
      Data on pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), pain disability, neck flexor and extensor
      muscles endurance, scapulae stabilizers endurance, pain catastrophizing (Pain catastrophizing
      Scale), trait and state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and knowledge of pain
      neurophysiology (Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire) were collected. Measurements were
      taken before and after the intervention.

      Statistical analysis were performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.
