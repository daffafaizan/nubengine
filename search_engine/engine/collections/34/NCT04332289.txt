      understood. It is generally assumed that PHH is caused by excess insulin secretion, either
      due to an intrinsic beta-cell abnormality (histology showing increased beta-cell mass or
      signs of hyperfunction) and/or increased postprandial insulinotropic signals (also known as
      the incretin-effect) as a consequence of the re-arranged gastrointestinal tract and
      accelerated nutrient transit and absorption. Either of the two explanations would imply an
      altered insulin turnover in these patients with higher amounts of pre-stored insulin and/or
      accelerated de-novo insulin synthesis in response to stimulus-depletion of the available
      insulin pool. A non-invasive in vivo technique to study insulin turnover has not been
      established yet and data related to PHH are consequently lacking.

      The primary objective of this study is to observe the kinetics of pre-stored and de-novo
      synthesized insulin that is secreted into the circulation using an in-vivo heavy water (D2O)
      labelling experiment in patients with postprandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (PHH) and
      non-surgical non-PHH controls. The investigators hypothesize that the suggested
      methodological approach is feasible to assess insulin turnover and provides the foundation
      for further studies in different target groups.
