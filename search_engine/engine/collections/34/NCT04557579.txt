      presence of cataract in both eyes, age between 50 and 80 years, and corrected distance visual
      acuity (CDVA) of both eyes under 20/40. Phacoemulsification cataract surgery was arranged for
      both eyes for all patients. The study groups of IOL models include EDOF Symfony IOL (AMO,
      Santa Ana, CA, USA), bifocal Restor +2.5D IOL (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA), and monofocal
      Sensar AR40e IOL (AMO, Santa Ana, CA, USA). The patients were routinely examined
      preoperatively as well as 1 month after surgery for far and near visual acuity (in LogMAR
      unit). Contrast sensitivity, wavefront aberration and quality of vision questionnaire was
      measured at the 1-month postoperative visit. These aforementioned outcomes were recorded and
      compared between groups.
