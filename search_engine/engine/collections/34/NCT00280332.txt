      increasing. Screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the cancer incidence and mortality by
      detecting early lesions. However, the best interval for a follow up colonoscopy, particularly
      for those with normal baseline colonoscopy, remains largely unknown.

      This study aim to determine the prevalence of colonic neoplasm in average-risk patients who
      had previously undergone screening colonoscopy and the optimal time interval for
      re-screening.
