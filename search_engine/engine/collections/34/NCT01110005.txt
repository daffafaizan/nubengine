      fluids for maintenance hydration during labor. This study will be conducted at 4 sites:
      Reading (Reading Hospital), Allentown (Lehigh Valley), St. Luke Hospital and Hershey (Penn
      State College of Medicine). It will include 1524 pregnant women at â‰¥ 36 weeks presenting in
      spontaneous labor for anticipated delivery.

      The primary research hypothesis is that intravenous hydration during labor with a
      glucose-containing fluid will lead to more efficient uterine contractility and will lead to a
      reduction of cesarean delivery. The primary outcome measure is the occurrence of a cesarean
      birth during the study period. The primary analysis will use an intent-to-treat approach to
      examine differences between the two IV fluid treatments in the proportion of deliveries
      requiring cesarean section.
