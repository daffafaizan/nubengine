      I. To evaluate the ability of UDCA (ursodiol) treatment to reverse oxidative deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) damage in the esophageal epithelium of subjects with Barrett's esophagus.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of UDCA treatment on gastric bile acid composition and on cell
      proliferation in Barrett's epithelium.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ursodiol orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.
