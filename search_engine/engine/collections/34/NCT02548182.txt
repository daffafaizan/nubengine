      incentives, the study employed a three-arm, open label randomized controlled trial design:
      control, smartcare, and smartcare plus financial incentives. The investigators hypothesized
      that the 'smartcare + financial incentive' arm will show the greatest change in outcomes,
      followed by the 'smartcare' only arm, and lastly the control arm. Specific aims of the study
      are as follows:

        -  To quantify the effectiveness of a 'smartcare' intervention to promote physical activity
           and reduce weight over a 12 week period.

        -  To quantify the incremental effectiveness of adding financial incentives to 'smartcare'
           intervention
