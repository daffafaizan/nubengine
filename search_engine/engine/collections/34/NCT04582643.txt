      health of mother and offspring. In Singapore, approximately one-third of women are overweight
      and obese during the preconception period. In the present pilot study, the investigators aim
      to introduce a simple, self-administered tool that can identify discrete components of an
      individual's diet, which would lead to self-awareness, self-evaluation and self-education,
      and over time, results in a positive change in eating habits and health. Specifically, the
      study aims i) to validate a newly developed tool that comprises six main dietary components
      (6P), namely Portion, Proportion, Pleasure, Phase, Physicality and Psychology in overweight
      and obese women during the preconception period; (ii) and to assess the short-term
      intervention effect of the 6P tool on dietary attitude/ practice and body weight changes over
      three months. The investigators hypothesize that intervention using this 6P tool in
      overweight and obese women will help them to promote healthy eating behaviors and reduce body
      weight within three months. This study targets to recruit 50 overweight/ obese preconception
      women, from KK Women's and Children's Hospital, to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool
      over three months period. The process for the pilot study is estimated to take six months to
      complete. This validated 6P tool is planned to be applied in a preconception targeted
      intervention cohort in order to build a positive mental model in healthy eating among
      overweight and obese women, enhancing awareness and belief towards weight management
      behavior, and promoting a healthy life cycle.
