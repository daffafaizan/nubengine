      to experience relapse than are those without infiltrates,studies suggest that severity of
      inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia in UC.

      The assessment of inflammation activity by conventional colonoscopy is inaccurate in the
      prediction of acute inflammation in some cases. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) allows
      for real-time endoscopy and histological diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. In our
      previous study, we confirmed a simplified four-grade classification system of crypt
      architecture(Grade A :normal; Grade B: an irregular arrangement of colonic crypts with normal
      size and shape, and enlarged spaces between crypts; Type C: an enlarged crypt opening and a
      more irregular crypt arrangement than type B; Type D: crypt destruction and / or crypt
      abscess) by eCLE in predicting acute inflammation, and found a good correlation with
      histology. In this study, the investigators aimed to test the accuracy of the proposed tne
      four-grade classification system in evaluating inflammation activity in UC by pCLE.
