      lnc.) for multiple molecular biomarkers including mutations with sensitivity/resistance to
      targeted therapies, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status,
      etc., Therapeutic approach and outcome will be followed-up to inspect the clinical benefit by
      large-panel analysis. In addition, selected samples will be analyzed by WES to assess the
      correctness of TMB estimated by large-panel.
