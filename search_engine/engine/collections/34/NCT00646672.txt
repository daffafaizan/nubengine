    
      Objective:

      To assess whether the hemodynamic stress of long-term common carotid artery occlusion can
      lead to cerebral aneurysm formation in young adults.

      Study population:

      100 adults 18-25 years of age who underwent common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion as a
      neonate as part of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) procedure performed in the
      setting of pulmonary insufficiency.

      Design:

      Patients who underwent CCA occlusion as a neonate for ECMO at Children's National Medical
      Center will be identified and contacted. The study will be explained and informed consent
      will be obtained. Subjects will undergo outpatient evaluation to include history and
      physical, magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head.

      Outcome measures:

        -  Cerebrovascular anatomic anomalies such as cerebral aneurysms and persistent fetal
           circulation pathways, etc.

        -  Cerebral perfusion asymmetry on MRI.

        -  Cerebral parenchymal abnormalities such as stroke.
