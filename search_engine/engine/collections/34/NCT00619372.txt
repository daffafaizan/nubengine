      transplantation. Preliminary data suggest that the oral administration of OKT3 in low dosages
      can exert an immune modulatory effect via activation of regulatory T lymphocytes.

      Î²-D glucosylceramide [GC]: Is approved for oral administration and is currently being tested
      in three clinical trials. Recent data suggested that it can serve as an immunological
      adjuvant in various clinical settings and to augment the immune response via activation of
      regulatory T cells.

      This clinical trial has been designed to assess the safety of oral administration of OKT3
      with and without co-administration of GC in healthy subjects. The use of two potential
      activators of regulatory T cells, may exert an additive effect, augmenting the systemic
      immune modulatory effect.
