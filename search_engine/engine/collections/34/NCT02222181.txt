      interferes in learning process, social and professional performance, besides being the main
      cause of dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD). In Brazil, patients are medicated for AD
      through "Programa de Medicamentos Excepcionais" (Exceptional Drug Program) that ensure the
      patient´s treatment by providing high cost medications. Even having access to, little is
      known about the effectiveness, safety and adherence of drug therapy in this group of
      patients. The research aims to promote adherence and develop strategies to address
      Drug-Related Problems (DRP's) in AD patients. For this end, we intend to conduct a
      descriptive, almost experimental and longitudinal uncontrolled research, from April 2014 to
      December 2015, at the CRIA: "Centro de Referência do Idoso de Araraquara" (Reference Centre
      for the Elderly of Araraquara). Patients included in the research must have a diagnosis of AD
      and must be using drugs supplied by the "Programa de Medicamentos Excepcionais". For data
      collection pharmaceutical care will be employed as a technique, carried out through
      pharmaceutical meetings, including the steps of initial assessment, care plan (pharmaceutical
      intervention) and results evaluation. The results will be monitored for pharmacotherapy
      adherence, cognitive assessment and other clinical parameters related to their health
      problems and resolution of DRP's before and after the proposed follow-up.The expected
      outcomes include knowledge of the medication experiences of AD patients, how they influence
      the adherence and other DRP's and how they can contribute by solving these problems, in
      addition to the impact evaluation of pharmaceutical care in cognitive improving and other
      clinical parameters monitored and evaluated individually.
