      immunosuppression and common risk factors, including sexual behavior patterns. In HIV
      seronegative women, progression of preinvasive neoplasia is relatively slow, and up to 40
      percent of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (grade I CIN/HPV-associated changes)
      regress to a normal appearance over time. Many clinicians have opted not to treat CIN
      I/HPV-associated changes due to this high spontaneous regression rate. Currently, retinoids,
      principally isotretinoin, are the most consistently effective medical therapy for
      CIN/HPV-associated changes, but use of isotretinoin in HIV-infected patients has not been
      extensively documented. (AS PER AMENDMENT 6/10/97)

      Patients are randomized to receive oral isotretinoin for 6 months or be observed only for 6
      months, with 12 additional months of follow-up. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/23/99: Follow-up time has
      been decreased to 9 months from the last patient enrolled.]
