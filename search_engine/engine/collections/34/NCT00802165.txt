      threshold as compared to sham. The outcome measurement utilized will be a digital algometer.
      The electroacupuncture treatment will consist of a total of four electroacupuncture
      treatments stimulating acupuncture points LI4 and LI11, and will be given on the same upper
      extremity tested by the algometer. The algometer measurements will occur alone on the first
      week, prior to the treatments on the second and third week, and the final reading alone on
      the fourth week.
