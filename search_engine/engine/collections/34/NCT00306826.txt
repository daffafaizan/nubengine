      on intima media thickness (IMT), heart rate variability (HRV), flow-mediated vasodilatation
      (FMD) of the brachial artery and vascular/metabolic lab parameters in patients with impaired
      glucose tolerance (IGT). Previous studies have shown a reduction in IMT for both pioglitazone
      and simvastatin in type 2 diabetics. Many patients with diabetes mellitus develop diabetic
      polyneuropathy which can be assessed by measuring HRV. It has been shown that pioglitazone
      has a positive effect on HRV in type 2 diabetics. Questions remain on the relative efficacy
      of pioglitazone and simvastatin on the parameters mentioned above. Also, there is only scarce
      data in patients with IGT (as opposed to overt diabetes mellitus). There are no data on the
      relative effects of pioglitazone and simvastatin on flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of the
      brachial artery as a surrogate marker for endothelial function.
