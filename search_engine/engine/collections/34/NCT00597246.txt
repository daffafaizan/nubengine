      [11C-methyl]-Lmethionine brain tumor PET imaging studies in patients with primary brain
      tumors who have previously been treated and are now suspect for having recurrence or
      progression of disease (a pilot study, n=20); 2) perform only 3-[18F]-FACBC PET imaging
      studies on an additional set of patients with primary brain tumors who have previously been
      treated and are now suspect for having recurrence (n=10) . 3) obtain organ/tissue and body
      radiation dosimetry information following i.v. injection of 3-[18F]-FACBC; 4) look for
      potential correlations between the scan results obtained from those patients enrolled to
      03-028 and the patients' past medical treatment; The first set of 20 patients will agree to
      two PET studies. One study will involve the i.v.

      administration of a fluorine-18 labeled amino acid analogue, 3-fluoro-aminocyclobutane
      carboxylic acid (3-[18F]-FACBC) with sequential brain and body PET imaging. The second study
      will involve i.v. administration of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine and head imaging only.

      The additional set of 10 patients will undergo one PET study which will consist of the i.v.

      administration of fluorine-18 labeled amino acid analogue, 3-fluoro-aminocyclobutane
      carboxylic acid (3-[18F]-FACBC) with one brain scan and one body scan only. The 3-[18F]-FACBC
      PET studies (n=30) will be performed under the Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC)
      guidelines as defined and established by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).
      [11C-methyl]-L-methionine is in the hospital formulary and is approved for imaging brain
      tumors at MSKCC. Our hypotheses include: 1) [18F]-FACBC has equal or better brain tumor
      imaging characteristics compared to [11C]-methionine; 2) [18F]-FACBC is not metabolized, and
      radiolabeled metabolites will not confound the interpretation of the images as can be the
      case with [11C]-methionine; 3) imaging recurrent brain tumors with [18F]-FACBC will be
      enhanced by lower brain (background) activity as compared to corresponding [11C]- methionine
      images; 4) the biodistribution of [18F]-FACBC and radiation dosimetry following i.v.
      administration of a 370 MBq (10 mCi) dose is safe and within FDA guidelines; 5) a 370 MBq (10
      mCi) dose of [18F]-FACBC is sufficient for imaging brain tumors in a clinical setting; 6) the
      accumulation of [18F]-FACBC will correlate with the patients response to prior treatment and
      will provide prognostic information with respect to tumor progression and survival.
