    
      A double-blind efficacy study will be carried out over 4 months in school age children
      enrolled in a primary school equipped with a water pump, in the rural area of the commune of
      Natitingou, Benin. Participating children will be randomly assigned to one of two groups of
      intervention or control. On a daily basis, all children will consume a defined quantity of
      pump-water outside of meals. The water offered to children in the first group of intervention
      will be previously filtered and zinc-fortified by the LSF-filter; the children in the second
      group will receive water that has been filtered only. A nutrition survey will provide an
      indication of dietary zinc intake. The effect of enriched water consumption on children's
      zinc status will be evaluated by analyzing the concentration of zinc in serum at baseline,
      midpoint and endpoint of the intervention. Diarrhea rates will be monitored by recording
      episodes of diarrhea.
