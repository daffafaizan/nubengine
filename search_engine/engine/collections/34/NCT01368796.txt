    
      This study is prospective, multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded, controlled, parallel
      group study of 3 licensed seasonal influenza vaccine products conducted in seniors, with a
      4th vaccine included in a substudy of cellular immune responses.

      Ambulatory adults 65+ years of age, in good health or with stable health conditions, given
      TIV within the past 2 years, will be recruited in multiple Canadian centres. Subjects can be
      dwelling in the community or in centers providing minimal assisted living support. A total of
      930 subjects will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be centrally (electronically) randomized to receive either TIV, IDV or AIV on
      Day 0. Three blood samples will be collected (1 pre and 2 post vaccination) to measure HAI
      antibody responses to each virus strain (H1N1, H3N2 and B) in each vaccine, using
      standardized assays. Randomly selected subsets of sera from each study group will also be
      tested for neutralizing antibody and for cross-protection against drift variants of H3N2,
      H1N1 and B viruses. In a subset of subjects in Vancouver, randomization assignments will
      include TIV2 and extra blood samples will be obtained 0, 21 and 72 days post vaccination for
      CMI testing. Safety assessments will be conducted on Day 7, Day 21 and Day 180 following
      vaccination. Acceptability of each product, reflecting the frequency, severity and
      tolerability of adverse effects, will be assessed.
