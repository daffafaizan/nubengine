    
      This randomized controlled study will involve at least 50 evaluable subjects divided evenly
      among 5 study sites in Taiwan. Each study site will enroll 12 subjects at least. The ration
      of evaluable test subjects to control subjects will be 2 to 1. Subjects who have normal
      ocular health and conform to a set of standard criteria will wear one of the study lenses on
      two eyes and follow up for 3 months (90 days). Lenses will be assigned to subject according
      to a predetermined randomized order. It is necessary to remove contact lenses every day and
      replace after 30 days. Any unscheduled visit will be allowed when there is a medication
      necessary. The data for slit lamp findings, symptoms/problems/complaints, keratometry (K)
      reading, refractive changes (absolute value), visual acuity data, average wear time (AWT),
      discontinuations, and lens replacement will be collected to claim that the VISCO Soft Contact
      Lens is as safe and effective as BIOFINITY (comfilcon A) Soft Contact Lens (CooperVision).
