      in anemic patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. After successfully completing a 6 month
      enrollment period, qualifying patients were randomized to receive 1000mg of IV iron over a
      four week period, or no iron supplementation. Erythropoietin regimen was to remain stable.
      Patients were followed to day 71 for safety and efficacy.
