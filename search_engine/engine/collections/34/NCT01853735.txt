      record. This record will be accessed to determine if this variable is accomplished.
      Additionally, any dehiscence complication will be recorded (which would impact the long-term
      fascial closure rate). Infectious complications (abscess, pneumonia, etc) will be adjudicated
      by the primary clinician and any record of this in the patient chart will be recorded.
