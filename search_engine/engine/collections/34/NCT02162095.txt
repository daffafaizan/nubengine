      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Coronary artery disease has often been linked
      causally to COPD, but the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning this association
      remain speculative. A retrospective case-control study matching COPD patients and controls
      one to one for smoking history and conventional cardiovascular risk factors will be performed
      to study the association between COPD and cardiovascular outcomes. Filling in this knowledge
      gap may contribute to the understanding of the interplay between COPD and cardiovascular
      disease.

      The objective of this retrospective case-control study is to determine whether COPD might be
      a risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis, impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, and
      major adverse cardiovascular events independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors.
