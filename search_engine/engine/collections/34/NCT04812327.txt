    
      This multi-center, prospective, observational, diagnostic evaluation study is designed to
      assess the performance of the BD Veritor System in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
      asymptomatic individuals compared to viral culture and a commercially available RT-PCR assay
      over multiple testing time points. The study will enroll a minimum of 150 asymptomatic, adult
      participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during community/traveler screening procedures.
