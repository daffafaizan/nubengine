      epidemic proportions. Lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise are recommended as
      first-line intervention for treating metabolic syndrome. Previously, we reported that
      specific phytochemical supplementation for 12 weeks (soy protein, phytosterols, rho iso-alpha
      acids and proanthocyanidins) increased the effectiveness of the modified Mediterranean-style
      low glycemic load dietary program on variables associated with metabolic syndrome and CVD in
      subjects with metabolic syndrome and elevated LDL cholesterol. In this study, we propose to
      conduct a multi-center randomized trial to confirm our previous findings.
