    
      DESIGN: An observation cohort study conducted in a tertiary hospital.

      METHODS: Data will be collected from patients along the ICU-hospital discharge continuum,
      will be analysed and non-parametric tests will be used to explore association between
      variables.

      Outcome measures: Muscle strength, as a component of physical function, will be evaluated
      with the Medical Research Council sum score (MRC- SS) at discharge from ICU and at hospital
      discharge; the Functional Status Score for the ICU (FSS-ICU) will also be assessed at
      hospital discharge. Data on participants' demographics, ICU admission and hospital admission
      will also be collected.

      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESEARCH: Understanding how physical function is affected in patients
      with severe COVID-19 may help develop future prevention, therapeutic and follow-up strategies
      that improve quality of care and outcomes in this specific group of patients. Findings from
      this study may be useful to design future larger cohort studies and experimental trials.
