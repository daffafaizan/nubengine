      volunteers to assess risk factors. As these healthy volunteers are providing samples solely
      for research purposes, there is no standard of care for these volunteers, with the exception
      of a positive HIV result during screening. The Department of Genetic Medicine will enroll
      healthy controls and the Hospital for Special Surgery will enroll subjects with Systemic
      Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) for a comparative analysis of the two cohorts (Table I). Laboratory
      testing on all blood samples will be done at the Hospital for Special Surgery.
