      in North America and Europe. CS complicates approximately 5-14% of all cases of acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI) and is the most common cause of death in patients hospitalized
      with AMI. Cardiogenic shock developing during the course of AMI is the end result of a
      pathophysiological cycle secondary to a sudden and significant decrease in cardiac
      contractility due to infarction, ischemia, and stunning of large myocardial segments. It is
      not anticipated that further advances in reperfusion or revascularization therapy will have a
      significant additional impact on survival in patients with CS. Modalities that protect the
      myocardium during ischemia and reperfusion are likely to be the next major advance in
      improving outcome in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI), especially in patients
      with large infarcts complicated by shock. Preliminary studies investigating nitric oxide
      synthase (NOS) inhibition suggest that improvements in cardiovascular function and survival
      are possible by limiting formation of toxic NO. The primary objective of the TRIUMPH study is
      to establish the efficacy of Tilarginine Acetate Injection compared to placebo in reducing
      all cause mortality at 30 days post randomization in patients with cardiogenic shock
      complicating acute myocardial infarction (MI). Safety objectives of this study include an
      evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events, and key laboratory parameters.
