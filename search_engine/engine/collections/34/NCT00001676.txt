      therapy is effective for treating patients with severe lupus nephritis, but may result in
      substantial rates of sustained amenorrhea. Initial studies in patients with autoimmune
      rheumatic diseases have also suggested a beneficial effect from the lymphocyte-specific
      nucleoside analogs chlorodeoxyadenosine and fludarabine. Cyclophosphamide induces DNA
      cross-links whereas, nucleoside analogs inhibits DNA repair indicating complementary and
      partially synergistic modes of action. Whether combination of lower doses of cyclophosphamide
      with nucleoside analogs will increase efficacy while at the same time minimize toxicity from
      higher-cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide has not been determined. In this phase I/II
      study, 15 patients with proliferative lupus nephritis will be treated as outpatients with a
      combination of oral cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m(2)) on day 1 followed by fludarabine (30
      mg/m(2)) subcutaneously on days 1, 2 and 3 every month for 3 cycles. The cumulative dose of
      cyclophosphamide in this regimen is approximately 2.5g as compared to greater than or equal
      to 30g in the standard NIH cyclophosphamide regimen. In this study the tolerance and toxicity
      of this combination will be studied. Regeneration of T and B cells following depletion
      including analysis of antigen-repertoire and function will also be examined. Preliminary
      efficacy information, including rates and time to renal remission and rates of preservation
      of renal function, will be analyzed to be used for future controlled studies. Pharmacokinetic
      analysis will be performed on a subset of patients to determine the bioavailability and
      pharmacokinetic parameters of subcutaneous fludarabine.
