      safety and effectiveness of infliximab in patients with active Rheumatoid Arthritis, despite
      methotrexate treatment. Infliximab is an anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2). The
      primary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline in American College of
      Rheumatology (ACR20) response at week 30, and the change in the modified van der Heijde Sharp
      Score. The ACR20 Responder Index a composite of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures
      and the van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) scoring method is a method of rating structural damage
      in patients..

      Patients will be treated with either infliximab or matching placebo.
