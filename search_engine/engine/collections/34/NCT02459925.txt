      participants as they navigate their journeys to sustainable employment that pays a
      family-supporting wage. Participants will be guided through an individualized progression of
      services designed to increase their employability, to increase their ability to earn higher
      incomes in career-track employment, and to improve their chances of retaining jobs and
      advancing in them.

      The MOMS Mental Health program centers around a manualized Stress Management Course 8-class
      group treatment, delivered once per week. The course was adapted from "The Mother and Child
      Course" by Munoz and Le (2011) for the population of New Haven mothers who are served by the
      MOMS Partnership.
