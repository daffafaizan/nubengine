      countries. Obese people are at a higher risk for developing various comorbidities: type II
      diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, coagulation disorders,
      degenerative joint disease, some types of cancer, sleep apnea and urinary incontinence Women
      suffering from obesity are more likely to develop urinary incontinence, especially when
      related to stress. Excess weight is a modifiable risk factor. It is believed that weight
      reduction may be an effective treatment for urinary incontinence. The aim of this study is to
      analyze the effects of weight loss induced by bariatric surgery on pelvic floor function.
      Taking into account that modest weight loss (5% to 10%) already brings benefits to women with
      obesity and incontinence, one may assume even more marked improvement owing to the massive
      loss of weight by surgical means.
