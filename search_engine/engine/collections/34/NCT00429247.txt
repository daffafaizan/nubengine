      trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN) given after the completion of the standard adjuvant chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy versus observation in patients with stage I-III operable breast cancer who have
      detectable cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) mRNA-positive tumor cells in the bone marrow or the
      peripheral blood before and/or after the adjuvant treatment.
