      messages and tools developed under prior NCI-funded applications combined with newly
      developed messaging specific to this application. Throughout development, the principal
      investigator will seek input and guidance from a quality improvement team at the Henry Ford
      Health System (HFHS) (i.e., the local performance site) that is tasked with patient portal
      innovation for Meaningful Use. Once finalized, the effectiveness of e-assist will be
      evaluated using a three-arm, practical randomized trial.

      Trial participants will be randomized to one of the following three groups:

        1. e-assist: Colon Health (treatment arm) [n = 900]

        2. Healthwise Educational Program (active control) [n = 900]

        3. Usual care control (observational only) [n = 900]

      For the evaluation, the investigators employ an intent-to-treat design with primary
      effectiveness measured by electronic health record (EHR)-documented CRC screening use.
      Secondary outcomes of interest include patient-reported CRC screening intent, perceived
      barriers to and support for CRC screening as well as perceived susceptibility and screening
      benefits. Results from all analyses will be used to develop an implementation guide for the
      dissemination and implementation of e-assist among diverse primary care practices.
