      treatment dropout rates along with a failure to target the relevant underlying neural
      mechanisms. Neuromodulation of deep limbic areas such as the amygdala may play a critical
      role in the effective recovery from traumatic stress. Human studies have shown the importance
      of such modulation during the encoding of traumatic stimuli, showing greater amygdala
      activation for subsequently remembered traumatic stimuli. In addition, a prospective study
      among previously healthy soldiers showed that hyper-activation of the amygdala prior to
      military traumatic exposure corresponded with more severe post-traumatic symptoms following
      exposure.

      Together these finding points to the amygdala as a plausible neuromodulation target for
      preventive or early interventions of post-traumatic disturbances. Local neuromodulation of
      the amygdala could improve treatment specificity and the overall intervention outcome.

      The main goal of the suggested research is to further develop and implement a non-invasive,
      portable and cost-effective brain-imaging tool that will provide individual on-line guidance
      for amygdala modulation. This closed-loop brain training will enhance individual resilience
      to and coping with potentially traumatic stress as well as alleviate consequential
      psychopathologies.
