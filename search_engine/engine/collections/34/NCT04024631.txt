      the biobank populations who have agreed to be recontacted for future research. Each
      participant will undergo a frequently sampled four-hour oral glucose tolerance test and whole
      body DXA scan (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) in addition to baseline laboratory and
      history assessment.
