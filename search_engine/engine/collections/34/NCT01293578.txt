      (Diabetes Medication Choice Cards) versus usual care as strategies to translate CER into
      practice among patients with poorly controlled diabetes in need of drug intensification
      (Hemoglobin Alc (HbA1c) > 7.3%). Patient outcomes including reaching glycemic control target
      (HbA1c less than or equal to 7.3%), medication choice and adherence, satisfaction and
      knowledge. From the physician perspective, we will be measuring physician adoption and
      satisfaction with the decision aid.

      To identify, describe, and explain factors that promote or inhibit the uptake of complex
      interventions such as decision aids in practices participating in the trial.

      To conduct an exploratory analysis of the ability of patients to adhere to the medications
      chosen while exploring the factors that enable or hinder the patients' ability to incorporate
      these medications into their routine.
