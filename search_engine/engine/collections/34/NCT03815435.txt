      surgical field in pansinusoperation in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Balanced
      anaesthesia using volatile anaesthetics (Desflurane + Sufentanil) is compared to total
      intravenous anaesthesia (Propofol + Sufentanil). A secondary goal of the study is to compare
      circulatory parameters, depth of anaesthesia and consumption of hypotensives in these two
      groups of patients.

      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the clarity of the surgical field at various
      levels of the mean arterial pressure.

      This study is being realized in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been
      approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Ostrava (849/2018). According to
      the statement of the State Institute for Drug Control of 26th April 2019 (reference number
      Sukl96964/2019), the trial is not considered a clinical trial of medicinal products.

      Study type: Single-blind study (the surgeon does not know the value of the patient's blood
      pressure) prospective observational study.
