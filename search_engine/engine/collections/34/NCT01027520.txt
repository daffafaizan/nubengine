      dressing will be applied to the participant's hand(s)during surgery for a skin graft. This
      portion will occur whether the participant agrees to participate or not. The participant will
      begin range of motion exercises the day after surgery (post operative day one) with and
      occupational therapist. The occupational therapist will see the participant daily for
      supervised range of motion while in the hospital. The coban dressing will be removed on post
      operative day one if a sheet graft is placed to assess bleeding under graft. The coban
      dressing will be reapplied and removed again on post operative day four. When a meshed graft
      is placed, coban dressing will be removed on post operative day four only. All skin grafts
      (meshed and sheet grafts) and range of motion will be assessed on post operative day four.
      Coban dressing will be reapplied. The participant will continue range of motion exercise
      program at home. An appointment will be scheduled for 3 consecutive weeks in out patient burn
      clinic. During clinic visits, skin graft, range of motion, and grip strength will be
      measured. The participant will seen in out patient burn clinic whether they choose to
      participate in the study or not as a standard of burn care.
