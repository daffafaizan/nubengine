      metabolism in patients with CKD. When kidney function is poor, levels of vitamin D, phosphate
      and parathyroid hormone become abnormal and patients are at risk for bone disease and
      fractures (renal osteodystrophy) and the deposition of calcium in blood vessels and muscles.
      CKD-MBD increases the risk of fractures, heart attacks, strokes, and death. Treatment of
      CKD-MBD is focused on lowering levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by giving vitamin D and
      lowering levels of phosphorous by giving phosphate binders. In patients with end stage kidney
      disease (ESKD), target levels of PTH recommended by the Kidney Disease Improving Global
      Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines are in the range of 2-9 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for
      the PTH assay. In many cases, in patients with long-standing ESKD, the parathyroid gland may
      no longer respond to treatment with vitamin D and phosphate lowering. In these cases,
      treatment with a calcimimetic, a medicine that increases the sensitivity of the parathyroid
      gland to serum levels of calcium, can restore PTH levels to goal.
