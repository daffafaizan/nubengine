      (CVD). Frailty is a frequent condition among LT candidates. Together, CVD and frailty are
      major causes of morbidity and mortality before and after LT. Conventional methods to diagnose
      and predict CVD in LT candidates lack sensitivity and clinically relevant application.
      However, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can directly estimate coronary artery
      disease, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, and indirectly assess frailty. Such versatility of CPET
      has caused it to become the standard of care in many LT centers outside of the United States.
      In preliminary work that will be used to fund a more definitive study (RO1), the
      investigators plan to investigate CVD and frailty in LT candidates, both from existing
      standard of care (SOC) methods and CPET. The investigators expect results to improve the
      assessment of CVD and frailty in LT, ultimately changing practice. The investigators'
      proposal will pursue the following Specific Aims (SA):

      Aim 1: Prospectively determine agreement between cardiopulmonary exercise testing and cardiac
      stress testing (SOC), for the identification of subclinical coronary artery disease in liver
      transplant candidates.

      Aim 2: Prospectively determine agreement between cardiopulmonary exercise testing and
      dobutamine stress echocardiogram (SOC), for the identification of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in
      liver transplant candidates.

      Aim 3: Prospectively determine agreement between peak oxygen consumption from cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing and the liver frailty index or the six-minute walk test (SOC), for the
      identification of frailty in liver transplant candidates.
