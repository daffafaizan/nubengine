    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the efficacy of CC-5013 (lenalidomide) in prolonging time to disease
      progression in patients with multiple myeloma after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if CC-5013 will increase the complete response (CR) rate in patients with
      multiple myeloma following ASCT.

      II. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with
      multiple myeloma who have undergone ASCT and who then are randomized to either CC-5013 or
      placebo.

      III. To determine the feasibility of long-term administration of CC-5013 to multiple myeloma
      patients who have undergone ASCT.

      OUTLINE:

      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL (PBSC) MOBILIZATION: Mobilization of autologous PBSC will be
      performed according to institutional guidelines.

      AUTOLOGOUS PBSC TRANSPLANTATION (PBSCT): Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over
      30-60 minutes on day -2 or -1 or over 2 days on days -3 and -2 or -2 and -1. Patients undergo
      autologous PBSCT on day 0.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 maintenance treatment arms. (Note: As of 12/17/09, no
      more patients will be randomized between lenalidomide and placebo. Patients who have not been
      randomized as of 12/17/09 will be assigned to lenalidomide.)

      ARM I: Beginning between day 100-110, patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily.

      ARM II: Beginning between day 100-110, patients receive placebo (PO) once daily.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
