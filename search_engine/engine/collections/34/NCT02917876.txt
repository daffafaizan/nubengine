      pregnant women. Subjects will have:

        1. measurements of body composition

        2. anthropometric measures

        3. sleep and mood questionnaires

        4. Home sleep studies

        5. blood testing for biological markers

        6. salivary testing for hormonal markers

        7. pulmonary function tests and upper airway patency measurements

      Women without sleep apnea at enrollment will then be followed longitudinally for the
      development of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy with repeat assessment during their
      third trimester. Women diagnosed with sleep apnea at enrollment will have no further
      assessment in late pregnancy.

      Monetary incentives will also be issued at data collection points. Subjects will receive
      small gift incentives such as baby-related items.
