      intensity to effect progressive effacement and dilation of the cervix prior to term gestation
      (between 20 and 37 weeks).

      It is a major health problem of increased incidence, affecting approximately between 7-10% of
      pregnant women in developed countries with a high socioeconomic costs and high rates of fetal
      mortality, although perinatal progress.

      This study may allow to establish the existence of differences in perinatal outcomes and to
      define the first choice drug for tocolysis.
