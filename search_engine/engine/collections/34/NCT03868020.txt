      I. To estimate positive predictive value with a corresponding 95% confidence interval for
      fluciclovine F18 (18F fluciclovine) positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET CT)
      to detect a primary site of disease in patients presenting with cervical metastatic nodal
      disease but a head and neck primary site not apparent on CT of the neck with contrast
      (contrast enhanced-computed tomography, CE-CT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate positive predictive value with a corresponding 95% confidence interval for
      fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F FDG) PET CT in the detection of a primary site of disease in
      patients presenting with cervical metastatic nodal disease but a head and neck primary site
      not apparent on CT of the neck with contrast.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the lesion to background (L/B) ratios for nodal metastatic disease between 18F
      fluciclovine PET CT and 18F FDG PET CT.

      II. To estimate the sensitivity of 18F fluciclovine PET CT and 18F FDG PET CT to detect nodal
      disease.

      III. To evaluate for any trends in findings on 18F fluciclovine PET CT and human
      papillomavirus (HPV) status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluciclovine F18 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan over 20-30
      minutes.
