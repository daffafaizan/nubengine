      autoimmune disease of psoriasis. This neutrophil recruiting cytokine is produced by IL-17A
      producing CD4+ T cells (Th17) and gamma/delta T cells of the skin and evokes an inflammation
      circuit finally leading to the classical clinical picture of psoriasis with hyper- and
      parakeratosis, erythema, scaling and neutrophil abscess formation.

      Besides genetic factors, lifestyle factors are relevant and decide if an autoimmune disease
      becomes manifest. It was shown previously that increased salt (sodium chloride, NaCl)
      concentrations boost the induction of murine and human Th17 cells. However, more - and also
      clinical - studies are needed to understand the correlation between salt content and IL-17A
      in autoimmune diseases.

      This study investigates the hypothesis if skin sodium content in human psoriasis is increased
      in order to get further insight into the IL-17A-salt-interplay.
