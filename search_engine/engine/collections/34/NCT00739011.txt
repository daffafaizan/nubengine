    
      All patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea presenting at the Auckland Hospital Sleep
      Laboratory and referred for either a split-night or full night diagnostic study, will be
      offered participation in the study and will be recruited. From these patients, a total of 20
      patients that are diagnosed with clinical obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, based on
      diagnostic polysomnography, will undergo titration with the HC254 Auto CPAP. An additional 20
      patients will undergo titration with the HC244 CPAP.

      The sleep physiologist evaluating the patient clinically will approach patients for
      participation in this study during their sleep laboratory visit. Consenting patients will
      undergo either an initial full night diagnostic polysomnography or a split night study as
      determined by the physician based on clinical requirements. Patients diagnosed with
      obstructive sleep apnea (AHI > 15/hr) during this diagnostic component will then undergo one
      of the following:

        -  Treatment with the HC254 Auto CPAP during the second half of the study.

        -  Treatment with the HC244 CPAP during the second half of the study.

      The sleep physiologist will then determine final CPAP prescriptions for all patients based on
      the patient's response to CPAP therapy.

      5 subjects who have completed the HC254 arm of the study will be brought back to the sleep
      lab for an additional PSG or partial PSG while on CPAP pressure set to 90th percentile
      pressure determined on the diagnostic night.
