      palliative intent. These patients are usually unwell due to their advanced disease and
      suffering from pain and other symptoms related to bony and soft tissue metastases. Radiation
      therapy (RT) has an important role in the symptomatic relief and improvement in the quality
      of life (QoL) for these patients. A meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
      estimated the overall response rate (ORR) following RT for bone metastases at approximately
      60% with up to one quarter of patients experiencing a complete response (CR). However,
      palliative patients form a diverse group of patients and selecting the optimal number of
      palliative treatments which provides an enduring benefit while not being burdensome for the
      patient can be challenging. The ideal treatment is one that provides lasting symptom control
      and involves the least number of treatments. Up to one quarter of patients with advanced
      cancer who undergo palliative RT will die within 1 month of the treatment, while up to 50% of
      palliative patients will be alive at 12 months . In patients who receive a single fraction of
      8Gy, up to 20% of these patients require retreatment to the same site, compared with 8% who
      receive multiple fraction treatment . One potential option to increase the duration of local
      control is with hypofractionated, dose escalated radiation.A phase II non-inferiority study
      investigated this hypothesis in non-spine bone metastases, comparing a single treatment of
      12Gy to 30Gy in 10 fractions. The cohort reported a higher pain response in the single
      fraction dose escalated arm as early as 2 weeks post treatment (62 vs 32%), which was
      maintained at 9 months (77% vs 46% respectively).
