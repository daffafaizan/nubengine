      (placebo, rivastigmine 5 cm^2 and rivastigmine 10 cm^2) in a ratio of 1:1:1. During the
      Double-blind treatment phase, patients entered a 16-week Titration Period followed by an
      8-week Maintenance Period. During the open-label extension phase, all patients started
      treatment with a 2.5 cm^2 patch and the dose was increased to 10 cm^2 over a 16-week
      titration period, followed by a maintenance period of 36 weeks.
