      HIV-infection, most of the patients with a controlled viral load under antiretroviral therapy
      and a high level of CD4 cell count (over 200/mm3) who received IL-2, experienced an increase
      of their CD4 cell count superior to what is observed with antiretroviral therapy alone. The
      efficacy of IL-2 when the viral load is high and the patient is not receiving antiretroviral
      therapy is not known. The purpose of this multicentric national study is to compare the
      effects of IL-2 versus no treatment in HIV na√Øve patients. One hundred thirty HIV-1-infected
      patients, with a CD4 count between 300 and 500/mm3, will be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups : IL-2 or no treatment. The group with IL-2 will receive a dose of 4.5
      million international units by subcutaneous injection twice a day for 5 days (up to a total
      of 5 cycles, ending at Week 96), the first three cycles 8 weeks apart. Evaluation will be
      done at week 96. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients reaching an absolute CD4
      count below 300/mm3 at Week 96. Secondary endpoints include the occurrence of HIV-related
      events, drug safety and the evolution of CD4 cells and of HIV RNA and HIV DNA loads over
      time.
