      Primary

        -  Determine if tumor uptake of ^11C topotecan occurs quickly enough and at sufficient
           concentration to be measured immediately following infusion in patients with brain
           metastases secondary to ovarian cancer, small cell lung cancer, or other cancers.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, if ^11C imaging has potential to be an early predictor of
           response to topotecan therapy in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the whole-body biodistribution of ^11C topotecan in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Phase I: Patients receive ^11C topotecan IV over 10 minutes followed immediately by a
           1-2 hour positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Within 4 weeks after initial imaging,
           patients also undergo a CT scan.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive ^11C topotecan and undergo imaging as in phase I. Patients
           also receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 IV and, 1 hour later, undergo a PET scan.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
