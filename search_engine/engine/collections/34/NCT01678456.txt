    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained rhythm disturbance, is associated with a
      significantly enhanced mortality and morbidity due to thromboembolic events, and other
      cardiac and noncardiac complications. Therefore the "Network of Competence on Atrial
      Fibrillation (AFNET)" supported by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) was
      established in order to collect clinical data on patients (pts) with AF (paroxysmal,
      persistent, permanent) over a study period of 6 years with an expected sample size of 12,000
      pts. Incidence, clinical relevance and outcome after SAE is recorded and assessed by a
      Critical Event Committee (CEC).

      The CEC-members (experts in cardiology and neurology) defined as SAE any death with or
      without relationship to AF, cardio-embolic events (stroke, peripheral arterial embolism),
      bleeding complications due to antithrombotic therapy, acute heart failure, syncope,
      resuscitation; additionally, the complication of interventional strategies for AF-treatment
      and other AF-independent SAEs.

      Over a 3-year follow-up period, during 6-monthly and unscheduled visits, the SAEs are
      systematically documented, blinded and their relationship to AF will be interpreted in detail
      by the CEC.
