      standard care and recommended management especially in preterm deliveries.1 In average, about
      80 ml of blood was found to be transferred to the neoborn by one minute after birth.2 This
      additional blood can afford extra iron and blood volume giving the benefit of less iron
      deficiency anemia during the first year of life, less need for blood transfusion, less need
      for vasopressors and less intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) by 50%.3 Placental transfusion
      with different techniques proved safety with no significant risks regarding postpartum
      hemorrhage, polycythemia, jaundice, Apgar score or admission rates.4 Our study aims to
      compare delayed cord clamping with umbilical cord milking as the best way for placental
      transfusion for preterm neonates.
