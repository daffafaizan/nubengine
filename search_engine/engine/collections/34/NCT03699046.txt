      arthroscopy will have reduced knee pain, improved knee function, and improved bone quality
      and micro-architecture compared to patients receiving arthroscopy alone who have symptomatic
      early osteoarthritis with the presence of at least one BML observed on MRI.

      Patients who provide informed consent to enroll in the study will be scheduled for knee
      surgery and randomized to receive subchondroplasty and arthroscopy or arthroscopy alone. Knee
      function outcomes will be assessed at initial presentation, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months,
      and 24 months following surgical intervention. Patient-reported pain will also be recorded at
      2 weeks following surgical intervention. The evaluation of bone quality and
      micro-architecture will occur at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months following surgical
      intervention. X-rays will also be evaluated at the 24-month time-point.
