        1. Determine the frequency of low serum Vit D levels (<50 nmol/L) in COVID-19 patients.

        2. Determine the relationship between baseline vitamin D status and disease severity,
           laboratory biochemical tests of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP),
           lymphocyte count, leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), lactate
           dehydrogenase, IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha platelet count, albumin, and serum ferritin,
           required hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

        3. Asses patients' initial response to vitamin D supplementation in week one and determine
           its association with disease progression and recovery.

        4. Compare disease severity and progression, laboratory biochemical tests of white blood
           cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase,
           IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, platelet count, albumin, and serum ferritin, hospital
           admission and length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital mortality and
           respiratory failure differ between the early responder and non-responder groups.

      Out-patients

        1. Determine the frequency of low serum Vit D levels (<50 nmol/L) in COVID-19 patients.

        2. Determine the relationship between baseline vitamin D deficiency and clinical
           characteristics.

        3. Asses patients' response to vitamin D supplementation in week three and determine its
           association with disease progression and recovery
