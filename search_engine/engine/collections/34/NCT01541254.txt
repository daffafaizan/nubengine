      neurovascular stent is placed across the aneurysm neck, to act as a bridge to prevent coils
      from protruding into the parent artery. Stenting may allow to more safely achieve a higher
      packing density of coils. These effects may improve the rates of complete aneurysm occlusion
      and enhance the durability of the coiling treatment.The LVISâ„¢ device manufactured by
      MicroVention, Inc. has a braided design which may provide superior conformability and parent
      artery apposition, as well as a more reliable continuous and uniform neck bridging than other
      neurovascular stents.
