      therapy as recommended in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's Lipid Guidelines. Despite
      substantial evidence supporting statin use, several studies suggest dyslipidemia management
      in Canada remains suboptimal. In Ontario, prior work using the 2008 Cardiovascular Health in
      Ambulatory Care Research Team (CANHEART) 'big data' registry of almost the entire Ontario
      population of 9.8 million adults created through linkage of 17+ population health databases
      at ICES, has documented an approximate 2-fold variation across the province in cardiovascular
      events that is associated with performance of key cardiovascular preventive measures,
      particularly lipid screening and statin prescribing. This work noted that the variation did
      not have a clear association with traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic
      conditions. This observation suggests that heterogeneity in this care process may be
      modifiable with an intervention geared to improving adherence to national guidelines.

      In this pragmatic, cluster randomized registry trial, 'big data' is used to test the 'real
      world' effectiveness of a tailored, multicomponent intervention strategy aimed at improving
      lipid management (screening, risk assessment, statin initiation, statin adherence) amongst a
      primary prevention cohort of 40 to 75 year olds individuals living in 14 (of 28) communities
      in Ontario with higher than average rates of cardiovascular events. A multicomponent
      intervention strategy will include a 'toolbox' of lipid management resources for both patient
      and physicians in the intervention (high-risk) communities of the province. The intervention
      strategy will include tools to enable patients and physicians to make informed and shared
      decisions about statin therapy and will be implemented in the intervention communities using
      targeted local and social media strategies. Patient characteristics for those aged 40 to 75
      and clinical outcomes in this study will be measured without primary data collection using
      the 2016 CANHEART 'big data' registry, with the exception of stain use and adherence data
      available only in adults 66 to 75 years old.
