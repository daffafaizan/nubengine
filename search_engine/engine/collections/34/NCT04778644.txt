      psychosis symptoms (at least in part) through downstream ECS-related mechanisms, both of
      which actions converge on the hippocampus, a region rich in CB1 receptors. As such, observing
      hippocampus activity levels using fMRI can be an effective means of measuring CBD target
      engagement within this pilot study context. The purpose of this pilot research is to show
      target engagement of the hippocampus with the study drug cannabidiol (CBD) versus placebo, in
      BSNIP Biotype 3 compared to Biotypes 1 and 2 and to healthy control subjects, during
      performance of an fMRI paired associated memory task. Here, investigators will use
      B-SNIP-based observations in already-characterized B-SNIP subjects, to predict in which
      individuals CBD engages a theoretically-based brain target. In turn (in future planned
      studies) such engagement may predict CBD treatment responders. At present, CBD is still an
      experimental drug for psychosis treatment (although now FDA-approved for treatment of
      specific types of childhood seizures), but one with a rather benign side-effect profile that
      could easily be added to ongoing antipsychotic treatment. The purpose of the study is to
      study response to a single, acute dose of CBD compared to placebo, under double-blind
      conditions in a small-scale pilot study.
