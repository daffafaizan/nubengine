      affects around 95 % of patients receiving radiotherapy. Patients with breast cancer as well
      as patients with head and neck cancer are most frequently affected, due to the higher
      radiation dose to the skin, as compared to other cancer types.

      Radiation dermatitis has a profound impact on the quality of a patient's life, due to pain
      and discomfort. Skin lesions bear a marked risk of infection. In addition, all these issues
      may be the cause of interruption of radiation therapy, resulting in inadequate disease
      treatment.

      Despite a plentitude of studies researching local and systemic therapeutic approaches,
      currently no treatment (aside from local steroids which bear substantial side-effects) can be
      explicitly recommended.

      Thus, further research, especially in therapeutic options with a positive side-effect
      spectrum would be highly beneficial.

      Urtica comp. gel is a Swissmedic registered medication. It is e.g. applied in first and
      second-degree burn and scalding as well as sunburn and has been used in over 80 years with an
      excellent safety profile. Positive clinical experience in treating radiation dermatitis with
      Urtica comp. gel suggest studying this therapeutic option in a pilot trial.
