        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of tipifarnib given
           concurrently with radiotherapy after induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel and
           carboplatin and followed by maintenance therapy with tipifarnib in patients with stage
           IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the tumor response at 3 months in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1
      and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2
      courses.

      Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of induction chemotherapy, patients receive oral
      tipifarnib twice daily for 7 weeks. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week
      for 7 weeks beginning 3 days after the start of tipifarnib. After completion of radiotherapy,
      patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily for 4 days and then once daily for 4 days.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib while receiving radiotherapy
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy and tipifarnib, patients receive
      maintenance therapy comprising oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Maintenance therapy
      repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
