      relatives will be offered BRCA1/2 gene testing. This study proposes to evaluate psychological
      and behavioral aspects of their decision-making and the outcomes of the testing process.
      Knowledge and expectations will be assessed initially, followed by pre-test psychological
      assessment and an in person education and counseling session. Participants will be presented
      the choice of whether or not to undergo BRCA1/2 testing. Notification of test results will
      occur in person along with discussion of available surveillance options. Telephone interviews
      will assess psychological and behavioral outcome measures at 6 and/or twelve month time
      points. Aspects of this research endeavor have been designed to complement an NHGRI/NCI
      extramural consortium and an NHGRI/NCI intramural collaboration both of which will address
      various aspects of risk notification and follow-up for hereditary breast, ovarian and colon
      cancer.
