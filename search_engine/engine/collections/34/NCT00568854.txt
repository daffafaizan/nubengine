      Specific Aim 1: To assess differences between the study groups in cytokine expression before
      and after BCG vaccination. The investigators will determine within-individual variability in
      cytokine measurements and describe the kinetics of cytokine response to BCG. Peak response
      levels, time to peak, and patterns of cytokines expressed will be compared.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of hyperglycemia on the cytokine response of type 2
      diabetics. The investigators will evaluate whether levels of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) are
      associated with degree of cytokine response and test if type 2 diabetics who have good
      glucose control are different from nondiabetics.

      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the effect of testing PBMCs from diabetics outside of their
      diabetic milieu. Investigators will compare the BCG-specific cytokine responses of PBMCs
      stimulated in normal medium, PBMCs stimulated in glucose correlating to the person's most
      recent HbA1C, and whole blood samples.
