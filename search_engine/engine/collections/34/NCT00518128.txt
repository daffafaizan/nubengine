      OSA treatment by evaluating its impact on these health-related and functional outcomes and
      comparing these effects to the changes in respiratory physiology achieved after surgery. To
      achieve this goal, we will examine key health-related (C-reactive protein, homocysteine,
      leptin, the homeostasis model of insulin resistance, and heart rate variability) and
      functional (sleep-related quality of life and vigilance) measures among a surgical group of
      OSA patients who do not tolerate non-surgical treatment (positive airway pressure, PAP) and a
      comparison group of matched OSA patients who tolerate PAP. We propose to measure the impact
      of surgical OSA treatment on these health-related and functional outcomes measures with the
      following three analyses: (1) to assess the changes seen with surgical treatment; (2) to
      compare changes seen with surgical and PAP treatment; and (3) to evaluate the association
      between changes in respiratory patterns during sleep and changes in health-related and
      functional outcomes measures for both surgical and PAP treatment.
