        -  To develop a weight loss intervention for obese African American women who are breast
           cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention
      groups.

        -  Group 1: Participants receive traditional individual dietary and exercise counseling in
           combination with the Weight Watchers weight loss program for 18 months.

        -  Group 2: Participants receive individual dietary and exercise counseling in combination
           with the Weight Watchers weight loss program as in group 1. They also receive spiritual
           counseling that incorporates meditation, readings, and the recording of thoughts into a
           long-term weight management program. The program addresses coping with stress, setting
           priorities, dealing with emotional issues that trigger old behavior patterns, and
           developing accountability for following desired diet and exercise patterns.
