    
      Pre-operatively patient are approached and enrolled according to inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.

      Demographic data is then recorded and afterwards the patient is randomized
      (randomization.com) but is blinded to the group.

      The patient is outfitted with a Philadelphia® cervical collar and a BIS® monitor before
      induction of anesthesia.

      The anesthetist is blinded to the randomization group. Once asleep, the patient is intubated
      using the GlideScope® with the single-use blade and one of the randomized intubation stylets
      by an operator.

      Intubation and tube manipulation times, vital signs and BIS level are recorded via a nurse or
      video camera.

      Verbal cues are given for start of laryngoscopy, tube manipulation and confirmation of CO2
      which is recorded by the camera microphone.

      Patient is questioned about hoarseness and sore throat when leaving the post anesthesia care
      unit according to our local protocol and 24hr after the surgical procedure.

      The data is then taken from the video and analyzed by a blinded operator.
