      cell transplantation developing in 30 - 70% of patients. It is a multisystem alloimmune and
      autoimmune disorder with a negative impact on quality of life and functional status,
      increased need for extended immunosuppression and is the leading cause of late transplant
      related mortality.

      CC-4047 is a novel immune modulatory drug that is a thalidomide analog with a 4,000 fold
      greater inhibition of TNF-α production related to thalidomide. Several features of CC-4047
      suggest that this drug may be useful in treating chronic GVHD including in vitro suppression
      of TNF-α production, increasing Th1 and stimulation of IL-12 and sIL-Rα.

      This study is an open-label, single-arm, pilot study of efficacy and safety of CC-4047 in
      patients with advanced chronic GvHD who failed to achieve a response with high-dose
      corticosteroids or second line systemic immunosuppressive therapy.
