      There are many available treatments, but disappointing results are reported in clinical
      trials.

      TDCS is a noninvasive, secure and painless technique of brain stimulation. It is delivered by
      a battery-operated device that transfers low intensity electrical current to all surface of
      the brain. Then there is a modulation of cortical excitability and influence on central
      neurological functions. It has been reported its efficacy for the treatment of many diseases
      such as depression and chronic pain.

      Impairment of central mechanisms of interpretation and threshold of pain are related to
      functional dyspepsia. Therefore, tDCS may benefit dyspeptic patients.

      This study is a double blind randomized controled trial to test tDCS effectiveness on
      functional dyspepsia. Seventy functional dyspeptic patients will be enrolled, being
      randomized to either tDCS or sham tDCS.
