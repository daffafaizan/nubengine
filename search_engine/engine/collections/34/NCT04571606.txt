      of two types of interscalene nerve block, both of which are currently being used at UNC.
      Group 1 will be comprised of patients with a preoperative interscalene nerve catheter placed
      with 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine and a 0.2% ropivacaine infusion by an OnQ pain pump. Group 2
      will be comprised of patients with a preoperative interscalene nerve block placed with 10 mL
      0.5% bupivacaine and 10 mL 1.3% Liposomal Bupivacaine (Exparel). All patients in both groups
      will have a similar intraoperative general anesthetic with multimodal analgesic pre-op oral
      medications.
