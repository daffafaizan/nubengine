      pubertal development. We propose to: (1) examine the effects of sex steroids (androgen) on
      multiple variables (growth rate, GH binding protein, IGF-I, and cognitive function), in the
      setting of supplemental growth hormone administration and (2) to investigate any synergistic
      or additive effects of the androgen and estrogen combination on the above variables.
