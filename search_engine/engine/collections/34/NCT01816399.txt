      angiography a computerized simultaneous multi-leads ECG will be recorded and, using a new
      dedicated algorithm for 3D electrical activity reconstruction, the investigators will plot
      the horizontal VCG of the whole ECG cycle. Using this new VCG analysis we will determine
      whether the patients have normal coronary arteries or coronary disease.
