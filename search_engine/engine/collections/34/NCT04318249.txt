      intervention, Assisted Relaxation Therapy (ART), for lung cancer patients who experience
      insomnia symptoms and other sleep difficulties. This intervention includes using a smartphone
      application called mPhenomic to monitor adherence to the study protocol. A variety of surveys
      will be used to track the interventions' efficacy throughout the study. To test these
      interventions, the investigators will recruit participants (n=20) from a weekly oncology
      patient list located within the University of Pennsylvania. Participants with a history of
      lung cancer who are recruited into the study must have a smartphone. Participants will use
      the ART intervention over the course of 2 weeks and will receive surveys at enrollment (D0),
      end of intervention (D14) and 2 weeks post-intervention (D30). Missing data will be handled
      using imputation methods. The investigators will analyze the data using statistical programs
      to determine progress throughout the study.
