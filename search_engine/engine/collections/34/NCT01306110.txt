      advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. However, liver fibrosis screening in this
      large population needs non-invasive methods. Recently, FibroScan was shown to be a good
      method for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients. We examined the efficacy of
      a screening strategy with a noninvasive fibrosis biomarker (FibroTest) and transient
      elastography (FibroScan) in patients with diabetes.
