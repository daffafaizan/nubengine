      cholesterol (LDL) but compliance has been shown to be poor. Therefore, focus has shifted to
      non-fasting measurements. However, there has been limited data in patients with type 2
      diabetes and further study is needed to illuminate the lipid changes that occur in the
      non-fasting state. This observational study examines fasting and postprandial lipids in
      patients with type 2 diabetes using standard chemical analysis and NMR. For comparison, lipid
      panels will be obtained at baseline and 3 hours following a standard meal in 30 patients with
      type 2 diabetes. These measurements will then be analyzed based on current ATP III
      guidelines. We will investigate the degree to which the postprandial assessments agree with
      the fasting assessments and the agreement between LDL and the two alternative measures ---
      non-HDL and NMR-LDL.
