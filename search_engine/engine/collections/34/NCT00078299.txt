      clinical trials and epidemiologic studies of cataract. While photographic grading systems
      have been shown to be reliable, they are too expensive and complex to use in many studies.
      For some large studies, especially those with many centers or those in which lens changes are
      of secondary concern, it would be useful to have a simple clinical lens grading system that
      is reliable and that can be used with minimal training of examiners. Several clinical lens
      grading systems have been developed and found to be reliable in the hands of dedicated lens
      researchers, but the systems have been difficult for other ophthalmologists to use reliably.

      The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDA) has developed a simplified clinical cataract
      grading system to assess the severity of nuclear, cortical and posterior subcapsular
      cataracts, the 3 main types of age-related cataract. The system is designed to require
      minimal examiner training for persons already proficient in the use of the slit lamp. A total
      150 participants with cataracts of varying severity, who are already participating in other
      NEI protocols, will be recruited to evaluate the reliability of the system. After being
      dilated, each participant will have a lens grading performed independently by 2 examiners. To
      provide information on the validity of the clinical gradings, lens photographs will be taken
      and graded using the detailed AREDS system for grading photographs. The data will allow us to
      evaluate (1) the agreement between the AREDS clinical lens grading system and the AREDS
      photographic system of grading lens opacities, and (2) the agreement on assessment of
      cataract severity among opthalmologists (with varying subspecialty) using the AREDS clinical
      lens grading method.
