    
      The primary objective of this intervention study is the evaluation of the efficacy of dietary
      indications, developed on the most recent scientific evidence, useful for the management of
      the symptoms associated with adverse reactions to nickel.

      The secondary objective is to:

        -  verify the correlation between the consumption of a specific food and the onset of
           gastroenteric symptoms;

        -  provide a practical indication to the dietician who acts in concert with the figure of
           the dietician and allergist in the multidisciplinary management of the patient in order
           to manage and contain the symptoms;

        -  make the patient aware of his problem and help him understand how to manage it
           autonomously, from a food point of view, thus promoting a diet as complete and balanced
           as possible and at the same time reduce the risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as
           deficits of minerals and vitamins, and the consequent impact on the state of health.

      In this experimental study, each patient will be assessed at the baseline time (T0) in which
      the pathological and physiological history and anthropometric data (weight, height, waist
      circumference, BMI) will be collected.The patients of the intervention group will be given
      dietetic indications by the reference dietitian, which must be followed for 8 weeks. In
      short, the indications provide for an exclusion period (4 weeks). At the end of this phase
      (T1) one group of foods per week will be reintroduced on the basis of their nickel
      content.The reintroduction will begin with the group of foods with a lower nickel content and
      will proceed gradually for a period of 4 weeks (T1a, T1b, T1c, T2). In order to monitor the
      trend of gastroenteric symptoms, a diary of symptoms will be administered at baseline time
      (T0) which must be completed for the duration of the study (T1a, T1b, T1c, T2) and which will
      be delivered and evaluated by the dietician and the reference clinician. To ensure adequate
      patient support and to monitor compliance with the indications provided, the referring
      dietitian will have to contact individual patients once a week by telephone or e-mail.
