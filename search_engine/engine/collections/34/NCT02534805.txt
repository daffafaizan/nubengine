      of readmission prevention in cirrhosis by using the Patient Buddy App with patient and
      caregiver interfaces. Eighty subjects (40 cirrhotic inpatients and 40 caregivers) will be
      enrolled and trained on the Patient Buddy at discharge. The App focuses on daily
      communication between patient/caregivers and the study team based on previously identified
      risk factors associated with readmission. The study team will initiate measures to prevent
      readmission using these communications. A detailed analysis of 30-day readmissions and input
      of the patients,caregivers and nurse manager will be performed to improve the App. Avoidable
      readmissions will be defined by a committee of hepatologists who is not part of the study at
      VCU.

      Specific aim 2: To incorporate the opinion of key stakeholders (patients, caregivers and case
      managers) towards improving the Patient Buddy App in the prevention of avoidable readmission
      in cirrhosis. The input of the key stakeholders and the analysis of readmissions prevented
      during the pilot study will be used to update the App for preventing avoidable readmissions
      in future studies
