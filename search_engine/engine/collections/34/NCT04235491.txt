      AV leadless pacemakers or dual-chamber transvenous pacemakers and will be executed by
      analyzing administrative claims data. The study consists of two primary objectives: estimate
      the (1) acute overall complication rate, and (2) the 2-year survival rate of patients
      implanted with a Micra AV leadless pacemaker. As part of the secondary objectives of the
      study, a comparative analysis of Micra AV leadless pacemakers to dual-chamber transvenous
      pacemakers will be conducted.

      The analysis will be in CMS claims data and is subject to a central IRB. However, individual
      hospitals are not engaged in research and local IRB oversight is not necessary.
