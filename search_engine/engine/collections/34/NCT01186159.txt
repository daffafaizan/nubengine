      patients with abdominal surgery. The differences of COX-2 expression in PMNL are compared
      between peripheral blood and partial incision transudate to the same individual, and at the
      same time, the COX-2 expression differences in PMNL and macrophages, and PGE2 concentration
      in partial incision transudate also compared interindividually, to show the relevance between
      the difference and postoperative pain. In addition, the effects of Parecoxib Sodium on COX-2
      expression of the amount in PMNL and macrophages are investigated during the development of
      postoperative inflammatory pain. Finally, we will clear the dose-effect relations among the
      expression of COX-2 in inflammatory cell, systemic and local inflammatory response and
      postoperative pain.
