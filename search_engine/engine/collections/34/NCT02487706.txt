      the HIV-positive population. This means that an increasing number of HIV-infected patients
      will need renal replacement therapy.However, little is known about DTG removal from plasma by
      HD in patients with ESRD.

      Objective: to evaluate the effect of HD on DTG clearance as well as on DTG plasma
      concentrations at steady state in HIV-infected patients with ESRD undergoing HD.
