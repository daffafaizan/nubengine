      development, and increased learning problems. This study is designed to (1) examine the
      effects of sex steroids (androgen and estrogen) on multiple variables including growth rate,
      GH binding protein, IGF-I, IGFBP3, and cognitive function in the setting of supplemental
      growth hormone administration and (2) to investigate any synergistic or additive effects of
      the androgen and estrogen combination versus each alone, on the above variables.
