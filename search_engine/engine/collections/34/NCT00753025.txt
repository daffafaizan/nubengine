      compounds more than 20-25 % from all kinds of a cardiovascular pathology. At conservation of
      this tendency to 2020 the amputation percentage executed due to vessel diseases, can reach 45
      %. Hemodynamics improvement in an extremity by surgery is possible at 40 - 70 % of patients
      even with the widespread and plural lesion of arteries, but results are not always
      satisfactory. The most actual is the problem of angiosurgical help to patients with distal
      forms of arterial occlusions, due to the difficulty or impossibility performing
      reconstructive interventions. In these cases the operations of an indirect revascularization
      referred on stimulation of a collateral blood flow are carried out. However, despite the
      reached successes, in some cases results of such interventions do not give desirable effect,
      search of new methods of treatment therefore is necessary. To date the most perspective
      methods of neoangiogenesis stimulation are a cellular therapy and gene-engineering
      technologies. Experimental researches on a model of local limb ischemia showed possibility of
      use of various cells for neoangiogenesis stimulation. A number of clinical researches at
      patients with obliterating limb diseases has shown efficacy of cellular therapy even at a
      critical ischemia. However randomized, the placebo-controlled researches based on principles
      of evidence based medicine while it is not enough for the convincing conclusions.
