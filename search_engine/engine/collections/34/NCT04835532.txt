      regeneration technique is widely used in clinic since it leads to less trauma and less
      complications. Tenting screw technology, basic on the classical GBR, implants screws into the
      surgical area to prevent the barrier membrane from collapsing. Moreover, advanced platelet
      rich fibrin and injectable platelet-rich fibrin are used to provide the osteogenic function.
      The investigators intend to increase vertical alveolar bone augmentation by combining tenting
      screws and A-PRF, I-PRF.
