      Karnofsky performance score of â‰¥70% and were candidates for myeloablative HCT. A 8/8 HLA
      allelic match between the donor and the recipient at HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1 by
      high-resolution typing was required. The graft source was PBSC.

      Patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of oral chidamide given
      twice weekly at a dose of 20 mg from day -7 to 2 weeks post transplantation, intravenous
      busulfan 3.2 mg/kg from day -6 to -3, intravenous fludarabine 30 mg/m2 and cytarabine 1g/m2
      respectively from day -6 to -2. PBSCs were infused on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis was
      post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg on day +3, +4) and cyclosporine (started from
      day +5). In the absence of GVHD, cyclosporine tapering started on day +100 and discontinued
      on day +180. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was determined by multi-parameter flow cytometry.
