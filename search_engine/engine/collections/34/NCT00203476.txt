    
      : Patients with hyperlipidemia who sign consent and who are currently at maximum tolerated
      dose of a statin and are not meeting NCEP ATPIII treatment goals for LDL cholesterol are
      enrolled in 12-week open label, prospective trial. Patients are randomized into one of three
      groups to receive ezetimibe, niacin, or colestipol in addition to current statin therapy.
      Patients are titrated as tolerated to therapeutic doses of study medications (ezetimibe
      10mg/day, niacin 1500mg/day, and colestipol 20gm/day). At baseline, informed consent; a
      laboratory admission profile (Chem20); weight; height; blood pressure; concomitant
      medications; cholesterol medication history; and grapefruit juice consumption data are
      gathered. At weeks 6 and 12, patients have their cholesterol panels and liver function tests
      assessed. Patients are also interviewed regarding side effects (including rhabdomyolysis),
      tolerance, changes in concomitant medications, and grapefruit juice consumption, along with
      weight and blood pressure measurements.
