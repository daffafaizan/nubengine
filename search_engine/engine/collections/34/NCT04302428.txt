      status and growth in infant and young people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF). The investigators
      hypothesize that Zn deficiency in infant and young PWCF is associated with poor growth.

      Aim #2: To study the association between Zn levels in red blood cells and nutritional status
      in PWCF at 3 months to 3 years of age and compare it to the association between serum Zn and
      nutritional status in the same population. Hypothesis: Lower Zn levels in red blood cells is
      associated with poorer nutritional status in infant and young PWCF and is a better measure of
      Zn status compared to serum Zn.
