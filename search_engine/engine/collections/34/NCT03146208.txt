    
      1. We are aiming to establish a marker for chronic reactivation and pathophysiology of CMV
           infection in patients with coronary artery disease.

        2. We will be able to answer whether there is a link between the seropositive CMV, telomere
           length, and CAD.

        3. We will correlate the seropositive CMV with telomere length, GDF-15 & NRF2.

        4. We will detect the origin of our biomarkers by human umbilical vein endothelial
           cells(HUVECS).

        5. We will measure the effect of DPP4-I (on TL & GDF-15 on cardiac cell line).

        6. We are looking to establish a new potential risk marker from our study, (GDF-15 & NRF2)
           which could be tested in a larger cohort of patients. This would then enable us to
           identify CMV-seropositive patients at risk and develop novel strategies for future
           treatment and prevention.
