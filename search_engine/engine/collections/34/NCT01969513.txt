      Randomized clinical trial conducted by general practitioners (GP) who received a two hour
      training to perform the manoeuvres under the supervision of an otorhinolaryngologist.
      Patients will be reevaluated 1 week, 1 month and 1 year after the first visit by a different
      GP from the first visit to accomplish blinding of study participants and personnel.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE:

      The aim of this study is to determine whether the improvement is greater in intervention
      group than in control group in terms of Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre turning negative, subjective
      perception of vertigo and quality of life, and less amount of betahistine taken.

      The main objective is the response of treatment in the second visit (1 week after the first
      visit), although new assessments will be carried out at day 30 and one year after the first
      visit.
