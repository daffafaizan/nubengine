    
      Through recruitment of a racially, geographically, and socioeconomically diverse sample of
      patients, we will achieve the following aims:

        1. Evaluate factors associated with access to genetic risk assessment, counseling, and
           testing services

        2. Conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of interventions on
           improving guideline-adherent CRM and FC of genetic test results

        3. Create and pilot an adaptive intervention to tailor resources to promote CRM and FC

        4. Document and compare multiple implementation outcomes across the different interventions
           to maximize their effectiveness and improve reach to underserved populations
