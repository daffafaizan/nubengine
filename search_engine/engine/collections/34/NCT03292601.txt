      clinician making a mark on the brace straps, to which the patient tightens the straps during
      daily wear. Once the strap is set in place, the current standard-of-care does not involve any
      more monitoring. Therefore, ideal strap tension is unknown and the effectiveness of bracing
      may be unknowingly compromised by many as yet unidentified variables. In recent years, a
      small number of studies have emerged related to the strap tension of bracing yet no clear
      guidelines on correct strap tension currently exist. Considering the potential effects on
      preventing scoliosis progression and brace-associated complications, the need for guidelines
      regarding optimal brace fit are greatly needed for clinical use. Via this brace monitoring
      study, continuous monitoring of tension at brace fitting, throughout the day, and related to
      positional changes will be possible with a very minimal device and smartphone application.
      The tremendous amounts of data generated by the device and its app will be used to create a
      database from which our team will gather information about brace wear compliance and use
      tension information for the development of standards for effective strap tension associated
      with greater scoliosis curve correction. Lastly, the effect of a patient's engagement with
      his or her brace - through the smartphone app - will be examined. It is well established in
      the literature that observation increases compliance, but no studies investigating patient
      self-monitoring through personal devices currently exists. This is a vital area of
      investigation given the recent explosion in personal health-assessing devices e.g. the Apple
      watch, Up band, fitbit, etc.
