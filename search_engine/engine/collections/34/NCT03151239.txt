      mononucleotide" (NMN) on key cardiovascular and metabolic functions, specifically those that
      are important risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, the
      investigators will evaluate the effect of NMN on how well the hormone insulin works to
      control blood sugar. The investigators will also look at the effects of NMN on blood lipids;
      body fat and liver fat; and other blood, fat tissue and muscle tissue markers of
      cardiovascular (heart) and metabolic health. Data from studies conducted in rodents have
      shown that NMN supplementation has beneficial effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health,
      but this has not yet been studied in people.
