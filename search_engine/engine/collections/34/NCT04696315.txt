      public and health care systems. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), characterized by a
      self-report of decline in cognitive function without objective impairment in
      neuropsychological assessments, is considered a high risk factor for AD. SCD with
      amyloidopathy is considered as a first symptomatic indicator of the preclinical AD (SCD due
      to preclinical AD). However, how to construct and validate the preclinical diagnosis model of
      AD with fused multimodel information across culture/race remain unclear.

      In the present study, all SCD participants from Germany and China will be conducted amyloid
      PET scanning, and they will be classified into two groups (SCD with amyloid+ and SCD with
      amyloid-) based on whether there is the evidence of amyloid deposition. The investigators
      will compare the clinical information, genetics, blood and multiple parameter MRI data
      between the German and Chinese to evaluate the common and specific features from different
      culture/race. Then, key features associated with amyloid deposition will be extracted for the
      establisment of diagnosis model of SCD due to preclinical AD, which will improve the current
      diagnostic system of AD. After four-year follow-up, SCD will be classified into SCD converter
      group and SCD non-converter group. Risk factors for conversion to cognitive impairment and
      dementia will be further extracted as predicted biomarkers.

      Through this project, the value of SCD in the etiologic, anatomical and quantitative
      diagnosis of preclinical AD will be identified to improve sensitivity and specificity of
      preclinical AD diagnosis in clinical practice.
