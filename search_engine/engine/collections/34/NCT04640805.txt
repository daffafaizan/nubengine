      (VLBW) infants without sufficient mother's milk, with the overall aim of lowering the risk of
      necrotizing enterocolitis in this population. However, with the introduction of PDHM in our
      setting, rates of suboptimal weight gain have increased (60.2% to 65.7%). This is likely due
      to the fact that PDHM is often lower in energy and protein than preterm mother's own milk.
      One solution to delivery adequate nutrition in this VLBWs receiving PDHM, is targeted
      fortification, which involves measurement of the macronutrient content of human milk, and
      adding extra macronutrients to reach nutrient goals. In this proposed study, we will conduct
      a pilot randomized controlled trial of a modified targeted fortification versus standard
      care. This study will include preterm VLBW infants (<1500g), without congenital conditions
      resulting in growth restriction, and receiving >25% of PDHM use in the first week of life. 40
      patients in each arm will be recruited over a period of 2 years. The intervention group will
      receive a modified targeted fortification, consisting of selection of high fat PDHM (3.8g/dL
      or more) with the addition of protein fortification of 0.67g/dL from week 2 of life until a
      gestational age of 37 weeks or hospital discharge, whichever earlier. The control group will
      receive usual regular PDHM with standard fortification using human milk fortifier as per
      current practice. The primary outcome is the rate of suboptimal growth (drop in weight
      z-score from birth â‰¥0.8) at discharge or 37 weeks. Secondary outcomes include body
      composition, feed tolerance, and morbidity outcomes.
