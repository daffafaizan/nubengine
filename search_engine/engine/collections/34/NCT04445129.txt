      devices designed for at-home assessments. The study will assess whether a portable EEG device
      provides an EEG signal comparable to inpatient nPSG. The frequency and characteristics of
      wake and sleep patterns and transitions over multiple nights will also be characterized.
      Participants with NT1 who will complete the study TAK-994-1501 (NCT04096560) will be eligible
      to enter the current study following the appropriate washout period (60 days).

      The study will enroll approximately 32 participants (16 participants with NT1 and 16 healthy
      participants). Participants will be enrolled in the 2 groups:

        -  NT1 Participants

        -  Healthy Participants

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 8 days. The follow-up visit will occur on Day 10
      and during this debrief, participants will answer a questionnaire on user experience (device
      comfort) for the wearable devices.
