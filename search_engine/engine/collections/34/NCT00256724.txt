      in blood pressure secondary to an increase in cardiac output. Either an active or sham ITD
      will be applied to hypotensive patients when initially presented to the emergency department
      with a systolic blood pressure of <95mmHg. The main endpoint of this study will be the rise
      in blood pressure over the first 10 minutes of use. Based upon pre-clinical studies as well
      as clinical studies performed to date, we hypothesize that use of the active ITD will result
      in a more rapid and higher blood pressure than the sham ITD. Multiple additional clinical
      parameters will also be compared between the two groups of patients.
