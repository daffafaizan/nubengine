      to assess and proof the effectiveness of this device. The aim is to objectify the movement of
      the Patella induced by the device Patello in cranial / caudal direction. As outcome parameter
      serve ultrasound measurements of a bony reference point of the femur and the Patella and its
      displacement / distance after mobilization.
