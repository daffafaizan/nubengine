      infection, allowing to achieve undetectable plasma viral RNA, restore CD4 cell count and
      provide substantial decline in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, long-term toxicity
      associated with antiretroviral therapy is a real concern.

      The purpose of this study is to compare an intermittent therapy (IT) strategy (8 weeks off /
      8 weeks on) to a continuous treatment (CT) in patients with chronic and well controlled HIV-1
      infection (CD4 over 450/µl and plasma HIV1-RNA below 200 cp/ml) under HAART, over a 96-week
      study period.

      The study hypothesis is that intermittent therapy is not inferior to continuous therapy in
      maintaining a CD4 cell above 300/µl. It will compare the proportions of and time to
      immunological failure (CD4 count below 300/µl confirmed by a retest 14 days later) in the IT
      and CT groups.
