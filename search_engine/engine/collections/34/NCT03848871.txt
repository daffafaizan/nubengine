    
      Approximately 20 subjects from 3 sites will be enrolled in this open-label study. Subjects
      will receive Enstilar foam and all adverse events and concomitant medications will be
      recorded.

      Subjects will attend a screening visit/baseline visit and those with plaque-type psoriasis
      and bilateral symmetric psoriatic plaques will have a target lesion identified on knees or
      elbows and subjects will receive study treatment as outlined above.

      Enstilar will be initiated daily for the entire study period of four weeks. Study visits will
      occur as follows: screening/baseline, week 2, week 4. Study assessments at each visit will be
      Body Surface Area (BSA,) Physicians Global Assessment (PGA,) Target lesion size, Total Lesion
      Severity Score (TLSS) and standard medical assessments. There will be standard
      medication/treatment and washout periods.

      NOTE: The original study protocol dated december 20, 2017, was designed to compare the effect
      of Enstilar versus vehicle for the treatment of plaque psoriasis at a 1:1 ratio. A protocol
      amendment on March 20, 2018 eliminated the chance of placebo and made this an open-label
      study of the effects of Enstilar for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.
