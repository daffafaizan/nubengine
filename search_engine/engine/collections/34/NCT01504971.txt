      causes troublesome symptoms with or without mucosal damage or complications. Despite the high
      prevalence of GERD in the general population, up to 60% of patients with reflux symptoms is
      insufficiently characterized as having normal endoscopic finding based on standard WLI
      endoscopy: non-erosive reflux diseases (NERD).

      NBI is an optical-digital imaging technology that uses two specific narrow-banded shot
      wavelength lights (400-430 nm and 525-555 nm) instead of broad band white light. The NBI
      contrasts surface structure and vascular architecture of the superficial mucosa and
      facilitates evaluation of indistinct mucosal morphology. AFI produces real-time computed
      images of endoscopically detected autofluorescence emitted from endogenous fluorophores in
      the digestive tract (collagen, nicotinamide, adenine dinucleotide, flavin, and porphyrins)
      caused by light excitation. The AFI can identify lesions due to differences in tissue
      fluorescence properties that are not detectable by standard WLI. Hence, our hypothesis is
      that new endoscopic imaging i.e. NBI and AFI would help to identify subtle mucosal change
      which indicates the diagnosis of GERD
