      manualized intervention on fear of cancer recurrence among Chinese breast and colorectal
      cancer patients with high level of fear of cancer recurrence.

      The aims are to test:

        1. the direct effect of ConquerFear intervention on fear of cancer recurrence,

        2. the direct effect of ConquerFear intervention on maladaptive metacognition

        3. the indirect effect of ConquerFear intervention on fear of cancer recurrence through its
           effect on maladaptive metacognition.

      Primary hypothesis:

        1. Participants in the ConquerFear intervention will show greater reduction in fear of
           cancer recurrence compared to participants in the control group

        2. Participants in the ConquerFear intervention will show greater reduction in maladaptive
           metacognition than the control participants

        3. There will be an indirect effect of ConquerFear intervention on fear of cancer
           recurrence through its effect on maladaptive metacognition.
