      among men with increased reactive oxygen species in the ejaculate. Vitamin E can protect the
      sperm membrane from oxidative damage and increased levels are associated with low levels of
      reactive oxygen species. This is a study of Vitamin E levels in the spermatozoa and sera of
      48 infertile men, and 20 fertile men as a control group, to look for correlations between
      sperm vitamin E levels and the degree of sperm DNA fragmentation. Dietary intake of
      antioxidants will also be included.
