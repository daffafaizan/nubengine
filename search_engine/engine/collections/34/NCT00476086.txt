      Primary To determine the feasibility of dual modality therapy described as cytotoxic therapy
      followed by radiation therapy for the management of Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumors (MMMTs).

      Secondary

      * To describe the response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This study used a two-stage design to evaluate feasibility of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine
      prior to radiation therapy defined as completing 3 cycles of chemotherapy. The null and
      alternative therapy completion rates were 25% and 50%. If 3 or more participants enrolled in
      the stage one cohort (n=9 participants) complete therapy than accrual would proceed to stage
      two (n=15 participants). If therapy was completed by at least 10 participants in the final
      set of 24 evaluable participants then this regimen would be deemed worthy of further study.
      This design had 80% power given one-sided type I error of 5% with the probability of stopping
      early 0.60.
