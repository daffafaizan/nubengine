      young children diagnosed with Sickle Cell Trait. This will be accomplish by evaluating the
      current Ohio education in-person program, and assessing, through a set of questionnaires, how
      much participants are understanding about this diagnosis.

      During phase I of the study, participants will be video-taped, and a set of questionnaires
      will be answer before and after education is given. This data will then be analyzed by the
      SCT Team in order to develop the Program.

      During phase II of the study, population with the same criteria as phase I will be enrolled,
      however they will receive the revised "SCTaware" education. Pre and post education
      questionnaires will also be answered. In addition, participants during this phase will
      receive follow-up calls at 1 and 6 months to complete additional surveys.

      In addition, the investigators will be using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) to explore
      if parents experience decisional conflict about whether or not to obtain SCT testing and if
      SCTaware reduces this conflict
