      drug, IRX5183, in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
      IRX5183 is a derivative of Vitamin A. IRX5183 is a drug that is designed to cause cancer
      cells to mature and then die. It is thought that it will stop the uncontrolled growth of
      leukemia cells.

      These are 2 parts to this study. The purpose of the first part is to test the safety of
      IRX5183 at different dose levels. The investigators want to find out what effects, good
      and/or bad, it has on AML or MDS. Once the investigators figure out the best and safest dose
      of IRX5183, the investigators will enter the second part of the study using this dose. The
      purpose of the second part is to see if IRX5183 is effective as a treatment for AML or MDS.
      To date, IRX5183 has been used in about 25 people.

      The first part of the study is called a "Phase I" study. Phase I studies use drugs starting
      at low doses and slowly increase the amounts of the study drugs that are given to people
      until the side effects of the drugs are too high to give more. This means that not all people
      in the study will get the same dose of IRX5183. Doses at the beginning of the study will be
      lower than doses at the end of the study. Because of the design of the study, some people may
      get doses that are too low to have an effect, and other people will probably get doses that
      cause side effects.

      People with AML, MDS, or CMML that has 1) not responded to standard therapy or 2) has
      returned after a previous response may join.
