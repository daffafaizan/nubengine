      shoulder occur as an inflammatory change occurs in the articular capsular surrounding the
      shoulder joint. As a result, it has caused limitation in daily life movement.

      Uincare Homeplus is software manufactured in Korea, which uses infrared, kinect camera and
      motion capture technology to track 3D motion of the patients' articulation. Using this
      technology, the patients can receive feedback of their motion immediately.

      The objective of the study is to examine the effect of hospital-home linkage short-term
      rehabilitation therapy using real-time interactive digital healthcare system (Uincare
      Homeplus) in frozen shoulder.
