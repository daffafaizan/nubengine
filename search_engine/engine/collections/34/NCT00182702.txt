      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or
      unresectable renal cell carcinoma treated with ixabepilone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free and overall survival rates in patients treated with this
      drug.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate VHL gene mutations
      with response in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate VHL pathway protein expression with response in patients treated with this
      drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 9 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.
