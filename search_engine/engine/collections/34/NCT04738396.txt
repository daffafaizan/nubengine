      the left side of the ventricular septum, has recently initiated and been well practiced in
      China. LBBP is characterized with relatively ease of implantation (usually <5 minutes
      fluoroscopic use time), narrow paced QRS duration (similar to physiological pacing), low and
      stable pacing threshold (usually around 0.5V @0.5ms, good for device longevity and long-term
      stability without need of back-up pacing lead), high R wave amplitude for pacing management,
      and LBBB (left bundle branch block) correction by a low pacing output.

      LBBAP (left bundle branch area pacing) can generate a relatively narrow QRSd and fast left
      ventricular activation. As AV interval is an important pacing parameter relevant to cardiac
      function. This study is to investigate the cardiac electrical and mechanical function during
      LBBAP with different AV intervals.
