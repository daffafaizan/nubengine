      Given the devastating ocular sequelae of endophthalmitis, one cannot underestimate the need
      to develop a sterilization strategy which most effectively prevents intraocular infection.
      The most common organisms causing bacterial postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive
      cocci, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus Aureus. It is thought
      that the most common sources of bacterial contamination predisposing to endophthalmitis are
      the eyelids and conjunctiva (Ariyasu).

      The two main techniques used to reduce the bacterial flora on the ocular surface include
      treatment of the ocular surface with topical antibiotics prior to surgery and the
      instillation of 5% povidone-iodine during the prep immediately prior to beginning the
      surgical procedure (Speaker). Mupirocin ointment is a logical choice for surgical prophylaxis
      as it has been reported that mupirocin treatment applied to the nose resulted in elimination
      rates (of S. Aureus from the nares) of 91% directly after therapy (Doebbeling). Use of
      mupirocin ointment applied to the nares prior to eye surgery resulted in a significant
      decrease in the bacterial load on the conjunctiva at the time of surgery (Alexandrou, in
      press). Using mupirocin ointment directly to the conjunctiva, in addition to standard ocular
      sterilization techniques, may result in an even greater decrease in conjunctival flora prior
      to eye surgery.
