      the Centre de la main at the CHUV in Lausanne recruited the subjects during their
      consultations. During this initial visit, the patient was asked about his problem, his
      general health and a clinical examination (including range of motion of finger joints,
      pulp-to-palm distance, pain evaluated with a VAS) was performed. Once the diagnosis of
      trigger finger was established, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were evaluated. If the
      eligibility criteria were fulfilled, the patients were offered to be part of the study. They
      received oral and written information about the study and the surgeons gave further
      explanation if needed.

      On the surgery day, the signed consent form was recovered. Participants were randomized in
      two groups according to a computer-generated list ranging from 01 to 60
      (www.randomization.com). Surgery was then performed according to the method chosen by
      randomization. The possible occurrence of adverse effects during surgery was monitored. All
      information was recorded on the case report forms.

      The first postoperative visit occurred 1 week ± 3 days after surgery. The surgeons evaluated
      the wound to exclude the presence of postoperative complication (infection, hematoma, nerve
      or tendon injury) and answer any question the patient could have. Range of motion and pain
      were recorded. All information was recorded on the case report forms.

      The second postoperative visit occurred 4 weeks ± 5 days after surgery. The appointment was
      conducted in the same way as the previous one.

      Patients could choose to be withdrawn from the study at any point. The follow-up was similar
      to that of patients included in the study.
