    
      The purpose of this study is to perform a comparative analysis of the clinical and
      medico-economic effectiveness of center-based RR versus home-based RR in the departments of
      Nord and Pas de Calais in France. All COPD patients eligible for RR and willing to
      participate in the study will be followed.

      Patient preferences will be evaluated at inclusion. After presentation of both RR modalities,
      patients expressing a strong preference for one or other of the terms will be taken care of
      according to their wishes. Indifferent patients between the two RR modalities will be
      randomized.

      This design is justified in the light of three cases:

        -  It is impossible to evaluate blind intervention,

        -  The effectiveness of RR depends on patient preferences,

        -  Patients' adherence to the protocol is facilitated.
