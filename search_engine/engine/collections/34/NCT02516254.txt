      calcium or omega-3 supplements within the last three months will be excluded. Subjects will
      be assigned randomly to one of the three intervention groups: 1.fortified bread+placebo,2.
      plain bread+vitamin D supplements,3. plain bread+placebo. Each participant will consume 50 g
      of bread and supplement or placebo every day for 2 months.

      At the first and last visits, dietary and laboratory assessments will be performed for all
      subjects. Primary outcomes are improvement in vitamin D status and secondary outcome is
      improvement of glycemic and lipidemic markers and prevention of problems related to
