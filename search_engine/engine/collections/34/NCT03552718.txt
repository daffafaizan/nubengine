    
      This is a phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, the RP2D, and preliminary efficacy of a
      personalized neoepitope yeast-based vaccine, YE-NEO-001, in subjects who have completed
      potentially curative therapy for their type of solid cancer (eg, colorectal cancer, breast
      cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) and would otherwise be entering a
      period of surveillance for recurrent disease.

      The study will be conducted in two parts: part 1 will involve dose escalation, and part 2
      will involve the expansion of the RP2D to further evaluate the safety of YE-NEO-001. In part
      2 of the study, dose expansion will occur when the RP2D has been determined. An additional 4
      subjects may be enrolled in part 2, for a total of up to 10 subjects at the RP2D.
