      postoperative radiotherapy (RT) following radical prostatectomy (EORTC trial 22911). However,
      despite an improvement in biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), the risk of recurrences
      remained high for those patients. The investigators postulated that adjuvant androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT), radiation dose escalation, and selective pelvic irradiation for
      patients at risk for regional failures may improve the outcome. The
      combined-intensified-modulated-adjuvant (CIMA) as described may improve survival through a
      reduction of loco-regional and systemic failures.

      A phase II trial was designed to test the hypothesis that CIMA treatment may improve 5-year
      bRFS by 15%. Patients less than 80 years old, with a histological diagnosis of prostate
      adenocarcinoma without distant metastases, stage pT2-4 N0-1, no previous treatments and an
      ECOG performance status of 0-2 were selected. All patients had at least one of these
      pathologic features: extracapsular extension, positive surgical margins, or seminal vesicle
      invasion. Radiation dose to the tumor bed ranged from 64.8 to 70.2 Gy. Pelvic lymph nodes
      were treated to 45 Gy in selected patients at risk of regional failures (57%). Selected
      patients at risk for distant metastases (69.1%) received hormonal therapy.
