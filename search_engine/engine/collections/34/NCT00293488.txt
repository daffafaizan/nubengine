      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SL-11047 in patients with relapsed or
           refractory lymphoma.

        -  Describe and quantify the toxicity of SL-11047 administered to patients with relapsed or
           refractory lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Describe the pharmacokinetics of SL-11047 administered as a 30-minute IV infusion.

        -  Assess the response rate and duration of response in patients treated with SL-11047.

        -  Assess the level of SL-11047 within tumor tissues following intravenous administration
           of the drug.

        -  Determine the sensitivity of abnormal circulating macrophages to SL-11047.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive SL-11047 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SL-11047 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
