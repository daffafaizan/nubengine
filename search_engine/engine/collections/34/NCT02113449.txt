    
      This study will be conducted in two parts. In the first part of the study, recruited subjects
      with nasal congestion will view a description of a new treatment option (concept). Interested
      subjects will be offered the opportunity to enter the clinical trial. Subjects who consent
      and are found otherwise eligible will then receive one dose of CO2 in the study clinic under
      medical supervision. Afterward, subjects who wish to continue will be allowed to take the
      administration device home for an additional six days of use (study part 2).

      During the at-home use portion of the study, subjects will use a diary to record the number
      of times the product was used and their nasal congestion symptoms before and after use.

      At the end of the study period, subjects will return to the study center for global
      assessment of their impressions of treatment and to answer questions designed to estimate
      market acceptability. Subjects may be asked to participate voluntarily in a market research
      focus group following their participation in this study.
