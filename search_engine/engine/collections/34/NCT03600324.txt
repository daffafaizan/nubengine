      an estimated 65% (187,000) involving some type of vestibular impairment (gaze,
      postural/dynamic instability) and symptoms (dizziness, vertigo, motion intolerance) (Mucha et
      al., 2014). These vestibular impairments and symptoms, which have been associated with poor
      outcomes following mTBI including longer recovery times (Lau et al., 2011), can be actively
      treated using targeted vestibular rehabilitation exercises (Alsalaheen et al., 2010). In
      fact, the investigators recently concluded an observational trial of military personnel and
      civilians with mTBI- Targeted Evaluation, Action and Monitoring of TBI (TEAM-TBI) project
      (W81XWH-14-2-0002) supporting the effectiveness of targeted vestibular rehabilitation
      exercises in military personnel and civilians with complex mTBI (Kontos et al., in press).
      Although these vestibular-focused rehabilitation exercises are commonly used by military
      medical personnel following complex mTBI, there are no well-designed studies that show how
      much these exercises should be performed to be effective in US military personnel. In short,
      the concussion rehabilitation field does not know how frequently or intensely the exercises
      should be performed in order for injured personnel to have the best recovery.

      In the current proposal, the investigators leverage our interdisciplinary team of experts
      from physical therapy, neurology, neuropsychology, and sports medicine and over 17 years of
      clinical and research experience to conduct a RCT comparing different frequency and intensity
      of targeted vestibular therapeutic exercises in military personnel and civilians. In so
      doing, the proposed study may inform a more precise approach for treating vestibular symptoms
      and impairments following mTBI that minimizes morbidity and accelerates recovery.
      Deliverables from the current study include: 1) outcome data regarding the efficacy of
      different frequencies and intensities of targeted vestibular exercises in both military
      personnel and civilians, and 2) evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for
      prescribing vestibular therapeutic exercises.
