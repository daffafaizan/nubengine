      The stem cells will be collected and frozen before we start to give the patient chemotherapy.

      After admission to the hospital, patients will receive total body irradiation (very strong
      x-rays that kill cells in the bone marrow), Fludarabine and Campath 1H prior to the stem cell
      transplant (infusion of the donor's stem cells).

      Starting 7 days after the transplant, the patient will be given G-CSF by subcutaneous
      injection, until a blood test shows that numbers of granulocytes (a type of white blood cell)
      in the blood are more than 1,000/uL. This is to help increase blood cell counts.

      After transplantation, the patient will undergo several evaluations at different times. These
      are standard evaluations and tests performed for any patient who has received a stem cell
      transplant, as part of routine clinical monitoring.

      We will also be looking at the patient's immune function (how the body protects itself to
      prevent and fight infections and diseases). To do this, blood tests will be performed at
      regular intervals (every 3 to 6 months) for 2 years.

      Depending on how well the donor stem cells work in the body after the transplant, the patient
      may receive one or more Donor Leukocyte Infusions (DLI). This is when leukocytes (a type of
      white blood cell) collected from the same donor that provided the stem cells are given to the
      patient through a central line into a vein.
