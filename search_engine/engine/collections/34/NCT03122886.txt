      I. To determine if the infusion of a lipid emulsion before each dose of chemotherapy appears
      to prevent carboplatin and oxaliplatin hypersensitivity reactions in high-risk patients.

      II. To explore if lipid infusions modulate a well-established panel of mediators of
      hypersensitivity reactions and if these mediators appear to predict reactions.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive fat emulsion intravenously (IV) immediately before each dose of
      either carboplatin or oxaliplatin. Treatment continues for up to 2 years in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo IV immediately before each dose of either carboplatin or
      oxaliplatin. Treatment continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
