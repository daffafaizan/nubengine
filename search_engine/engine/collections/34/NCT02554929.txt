      compare the efficacy of two interventions in the treatment of children aged 4 to 7 years with
      SM and/or SAD. Participants are randomized into either the:

        1. Taming Sneaky Fears for SAD and/or SM parent and child group CBT treatment, or

        2. the Parent Psycho-education and Child Socialization comparison program.

      Both programs run for 10 consecutive weeks (plus one additional introduction week). To
      control for the nonspecific factors associated with treatment, such as the support, attention
      and expectation of improvement, parents and children in both treatment protocols receive
      comparable levels of attention from therapists (i.e., same duration of group sessions and
      total number of sessions with a therapist) and comparable opportunities for socialization
      (e.g., for the children: invitation to discuss how the previous week went, snack time, story
      time; for the parents: discussion of specific topics at each session). However, parents and
      children in the comparison group are not taught CBT strategies.
