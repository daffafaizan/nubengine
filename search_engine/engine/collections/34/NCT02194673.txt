      postprandial serum lipid, insulin, C-peptide and glucose concentration compare to TFPM. A
      randomised, double-blind crossover (3 Ã— 3 arms) orthogonal Latin-square design was used and
      conducted on 10 males and 10 females adults. During postprandial challenge day, each subject
      received an a test muffin incorporated with test margarine. Blood samples were collected at
      half-hourly intervals until 4 hr by using cannulation technique.
