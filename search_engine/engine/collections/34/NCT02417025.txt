      strategies, the efficacy of PE delivered via home-based telehealth (PE-HBT) versus PE
      delivered via standard service delivery (PE-SD) using a randomized, between groups, repeated
      measures design.

      Objective 1: To compare, at post, 3 and 6-month follow-up, whether PE-HBT is superior to
      PE-SD across critical clinical and quality of life outcomes (i.e., PTSD, depression, quality
      of life) due to increased PE 'dosing' that results from improved session attendance and
      reduced attrition.

      Hypothesis 1: In intent-to-treat analyses, PE-HBT will be more effective than PE-SD at
      improving clinical and quality of life outcomes at post, 3, and 6-month follow-up;
      improvement will correlate with session attendance, which will be higher in PE-HBT.

      Objective 2: To compare at post-intervention whether PE-HBT is superior to PE-SD across
      critical process outcomes (e.g., session attendance, satisfaction, and treatment adherence).

      Hypothesis 2: PE-HBT will yield better process outcomes than PE-SD post-intervention.

      Exploratory Aims: (1) To determine if treatment adherence and other process variables mediate
      the relationship between treatment condition and clinical and quality of life outcomes as
      noted in Objective 1; and (2) To use qualitative interviewing methods to obtain data on
      Veterans' reactions, preferences, difficulties, and suggestions for MST services.
