    
      The Health Behaviors in School-age Children (HBSC) survey is the only international survey of
      its type and the only national survey of adolescent health behavior in the U.S. The U.S. HBSC
      complements the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the Monitoring the Future surveys of
      older adolescents. The aims of the survey are to assess the prevalence of health behaviors
      and identify factors associated with them in a national probability sample of 6th -10th grade
      students, allowing for trend analyses and cross-national comparisons among the 37 countries
      involved in the quadrennial international HBSC surveys. This would be the third U.S.
      administration of the HBSC survey, previously administered in 1997-1998 and 2001-2002.
