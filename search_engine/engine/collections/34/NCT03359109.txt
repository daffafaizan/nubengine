      Long-term effects of indwelling metal implants are not well-understood. Data from this study
      will provide guidances as to whether some metals are safer for children (stainless vs.
      titanium alloys). In addition, we will document the presence of serum ion concentration for
      children with metal implants in place and whether this resolves after implant removal.
      Tissues adjacent to implants will be evaluated for signs of metallosis and wear debris.
      Presence of metallosis will be correlated with serum ion concentration. In vivo studies will
      provide data on whether metal exposure to bone cells and fibroblasts affects their
      inflammatory cascade and function. Based on these findings, surgeons can better counsel
      patients whether routine implant removal is advisable or whether stainless steel implants are
      safer for long-term retention compared to titanium implants. Further, novel drug targets for
      treatment and prevention of metallosis will be developed. This project will foster
      collaboration and future partnerships between the Sanford Health and Mayo Clinic research
      teams
