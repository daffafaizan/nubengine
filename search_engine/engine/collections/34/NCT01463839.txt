      associations between quality of sleep and harmful oral habits among children aged three to
      six years. This study was conducted in compliance with the Brazilian National Health
      Council/Ministry of Health guidelines contained in Resolution 196/96 and received approval
      from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Metropolitana de Santos (Brazil)
      under process number 026/2010. Parents/guardians of all participants were properly informed
      regarding the objectives of the study and signed a statement of informed consent.

      Fifty children (3 to 6 years of age) from a private school in the city of Sao Paulo were
      evaluated by means of two questionnaires administered to parents/guardians: The "Undesirable
      Habits Questionnaire", composed of 15 investigative questions on harmful oral habits as well
      as dietary and psychological factors, and the Sleep Habits Questionnaire.6 The data were
      submitted to descriptive analysis. The chi-square test was employed for the categorical
      variables and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to compare mean values. The
      Student's t-test was used for all analyses, with the significance level set at 5%. The SPSS
      12.0 program for Windows was used to analyze the results.
