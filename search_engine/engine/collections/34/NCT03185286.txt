      or allogeneic bone grafts. However, autologous bone graft may cause complications and its
      source is rather limited; allogeneic bone graft may cause disease transmission and the
      mechanical strength of the graft is low after processing.

      The 3D printing technology has provided a new way of solving this problem. It has the
      following technical advantages: wide range of graft sources, high mechanical strength, and
      can be prepared in advance according to various shapes.

      Preparation procedure: first, establish the individualized ankle model according to the
      patient's ankle CT scan data and then prepare the implant model; second, conduct surgery
      rehearsal and place the implant model in the ankle model for observation; third, after
      confirmation, use titanium alloy in the 3D printing machine to prepare the individualized
      metal implant, which is in line with the Chinese National Standard "Wrought titanium and
      titanium alloy for surgical implants" (GB/T 13810-2007); fourth, implant the individualized
      metal implant into the bone defect area after sterilization.
