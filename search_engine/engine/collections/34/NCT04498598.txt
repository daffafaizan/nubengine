      with an ETT which can act coaxially to provide both supraglottic (up position) and
      endotracheal (down position) of ETT. See this modification in

      Currently the proposed change to the conventional SGA has been made and feasibility tested on
      Manikins. The A/Z airway modification is also demonstrated in the attached link video

      In this study, we are trialing the A/Z concept on an original A/Z modification by a
      manufacturer on their currently used SGA. Thus instead of investigators making the changes by
      cutting a channel in a conventional SGA immediately before use in the Operating Room, they
      have asked a manufacturer to do so professionally.
