      principal outcomes are pharmacodynamic endpoints. Specifically, the investigators seek to
      identify: (1) effects of itraconazole on tumor angiogenesis, (2) effects of itraconazole on
      the Hh pathway, (3) biomarker predictors of these effects, (4) the correlation between
      itraconazole pharmacokinetics and these effects, (5) the correlation between different
      biomarkers.

      Up to 15 eligible patients with previously diagnosed or suspected NSCLC planned for resection
      will undergo a study-specific core needle biopsy, imaging (dynamic contrast enhanced [DCE]-,
      diffusion weighted imaging [DWI]-, and arterial spin labeling [ASL] magnetic resonance
      imaging [MRI]), skin punch biopsy, and collection of peripheral blood. Subjects will then
      receive itraconazole 600 mg PO daily for 7-10 days, following which they will undergo repeat
      imaging, skin biopsy, and blood collection. Subsequently they will undergo surgical
      resection. Due to the safety profile of itraconazole when used as an antifungal agent , all
      histologic subtypes of NSCLC will be eligible for the trial. The itraconazole dose of 600 mg,
      higher than an anti-angiogenic dose, has been shown to inhibit the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway.
