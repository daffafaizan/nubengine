      duodenum and small intestine, delays the metabolism and assimilation of carbohydrates, and
      thus effectively decreases postprandial blood glucose(PBG) as well as the risk of
      hypoglycemia before the next meal.Acarbose is now used as the preferred drug for some
      patients with prediabetes and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes millitus(T2DM).This study aims
      to investigate the glycemic excursions with different courses and glycated hemoglobin
      A1c(HbA1c) levels after treated three months with acarbose.To minimize gastrointestinal side
      effects，starting dosage of acarbose of 50 mg is given orally three times daily for 10
      days(with the first bite) of each main meal. Glycemic excursions are evaluated using the mean
      amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), the postprandial glycemic excursions (PPGE) and the
      largest amplitude of glycemic excursions (LAGE).Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring
      system (FGMS，Abbott Laboratories,USA) was administered in this study. According to the
      standard Freestyle Libre Pro operating guidelines, the FGMS is installed in all participants
      to monitor glucose levels of interstitial fluid for 14 consecutive days. The glucose sensor
      is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of upper arm at 8:00-9:00 in the morning.Glucose
      concentrations at 7 preset times per day (before meals, 2-h after meals and at bedtime) were
      determined with VivaChek Ino Smart（VivaChek Laboratories, Inc., USA) every two weeks.Four
      days before using acarbose and five weeks after using acarbose, FGMS was using to monitor the
      continuous glucose.MAGE was calculated for each subject by taking the arithmetic mean of FGM
      values increased or decreased (from nadirs to peaks or vice versa) when both ascending and
      descending segments exceeded the value of one standard deviation (SD) of the FGM values for
      24-h period.The primary endpoint of the study is the extent of change in MAGE.Secondary
      endpoints are changes in PPGE,LAGE and HbA1c. Gene polymorphism is detected for enrolled
      patient with poor acarbose effect.
