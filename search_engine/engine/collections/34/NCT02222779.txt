      Remaining portions of samples collected for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons (paired CSF and
      blood serum samples). No lumbar puncture will be done specifically for this protocol.

      The objective of this study is to gain an overview about transition metals concentrations in
      blood serum and CSF in order to provide preliminary data on patients. The effect of
      neurodegenerative diseases on metals or the other way round will be assessed if possible.
