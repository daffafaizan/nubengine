      successful vaccine for HIV prevention. The VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP vaccine used in this study was
      developed to incorporate HIV genes from multiple virus clades, representing the viral
      subtypes responsible for about 90% of new HIV infections in the world. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP in healthy, HIV
      uninfected individuals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and will be followed for one
      year. Study injections will be given by needle-free intramuscular injection at the start of
      study and at Months 1 and 2. Group 1 will receive 3 injections of the study vaccine; Group 2
      will receive 2 injections of the study vaccine (at start and Month 2) and injection of
      placebo (at Month 1); Group 3 will receive 3 injections of placebo. After a screening visit,
      study visits will occur at enrollment (initial injection) followed by 5 visits every 14 days
      for the first 2.5 months, with three additional visits at Months 6, 9, and 12. All
      participants will undergo physical exams, blood and urine tests to assess measures of health,
      and blood tests to assess HIV infection and immune response to the injections.
