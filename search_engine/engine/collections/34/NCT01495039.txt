      contents, rectal swab, groin skin fold swab, urine, and blood. These tests will be performed
      in each patient at ICU admission (T0) and subsequently every 3 days throughout the ICU stay
      (T3, T6, T9â€¦), as routine in our ICU.The specimens were placed in a dry medium and taken to
      the Mycology Laboratory. Group assignment was not indicated on specimens, the mycologists
      were therefore blinded to treatment allocation.

      Each specimen was directly microscopically examined and cultured on Sabouraud media.
