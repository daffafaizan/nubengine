    
      Aspiration is a serious morbidity that leads to an increase in both patient mortality and
      duration of hospital stays. Many practices exist within the hospital setting whose goal is to
      help prevent clinically significant aspiration including preoperative starvation,
      pharmaceutically reducing gastric acidity, facilitating gastric drainage, postural changes,
      cricoid pressure, endotracheal cuff pressure modification, and maintenance of a competent
      lower esophageal sphincter. However, to date, no monitoring system exists to help a clinician
      identify active aspiration. At present, video fluoroscopy, is the gold standard for detecting
      aspiration. This pilot prospective cohort study will examine the incidence of supraglottic pH
      readings.

      A continuous pH/impedence sensor will be placed immediately above the glottic opening in four
      high risk populations: burn patients who are intubated, intubated post-stroke patients,
      patients undergoing robotic prostectomy, and in patients undergoing peritoneal tumor
      debulking and chemotherapy. The presence of acidic fluid above the glottic opening will be
      measured using a supraglottic impendence/pH probe attached to an endotracheal tube.
