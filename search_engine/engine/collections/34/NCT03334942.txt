      period may promote recovery and reduce posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following violent
      injury by facilitating cognitive and emotional processing of trauma reactions, increasing
      coping capacity, and providing emotional support.

      Investigators seek to evaluate the effectiveness of the Child and Family Traumatic Stress
      Intervention (CFTSI), provided soon after a violent traumatic event, in producing significant
      and sustained reduction in PTSS among assault injured youth.

      Participants will be recruited from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) emergency
      department (ED) or Trauma Unit following interpersonal assault. Investigators seek to enroll
      300 participants from CHOP. Participants must reside in Philadelphia County with a caregiver
      for at least the last six months, be 8 to 18 years of age (inclusive), have been received for
      an injury resulting from a qualifying interpersonal assault, and both child and caregiver
      must be able to speak English. Youth must have a Child Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      Symptom Scale (CPSS) score > or = 11 during study screening.The Child and Family Traumatic
      Stress Intervention (CFTSI) is the study intervention. The primary outcome measure is
      youth-reported PTSS at 4 and 10 months.
