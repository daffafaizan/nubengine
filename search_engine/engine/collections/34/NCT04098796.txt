    
      AFP-elevated gastric adenocarcinoma is a special type of gastric cancer, with the
      characteristics of high risk of liver and lymph node metastasis, poor therapeutic effect, and
      dismal prognosis.

      This prospective study is a single-arm, multicenter phase II clinical study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with chemotherapy as first-line
      treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced recurrent or metastatic serum
      AFP-elevated gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

      AFP elevation is defined as serum AFP > 20 ng/ml. In this prospective study, the objective
      remission rate (ORR) will be used as primary outcome measures and 30 patients will be
      recruited. Anti-PD-1 antibody in combination with chemotherapy will be administered. PD-L1
      expression and tumor mutant burden (TMB) will be measured before treatment. In addition, the
      dynamic changes of serum AFP levels, T lymphocyte in peripheral blood will be monitored
      during treatment. In the course of treatment, safety evaluation will be carried out according
      to the standard of adverse reaction classification (CTCAE) 4.0.
