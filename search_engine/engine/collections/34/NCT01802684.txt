      evaluated in a large phase III study (EFC10262-VELOUR). This new combination significantly
      improved both PFS (4.7 to 6.9 months, HR=0.76; P=.00007) and OS (12.1 to 13.5 months,
      HR=0.82; P=.0032). In the evaluable population (86.5%), the tumor response rate was also
      improved when adding aflibercept (ORR=19.8% [16.4-23.2]) to the FOLFIRI regimen (ORR=11.1%
      [8.5-13.8]).

      This trial will evaluate the feasibility of adding aflibercept to an oxaliplatin-based
      regimen as a first-line therapy , using the OPTIMOX strategy rather than a continuous
      administration of chemotherapy until progression, in order to decrease the risk of severe
      toxicities.
