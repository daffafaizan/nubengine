      sensitization are playing an important role and this can lead to postoperative
      hypersensitization. Several studies have shown, that S (+) ketamine can be effective to
      reduce sensitization and postoperative pain. Ketamine (2-O-chlorophenyl-2-methylamino
      cyclohexanone) is a N-Methyl-D-Aspartat (NMDA) receptor antagonist. S (+) ketamine has a four
      times stronger affinity to the NMDA receptor compared to R (-) ketamine. The duration of
      action for S (+) ketamine is shorter than R (-) ketamine and it has fewer side-effects.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the analgetic effect of pregabalin and placebo used
      in the perioperative period.

      The hypothesis is that perioperative intravenous S (+) ketamine gives significant better
      analgesia than placebo without effecting cognitive function.

      The study is including patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy.
