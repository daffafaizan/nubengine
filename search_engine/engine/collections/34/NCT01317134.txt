      and serological markers in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The focus will be on
      L-arginine metabolism and to clarify its influence on endothelial function. The investigators
      also want to evaluate differences in plasma concentrations of L-arginine/NO metabolites and
      non-invasively assessed endothelial function based on specific PH-therapy.

      Furthermore, the investigators aim to transfer the results gained from the investigators
      study population to in-vitro systems in order to carefully characterize the involved signal
      transduction pathways. Thereby the investigators hope to identify potentially new therapeutic
      targets in PH or patient subgroups preferably benefitting from established therapeutic
      options.
