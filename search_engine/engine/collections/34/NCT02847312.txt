    
      -  To investigate the chronic effects of daily intake of oat products on flow mediated
           dilatation of the brachial artery (FMD; primary endpoint), microvascular endothelial
           function (measured by laser Doppler iontophoresis), pulse wave analysis, gut microbiota
           diversity, 24h blood pressure, activity of the renin angiotensin system, markers related
           to cellular production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, inflammatory
           cytokines, and further potentially emerging biochemical markers of CVD risk.

        -  To establish if phenolic acids and avenanthramides from oat products exert
           cardiovascular and microbial effects in a dose dependent manner.

        -  To measure urinary and fecal excretion of avenanthramide and phenolic acid metabolites.

      To explore correlations between bacterial population changes and CVD risk markers.
