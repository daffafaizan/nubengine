      the major cause of recurrence and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Previously in
      the investigators' research, the investigators find the contribution of gut microbiota to
      chemoresistance in patients with colorectal cancer. The investigators found that
      Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) was abundant in colorectal cancer tissues in patients with
      recurrence post chemotherapy, and was associated with patient clinicopathological
      characterisitcs. Furthermore, the investigators' bioinformatic and functional studies
      demonstrated that Fn promoted colorectal cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Metronidazole has
      been known to treat with anaerobe infection, including Fusobacterium. So oral metronidazole
      would be used to reduce the abundance of Fn in patients with high Fn, so as to explore
      whether oral metronidazole can improve the efficacy of postoperative chemotherapy in patients
      with colorectal cancer.
