      acute coronary syndrome, treated with ProlimÂ® stent between January and December 2013 in two
      interventional cardiology centers in Poland. Angiographic control was planned at 12 months,
      in which 15% of patients (randomly chosen) underwent optical coherence tomography analysis.
      The primary end-point was the cumulative rate of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and
      target lesion revascularization after 12 months.
