    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effect of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels on the immunologic response
      (antibody responses week 4 [4 weeks (+/- 7 days)] post-vaccination) to the injectable
      seasonal (2011-2012) trivalent influenza vaccine among Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI)
      employees. (Observational component) II. To examine the effect of vitamin D3
      (cholecalciferol) supplementation on the immunologic response (antibody response Week 16 [4
      weeks (+/- 7 days)] post-vaccination) to the injectable seasonal (2012-2013) trivalent
      influenza vaccine among RPCI employees. (Intervention component)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To track occurrences of flu-like illness in the study population from November 1, 2011
      through April 1, 2012, using a standardized epidemiologic questionnaire. (Observational
      component) II. To determine the relationship between 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels at time of
      vaccination and its immunologic responses Week 20 (8 weeks [+/- 7 days]) and Week 24 (12
      weeks [+/- 7 days]) following administration of the injected seasonal (2012-2013) trivalent
      influenza vaccine. (Intervention component) III. To track occurrences of flu-like illnesses
      in the study population from November 2012 through April 2013, using a standardized
      epidemiologic questionnaire. (Intervention component) IV. To evaluate the association between
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polymorphisms in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      sequence of vitamin-D3 metabolizing enzymes, measures of vitamin-D3 metabolism (24,25 hydroxy
      [OH] vitamin D3) and response to seasonal (2012-201) trivalent influenza vaccine.
      (Intervention component)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive low-dose cholecalciferol orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks,
      followed by the seasonal (2012-2013) trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM).

      ARM II: Patients receive high-dose cholecalciferol PO QD for 12 weeks, followed by the
      seasonal (2012-2013) trivalent influenza vaccine IM.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
