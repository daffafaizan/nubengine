    
      A group of 60 chronic hepatitis B patients combined with antiviral therapy will be recruited
      for study, which involved a 6 times IMT with gastroduodenoscopy and the time interval is
      generally 2 weeks. All participants will keep their present antiviral therapy. All
      participants will be assessed at baseline, after 1 months, 3 months, 6 months from baseline
      in order to evaluate the possible changes in:(1)Decrease of serum hepatitis B virus surface
      antigen(HBsAg) levels(as measured in IU/mL) and hepatitis B virus e antigen(HBeAg) levels(as
      measured in S/CO); (2)Appearance of serum anti-hepatitis B virus surface antigen(anti-HBs)
      and anti-hepatitis B virus e antigen(anti-HBe); (3)Relief of gastrointestinal symptoms:The
      onset and duration of gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed by "Evaluation Score Table
      of Gastrointestinal Symptoms"; (4)Changes of gut microbiota: The changes of gut microbiota
      will be assessed by High-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA) in fecal samples from recruited
      patients before and after IMT.
