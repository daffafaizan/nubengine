      combination regimen against uncomplicated falciparum malaria in SSA.

      The primary objective of this study is: To study the safety of the triple combination
      AS-AQ-MB compared to AS-AQ-PQ in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in young
      African children. The secondary objective of this study is: To study the efficacy of this
      MB-based triple combination in comparison with standard ACT-PQ in the treatment of
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in young African children.

      It is a mono-center, open randomised controlled non-inferiority study in children with
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso. Patients will be randomised to two
      treatment groups (arms):

        1. AS-AQ-MB

        2. AS-AQ-PQ

      Study population: Children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria from Nouna
      Hospital in north-western Burkina Faso.

      Sample size: 100 patients (50 per study arm).

      Treatment: The group AS-AQ-MB will receive once daily a fixed dose AS-AQ formulation combined
      with once daily MB (15 mg/kg) over a three days period. The control group will receive once
      daily a fixed dose AS-AQ over three days combined with a single dose of PQ on day 2 (0.25
      mg/kg).

      Endpoints: Primary endpoint is the haemoglobin value on day 7 compared to baseline. Secondary
      endpoints are adverse events (AE), adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) rate
      (PCR-corrected for recrudescences), as well as gametocyte prevalence and density.
