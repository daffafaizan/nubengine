      primary total hip arthroplasty performed either through a direct anterior approach or a
      lateral approach. At our hospital(i.e. Emergency County Hospital Cluj-Napoca), the lateral
      transgluteal approach was standard for more than 40 years. Starting 2008,the minimally
      invasive anterior approach was gradually implemented with the aim to facilitate early
      rehabilitation and improve functional results. Reduced blood loss, earlier functional
      recovery, low dislocation rates and shorter stays in hospital have been attributed to the
      muscle-sparing properties of the anterior approach.
