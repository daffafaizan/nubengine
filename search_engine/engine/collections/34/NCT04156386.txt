      acknowledged that nutritional supplements derived from animal protein sources, including whey
      from milk, aids recovery when taken immediately after strenuous exercise. However, the effect
      of vegan protein supplements are less understood, and how they affect recovery of strength
      and soreness is not known. This is an important area of research due to the increasing demand
      for plant-based protein.
