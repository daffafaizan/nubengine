      structure and cognitive impairment. Mid-life obesity is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease
      and vascular dementia. The mechanisms underlying obesity related decline in cognitive
      function are not fully understood. The long-term goal of this research is to identify how
      obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and their treatment impact brain structure and function.
      The investigators propose that IR and obesity related inflammation are two modifiable factors
      that affect neuronal integrity and lead to cognitive dysfunction. In this proposal,
      investigators will test two hypotheses: 1) among obese patients planning to undergo bariatric
      surgery (specifically vertical sleeve gastrectomy), baseline IR and systemic and brain
      markers of inflammation will inversely correlate with performance on cognitive testing and
      correlate with abnormalities in brain structure and 2) following bariatric surgery subjects
      who experience the greatest reduction in IR and obesity related inflammation will have the
      greatest improvement in cognitive function and brain structure. To address these hypotheses,
      investigators will use a comprehensive battery of tests to evaluate cognition and state of
      the art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to assess brain structure and
      neurochemistry before and six months after bariatric surgery.
