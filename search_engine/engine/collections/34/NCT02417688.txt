      demonstrate feasibility of PET imaging of radiopharmaceutical nanoparticle
      Cu[64]-25%CANF-Comb uptake by PET-MR. Patients will undergo Cu[64]-25%CANF-Comb PET-MR
      imaging of both carotid arteries. Both carotid arteries will be imaged at the same time. We
      hope to demonstrate differences in PET SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) in the significantly
      atherosclerotic artery in patients who will be going to carotid endarterectomy surgery in
      comparison to the PET SUV in the artery that is not significantly diseased (ie; the artery
      that will not undergo surgery) . We also will determine whether PET SUV of the
      Cu[64]-25%CANF-Comb by the plaque correlates to the American Heart Association
      classifications of atherosclerosis and tissue presence of NPR-C in the ex vivo carotid
      endarterectomy specimen post surgery as measured by RT-PCR.
