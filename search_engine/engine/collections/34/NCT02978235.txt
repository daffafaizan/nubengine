    
      Background and Rationale:

      • TAS4464 is an investigational NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, a compound which may
      affect cancer cell growth and survival. Thus, TAS4464 may help in the treatment of cancer.

      Phase 1:

      Primary:

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of TAS4464

        -  To identify a tolerated dose of TAS4464

      Secondary:

        -  To investigate the preliminary efficacy of TAS4464

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and the pharmacogenomics (PGx) of TAS4464

        -  To investigate the pharmacodynamics of TAS4464

      Phase 2:

      Primary:

      • To investigate the efficacy of TAS4464

      Secondary:

      • To further investigate the safety profile of TAS4464
