      will be examined within 24 h and at 48 h after placement of VA-ECMO. The VA-ECMO blood flow
      will be recorded, and the baseline microcirculation will be examined. After the ECMO
      technician adjusting the ECMO flow, sublingual microcirculation will be examined 2 minutes
      after each adjustment, and the change of ECMO blood flow will be recorded. When the ECMO team
      plans to weaning off the ECMO within 72 h, the sublingual microcirculation will be examined.
      The VA-ECMO blood flow will be reduced by ECMO technician, and sublingual microcirculation
      will be examined 2 minutes after each adjustment of the blood flow. The ECMO parameters,
      medications, and clinical data will be recorded, and the prognosis will be followed up on the
      28th day.
