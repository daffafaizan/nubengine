    
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder that affects over 800,000 people in the U.S. Due
      to the limited mobility associated with the disorder, individuals with CP have an increased
      risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis,
      compared to the general population. Therefore, identifying treatment strategies is of utmost
      importance. The aim of this study is to examine the acute and chronic effects of
      low-magnitude vibration on muscle, physical activity, and balance in children with CP. Fat
      concentration and muscle will be assessed using imaging techniques. Physical activity will be
      assessed using activity monitors. Balance will be assessed using clinical and biomechanical
      tests. Children with CP will be tested at five time points: baseline, 1 and 6 months after
      standing on a vibration platform daily 10 minutes per day, 1 and 6 months post treatment (7
      months and 12 months from baseline, respectively). The findings from the proposed study will
      help us determine if vibration shows promise as a treatment for the impaired mobility, lower
      physical activity and higher risk of chronic disease in individuals with CP.
