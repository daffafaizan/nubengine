    
      This is a Phase I, open label, first in human study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and PK of escalating doses of DCBCI0901 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Each treatment cycle will be 28 days in duration with no gap between cycles. During each
      cycle, DCBCI0901 will be administered slowly as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion (use of
      infusion pump preferred) once daily (QD) in the first 5 day dosing period (Days 1 to 5),
      which will be followed by 9 days of recovery and observation (Days 6 14). DCBCI0901 will be
      administered intravenously QD in a second 5 day dosing period (Days 15 through 19), followed
      again by 9 days of recovery and observation (Days 20 through 28).

      Patients may continue to receive treatment in 28 day cycles after completion of Cycle 1. To
      qualify for continued treatment beyond Cycle 1, all of the following criteria must be
      fulfilled:

        -  The patient is willing to receive further treatment

        -  Toxicity induced by the IP is not considered to be unbearable as judged by the
           Investigator

        -  The patient does not have PD as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors

        -  The patient satisfies the criteria for dosing

        -  The patient does not meet any of the criteria for withdrawal

      After the first cycle, CT/MRI assessment will be performed once every 8 weeks (2 cycles) for
      efficacy evaluation, or per Investigator judgment. After the first year of treatment, the
      Investigator will assess the patient using CT/MRI based on his/her discretion.

      Safety data will be evaluated according to normal practice.

      Upon discontinuation of study treatment (if applicable), assessments for the Early
      termination visit (if discontinuation occurs in Cycle 1) or End of Treatment visit (if
      discontinuation occurs in Cycle 2 or onwards) should occur within 3 days of discontinuation.
      Assessments for the Follow up visit (10 days [±1 day] after the last dose of IP) and End of
      Study (EOS) visit (30 days [±3 days] after the last dose of IP)
