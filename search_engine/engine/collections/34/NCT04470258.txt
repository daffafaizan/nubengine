    
      Objectives: 1. Validate the functionalities to fulfill the requirements and evaluate the
      usability of the Elmo System and 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Elmo system in the
      treatment of support to patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by COVID-19.

      Methods: This is a study divided into two stages. For objective 1, tests will be carried out
      on healthy volunteers using prototypes of the Elmo system and assessing whether their
      effectiveness in providing positive airway pressure and their usability from the perspective
      of their primary users (doctor, physiotherapist and nurses) and the comfort of the volunteer.
      After the tests to meet the requirements: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) offer,
      guarantee of the maintenance of alveolar ventilation without carbon dioxide (CO2)
      rebreathing, monitoring of intra-ELMO pressure, minimization of the adverse effects of the
      system such as noise, face temperature, dryness of the airways and overall comfort . In
      addition, realistic simulations will be carried out, centered on the assessment based on
      heuristic principles by a multiprofessional team with experience in mechanical ventilation,
      to assess the performance of the new equipment in the execution of the pre-defined skills.
      The second phase will consist of a clinical trial with application of the Elmo System to 10
      patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure by COVID-19, to evaluate its effectiveness,
      through the analysis of physiological variables and patient comfort, as well as their
      clinical outcomes (need for tracheal intubation) and Insuf recovery time. Resp. Hypoxemic and
      need for O2 in a referral hospital for the treatment of this condition in Fortaleza / Ceara.
