      is removed, is a life-saving procedure. The complication rate of cranioplasty, a
      neurosurgical procedure where the acquired skull defect is reconstructed, ranges from 11% to
      26% and includes postoperative hemorrhage and infection. (4) The syndrome of the trephined is
      a recognized long-term complication in which certain groups of patients, experience
      debilitating neurocognitive deficits in addition to chronic headache, dizziness, fatigability
      and clinical depression. (2) It is believed that the lack of an overlying bone may cause
      undue significant atmospheric pressure on the underlying cortex, thereby reducing cerebral
      perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid flow. There are reports that cognitive improvement can be
      observed in up to 30% of patients after cranioplasty yet the underlying mechanism for this
      observation is unclear. (1) Some studies have demonstrated enhanced cerebral perfusion by
      non-invasive investigations, but there is a lack of large scale systematically performed
      studies to verify such cerebral hemodynamic effects. (1-3) Clinical equipoise exists
      regarding the optimum timing of cranioplasty procedures after craniectomies. While the
      anecdotal practice of delaying cranioplasty for at least 3 months after a craniectomy is
      common, local and overseas observational studies suggest that performing early cranioplasties
      (i.e. within 3 months) is equally safe in terms of infection and other operative
      complications. (4-6)
