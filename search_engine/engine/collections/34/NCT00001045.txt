    
      Of the HIV-1 mutations reported to be associated with zidovudine resistance, the mutation at
      codon 215 of the reverse transcriptase gene is the most commonly occurring and has the
      greatest impact on susceptibility. When this mutation appears, a change in drugs may prevent
      further immunologic and virologic deterioration.

      Initially, all patients receive AZT alone. After detection of a 215 mutation in plasma RNA,
      patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms: AZT alone, AZT plus ddI, or AZT/ddI
      plus nevirapine. Patients are followed every 8 weeks and receive treatment for up to 4 years.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 5/9/96: All AZT monotherapy options have been eliminated. Patients will be
      randomized to either Arm II or Arm III, regardless of their codon 215 status. All patients
      who were randomized to Arm I following a mutation at codon 215 will be rerandomized to Arm II
      or Arm III. All patients who were randomized to either Arm II or Arm III following a mutation
      at codon 215 will remain on their initial randomized assignment.
