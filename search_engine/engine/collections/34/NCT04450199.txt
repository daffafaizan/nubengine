    
      This study will be a randomized, 1:1 placebo controlled, blinded, prospective study of level
      I evidence. The investigators will recruit patients undergoing a major ankle, hindfoot, or
      midfoot arthrodesis and obtain serum vitamin D levels. Patients that are vitamin D deficient
      (<30 ng/mL) will then be randomized into two treatment groups: vitamin D supplementation
      (50,000 IU D2) and no vitamin D supplementation, receiving placebo. Vitamin D levels will be
      drawn on the day of surgery and 6-8 weeks post-operatively. Outcome variables tested in this
      study are as follows: bone fusion as an event, time to bone fusion, VAS, and SF-36.

      The study will be conducted at 4 investigative sites within the Allegheny Health Network;
      West Penn Hospital, Forbes Regional Hospital, Twin Towers and Steel Valley Orthopedics &
      Sports Medicine, Jefferson Hills, PA. Recruitment will stop when approximately 150 subjects
      are entering the follow-up phase of the study.
