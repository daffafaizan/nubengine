      preoperative screening visit, two operative visits, and nine post-implantation visits. Both
      eyes will be implanted, with the second eye implantation to occur 2-21 days after the first.
      Primary endpoint data will be collected at the final visit (990-1140 days post-implantation
      from the date of second eye surgery).
