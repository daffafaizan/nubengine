      inflammatory cytokines, nicotinamide may enhance the effects of current topical treatments.
      Preliminary studies have shown that nicotinamide, which is a vitamin B derivative, is
      effective in the treatment of psoriasis. According to lack of data, we will investigate the
      beneficial effects of adding nicotinamide to calcipotriol for patients with mild to moderate
      psoriasis.
