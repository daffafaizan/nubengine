      given the option to continue in a 6-month extension phase upon completion of 18 months of
      teriparatide treatment. This extension will allow for collection of additional bone quality
      data. In Canada, the use of teriparatide is currently approved for 18 months. Patients in
      Canada may be given the opportunity to participate in the 6-month extension phase, contingent
      upon Health Canada approval of the use of teriparatide treatment for 24 months.
