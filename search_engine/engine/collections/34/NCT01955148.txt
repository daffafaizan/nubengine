      present in cervicovaginal secretions, and evaluate the clinical utility of the test in
      assessing spontaneous Pre-Term Bith risk in a high risk population. Identifying women at high
      risk of giving birth prematurely can be challenging. It is believed that higher levels of fFn
      measured in vaginal fluid suggest a woman is at a greater risk for delivering early. fFN
      testing is already approved for use in women from weeks 22 to 35 of pregnancy. The goal of
      this study is to evaluate the benefits of collecting fFN measurements from a vaginal fluid
      specimen taken during early pregnancy (from 16 weeks to 22 weeks) to assess the risk of
      pre-term birth.
