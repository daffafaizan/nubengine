    
      A prospective, non-randomized, single arm, multi-center observational study designed to
      evaluate the use of the SpringTMS system in reducing the frequency of headache days.

      Note: This is a NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK (NSR) study of a NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK (NSR) Device. It
      is a post market study of a NSR device cleared by FDA through the 510(k) pre-market
      notification process. The cleared indications for use are provided above. This NSR study is
      designed to collect information on additional applications of the SpringTMS device. These
      additional applications include:

        1. Use of the device to evaluate the potential for regular use of sTMS to reduce the
           frequency, severity, and/or duration of migraine.

        2. Delivery of additional treatments (pulses) to evaluate the acute treatment efficacy of
           breakthrough migraine attacks with and without aura.
