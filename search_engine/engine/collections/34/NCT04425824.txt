      antibody that binds to PD-1 and prevents binding of PD-1 with programmed death ligands 1
      (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2). Rituximab is an antibody to CD20 molecules. One of the mechanisms of
      killing tumor cells is through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). These
      two drugs may have a synergistic effect on anti-tumor. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether Toripalimab with Rituximab is effective and safe for treatment of relapsed
      refractory CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This is an exploratory small sample,
      phase II, single-center clinical trial, which is going to enroll 20 participants.
