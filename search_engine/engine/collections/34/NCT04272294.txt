    
      The objective of this pilot study is to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of diffuse
      reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and Raman spectroscopy (RS) at detecting treatment-resistant
      disease when DRS and RS are used together to measure treatment-induced reoxygenation and
      molecular changes in tumors of the oral cavity. This study will be performed in a total of 90
      patients that have Stage 3 or 4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with primary
      tumors located in the larynx or one tonsil.

      This study is a single-arm, single-center observational pilot study of the accuracy of DRS+RS
      at distinguishing early between treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive disease in
      study-eligible subjects undergoing first-line chemoradiation therapy for Stage 3 or 4 HNSCC
      of the larynx or tonsil.

      Three (3) optical spectra each will be collected from the tumor, an adjacent normal site, and
      a normal tissue site on the buccal mucosa prior to treatment. The subject will undergo 4
      repeat post-treatment measures taken after radiation therapy begins (marked as Day 1). Repeat
      measures will be taken on Day 2(+1), Day 4(±1), Day 7(±1), and Day 10(±1). The probe will be
      performed at the beginning of the radiation therapy visit, prior to the radiation dose that
      day.
