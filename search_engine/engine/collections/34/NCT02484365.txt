      pediatric patients during preoperative period. The investigators will collect the venous
      sample and the noninvasive hemoglobin data from masimo within 1 hour. Without any additional
      medication, the patients will visit preanesthetic room and attach the probe of masimo on
      index finger. The R 20L or R25L will be used based on their weight. The parameter will be
      stabilized within 2 minutes and the SpHb and perfusion index will be recorded.
