      anti-inflammatory/proinflammatory ratio, and may also improve intestinal motility, and the
      bacterial composition of the intestines. There is a substantial body of evidence in support
      of the use of probiotics in IBS. Probiotics appear to be particularly effective in the
      reduction of abdominal bloating and discomfort. The strains of the multispecies probiotic
      combination (BIO-25 LR) were tested and found to be beneficial in well-designed studies of
      IBS patients. Patients with post-infectious IBS, as well as many patients with "classic" IBS,
      manifest a low-grade inflammatory state that may be associated with visceral hypersensitivity
      and impaired motility. Probiotics may suppress this low-grade inflammation. In a recent study
      we found that highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP), a serum marker of micro-inflammation, was
      significantly higher in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS than healthy controls,
      although within normal limits in both groups. Thus, hs-CRP may serve as a marker of this
      low-grade, sub-clinical inflammation. If treatment with probiotic reduces the degree of
      low-grade inflammation in IBS, the improvement may be reflected in reduced hs-CRP levels.
      This study can contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of IBS and provide
      further evidence for the effectiveness of probiotic in its treatment.
