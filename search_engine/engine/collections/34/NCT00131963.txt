      Primary

        -  Determine the pharmacogenomics of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin and
           cyclophosphamide and/or paclitaxel in women with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer.

        -  Determine treatment-induced myelosuppression (e.g., neutropenia) in patients treated
           with adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide who have polymorphisms in drug activation
           and metabolism genes.

        -  Correlate the incidence of peripheral neuropathy with pharmacogenomic analysis in
           patients treated with paclitaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine response (i.e., relapse in the adjuvant setting) during a 10-year follow-up
           period in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive treatment on The Cancer and Leukemia
      Group B study(CALGB) CALGB-40101 OR are assigned to receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens on this
      study.

        -  Regimen 1: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 10 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over
           30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

        -  Regimen 2: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in regimen 1. Patients
           then receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months and then
      annually for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (300 treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
      and 200 treated with paclitaxel) will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.
