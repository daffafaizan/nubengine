    
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the occurrence of first trimester bleeding
      among patients with abnormal uterine artery Doppler.

      A prospective study is designed and two groups will be studied; patients with abnormal
      uterine artery Doppler at second trimester (study group) and patient with normal uterine
      artery Doppler at second trimester (control group). Both the study group and the control
      group represent high risk pregnant patients and the Doppler flows are done as part of the
      patient's predictive risk for placental associated abnormalities. The patients will be asked,
      as part of the routine history taken before the US about having first trimester bleeding
      during the current pregnancy.
