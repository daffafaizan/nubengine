      standard treatment ("refractory group") and patients who did not receive any treatment for
      pruritus ("naïve group"). The intensity of itch will be evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) score. In the refractory group Aprepitant (125 mg on day 1; 80 mg on day 3; 80 mg on
      day 5) will be administered after at least 1 week of standard systemic treatment. In the
      naïve group, Aprepitant will be administered after the first onset of severe pruritus. The
      primary end point is to evaluate the effect of aprepitant in managing pruritus both in naive
      and refractory group.
