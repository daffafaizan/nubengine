    
      This is a single center, observational study to determine if geriatric patients who are on
      five or more chronic medications will have a difference in clinical, humanistic, and/or
      economic outcome through an integrated clinical pharmacy service intervention. The primary
      efficacy objective will be assessed through a single cohort, paired research design measuring
      the change from baseline in the adherence rate, number of medication related problems, and
      Beers criteria medications. The primary economic objective will be assessed through
      prescription revenue to validate the employment of a 0.5-1.0 Full-time equivalent (FTE).
      Secondary efficacy objectives will be assessed through a single cohort, paired research
      design measuring the change from baseline in the health literacy, optimization in the
      anthropometrics, and health related quality of life (HRQOL).
