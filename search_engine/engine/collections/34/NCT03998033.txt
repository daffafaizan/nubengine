    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a genetically modified autologous T-cell therapy
      for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ET140202 T cells are autologous T cells
      genetically modified to carry a TCR-mimic (TCRm) construct capable of mediating cell killing
      by targeting tumor specific intracellular antigens and addressing solid tumor therapy
      challenges.
