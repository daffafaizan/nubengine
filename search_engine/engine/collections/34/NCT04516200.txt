      To determine the effect of Transcranial direct current stimulation on sensory integration and
      risk of falling in diabetic polyneuropathy.

      BACKGROUND:

      Diabetic polyneuropathy is the most prevalent chronic complication affecting 30% - 50% of
      diabetic patients. Diabetic polyneuropathy usually affect the peripheral, autonomic, and
      central nervous systems with several clinical symptoms .About 80% of the cases of DN manifest
      as distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy which is responsible for cases of chronic
      pain; impaired sleep quality; increase of the falling risk associated with weakness and
      increase of the risk of extremities amputation. Transcranial direct current stimulation is
      neurophysiologic intervention that alters cortical excitability to enhance lower extremity
      somato-sensation and thus improve functional outcomes.

      HYPOTHESES:

      There will be no effect of Transcranial direct current stimulation on sensory integration and
      risk of falling in diabetic polyneuropathy
