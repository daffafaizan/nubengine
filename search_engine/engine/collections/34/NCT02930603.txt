    
      Developmental Disabilities (DD) is defined as a group of neurodevelopmental issues, leading
      to significant lag in one or more areas (e.g. cognition, speech, motor, self-care and
      psychosocial function) for various reasons. On the basis of International Classification of
      Functioning, Disability and Health -Children and Youth Version (ICF-CY) framework, problems
      related to Developmental Disabilities further limit activities of daily living (ADL) and
      participation of patients.
