    
      Head and neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common head and neck
      malignant tumors. Investigators found that several patients with early TNM stage and poor
      differentiated HNSCC had poor prognosis, yet someone with advanced TNM stage and well
      differentiated HNSCC had good prognosis. Hence, Investigators suggested that prognosis
      factors and survival rates probably related to the differentiation of HNSCC, and prognosis
      factor of poorly differentiated HNSCC were rare discussed and controversy. Investigating the
      prognostic factors of poorly differentiated HNSCC is undoubtedly crucial.

      About this study ,inclusion criteria were the following parts:

      the patients of poor differentiated HNSCC ; T1-4aN0-2M0; pathological examination: poor
      differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; initial treatment(primary, without surgery,
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy); range:18-70 years old; KPS>80; hemogram and the function of
      main organ such as heart, lung, liver and kidney were normal; having the endoscopy, CT and
      MRI before formed into different groups; sign the informed consent file, good compliance.

      AND the exclusion criteria were:

      uncontrollable epileptic seizure, disorder of central nervous system or unconsciousness cause
      by psychosis; serious and uncontrollable infection; main organ system failure (including
      heart ,lung ,liver and kidney); reject training; high and moderate differentiated squamous
      cell carcinoma
