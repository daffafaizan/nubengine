      patients will be recruited from multiple high volume centers in Sweden. To determine if there
      is evidence of inferiority as per benchmarking recommendations by The Orthopaedic Data
      Evaluation Panel the following parameters will be studied: Clinical parameters such as EQ-5D,
      Oxford Hip Score and Forgotten Joint Score, preoperative and after 1, 3, 6 and 10 years.
      Conventional radiography will be done preoperatively, postoperatively, 3, 6 and 10 years
      after total hip replacement. CTMA will be done postoperatively, 3 and 6 month and 2 years
      after total hip replacement.
