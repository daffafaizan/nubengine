      brain beyond what might be expected from normal aging. Particularly affected areas include
      memory, attention, language, and problem solving. Especially in the later stages of the
      condition, affected persons may be disoriented in place and in person (not knowing who they
      are).

      The prevalence of dementia is rising as the global life expectancy is rising. Particularly in
      Western countries, there is increasing concern about the economic impact that dementia will
      have in future, older populaces.

      It is a disease that is strongly associated with age; 1% of those aged 60-65, 6% of those
      aged 75-79, and 45% of those aged 95 or older suffer from the disease.

      We are postulating that the use of far infrared radiation on the central nervous system, the
      endocrine system and the viscera will have a positive effect on treating dementia and other
      neurological illnesses.
