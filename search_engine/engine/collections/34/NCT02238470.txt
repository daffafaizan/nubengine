      Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH-OA) in patients with ischemic stroke who will receive Oral
      Anticoagulants (OA) for the secondary prevention of stroke. By allowing the detection and
      quantification of leukoaraiosis and microbleeding, MR aids in the assessment of hypertensive
      and/or amyloid angiopathy, two findings that may increase the risk of ICH-OA. The study of
      these and other known variables associated with the risk of ICH-OA will improve the selection
      of patients to be treated with OA. METHODOLOGY. A prospective, observational, multicentric
      study of 1000 patients with stroke, older than 65 y, candidates to receive OA indefinitely.
      The primary end-point is ICH-OA. A MR will be performed before starting the treatment, in
      which we will evaluate the presence and degree of leukoaraiosis (Fazekas's scale) and
      microbleeding (BOMBS scale). A visit will be scheduled at the first month after inclusion,
      and thereafter the patient will be followed-up during 2 years with phone interviews, to
      evaluate the appearance of the primary end-point. We will register data about demographics,
      vascular risk factors, anticoagulation, MR, echocardiography and co-morbidity. With those
      variables associated with ICH-OA in the univariate analyses, a regression analysis will be
      performed, in which ICH-OA will be the dependent variable. Finally, each independent
      predictive variable will receive a score to elaborate a predictive model of ICH-OA.
