      for categorical data and Mann-Whitney U test for numerical data. Comparison the different
      groups will be conducted by using Mann-Whitney U test for numerical data and using Pearson
      chi-square test for categorical data. The time course of biomarker plasma levels will be
      assessed by analysis of variance. Multivariate analysis will be performed using a logistic
      regression model to estimate the odds ratio of organ failure and dying, along with the 95%
      confidence interval (CI). Forward and backward selection procedures will be used to
      iteratively select the variables potentially related to death.

      Discrimination will be assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve to evaluate how well the model distinguished patients who lived from those who died and
      whether progression of organ dysfunction. A survival analysis will be performed using
      Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. Analyses will be completed and a two-tailed p<0.05
      will be considered significant.
