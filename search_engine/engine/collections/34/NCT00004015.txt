        -  Determine systemic and local toxicity of borocaptate sodium with boron neutron capture
           therapy (BNCT) following craniotomy with gross total resection in patients with
           glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated
           dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated radiation dose of BNCT in cranial localization to
           healthy tissues in these patients under defined conditions.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study.

      Within 6 weeks of surgery, patients receive borocaptate sodium followed 12-18 hours later by
      neutron irradiation. Treatment repeats daily for 4 days.

      Cohorts of 3-9 patients receive escalating doses of neutron irradiation. The maximum
      tolerated dose is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 or more patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 2 months, every 6 weeks for 15 months
      and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
