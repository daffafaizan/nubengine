      (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tapentadol
      immediate-release (IR) 50 mg and 75 mg in patients who are undergoing bunionectomy (a
      surgical procedure to remove a bunion). This study was designed to be a similar study to the
      pivotal global study of PAI-3003/KF32 in order to bridge the results from the global studies
      and to show similarity in effect of tapentadol between Korean and Caucasian population which
      will allow extrapolation of the foreign clinical data of tapentadol into Korea. The study
      will be divided into screening period, surgical period, qualification period, and a
      double-blind treatment period. The study length, including the screening period, will be up
      to a maximum duration of 32 days. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3
      treatment groups (tapentadol IR 50 mg, tapentadol IR 75 mg or placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio.
      Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed during the study.
