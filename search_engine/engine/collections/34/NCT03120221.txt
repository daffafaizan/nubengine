      trimester of pregnancy. This is of major concern as first trimester iodine sufficiency is
      critical for the development of the fetal brain. Our aim is to evaluate iodine consumption in
      first trimester pregnant women in Israel through dietary questioners, Urinary iodine samples
      and thyroid functions test assessed through blood samples. All data will be analyzed in a
      central lab.
