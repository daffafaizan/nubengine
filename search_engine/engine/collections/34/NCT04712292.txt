      the cause of the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which was initially reported in December
      2019 in China and has since rapidly spread worldwide. Italy, in particular, witnessed the
      rapid and uncontrolled spread of the infection between March and May 2020, and a worrisome
      increasing number of related deaths which rapidly surpassed those of China.

      The need for increased capacity for COVID-19 patients required elective activities to be
      drastically reduced or canceled. In the Northern regions of Italy, which were hit the most
      during the first peak of COVID-19 pandemic, the unprecedented stress on the healthcare system
      was associated with the reduction of the elective surgery and the cancer screening programs,
      including that of colorectal cancer. Studies predicting harmful impact of the COVID-19
      pandemic on cancer care have been already published. However, it has not been proved whether
      the potential delay of diagnosis and treatment could have a measurable effect on patients
      undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer between March and December 2020.

      The aim of the study is therefore to compare the characteristics of patients, the time
      between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis, the oncologic stage, the therapeutic
      treatment and the postoperative outcomes between patients undergoing surgery for cancer of
      the colon and rectum between March and December 2020 and those who had surgery for colorectal
      cancer between March and December 2019.

      Anonimyzed data will be retrospectively collected on a RedCap platform hosted on the servers
      of the Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna. The variables included demographic
      characteristics, comorbidities, details of the disease at the diagnosis, details of the
      neoadjuvant therapy, perioperative variables and 30-day postoperative follow-up variables.
