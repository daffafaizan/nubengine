      I. To establish the feasibility of treatment completion of a combined
      chemoradiation-nivolumab regimen followed by adjuvant nivolumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate at 1 year from completion of therapy, as determined
      by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      II. To determine the locoregional control rate at 1 year post-treatment. III. To determine
      the distant metastasis rate at 1 year post-treatment. IV. To determine the overall survival
      rate at 1 year post-treatment. V. To determine the rate of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) clearance at end of chemoradiation and at 1 year post-treatment.

      VI. To assess patients' quality of life from baseline through 1 year post-treatment.

      VII. To determine the acute and late toxicity rates according to Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5, including immune-related adverse events (AEs).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 of courses 1-5 and
      7-12. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 11 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at course 2, patients undergo radiation therapy once daily
      (QD) 5 days per week and receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 7 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days, at 1, 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 months for up to 1 year, and then every 3 months for 1 year.
