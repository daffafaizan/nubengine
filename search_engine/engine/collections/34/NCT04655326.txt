      microbiota in their stool samples. Customers who have autism spectrum disorders are invited
      to participate in this study by completing several questionnaires about their medical
      history, diet, autism symptoms, and gastrointestinal symptoms before taking the probiotic,
      and to repeat those questionnaires approximately 3 months later. This is effectively an
      open-label study.
