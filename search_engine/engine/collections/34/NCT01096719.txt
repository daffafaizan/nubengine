      the projected increase of these conditions in the future, development of effective weight
      loss and weight loss maintenance strategies is imperative. For weight loss to occur, energy
      intake needs to be reduced to incur an energy deficit, and for successful weight loss
      maintenance, energy intake needs to remain lower than energy intake at pre-weight loss levels
      due to an overall reduction in body size which reduces basal metabolic rate. One dietary
      strategy that may facilitate weight loss maintenance is consuming a diet low in dietary
      energy density (ED). This pilot study will test the effects of a dietary prescription focused
      on ED.

      All participants in the investigation will receive a standard 12-week behavioral obesity
      intervention. The intervention will include an activity goal that participants will gradually
      work to achieve over the course of the 12-week intervention along with standard behavioral
      weight loss strategies. One condition will receive a dietary prescription for weight loss
      that focuses solely on lowering the ED of the diet, another condition will receive the
      traditional dietary prescription used in behavioral weight loss interventions that reduces
      energy intake, and the third condition will receive both prescriptions. Pre and post
      intervention measurements will be taken to determine if there are differences between groups.
