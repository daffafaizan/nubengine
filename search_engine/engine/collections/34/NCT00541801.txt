      and acoustic cardiography before, during, and after the cytostatic treatment.
      Doppler-echocardiography measures ejection fraction, TDI, speckle tracking, and further
      parameters. Acoustic cardiography (Audicor, Inovise Medical Inc., Portland, USA)
      simultaneously integrates heart sounds and single-channel electrocardiography input to
      generate multiple parameters that correlate to established hemodynamic measures. Heart
      function as assessed by Doppler-echocardiography is then compared to the heart function as
      assessed by Audicor ECG.
