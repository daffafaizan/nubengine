    
      All adult patients requiring tracheal intubation in the pre hospital emergency context will
      be included. All intubation will be performed by an emergency physician or a nurse
      specialized in anesthesia. For patients with spontaneous cardiac activity, rapid sequence
      intubation will be performed to allow intubation.

      Comparisons studied will be : Intubation success rate at the first laryngoscopy, glottis
      exposure assessed by Cormack and Lehane classification, difficult intubation rate assessed by
      the Intubation Difficult Score (IDS), the need for alternative airway techniques and the
      immediate post intubation complications rate as vomiting, dental trauma, pulmonary
      inhalation, arterial desaturation , hypotension episodes and cardiac arrest occurrence.
