      the upper respiratory tract, the lungs, and the kidneys. MPA is marked by kidney
      inflammation, weight loss, skin lesions, nerve damage, and fever. Many patients with WG or
      MPA show no visible symptoms of active disease; it is known that underlying subclinical
      disease activity leads to long-term damage in these patients. Also, because it is difficult
      to monitor WG and MPA disease activity, it is difficult for clinicians to know when and how
      to treat these patients. This study will use new scientific methods to identify new
      biomarkers that can be used to monitor disease activity in GPA and MPA patients. These
      biomarkers may be used to help direct clinical care for GPA and MPA patients and assist in
      future drug development.

      Study visits will occur monthly for the first year, then every 3 months thereafter for the
      remainder of the study. Blood and urine collection will occur at every visit. A physical exam
      and medical and medication history will occur every 3 months; also, participants will be
      asked to complete several questionnaires to assess disease activity, health status, and
      tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Participants may have additional study visits if a disease
      flare or disease-related complications occur during the study.
