    
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common hereditary ataxia, with an estimated prevalence
      in Caucasians of 1 in 30,000. Neurological features of FRDA are progressive gait and limb
      ataxia, absent lower limb reflexes, and loss of position and vibration sense. There are
      currently no treatments proven to alter the natural history of FRDA. Resveratrol is a
      naturally occurring compound found in red wine, berries, and nuts. It is postulated to have
      wide-ranging health benefits, including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic and
      neuroprotective properties.

      The study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised 2-period crossover trial of
      2g/day of micronised resveratrol in FRDA over 24 weeks. The study will enrol 40 patients with
      FRDA from 3 sites. The primary outcome measure is the change in modified Friedreich Ataxia
      Rating Scale (mFARS) score from baseline to 24 weeks.
