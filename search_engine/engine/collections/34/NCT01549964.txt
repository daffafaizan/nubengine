    
      TAK-875 is being developed at Takeda Development Center, Inc. as an adjunct to diet and
      exercise to improve glycemic control in participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
      whose blood glucose level is inadequately controlled with metformin.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of TAK-875 (25 mg and 50 mg) plus metformin compared to
      placebo plus metformin and sitagliptin plus metformin on glycemic control as measured by
      change from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) over a 24-week Treatment Period.
      Participants completing the 24-week Treatment Period may enter an optional 80-week extension
      period for a total of 104 weeks of treatment.

      Due to concerns about potential liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients
      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.

      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for
      fasiglifam.
