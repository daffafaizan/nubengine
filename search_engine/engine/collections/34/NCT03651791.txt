      To evaluate the ability to trace iron oxide-labeled mesenchymal stromal cells with magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) after NOGA-guided injection therapy into the myocardium.

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with iron oxide-labeled mesenchymal stromal
      cells to form new heart muscle cells and blood vessels in the myocardium submitted by
      NOGA-guided injection therapy in the myocardium in order to improve myocardial blood flow and
      reduce patients' symptoms.

      Patient Population:

      Patients with coronary artery disease not treatable with additional bypass surgery or
      percutaneous coronary intervention who have angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society
      (CCS) class II-III) or angina equivalent shortness of breath (New York Heart Association
      (NYHA) class II -III).

      Study Design A prospective, non-randomized, pilot study including 5-10 patients. Patients
      will by means of the percutaneous NOGA injection catheter system receive 12-15
      intramyocardial injections. The number depending on the amount of cultured cells and
      distributed uniformly in the peripheral zone of a presumed ischemic area in the left
      ventricle demonstrated by angiography, magnetic resonance imaging and NOGA mapping.
