      renal failure. obstruction of urine flow increases the intratubular pressure. This pressure
      increase causes decrease in renal blood flow and starts the inflammatory process. In the
      first few hours after total ureter obstruction, due to the increase in intratubular pressure
      glomerular filtration ceases and tubular transport is markedly decreased. Long lasting
      obstruction results in renal fibrosis and end stage renal damage. Basically obstructive
      uropathy leading to irreversible renal damage and loss of renal function is the main
      indication for simple nephrectomy. Serious renal parenchymal damage is defined as
      non-functioning kidney having relative renal function (RRF) 10% or less in the literature.
      But recently in some studies it was suggested that by applying the nephrostomy catheter,
      ability of kidney to regain function can be evaluated before nephrectomy. So, possibility of
      gaining function should be kept in mind. In this study effect of percutaneous nephrostomy
      tube on serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and RRF in obstructed kidney with RRF 10%
      or less. Before and 2 weeks after percutaneous nephrostomy, serum creatinine, ure and RRF in
      DMSA was recorded and compared.
