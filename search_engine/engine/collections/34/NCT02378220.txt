      department (ED) visits will be recorded as well as time to first re-hospitalization and time
      to first ED visit. Select Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) metrics (e.g. M1034,
      M1242, M1710, M1720, M1745, M2110) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 will be evaluated
      and documented at time of admission to home health, at 30 days, and at 60 days for
      improvement in overall status, pain, confusion, anxiety, depression, disruptive behavior, and
      the need for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of
      daily living (IADLs). The number of falls will be collected as well as the proportion of
      YouScriptÂ® recommendations accepted by study pharmacist and passed on to clinicians and the
      proportion of recommendations accepted by clinicians.
