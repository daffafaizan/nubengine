        -  Determine the feasibility of treatment with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil
           followed by chemoradiotherapy and possible surgical salvage in patients with resectable
           locally advanced carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.

        -  Determine the overall and disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the treatment-related toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the tolerance to surgical salvage in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the morbidity and mortality of surgical salvage in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive fluorouracil (5-FU) IV continuously over 96 hours
           beginning on days 1 and 29; cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33; paclitaxel
           IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 29; and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 6 and 34
           OR filgrastim (G-CSF) SC on days 6-15 and 34-42. Treatment continues in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 57-61 and 5-FU IV
           continuously on days 57-61, 64-68, 71-75, 78-82, 85-89, and 92-96. Patients concurrently
           undergo external beam radiotherapy on days 57-61, 64-68, 71-75, 78-82, 85-89, and 92-96.

      Patients with residual or recurrent esophageal disease 4-6 weeks after completion of
      chemoradiotherapy may undergo salvage esophagectomy.

      Patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
