    
      1. Recruit 8 male healthy individuals with no prior history of arterial or venous
           thrombosis (2 each from each of the following age ranges: 20-34, 35-49, 50-64, >65).

        2. Visit 1: Measure baseline activity levels of Factor II, Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor X,
           and levels of D-Dimer, TAT complexes, protein C and S activities. Also measure thrombin
           generation potential. Collaboration with a research laboratory will be sought to also
           determine factor VIIa levels.

        3. Visit 2: Measure activity of Factor II, Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor X, levels of
           D-Dimer, TAT complexes, protein C and S activities and thrombin generation potential at
           the end of the 2 week period.

        4. Have each individual consume 20 mg of Vitamin K2 orally per day for two weeks.

        5. Visit 3: Measure Factor II, Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor X, D-Dimer, TAT complexes,
           protein C and S activities and thrombin generation potential at the end of the 2 week
           period.

        6. Total length of study is 4 weeks.

        7. Analyze the data sets for changes in levels / activities due to Vitamin K
           supplementation.
