      health care resource utilization because of their sheer numbers. Determinants of the length
      of hospitalization in this population are understudied. Gestational age is used most commonly
      as a predictor for length of hospital stay but there are many limitations including
      inaccurate dating and morbidities of prematurity which at least partly related to
      neurophysiological immaturity. The latter can be assessed by amplitude integrated
      electroencephalogram (aEEG, a simplified 5 lead EEG), and possibly by heart rate variability
      (HRV). Both non-invasive tests that can be done at the bedside. The study hypothesis is to
      determine if neurophysiologic maturation as assessed by aEEG and HRV within 24-96 hours
      following birth improves the correlation between gestational age and time to reach milestones
      for safe discharge, such as thermal regulation and oral-motor skills for adequate nutritional
      intake, compared to gestational age alone.
