    
      The purpose of CAPRI study is to confirm the safety and the efficacy of the CE marked MR
      conditional pacing system composed of the ENO, TEO or OTO pacemaker with VEGA pacing lead(s).
      Conditions to undergo an MRI scan are provided in the MRI solutions guideline.

      The primary objective is to confirm the clinical safety of the ENO/TEO/OTO pacing system when
      used under 1.5 and 3 Tesla specific MRI conditions without scan exclusion zone.

      The study secondary main objectives are aiming to assess the performance of the MR
      conditional pacing system in the right atrium and ventricle at 1 month following the MRI
      scan:

        -  Stability of the Pacing Capture Threshold

        -  Stability of the lead sensed amplitude
