      participants will wear PureVision contact lenses for 30 days and use ReNu® Multiplus® for
      contact lens care. Eligible participants will continue into the Investigational Phase (Phase
      2) and be randomly assigned to wear AIR OPTIX® AQUA contact lenses or ACUVUE® OASYS® with
      HYDRACLEAR® contact lenses for a total of two months. For contact lens care, participants
      will use OPTI-FREE® PUREMOIST® MPDS and BIOTRUE® for 30 days each.
