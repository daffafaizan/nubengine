      and 65-85 years. Participants in the older age group will be randomly assigned to receive
      groups (n3-PUFA or placebo (soybean oil)) in a double-blind manner. Before and after the
      intervention, all participants will complete an outpatient study day (body composition, blood
      draw, treadmill test, strength test) and an inpatient study day (muscle biopsies, fat
      biopsies, indirect calorimetry, exercise test, mixed meal test). During the intervention
      phase of the study, participants will be instructed to swallow 2 softgels twice per day with
      meals (morning and evening) for a total of 4 softgels per day. Every 4 weeks, participants
      will report to the Clinical Research and Trials Unit (CRTU) to pick up a new prescription and
      return any remaining capsules from the previous prescription. On the day they pick up
      prescription refills, participants will report to the CRTU for a fasting blood sample. The
      duration of the intervention will be 6 months.
