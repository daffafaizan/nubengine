      mice deficient in enzymes involved in GSL synthesis have severely impaired fertility and
      knockout mice are infertile. Recently, it was demonstrated that administration to mice of an
      inhibitor of ceramide-specific glycosyltransferase, the first step in the biosynthetic
      pathway of GSL formation, resulted in reversible infertility without discernable adverse side
      effects. This inhibitor was Miglustat, which is an alkylated imino sugar. The impact of
      Miglustat therapy on human spermatogenesis is unknown. If the effects on sperm morphology and
      motility are similar to those observed in mice, Miglustat or other GSL inhibitors might have
      potential utility as non-hormonal male contraceptives.
