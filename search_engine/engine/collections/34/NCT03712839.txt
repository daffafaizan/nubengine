      scale of metacognitive knowledge) and the Basic and Instrumental ADL performance based test
      (Awareness ADL), to identify the presence of cognitive deficits and anosognosia in patients
      with ABI always within the context of everyday life activities. One first specific aim is to
      test the convergent validity of the two proposed ecological tools with other traditional and
      validated measures usually used to assess similar cognitive processes and components of
      self-awareness. The second specific objective is to investigate the external validity of the
      ecological tools, by testing whether they are able to discriminate between acquired brain
      damage patients with and without anosognosia and a group of neurologically healthy
      participants on every component.

      After conducting a literature review of the subject we found that this would be the first
      protocol developed to identify all these components in the same study.
