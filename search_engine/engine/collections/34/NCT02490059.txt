    
      The present prospective single-centre randomised pilot study was performed at Tygerberg
      Academic Hospital, a tertiary university hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, with a referral
      drainage area of 1.5 million people and tuberculosis notification rate of up to 1'000/100'000
      persons per year when the study was performed. Between November 2000 and November 2003 all
      patients referred to the lung unit with single pulmonary lesion ≤ 6 cm in diameter on chest
      computed tomography (CT) were included. SPN was defined as a single and circumscribed
      pulmonary lesion with a diameter ≤ 6.0 cm, surrounded by aerated lung tissue, and without
      evidence of atelectasis, pneumonitis, or cavity on CT scan. Location and maximal diameter of
      all SPNs were recorded from the chest CT prior to enrolment of patients. Inclusion criteria
      were a previous cytological and microbiological negative sputum examination, absence of
      enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes on chest CT scan, and informed consent obtained
      before start of the procedure. Exclusion criteria were SPN with lesion size unchanged over
      two years, inability to undergo bronchoscopy or thoracotomy, and pregnancy. Participants with
      consent for participation in the study in whom the lesion was found to be visible on SB were
      then not randomised and not considered part of the study population. Written informed consent
      was obtained from all patients before inclusion in the study.
