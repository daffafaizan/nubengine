      will be conducted in a subgroup of unselected, consecutive patients having completed the part
      I of the Sleep, Awake & Move project (i.e. the "Sleep & Move" study). The investigators plan
      to explore the carry-over effect of REM sleep on motor function in a subgroup of PD subjects
      p. In this interventional study the investigators expect to induce SB by awakening the
      subjects from nocturnal REM sleep in a sleep laboratory setting, but not from Non-Rapid Eye
      Movements (NREM) sleep (control intervention).
