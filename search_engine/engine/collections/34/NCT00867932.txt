      pediatric and adolescent participants aged 2 to 17 years with PNH. There were 3 periods in
      this study (screening, treatment, and post-treatment) with the treatment period having 2
      dosing phases (induction and maintenance). If all screening criteria were met, the
      participant was eligible to enter the treatment period of the study after receiving Neisseria
      meningitidis (N. men), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumo), and Haemophilus influenzae (H.
      influ) vaccinations at least 14 days prior to first dose of study drug, or was vaccinated and
      received treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 14 days after the vaccinations.
      Participants received eculizumab intravenously (IV) based on their weight. Eculizumab was
      administered via an IV infusion at a rate of 5 to 10 milliliters (mL) per kilogram (kg) per
      hour (hr) (mL/kg/hr) for at least 25 minutes. The planned duration of treatment was 12 weeks
      with a 4-week induction phase and an 8-week maintenance phase. At the Investigator's and
      parents/legal guardian's discretion, participants who completed this study with eculizumab
      could continue treatment with commercially available eculizumab (Soliris®) and were followed
      in the Soliris® PNH Registry. Participants who stopped study participation before study
      completion or who did not continue with Soliris® treatment at the completion of the study
      were followed for 8 weeks and monitored for signs and symptoms of serious hemolysis.
