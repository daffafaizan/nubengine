      the acidic products formed as result of carbohydrates fermentation by bacteria due to
      disturbance in equilibrium between tooth minerals and plaque products through time. (Trindade
      et al., 2014) It's a worldwide disease affecting all ages both sexes with different
      socioeconomic levels. Dental caries commonly affects children and adversely affects their
      quality of life and so their weight and growth if left untreated (Gokhale and Nuvvula, 2015).
      The environmental factor is a very valuable factor affecting dental caries especially the
      mother and the family as whole, the family habits are directly influencing their children
      (Suma G and Anisha P, 2017). As parents are the primary decision makers for children and
      their first role models, their oral health knowledge, attitude and practice as well as habits
      influence their children (Dikshit et al., 2018).

      There is lack of data about parent's oral health knowledge, attitude and practice and their
      implications on their children in Egypt.

      Acquiring information about oral health knowledge of parents, will help identifying those
      children who are at risk of dental caries consequently it will be possible to offer the
      proper preventive and curative measures for them.

      So, we need to know the effect of oral health knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of
      parents on caries prevalence of their children.
