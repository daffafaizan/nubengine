      academic performance and behavior in children with ADHD when compared to placebo as
      demonstrated using specified study measures. This is a double-blind (neither participant nor
      investigator knows the name of the assigned study drug), randomized (study drug assigned by
      chance), placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the academic, behavioral and
      cognitive effects of CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) on older children with ADHD This means
      that all eligible children will receive treatment with methylphenidate HCl throughout the
      study (the titration and assessment periods) and inactive pill (placebo) on 1 of the 2
      laboratory classroom days. On the other laboratory classroom day they will receive their
      regular dose of CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl). The primary efficacy variable in this study
      is the Permanent Product Math Test (PERMP) attempted score. Secondary Measures include: SKAMP
      (Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham), tests of inattention, reading fluency and
      comprehension, and memory. Assessments will be completed during each of the laboratory
      assessment days (12.5 hours). Participants will be assessed for adverse events throughout the
      study. Patients will initiate treatment with oral CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) 18 mg at
      baseline and continue morning dosing with increases every 3 to 7 days until an optimal dose
      is achieved, up to the maximum of 54 mg/day. Eligible patients will remain in the study for a
      maximum of 8 weeks.
