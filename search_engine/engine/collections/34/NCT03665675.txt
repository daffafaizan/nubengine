      antigen stimulation/interferon gamma capture system (Miltenyi Biotec, CliniMACS Prodigy
      System) generated CMV specific- CTLs from haploidentical donors in transplant patients both
      solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with CMV
      infection despite standard therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive allogeneic cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes
      intravenously (IV). Participants with partial response, may receive up to 2 additional doses
      at monthly intervals.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 1 year.
