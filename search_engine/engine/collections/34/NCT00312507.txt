      with meconium aspiration syndrome occuring in approximately 5% of these infants. In this
      disease process, meconium is believed to mechanically obstruct the airways, causing a
      chemical pneumonitis and inactivate surfactant. Approximately one-third of these babies need
      mechanical ventilation and approximately 5% die. Since 1990 surfactant has been the standard
      of care for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. Pulmonary compliance and gas exchange
      often improve rapidly after administration of surfactant. Its use has led to significantly
      reduced mortality rates and improved short-term respiratory function. There is evidence to
      support its use in other neonatal respiratory disorders where there is dysfunction or
      inactivation of surfactant. Its use in meconium aspiration syndrome is the most well-studied
      alternate use to date. The Canadian Pediatric Society's (2005) position statement recommends
      that infants with meconium aspiration syndrome who are intubated and require more than 50%
      oxygen should receive exogenous surfactant therapy.

      Studies in both animals and humans suggest that surfactant helps in meconium aspiration,
      either administered as a bolus or as a lavage. There have been no trials to date comparing
      the efficacy of surfactant lavage to bolus surfactant in human neonates with meconium
      aspiration or examining the physiologic effects of surfactant, given as either a bolus or
      lavage, in the treatment of meconium aspiration syndrome. This study will assess the relative
      efficacy of these two methods of administering surfactant and their effect on physiologic and
      clinical outcomes.
