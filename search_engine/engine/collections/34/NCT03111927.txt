      The mother will be asked to complete self-report questionnaires and to undergo a brief
      cognitive assessment. If the mother is not breastfeeding, a study product will be provided
      and will be consumed by the infant daily up to 12 months of life. The study also involves
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans of the infant's brain while asleep as well as
      evaluation of cognitive outcomes, including general cognitive development, and
      social-emotional development.
