      contributors to under-five mortality in Nigeria. To reduce the burden of these diseases, the
      Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines were developed by the World
      Health Organisation (WHO) to be used at first point of contact (e.g., primary healthcare
      centres) with children under the age of five years old. Preliminary literature review
      suggests that although interventions based on numerous diagnostic approaches have been
      trialed, burden from malaria and pneumonia remains unacceptably high in Nigeria, suggesting
      limited effectiveness of existing approaches. Therefore, this study aims to compare the
      accuracy of different early diagnostic approaches used in the community(for e.g. the WHO
      Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines versus the gold standard
      diagnostic tests comprising microscopy in malaria and chest radiography in pneumonia) in
      children under the age of five years presenting with suspected malaria and pneumonia to
      primary healthcare centres in Benin City, Edo State of Nigeria.

      The research will compare the accuracy of these various diagnostic approaches using measures
      such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The research will also assess patient
      outcomes like complications, hospitalisation and death following a diagnosis of either
      pneumonia or malaria in all study participants as well as costs associated with malaria and
      pneumonia.
