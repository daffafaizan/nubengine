    
      To investigate the pharmacokinetics of one of the garlic oil macerate, Ajoene, the
      anti-inflammatory effect of garlic oil macerate on the pro-inflammatory transcription factor
      NF-kB, it's activating proteins, including IkB, IkB Kinases a and B (IKKa and IKKB) and the
      pro-inflammatory NF-kB-regulated proteins, c-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-a), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular
      cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), plasminogen activated
      protein-1 (PAI-1)and the effect of garlic oil macerate intake on platelet activation in
      normal subjects.
