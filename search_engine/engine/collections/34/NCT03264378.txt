      for scaling up sustainable, evidence-based mental health interventions with research
      capacity-building activities for East Asia. Specific scale-up study aims include: Aim 1:
      Assessing readiness for implementing the evidence-based physical exercise intervention for
      improving mental health of older adults in participating provinces of Thailand; Aim 2:
      Developing the GTO-ThAI implementation support model through a pre-implementation case study
      and formative evaluation; and Aim 3: Evaluation of implementation strategies and clinical
      outcomes through a hybrid Type 3 randomized trial to test an evidence-based implementation
      support strategy (i.e., the GTO-ThAI model) that emphasizes a systematic process to address
      implementation barriers to the delivery of the evidence-based physical exercise intervention
      (PEI), compared with the existing standard administrative procedures for delivering the same
      PEI.
