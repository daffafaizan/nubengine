      trial. Typical symptoms like pain or tenseness of the masticatory muscles, headache or
      abrasions are mandatory preconditions. Exclusion criteria are a present treatment with a
      biteguard or a sufficient canine guidance.

      In the first session a detailed history, a dental status and a clinical functional status are
      recorded. The baseline situation is documented by taking impressions with alginate of the
      maxilla and mandible for diagnostic study models. Following this procedure a first
      measurement of the muscular activity is conducted for seven days with the Grindcare device.

      After four weeks without any intervention a second measurement is conducted again for seven
      days.

      In the next session the canine cusps are restored with composite fillings. Finally a
      sufficient canine guidance should be present. In the same session a second impression of the
      maxilla is taken. A third measurement is conducted, again followed by four weeks without any
      intervention.

      At last another impression of the maxilla is obtained and a final measurement for seven days
      is conducted.

      At the first examination and after the third measurement of the masticatory muscle activity
      the patients fill out the questionnaire of the Oral Health Impact Profile in order to allow
      for the assessment of possible functional restraints and mental interferences.
