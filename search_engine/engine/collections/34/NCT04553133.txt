    
      Study C4161001 is a Phase 1, open label, multi dose, multi center, dose escalation, safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic study of PF-07104091 in adult patients with advanced
      or metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC), advanced platinum resistant epithelial ovarian
      cancer/fallopian tube cancer/primary peritoneal cancer, locally recurrent/advanced or
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), HR-positive HER2-negative advanced or mBC,
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This two part study will assess
      the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of PF-07104091 in Part 1, and establish
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Part 2.
