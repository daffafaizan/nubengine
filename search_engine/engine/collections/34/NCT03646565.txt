      Gy√∂rgy Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest. The participants will be selected from
      patients who underwent open-chest cardiac surgery, under the age of four, between 2003- 2007
      and once followed up in 2013-2014.

      Psychosocial measures will be as follows: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S/T), KidScreen questionnaire, PRISM-D and person/organ
      test.

      A range of perioperative and psychosocial factors will be assessed as potential determinants
      of outcome. The data will be fully retrieved from the registries of our hospital center.
      Characteristics registered included pre-, intra- and postoperative variables such as age,
      gender, comorbidities (renal, hepatic, infectious, neurological, metabolic, hormonal or
      genetic disorders), type of surgery, laboratory parameters, operation time, cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB) time, aortic cross-clamp time, Risk Assessment for Congenital Heart Surgery
      (RACHS) points, length of mechanical ventilation, blood loss, transfusions, fluid balance,
      need for inotropic support or pulmonary vasodilatation, medications, anaesthetic and
      analgesic agents.

      By comparing the above mentioned perioperative data with the result of the psychological
      measures we expect to answer our hypothesis.
