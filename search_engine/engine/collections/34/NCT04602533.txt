    
      The trial is subdivided in a safety run-in phase and a randomized part with the induction
      phase (Radiochemotherapy ± Durvalumab and including prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI; if
      clinically indicated and according to local standard)) followed by the maintenance phase. The
      trial starts with the safety run-in phase of 6 patients in Durvalumab group. After the
      completion of the first cycle of all 6 patients a safety interim analysis will be performed.
      Study should be discontinued if ≥ 2 out of 6 patients within safety run-in phase (first
      cycle):

        -  show more than 2 AEs CTCAE grade ≥3 related to study drug Durvalumab

        -  or develop pneumonitis (CTCAE grade ≥2)

        -  or drop out, Otherwise, the trial can continue with randomization. Eligible patients
           will be randomized to Durvalumab group or standard of care group 2:1.

      Induction phase:

      Durvalumab group: Cisplatin (75 mg/m² (BSA) D1) and Etoposide (100 mg/m² (BSA) D1-3) once
      every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles and concomitant Radiotherapy (60±6 Gy, 2 Gy/d) and additional
      Durvalumab (1500 mg once every 3 weeks) for 4-6 cycles according to randomization followed by
      prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI, if clinically indicated and according to local
      standard)) Control group: Cisplatin (75 mg/m² (BSA) D1) and Etoposide (100 mg/m² (BSA) D1-3)
      once every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles and concomitant Radiotherapy (60±6 Gy, 2 Gy/d) followed by
      prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI, if clinically indicated and according to local
      standard)

      Maintenance phase:

      In Durvalumab group patients will be treated with Durvalumab once every 4 weeks until disease
      progression (radiologic or clinical progression) or unacceptable toxicities, if patients show
      at least stable disease after induction phase. Patients with PD after induction phase will
      have EoT visit and will be followed up until death.

      Patients in control group will have EoT visit and will receive standard of care treatment
      until PD and thereafter will be followed up until death.
