      Minimally invasive gastrectomy is accepted widely in Asian countries. Laparoscopic-assisted
      gastrectomy offers improved early postoperative outcomes and improved long-term oncologic
      outcomes,but it still has its own limitations.The advantages of robotic surgery include a 3D
      imagine, convenient movements of the robotic arm, no tremor, and ambidextrous capability.

      This study therefore aimed to compare the clinical results between robotic-assisted
      gastrectomy(RAG) using the da Vinci Surgical System and conventional laparoscopic-assisted
      gastrectomy(LAG) in gastric cancer patients.To evaluate the the feasibility and safety of
      robotic gastrectomy and explore the patients who are more suitable for robotic gastrectomy.
