      antipsychotic medication, to ongoing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
      antidepressant treatment for depressed outpatients who are not responding fully to SSRI
      treatment alone. Fifteen subjects will be given aripiprazole in a flexible dosing schedule
      and followed for 12 weeks, while continuing their ongoing SSRI medication. Assessments of
      depressive symptoms, overall functioning, social functioning, and side effects will be
      completed. It is hypothesized that patients' functioning will improve after 12 weeks of
      treatment with Aripiprazole and SSRI medication.
