      of hospital stay (LOS) for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      Primary endpoint: time from end of surgery until the patient meets the discharge criteria.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Will general anesthesia produce less post operative pain?

        2. Is there any difference in post operative orthostatic function (dizziness) between the
           groups?

        3. Time until the patient meets the discharge criteria from PACU

        4. How many patients will need at least one urinary bladder catheterization?
