      to an educational control group. H1: The dance group will show cognitive improvements in a
      domain-specific fashion such that executive and memory functions will be enhanced more than
      other cognitive domains; Aim 2. Examine whether African Dance influences brain morphology,
      task-evoked neural responses, cerebral blood flow, and resting state connectivity. H1: It is
      predicted that African Dance will increase volume, white matter integrity, perfusion, and
      functional activation/connectivity in a regionally-specific fashion such that prefrontal and
      hippocampal areas will be more sensitive to the intervention than other brain regions. Aim 3.
      Explore potential physiological and socio-emotional mechanisms of the dance intervention. The
      investigators will collect measures of physical and psychosocial health such as waist
      circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, mood, anxiety, depression, and
      loneliness and examine whether intervention-related changes to these measures mediate
      improvements in cognitive performance.
