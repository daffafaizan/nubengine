    
      Objectives:

        1. To determine if the amount of time spent performing moderate to vigorous physical
           activity (MVPA) and the number of bouts of MVPA engaged in on a weekly basis differs by
           the level of disease severity in the pediatric hemophilia population.

        2. To determine if recorded physical activities and intensity of activities from
           self-report questionnaires (PedHAL and 3 day physical activity recall - 3DPAR) differ
           according to the severity of hemophilia.

        3. To determine if, among patients with hemophilia, there is a relationship between
           physical activity level and patient age, weight, and body mass index (BMI).

      Specific Aims:

      â€¢Aim # 1: The primary aim of the study is to determine if there are differences in the amount
      of time spent in MVPA by level of disease severity of children with hemophilia.

      Secondary Aims:

        -  Aim # 2: To determine if there are meaningful differences in the accumulation of MVPA
           (bouts of exercise) by disease severity of children with hemophilia.

        -  Aim # 3: The compare the findings from Aim #1 and #2 to the NHANES (National Health and
           Nutrition Examination Survey) data, recognizing that this survey provides a comparative
           healthy normal cohort.

        -  Aim # 4: To investigate MVPA with these data collected from the PedHAL (11) and the
           3DPAR (12) by disease severity of children with hemophilia.

        -  Aim # 5: The review and determine the relationship between physical activity
           participation and timing of prophylaxis factor replacement and whether participation is
           limited to days of factor infusion.

        -  Aim #6: To investigate the amount of physical activity and how it relates to age,
           weight, and patient body mass index (BMI).
