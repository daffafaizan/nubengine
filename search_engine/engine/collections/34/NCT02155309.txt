    
      Part 1: The pharmacokinetic (PK) phase Objective: To determine the bioavailability and amount
      of scopolamine absorbed after administration of 0.2 mg intranasal scopolamine at regular
      intervals across 8 hours post- dose.

      Hypothesis: Detectable levels of Intranasal scopolamine (INSCOP) will be present in subject
      plasma within 15 minutes post-dose; mean time to Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) will be
      less than 1.5 hr.

      Part 2: The Efficacy phase Objective: To determine the effectiveness, cognitive performance
      effects, and medication side-effect profile of 0.2 mg intranasal scopolamine spray as a
      motion sickness (MS) countermeasure.

      Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that the INSCOP spray will be more efficacious against
      MS than placebo, without statistically significant cognitive performance side-effects.
      Specifically, participants will tolerate significantly more provocative head tilts in the
      INSCOP condition than in the placebo condition.
