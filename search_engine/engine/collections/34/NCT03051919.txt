      methods (suturing, absorbable buttressing material and fibrin glue) in laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy.

      The resected stomach specimens were treated in the same manner of reinforcement as used in
      the surgeries of the corresponding patients and then insufflated until a burst occurred. The
      burst pressures of the resected stomach specimens and postoperative events of the patients
      were recorded.
