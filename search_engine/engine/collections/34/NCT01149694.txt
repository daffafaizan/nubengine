      pre-dose and within 9 +/- 1 hours post-dosing to visually examine the colonic mucosa for any
      signs of local toxicity and grade it as normal/abnormal; and 3 pinch biopsies will be
      obtained at each endoscopy at about the same level in the colon (<50 cm from the anal verge)
      for histology. At the baseline flexible sigmoidoscopy, subjects must have normal colonic and
      rectal mucosa (i.e., no bleeding, inflammation, edema, ulceration or other abnormal finding)
      to be included in the study.
