      therapy, but low dose edoxaban (30mg) will be non-inferior to standard dose edoxaban (60mg)
      for reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients who underwent successful AF
      ablation. Although AF ablation is an effective therapy for reducing and/or eliminating the
      burden of AF, there may continue to be a risk of late recurrence or asymptomatic recurrence
      of atrial tachyarrhythmias. Until now, the guideline has recommended the continuation of OAC
      in patients who are at risk of stroke or systemic embolism based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score,
      even though they have maintained sinus rhythm. The annual rate of stroke, however, is still
      lower compared to that predicted by the scoring system, because AF ablation reduced the AF
      burden by 86% and the remaining episodes were significantly shorter in duration (median 6
      minutes) than those pre-ablation reported by the previous study. Based on recent studies
      which demonstrated that both standard-dose and low-dose non-vitamin K OACs (NOAC) performed
      equally well with regard to the stroke prevention in patients with AF, low dose NOACs may
      also be sufficient for stroke prevention of briefly lasting AF episodes after successful AF
      ablation.
