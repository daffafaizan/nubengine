      falciparum clearance kinetics in healthy subjects using the Induced Blood Stage Malaria
      (IBSM) challenge model to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of MMV390048 for P.
      falciparum (Part B). An approximation of this concentration in healthy subjects will help to
      identify the optimal dose of MMV390048 for subsequent Phase 2 studies in patients. The
      challenge model will enable characterization of the exposure-response relationship for
      MMV390048 and will also provide data regarding the safety and tolerability of MMV390048 in a
      controlled disease-like setting.
