      recommended as an initial treatment. It aims at destroying the lining of the womb to reduce
      heavy menstrual loss.

      A hormone releasing device in the womb (MIRENA®)is another commonly used treatment for women
      with heavy menstrual bleeding and has added benefit of reducing cyclical pain.

      There is an increase in the number of women presenting to gynaecology clinic with persistence
      of pain or cyclical pain with absent or light bleeding after second generation endometrial
      ablation (Novasure). This may be due to the pockets of active lining of the womb that remains
      after ablation or possible adhesions created by the treatment. Most women require surgical
      removal of the womb (hysterectomy) because of pain or a further surgical procedure to divide
      these adhesions in an attempt to relieve pain and drain any collections in the womb.

      We aim to determine if the combined use of MIRENA® and NOVASURE® (which is the second
      generation endometrial ablation technique used in our unit) will help in reducing the number
      of women presenting with cyclical pain and requiring further intervention or surgery. The aim
      of the current study is to compare between women receiving only NOVASURE treatment and women
      receiving combined NOVASURE and MIRENA treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. The primary
      and secondary outcomes will be assessed at 6 and 12 months by a patient questionnaire. The
      primary outcome is improvement in quality of life The secondary outcomes include

        -  Lowering of surgical intervention

        -  Reduction in pain

        -  Reduction in amount of bleeding This will be a pilot study to determine if the theory is
           correct and then a larger powered study can be undertaken
