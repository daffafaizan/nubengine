      ambulatory care setting. Each participant will be followed for 12 months.

      Twenty eligible patients will be enrolled, and within eight weeks of diagnosis. Patients will
      meet with a member of the outpatient PC team, which consists of board-certified PC
      physicians, advance practice providers and nurse care coordinators, within three weeks of
      enrollment. Additional visits may be scheduled at the discretion of participants, oncologists
      or PC providers and participants will receive routine oncologic care throughout the study
      period.

      The primary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the effects of early PC
      involvement in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic MM

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess self-reported QOL, estimate the change
      in QOL relative to baseline, estimate number of participants with self-reported symptoms of
      depression and anxiety, to determine if monthly PC visits are feasible for participants, and
      to estimate health services utilization.
