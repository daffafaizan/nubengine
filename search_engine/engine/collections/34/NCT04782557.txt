      technologies for ctDNA analysis have presented an attractive opportunity for minimally
      invasive "liquid biopsy" genomic diagnostics. The investigators plan to perform EUS-guided
      portal vein and hepatic vein aspiration in GI cancers patients. The aim of the current study
      is thus to examine the concentration of ctDNA in portal vein (EUS-guided PVA), hepatic vein
      (EUS-guided HVA) and peripheral blood to understand the first pass effect of the liver with
      gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and the possibility of using ctDNA as a marker for
      preoperative staging, restaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and monitoring for
      recurrence.
