    
      BIOD-531 is a formulation of recombinant human insulin with a biphasic absorption profile
      characterized by rapid absorption (to prevent meal-time rises in blood glucose) and a
      secondary longer (basal) phase. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate glucose control and
      safety of BIOD-531 compared to a pre-mixed insulin which is commonly used to provide both
      meal-time and long acting insulin.
