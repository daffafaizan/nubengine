      patients.

      Previous study indicated high mutation/deletion rate of PTEN gene in intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma and poor prognosis of those patients with PTEN mutation/deletion. The
      investigators also found that the activity of proteasomes elevated in cholangiocarcinoma
      cells with PTEN mutation/deletion.

      So the investigators suppose proteasomes inhibitor could improve prognosis of intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma patients with PTEN mutation/deletion
