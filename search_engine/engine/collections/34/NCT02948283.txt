    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, tolerability and feasibility of administering metformin
      hydrochloride (metformin)/ritonavir combination therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the clinical activity of this two-drug combination by assessing disease
      response, response duration, and (in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma [RRMM]) clinical
      benefit response.

      II. To assess the progression-free survival, overall survival and compliance of all patients
      who start the two-drug combination.

      III. To evaluate potential changes in health-related quality of life, as assessed by the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Multiple Myeloma (FACT-MM) and Leukemia
      (FACT-Leu).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of metformin and ritonavir when given in
      combination.

      II. In relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RRCLL), to describe changes in pAKT,
      pAMPK, and MCL-1, in circulating lymphocytes in response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      SINGLE AGENT STAGE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on
      days 1-7 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COMBINATION REGIMEN STAGE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride PO BID and ritonavir PO
      BID on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 28
      days.
