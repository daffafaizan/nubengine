      discomfort usually caused by bladder spasms. The onset of action of the suppository is 30-60
      minutes. Bladder spasms are more likely to occur following uteroscopy procedures. The spasms
      result in a felt desire to void, even when there is no urine in the bladder. The spasms can
      produce pain or a sense of severe urgency.

      By administering a belladonna and opium suppository at the beginning of surgery, it is hoped
      that there will be a decrease in the incidence of bladder spasms, increased comfort and less
      need for additional medications.
