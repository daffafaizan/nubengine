    
      The study will consist of two phases. Phase I of the study will enroll 6 healthy volunteers,
      who have no indication for remote cardiac monitoring. Subjects are required to participate in
      the study for 30 days.

      Phase II of the study will enroll up to 44 patients indicated for outpatient cardiac
      monitoring and will participate in the study for up to 90 days.

      All subjects will wear the device in two locations, one along the left midaxillary line and
      the other along the left midclavicular line for the first seven days.

      Thereafter, for the remainder of the study, half the enrolled subjects will only wear the
      device in the left midclavicular position and the other half will wear the device in the left
      midaxillary position. Subjects will use a diary to keep a daily log their activities of daily
      living (phase I) or a log of any symptoms related to heart rhythm abnormalities and heart
      failure (phase II).

      Data will be acquired with the ÂµCor system and wirelessly transmitted daily to a remote
      server for processing, generating thoracic fluid content, ECG, heart rate, respiration rate,
      activity, and posture measurements. Investigators will have access only to ECG data.

      Study staff will make weekly phone calls to subjects and record any new clinically actionable
      events. Patients will have monthly office visits. At the end of 30 days (phase I) or 90 days
      (phase II), patients will end wear and will complete the study follow-up questionnaire.

      The study will enroll a maximum of 50 subjects. Six healthy volunteers will be enrolled for
      phase I of the study. Remaining 44 subjects will be enrolled for phase II and will have an
      indication of outpatient cardiac monitoring.
