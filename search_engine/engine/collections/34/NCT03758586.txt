      training techniques are essential for enhanced performance. Optimal performance during a
      surgical task is key to successful surgery and minimal adverse events.

      Objective: To introduce and examine a single session of spatial skill training as an
      efficient means of improving surgical suturing performance in robot-assisted surgery.

      Design: Forty-one surgical residents will be randomly assigned to training and control
      conditions. (1) participants will perform two da-Vinci skills simulator (dVSS) tasks to
      determine baseline performance. (2) the training group will undergo computer-based simulator
      training of spatial skills while the control group will engage in a neutral activity. (3) two
      dVSS tasks will be performed within 2 days of training completion to evaluate post-training
      performance. The experiment will be conducted until December 2018.

      Participants: A convenience sample comprised of 41 surgical residents with non-robotic
      surgical suturing skills.
