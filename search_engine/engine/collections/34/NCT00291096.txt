    
      1. To correlate established risk biomarkers such as cytomorphology obtained from random
           periareolar fine needle aspiration ( RPFNA), mammographic breast density, serum
           bioavailable estradiol and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 with each other and with 5-10 year Gail risk
           estimates. Where available, and with appropriate safe guards to maintain status for
           breast cancer susceptibility genes may be included.

        2. To determine the relative predictive value of established risk biomarkers for the
           development of DCIS and/or invasive cancer.

        3. To evaluate potential new breast tissue-based biomarkers including Ki-67, PCNA, ER,
           COX-2, aromatase, methylation of key tumor suppressor genes (i.e., RAR, p16, etc),
           proteomic patterns in RPFNA and nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), as well as NAF hormone
           levels, and correlate them with other risk biomarkers listed in 1.

        4. To determine the prevalence of polymorphisms of a panel of genes important in hormone
           and xenobiotic metabolism as well as DNA repair and correlate these polymorphisms with
           established risk biomarkers listed in 1, as well as with development of DCIS and
           invasive cancer.

        5. To maintain contact with this initially identified cohort of high risk women, acquire
           demographic data, biologic specimens and data and follow them prospectively for the
           development.
