      National HIV Treatment Program. The Malian National HIV Treatment Program uses fixe dose
      coninaison (FDC) therapy, and this study will use a historical comparison from an African
      country in which the same generic antiretoviral are used. Virologic responses of patients
      enrolled in the Malian national program will be determined and, in a non-inferiority design,
      compared to these historical controls. The study will also establish the feasibility of doing
      frequent HIV virologic monitoring in this setting.

      Viral RNA and CD4 T-cell count monitoring will be performed for HIV-infected persons seen at
      study sites. All clinical decision-making and prescription will occur outside of the
      protocol. Decisions about whether antiretroviral therapy is appropriate, the prescription of
      antiretroviral therapy, and the monitoring of treatment will be done by Malian health-care
      providers outside of the scope of the protocol. Viral RNA monitoring will be used to assess
      the endpoint of viral RNA suppression below the limit of detection (50 copies/mL).
