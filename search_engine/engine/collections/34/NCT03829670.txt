      prevalence increases as patients get older and sicker. There is scientific evidence that
      delirium affects cognitive function for a prolonged period of time and in many cases
      irreversibly. The economic burden on health care and emotional burden on the caregivers of
      patients with delirium is tremendous. We think that our study may contribute to developing
      prevention strategies for delirium in the hospital. We propose genetic testing of older
      patients to determine their ability to metabolize commonly used medications in the hospital.
      This will give medical professionals and pharmacists an ability to adjust dosages of
      medications based on the patient's genetic profile.
