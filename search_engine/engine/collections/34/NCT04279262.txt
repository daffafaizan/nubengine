        1. Analyse records from six ambulance services to see: how many people CFRs attended; the
           proportion of ambulance calls attended; age, sex and conditions of people attended; how
           quickly CFRs attended and what happened to the patient(s) when the ambulance arrived.

        2. Evaluate benefits and costs of CFRs attending rural emergencies.

        3. Interview patients/relatives, ambulance staff, GPs, funders, CFRs and CFR leads to
           obtain views on rural CFR current and potential future roles. Interviews will also
           explore with CFRs and CFR leads, challenges and solutions to recruiting, training,
           retaining rural CFRs and ensuring safe, high quality care.

        4. Combine this knowledge (gained in steps1-3 above) to develop recommendations for change;
           who will be involved and how services should change to solve the most pressing problems
           for the rural communities served.

        5. Present recommendations to a workshop of experts and public to agree priorities for
           future development.
