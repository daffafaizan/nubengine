      addition to local antitumor effects, and currently no biomarkers are used for the prediction
      of the abscopal effect of radiotherapy in standard clinical practice. Our recent preclinical
      studies identified ICAM-1 as a potential predictive biomarker for the radiotherapy-induced
      abscopal effect. In this clinical trial, we aim to investigate whether the ICAM-1-targeting
      radiotracer 68Ga-ICAM-1pep could be used for PET imaging of tumor responses to radiotherapy
      in cancer patients. PET/CT imaging of 68Ga-ICAM-1pep will be performed in patients before and
      after radiotherapy.
