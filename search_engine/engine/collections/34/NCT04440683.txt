      disease progression to cancer, but only reduce the probability of some ER and PR positive
      tumors, which has no preventive effect on triple negative breast cancer and HER-2 positive
      breast cancer. In the first hospital of Jilin University, the preparations containing antler
      ingredients have been clinically proven to be able to treat breast hyperplasia, which has
      been proved to be able to prevent breast cancer in basic research, and antler ingredients
      have been proved to be non-toxic and side effects in the treatment dose. This study aims to
      prove whether antler disk extract can be put into clinical practice to prevent breast
      precancerous lesions from developing into cancer.
