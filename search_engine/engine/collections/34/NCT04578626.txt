      is to assess temporomandibular joint and three perimandibular muscles (temporal, masseter,
      sternocleidomastoid) by means of rehabilitative ultrasound imaging, carried out by a novice
      clinician. These evaluations are performed before and after a dry needling treatment directed
      to the tree studied muscles of one side of the face. The side to be treated is randomly
      assigned by using a computer-generated randomization process, the other side is used as
      control.

      One month after the treatment sonographic images are taken by the novice clinician and by an
      expert one. The aim is to assess the reliability of ultrasonography comparing the results of
      their assessments.
