      resection and functional protection for lower rectal cancer, which have been regarded as
      challenging situations in rectal cancer surgery. However, the narrow angle and limited space
      of the operation restrict the wide spread of this technique. Da Vinci robotic system has
      achieved good results in rectal cancer surgery. Robotics may help to overcome technical
      difficulties in TaTME. The purpose of this study was to explore the availability of Da Vinci
      robotic-assisted transanal total mesorectal excision(R-TaTME) This study investigates the
      feasibility, practicability, safety and subjective as well as functional outcome of Robotic
      transanal total mesentery excision for rectal cancer in low site.
