      parallel-groups design to assess the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist delivered
      intranasally for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary teeth numbers 4 to 13 (maxillary
      right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar) sufficient to allow completion of
      the Study Dental Procedure.

      A total of 140 subjects, randomized 2:2:1 (Kovacaine Mist:Tetracaine alone:Placebo) will be
      enrolled to achieve 125 completed subjects; a total of 50 Kovacaine Mist subjects, 50
      tetracaine alone subjects and 25 placebo subjects. Recruitment will be from diverse dental
      patient populations. At the two study sites, a balanced enrollment of 70 subjects each is
      planned to allow for a potential 10% drop-out rate.
