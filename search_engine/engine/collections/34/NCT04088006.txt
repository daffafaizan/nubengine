    
      This is a prospective, single center, randomized, intra-individual study with blinded
      evaluators assessing the efficacy and safety of STYLAGE® HydroMax on skin moisturization and
      elasticity on the cheek and neckline area. Forty seven female subjects will be enrolled and
      will receive 3 injections of product one month apart on the cheek and neckline area in a
      randomized fashion with the contralateral non-treated cheek and neckline area. Injection will
      be performed into the mid to deep dermis of the cheek and neckline area (1 mL per session and
      per area) by micro-papular injection technique. Subjects will be followed up at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
      and 9 months timepoints. Variation of moisturization, elasticity and roughness of treated
      areas in comparison with non-treated areas will be measured using Corneometer®, Cutometer®,
      Dermatop® or Primos Lite® respectively. Global aesthetic improvement, subject satisfaction,
      pain at injection and safety will also be assessed.
