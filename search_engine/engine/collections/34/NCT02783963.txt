      disease remains unknown. The SOFT-MI study has been designed as a single-center, prospective
      observational trial to investigate the prevalence of vulnerable and disrupted plaques in
      patients with acute MI but without any significant coronary stenosis (defined as stenosis of
      >50%) at coronary angiography. All patients will undergo coronary OCT immediately after
      coronary angiography. In addition, CMR will be performed within 1 week of coronary
      angiography to evaluate associated myocardial abnormalities as well as extracardiac findings.
      The study will provide insight into the mechanism of MI without obstructive coronary artery
      disease at coronary angiography, and may be useful in order to establish an appropriate
      therapeutic strategy for the secondary prevention of ischemic events.
