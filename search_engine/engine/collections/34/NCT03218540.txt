    
      Objective: To compare postoperative clinical outcome in adult patient undergoing EVAR.

      Primary outcome: Postoperative serum lactate and creatinine.

      Secondary outcome: Postoperative complications.

      Methods: Eligible patients will be randomized to 2 groups. Both groups will be managed
      intraoperatively in the same way, except fluid management protocol. SVV group will be managed
      according to stroke volume variation (SVV) protocol, i.e., control SVV 10-13% and give fluid
      when SVV > 13%. CVP group will be managed using central venous pressure (CVP) protocol, i.e.,
      control CVP 8-12 mmHg and give fluid when CVP < 8 mmHg.

      Outcome analyses: Postoperative serum lactate and creatinine of both groups will be compared
      using unpaired Student-t test. Secondary outcomes will be compared using chi-square test.
