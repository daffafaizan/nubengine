      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with
      hepatocellular cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the
      PBMCs of the hepatocellular cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate
      ALDHhigh and ALDHlow tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the hepatocellular cancer patient
      using a similar protocol as investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-hepatocellular cancer CSC
      immunity induced by hepatocellular cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of hepatocellular cancer CSCs by
      antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with hepatocellular cancer
      CSC-DC.
