      elderly subjects during pharmacologic vasodilation of the lower limb vasculature in
      combination with increased amino acids delivery. We obtained femoral arteriovenous blood
      samples and v. lateralis muscle biopsies during a primed continuous infusion of L-[ring-13C6]
      Phenylalanine. Muscle protein kinetics were measured in the basal state and during a 180 min
      infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and amino acids (Premsol 10%) (SNP+AA). Skeletal
      muscle microvascular recruitment and flow were measured during the basal state and SNP+AA
      using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU).
