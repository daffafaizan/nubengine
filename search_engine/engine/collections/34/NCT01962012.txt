      that the rate of tooth movement may be affected by variables such as age, sex, as well as
      alveolar bone levels, tooth root length and alveolar bone quality. The purpose of this study
      is to examine the amount of tooth movement achieved over time between subjects undergoing
      aligner treatment using a pulsation device known as AcceleDent® Aura with those not using the
      device.

      A preliminary validation pilot study will be done to calibrate all staff on study procedures.
      The pilot will consist of 3 subjects using the active AcceleDent® Aura device and 3 using the
      sham control AcceleDent® Aura device for 4 weeks. Study staff will be calibrated for all
      study procedures.

      The primary study will be a prospective, single-center, randomized crossover clinical trial
      comparing two groups of subjects with 40 participants. Subjects will be randomized to groups
      that will receive aligner treatment while using either an active AcceleDent® Aura device or a
      sham control AcceleDent® Aura device for the first 6 weeks of the study. After 6 weeks,
      groups will cross-over and switch devices, and tooth movement will be followed for another 6
      weeks. Patients will be blinded as to which device they are using. Amount of tooth movement
      per week, pain perception, and change in gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers will be
      outcomes assessed. Device safety evaluation to be performed will include adverse events and
      clinical examination findings including pulp vitality testing and periodontal probe results.
