      muscles during postural and locomotor tasks in patients post stroke. To this end, the
      researchers will recruit 20 patients participating in inpatient rehabilitation at Shirley
      Ryan AbilityLab in the early subacute phase after stroke and 20 age-matched healthy controls.
      The researchers will ask them to perform postural tasks and walking trials at their
      preferential speed. All assessments will be performed by a licensed physiotherapist as per
      the standard of care once a week during three weeks of inpatient rehabilitation at the
      Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. During these tasks, the researchers will record HD-EMG signals from
      four muscle groups (Quadriceps, Hamstrings, Triceps Surae, Tibialis anterior).
