      same time period, patients receiving fixed orthodontic treatments well-matched with
      clear-aligner patients by similar ages (difference < 3 years), same gender and similar levels
      of severity of malocclusion [similar Index of Complexity Outcome and Need (ICON) level] were
      enrolled.The two groups were well-matched with ages, gender and levels of malocclusion
      severity. Pain perception, anxiety and quality of life were assessed through visual analogue
      scale (VAS), state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and oral health impact profile-14
      (OHIP-14), respectively.
