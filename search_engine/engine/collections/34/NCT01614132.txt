      often treated in the scope of expanded access treatments or within pediatric studies;
      although, it is not known whether medulloblastomas act in the same way in adulthood and in
      childhood. This is the first study to investigate the significance of a combination of a
      radiochemotherapy (vincristin) and a following maintenance chemotherapy (vincristin,
      cisplatin and CCNU) in adult patients with medulloblastoma with the purpose to have a
      starting point for the development of chemotherapeutical protocols in adults.
