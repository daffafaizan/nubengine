      Although the presence of bone marrow lesions (BML) on MRI is strongly associated with
      osteoarthritis (OA) progression and pain in some studies, the mechanism for this relation and
      the underlying pathology is not well established. The lack of knowledge on what these lesions
      constitute hampers their clinical utility both with regards to measurement and targeting for
      therapeutic intervention.

      Our preliminary data has localized specific changes in bone mineralization, remodeling and
      defects within BML features that are adjacent to the subchondral plate. BMLs appear to be
      sclerotic compared to unaffected regions; however, the mineral density in these lesions is
      reduced and may render this area to be mechanically compromised, and thus susceptible to
      attrition. Limited histological analysis of BMLs reveal thrombi, diffuse fibrinoid necrosis
      and hyperplasia of blood vessel walls - all indicative of infarction-like pathology.

      The aim of this research proposal is to create more specific targets and improve our
      understanding of the pathology in BMLs.

      Specific Aim 1:

      - To collect tissue to evaluate protein and gene expression of these tissues and cultured
      cells.
