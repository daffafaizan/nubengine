        -  Compare the efficacy of neutron and photon radiotherapy vs hypofractionated intensity
           modulated radiation, in terms of a lower frequency of chronic complication rate (chronic
           toxicity and disease-free survival), in patients with favorable to intermediate
           prognosis, stage I-III adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage
      of disease (T1 vs T2 vs T3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo neutron radiotherapy over 15-45 minutes 5 days a week for 2
           weeks followed by photon radiotherapy over 15-45 minutes 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo photon radiotherapy over 15-45 minutes 5 days a week for 5
           weeks followed by hypofractionated photon irradiation over 15-45 minutes 5 days a week
           for 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
