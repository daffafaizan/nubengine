      clinic at Landspitali National University Hospital in Iceland. In the clinic risk assessment
      was conducted and the patients were accordingly provided with individualized care be it
      telephone surveillance, onsite examination and treatment, or admission to the hospital. As
      the the first wave of the pandemic was curbing the necessity of exploring how the patients
      did and continue to fare after being infected became apparent.

      The research questions are:

      What were the symptoms that patients expressed during and about three months after being
      diagnosed with COVID-19? What is the prevalence and intensity of the symptoms that patients
      expressed during and about three months after being diagnosed with COVID-19 ? How do patients
      value their health related quality of life, what is their health literacy and sense of
      security in care during and about three months after being diagnosed with COVID-19 ? How do
      patients value the nursing care in the outpatient COVID-19 clinic? What are the patients'
      perception of having caught COVID-19?
