        -  Compare the efficacy of gabapentin with vs without an antidepressant, as measured by the
           frequency and intensity of hot flashes, in patients with a history of breast cancer or a
           concern about taking hormonal therapy due to a fear of developing breast cancer.

        -  Compare adverse events in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate a reduction in hot flash scores with improvement in quality of life and
           related outcomes in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      duration of hot flash symptoms (< 9 months vs ≥ 9 months), average frequency of hot flashes
      per day (2-3 vs 4-9 vs ≥ 10), and antidepressant currently being used (venlafaxine vs
      paroxetine vs other). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients continue to receive the same antidepressant (as before study entry) on
           weeks 1-5. During weeks 2-5, patients also receive oral gabapentin once daily on days
           8-10, twice daily on days 11-13, and then three times daily on days 14-35 in the absence
           of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gabapentin as in arm I. Patients are tapered off their
           antidepressant over 7-10 days and remain on gabapentin alone (per arm I schedule).

      Patients in both arms complete a hot flash diary at baseline and then daily during study
      treatment.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then weekly during study treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients (55 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
