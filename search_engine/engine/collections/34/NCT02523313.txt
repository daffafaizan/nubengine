      monotherapy or Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab versus double placebo control. Furthermore,
      it will also allow for direct comparison of the respective safety profiles of Nivolumab
      monotherapy or Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab. Nivolumab monotherapy was chosen as one of
      the experimental arms because of a favourable risk-benefit ratio assessed in the large Phase
      1 study (MDX1106-03/CA209-003). The combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab was chosen as an
      experimental arm because of the preliminary evidence from the Phase 1 study CA209-004
      suggesting synergy between Nivolumab and Ipilimumab resulting in a higher frequency of
      patients with increased tumour burden reduction. Evaluating both Nivolumab monotherapy and
      the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab will provide clinical data allowing clinicians to
      select the appropriate treatment for each patient based on their individual risk-benefit
      ratio.
