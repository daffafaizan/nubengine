      hyperglycemic clamps in dogs significantly increases the glucose infusion rate necessary to
      maintain stable hyperglycemia without any significant differences in insulin or glucagon
      secretion. The present study's aim is to examine whether this also occurs in humans. It may
      be necessary to examine a dose response curve. Specifically, in twenty healthy volunteers
      glucose infusion rate during the peptide infusion will be compared to the glucose infusion
      rate during saline administration during a 4 hour hyperglycemic clamp, in a cross over
      design(mg/kg/min).
