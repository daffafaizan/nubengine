      The efficiency of catheter ablation in drug-refractory atrial fibrillation (AF) is
      compromised by high incidence of post-ablation AF recurrences requiring multiple ablation
      procedures (1). Post-PVAI (pulmonary vein antrum isolation) AF recurrence is mostly due to
      reconnection of the previously isolated PVs (2). Earlier studies have revealed that
      elimination of dormant PV conduction revealed by adenosine-provocation ensures better outcome
      as reconnection mostly happens due to presence of incompletely ablated tissue and
      identification and complete ablation decrease chance of recurrence (1). Adenosine is
      specifically chosen for induction of triggers because it is known to transiently or
      permanently re-establish left atrium-pulmonary vein (LA-PV) conduction after apparently
      successful PV isolation (3). Datino et al have demonstrated in the canines that adenosine
      selectively hyperpolarizes the PVs by increasing inward rectifier potassium (K+) current and
      restores excitability (4). As incompletely ablated tissue can potentially cause AF
      recurrence, the depth and extension of the lesion are crucial factors in determining the
      success-rate of ablation; these in turn are directly influenced by catheter type and the
      radio-frequency (RF) energy settings (5). In a previous study, Matiello et al have reported
      cooled-tip catheter at 40w setting to be more effective in preventing recurrence than that
      with 30w setting (5). However, none of the earlier studies have examined the rate of PV
      reconnection when AF ablation is done at different power settings using open-irrigated
      catheters after the dormant sites are revealed by adenosine-challenge.

      Hypothesis:

      Use of higher wattage during ablation before and after adenosine-challenge is associated with
      lower rate of PV reconnection.
