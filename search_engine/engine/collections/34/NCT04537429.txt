    
      This is an interventional, open-label pharmacokinetic study with eptinezumab, consisting of a
      single-dose, 20-week main study period (Part A) and an optional 44-week multiple-dose
      extension period (Part B).

      The main study period includes a single IV infusion of eptinezumab. The optional extension
      period includes 3 additional eptinezumab infusions 12 weeks apart (reflecting recommended
      dosing interval in adults), for a total of up to 4 infusions over the course of the study.

      At least 32 patients with migraine will be enrolled: 16 patients aged 6 to 11 years, and 16
      patients aged 12 to 17 years, inclusive.
