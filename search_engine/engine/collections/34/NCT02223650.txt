      treatment vs. non-overminus (spectacles without overminus or no spectacles) is to determine
      whether to proceed to a full-scale, longer-term randomized trial. This decision will be based
      primarily on assessing the initial (8-week) response to overminus by comparing treatment
      groups on the following outcomes:

        -  Mean distance IXT control score (each patient's score is the mean of 3 control scores)
           (primary outcome)

        -  The proportion of subjects with treatment response, defined as 1 or more points
           improvement in mean of 3 distance IXT control scores (secondary outcome)

        -  Adverse effects, near visual acuity outcomes, and spectacle wear compliance
