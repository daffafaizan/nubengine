      TSP alone to the combination of TSP with cathflo activase for achieving optimal results with
      pleurodesis for recurrent pleural effusion. Patients who sign informed consent will be
      randomly assigned to receive either TSP alone (talc, 5 gm in 50 ml NS) with placebo (50 ml
      NS) or TSP with cathflo activase (4 mg in 50 ml NS) through the chest pleural catheter.
      Follow-up lasts for three months. The primary outcome is achievement of a "Radiographically
      Satisfactory Pleurodesis" (RSP) by day three post-procedure, defined as chest tube drainage
      of less than 100cc over 24 hours and a chest x-ray showing similar or less pleural space
      opacification than on the day TSP was performed (baseline, day 0). Secondary outcomes include
      the proportion of patients who achieve RSP, time needed to achieve RSP, duration of chest
      tube drainage, length of hospital stay after initiation of TSP, proportion of patients
      requiring repeat TSP, change in serum hemoglobin during therapy, objective assessments of
      pain and dyspnea, and potential complications. This study will recruit 136 patients, with an
      interim analyses for efficacy after 50 patients, and aims to help develop the future standard
      for management of patients requiring pleurodesis for their symptomatic pleural effusion.
