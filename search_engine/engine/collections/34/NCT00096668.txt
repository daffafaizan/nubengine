      Paclitaxel at a dose level, 120mg/m2, known to be tolerated based on Phase 2a studies of this
      investigational agent in patients with other histological diagnoses. This study is a fixed
      sample size design with no planned early stopping decision. The goals of the study include
      the determination of the safety of TOCOSOL Paclitaxel, and the objective response rate,
      defined by RECIST criteria as complete responses plus partial responses.
