      To evaluate the effect of nutritional therapy with caloric intake determined by indirect
      calorimetry and high protein intake (2.0 to 2.2 g/kg/day) compared to nutritional therapy
      with 25 kcal/kg/day and 1.4 to 1, 5 g/kg/day of protein on short-term outcomes and physical
      component (PCS) of quality of life after 3 and 6 months of randomization in severe ICU
      patients.

      The primary objective will be the evaluation of the physical component summary (PCS) of SF-36
      (Short Form 36), a questionnaire used to evaluate quality of life, validated for the
      Brazilian population. Patients will be assessed at least 3 and 6 months after randomization.

      Secondary objectives: Measurement of handgrip strength measured on the 7th and 14th day of
      the study and on discharge from the ICU, ICU mortality, hospital mortality, mechanical
      ventilation time and length of stay in the ICU.

      METHODS

      The study will include patients over 18 years of age, not pregnant, submitted to mechanical
      ventilation, whose expectation of stay in the ICU is greater than 3 days.

      The sample size was calculated based on the following parameters: patient population under
      mechanical ventilation, 528, 15% relative risk reduction in the evaluation parameter of the
      SF-36 tool, Level of significance (Î±) of 5%, test power of 80%, thus the number of
      individuals to be sampled will be 294, i.e., two groups of 147 patients. A computer-generated
      list for randomization and sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes is used. The level
      of significance to reject the null hypothesis will be 5%, that is, a value of p <0.05 will be
      considered as statistically significant.

      Informed consent was obtained from the patient or a next of kin.
