    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-041. This study will look at brain
      penetration of single oral doses of TAK-041 and its effects on amphetamine-induced dopamine
      release in the CNS.

      The study will enroll participants until 12 evaluable participants complete all study
      procedures. The first 4 participants enrolled in this study will receive a dose of 20 mg
      TAK-041 and 0.50 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) dose of amphetamine. The dose for subsequent
      participants will be determined based on the results of amphetamine-induced dopamine release
      in the first 4 participants (5 to 40 for TAK-041 and 0.25 or 0.50 mg/kg for the amphetamine).

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 92 days. Participants will remain confined to the
      clinic for 3 to 4 days during 2 confinement periods. Participants will make monthly visits
      during Days 8-64 and a final visit 30 days later.
