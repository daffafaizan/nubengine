      therapy. Patients were treated with conventional therapy for 3 days, then plus PNS for 14
      days. Patients in the control group received conventional therapy for 17days. Hematoma volume
      measured by CT scanning, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, Barthel
      index (BI), all the three were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect for both groups after
      two weeks of intervention.
