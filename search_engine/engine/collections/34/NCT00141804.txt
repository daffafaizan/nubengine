      efficacy of a tac/rapa vs a tac/MMF regimen. Tac trough levels in accordance with current
      standards in both arms. Steroids to be used to individual centre protocol. Rapa trough levels
      will be adjusted to 5-10 ng/ml. Up to now only few data (primate and clinical) on tac/rap
      combinations available.
