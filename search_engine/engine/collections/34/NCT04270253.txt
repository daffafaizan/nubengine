      characterized by pain and loss of physical function, which has a negative impact on patients'
      quality of life. The different international guidelines recommend several non-invasive
      treatment modalities for the management of KOA. Conservative therapy including land-based
      exercises, aquatic exercises, Transcutaneous Electro Neuro Stimulation (TENS) therapy and
      balneotherapy has been reported positively in the management of patients with KOA (1, 2).
      Manual therapy is also a preferred treatment modality with the aim of alleviation of pain,
      improvement of joint mobility and therefore the physical condition (1, 2). Out of manual
      therapy techniques, end-range mobilization is a well applied treatment technique in the
      management of different musculoskeletal conditions (3). Till date, the effect of end-range
      mobilization has not been investigated so far in knee OA.

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of end-range mobilization
      added to conservative therapy versus conservative therapy alone on decrease of pain and
      improvement of functional status in KOA.
