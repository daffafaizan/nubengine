    
      Open label study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-mBN85B in healthy
      vaccine-naive, measles-naive and measles-experienced children. The study is comprised of
      three groups with 30 children each. Two groups will receive two subcutaneous (s.c.)
      immunizations 4 weeks (28±3 days) apart of either either 1 x 10E7 TCID50 (Group A) or 1 x
      10E8 TCID50 (Group B) MVA mBN85B. The control group (Group C) will receive two s.c. doses
      (0.5 ml, 1000 TCID50) of Rouvax® (Sanofi-Pasteur) 24 weeks apart.
