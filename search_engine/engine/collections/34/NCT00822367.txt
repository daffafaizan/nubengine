      supplements are preferential for patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). We will compare the
      post-prandial blood glucose (BG) responses in response to 3 different nutritional supplements
      each containing 50 grams of carbohydrate in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      relate these responses to one of the two well-recognized indices of insulin sensitivity -
      HOMA-R and QUICKI.
