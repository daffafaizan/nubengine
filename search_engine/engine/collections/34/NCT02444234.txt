      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the airways of patients with CF is associated with more rapid
      lung function decline and a higher mortality. Tedizolid is a new antibiotic with potent
      activity against MRSA. Tedizolid is currently FDA approved for treatment of skin soft tissue
      infections with MRSA. The proposed study is designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      intravenous and oral tedizolid in patients with CF.
