      countermeasures available to provide protection against botulism. The rBV A/B is under
      development to provide protection of adults 18 to 55 years of age from fatal botulism caused
      by inhalational intoxication with botulinum neurotoxin complex (BoNT) serotype A, subtype A1
      (BoNT/A1) and botulinum neurotoxin complex serotype B, subtype B1 (BoNT/B1). Volunteers will
      not be exposed to botulism. Protective antibody titers will be measured in serum after
      vaccination.
