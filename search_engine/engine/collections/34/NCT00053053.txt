        -  Compare the change in lean body mass of patients treated with Juven速 vs a non-Juven速
           supplement.

        -  Compare the change in fatigue and quality of life of patients treated with these
           supplements.

        -  Compare the results of plethysmography, bioimpedance, and skinfold measurement in
           patients treated with these supplements.

        -  Compare the weight change in patients treated with these supplements.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to primary disease site (lung vs others), concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no),
      evidence of metastases (yes vs no), and degree of weight loss (2-5% vs 6-10%). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral Juven速 supplement twice daily for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral non-Juven速 supplement twice daily for 8 weeks. All
           patients undergo lean body mass measurement (to include multiple body composition and
           weight change) and fatigue and quality of life assessments at baseline and then at 4 and
           8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 468 patients (234 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 16 months.
