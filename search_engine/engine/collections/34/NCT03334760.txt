      introduction of complementary food and protein intake at 18 months are associated with BMI
      and overweight at ages 7 and 11 years, independent of BMI during infancy.

      Children participating in the Danish National Birth Cohort were followed-up at ages 7 and
      11years. Information on infant feeding, protein intake at 18 months, Ponderal Index at birth,
      child BMI (5 months, 12 months, 7 and 11 years) and several parental factors was available.

      Path analysis was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of infant feeding on BMI
      z-scores at ages 7 (n= 36,481) and 11y (n=22,047). Logistic regression analyses were used to
      examine associations with overweight.
