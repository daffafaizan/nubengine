    
      Ultrasound-guided PVB (either before surgery, or after surgery) is the standard postoperative
      pain management for Robotic cardiac surgery. This technique is to inject local anesthetic
      (numb medication) around nerve to decrease pain. But the optimal time of PVB is unknown.

      The administration of PVB before surgery can help pain control during the surgery and after
      surgery. But the duration of PVB could be reduced because surgery itself can last 5-6 hrs.

      The PVB after surgery will not provide pain control during surgery, but may provide longer
      pain control after surgery, and may help participants faster recovery after surgery.
