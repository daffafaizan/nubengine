      anesthetic drug in clinical settings.From clinical observation, dexmedetomidine has been
      revealed to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in patients with heart
      diseases during non-cardiac surgeries.Therefore, the aim of this sudy is to observe the
      impact of dexmedetomidine on Cardiac Troponin I and Glycogen Phosphorylase Isoenzyme BB in
      patients during cardiac surgeries.
