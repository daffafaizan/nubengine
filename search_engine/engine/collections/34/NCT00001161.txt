      intraocular pressure. The purpose of the study will be to determine if there is a common
      pathogenesis shared by these conditions. A natural history study of 40 individuals with these
      diseases will utilize clinical measurements and photographs for documentation of this
      hypothesis. In addition, surgical specimens, when available, will be studied.
