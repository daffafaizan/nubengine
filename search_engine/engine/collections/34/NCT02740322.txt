      the skull is elicited to determine if a change in hearing is conductive or sensorineural in
      nature. Because the hum test is frequently employed in clinical practice yet its validation
      has yet to be demonstrated, investigation is warranted.

      To examine and compare the Hum Test, Weber Test, and audiogram in their ability to detect and
      identify hearing loss, hearing loss will be simulated with the use of ear plugs (mimicking
      conductive hearing loss). Subjects will serve as their own control as these tests will be
      conducted with and without ear plugs.

      Study data will be maintained using an online, password protected storage system. No
      identifiable information will be collected or stored (i.e. name, DOB, etc.). Limited
      demographic information will be collected for analysis purposes such as age and gender.
