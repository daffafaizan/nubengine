      been used at some medical institutions. However, after releasing of danazol in the early
      1980's and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists in the late 1980's, pseudomenopause
      therapy became mainstream because of its high efficacy. However, pseudopregnancy therapy was
      recognized again due to adverse reactions associated with pseudomenopause therapy. After
      2000, low-dose estrogen/progestin (LEP) combination drugs (as LEP products,
      ethinylestradiol/norethisterone combination drug and ethinylestradiol/drospirenone
      combination drug) and dienogest have been utilized as drugs that are safer and can be
      administered for a long time. In recent years, Duphaston® Tablets are increasing recognized
      again from the viewpoints of its efficacy and safety because the drug has no effect to
      inhibit ovulation or effect on basal body temperature, a diagnosis of ovulation and other
      conditions may be made by following up basal body temperature, and pregnancy may be achieved
      even during treatment with Duphaston. As previously mentioned, Duphaston® Tablets are an old
      drug, and there are only few clinical data from Japanese patients; thus, its latest clinical
      efficacy and safety data are being demanded again mainly by obstetrician-gynecologists.
