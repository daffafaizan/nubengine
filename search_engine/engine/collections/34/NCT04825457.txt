      tip was projected from the sheath by 1-2 mm length. Consequently, a small mucosal incision
      was made at proximal side of lesion. Then the snare was deployed progressively and adjusted
      around the lesion trying to obtain free margins. At the final step of both conventional and
      Tip-in EMR, the lesion was resected.
