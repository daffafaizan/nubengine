      of the esophagus or gastric cardia receiving the combination of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil,
      and leucovorin calcium. II. Determine the duration of response and overall survival of this
      patient population receiving this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity, including
      neurotoxicity, of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours on day 1, then leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours with fluorouracil IV bolus, followed
      by fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for a
      minimum of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with stable or responding disease receive at least 3 additional courses of therapy. Patients
      are followed for a minimum of 2 years or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study over 18 months.
