      donation, no study has explored how donor attitudes and reactions change over time.
      Currently, there is no long-term data available to describe donor's feelings and reactions to
      their donation. Consequently, programs have no guidance to counsel prospective donors about
      whether donors' attitudes change towards their own participation, contact with any offspring,
      or concerns about the donation. In addition, just as ovum donors' initial health histories
      were shared anonymously with the recipient(s), any updated information gathered in this study
      would be shared anonymously with the recipient(s) or offspring should they request those
      updates.
