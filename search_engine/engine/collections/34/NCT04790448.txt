    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B
      (BRAF) V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with Vemurafenib in
      combination with Irinotecan and Cetuximab (VIC regimen).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), safety and toxicity
      of VIC regimen in the treatment of BRAF V600E mutant colon cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      Mechanism of primary and secondary resistance to VIC regimen in the treatment of BRAF V600E
      mutant colon cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Cetuximab and Irinotecan intravenously on day 1 and Vemurafenib orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1 to 14. Courses are repeated every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
