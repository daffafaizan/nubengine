    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To establish a national biorepository including biospecimen and clinical data collections
      from patients treated with immuno-oncology (IO) therapeutics who experience one or more
      serious (grade 3-4) immune-related adverse events (irAEs), rare infections or
      hyperprogression (acceleration of tumor growth).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples (and optional stool samples from
      patients experiencing colitis) at the time of registration (within 72 hours of confirmation
      of one or more severe irAEs) and at 1 month after registration. Patients' medical records are
      also reviewed for up to 1 year.
