    
      All subjects, after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF), will be assessed during the
      screening phase. Only those subjects who successfully complete the screening phase and meet
      the study eligibility criteria will proceed to receive study treatment at the assigned doses
      and will be followed up for 5 days (for SAD) and 1 week (for MAD) to assess post-treatment
      safety.

      Subjects in the SAD cohorts A1 to A3 will be administered a single dose of escalated doses of
      FB2001 (5 mg, 15 mg, and 30mg) by intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 0. Subjects in the MAD
      cohort B1 will be administered with FB2001 by IV infusion once daily for 5 consecutive days
      (Days 0 to 4).

      The SAD part of the study (cohorts A1-A3) will include a sentinel design in which, 2 subjects
      will be initially randomized 1:1 to FB2001 and placebo at the given cohort dose. If the dose
      was well tolerated for 48 hours after the administration per the study Data Safety Monitoring
      Committee (DSMC), the remaining 6 subjects with 5:1 randomization ratio (FB2001: placebo)
      will be administered the same dose. A daily assessment of adverse events will be performed
      via telephone everyday between EOT and the Follow-up Visit for both SAD and MAD.

      The decision for cohort (dose level) escalation to the higher dose levels will be made by the
      study DSMC after safety review of available information
