      disease has a marked propensity for loco-regional spread and will be the sole or major site
      of disease in up to 80% of patients. Various attempts at controlling loco-regional disease
      have not been successful. The selective lethal effect of supranormal temperatures on
      neoplastic cells and the additive or synergistic effect of combining chemotherapy has been
      well established in laboratory models and has provided the rationale for numerous clinical
      trials using hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion for advanced extremity melanoma or sarcoma.
      This Phase I study will evaluate the safety of escalating temperatures of continuous
      hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP) with escalating doses of intraperitoneal Cisplatin
      (CDDP) in the treatment of patients with advanced peritoneal adenocarcinoma of
      gastrointestinal origin.
