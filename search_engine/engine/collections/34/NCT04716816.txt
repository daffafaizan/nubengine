      the rhomboid after thoracoscopic surgery. Sixty patients with chest pain after thoracoscopic
      surgery were randomized divided into two equal groups (A and B). Group A (n = 100) received
      conventional analgesics. Group B (n = 100) received SM twice daily in the active trigger
      points of the rhomboid for two weeks. The visual analogue scale, a pressure algometer, will
      be used to evaluate patients' pre- and post-treatment statuses.

      This study will compare differences between the current traditional method (using analgesics)
      and the SM for rhomboid myofascial trigger points for post-thoracoscopic chest pain, and
      analyze the variables generated by the two different methods including demand time of
      analgesics, acceptance, and differences of visual analogue scale. The results of the study
      will use scientific data to prove which way is a good way to take into account of the relief
      of patient's chest pain.
