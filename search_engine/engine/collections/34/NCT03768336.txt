      Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine. The 3RP is a group program that-through a
      variety of mind-body approaches, such as imagery, relaxation, and yoga-seeks to buffer stress
      and promote psychological resiliency and physical well-being.

      The 3RP has not yet been carried out with adolescent or young adult individuals who have
      recently completed treatment for cancer. As such, the investigators have adapted the original
      3RP to target the specific needs of adolescent and young adult patients who are transitioning
      off active treatment. The investigators are conducting this study to see if the adapted
      program, the 3RP-AYA, is effective at reducing stress and stress-related symptoms for people
      of at least age 16 who have completed treatment for cancer within the past five years.
