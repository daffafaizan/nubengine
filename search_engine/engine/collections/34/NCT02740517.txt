      successfully record their sleep respiration data whilst unsupervised in their own home.

      Other objectives:

        -  To gather useful feedback on the user interface and suggestions for its improvement.

        -  To gather information on the device stability in the more variable conditions of the
           home user environment.

        -  To gather data in order to demonstrate compliance with IEC62366, and thus IEC60601-1

      The users had the device for a minimum of 10 nights, to confirm if the device could be used
      for an extended period and the likely compliance rates of users
