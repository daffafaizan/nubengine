      resulting in attrition in up to 60% of affected personnel. A recent report indicates that
      supplemental calcium (2000mg) and vitamin D (800-1000IU) stabilizes PTH, increases tibia
      volumetric bone mineral density in male and female recruits undergoing Army BCT, and reduces
      stress fracture incidence by up to 20% in female Nacy recruits. Bone macroarchitecture has
      been measured in response to basic training however, the resolution of standard peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) is insufficient for assessment of microarchitectural
      changes, which may underlie the pathophysiology of stress fracture. With the use of HRpQCT
      this study will allow the investigators to evaluate microarchitectural changes within the
      bone tissue and assess the efficacy of a moderate daily dose of calcium and vitamin D to
      support bone health during BCT.
