      measurements will take roughly 2-30 minutes to complete, and will involve: 1) attaching the
      sensor on the subject; 2) attaching one or more reference devices to the subject; 3) making
      measurements with both the sensor and reference device, either simultaneously or
      sequentially; and 4) collecting and analyzing the paired value.
