      recently it was the most commonly used imaging method to evaluate small bowel Crohn disease.
      Recently, Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) which is a form of magnetic resonance imaging
      that provides detailed images of the bowel and less frequently, Ultrasound (US) are replacing
      CT as the standard of care imaging tool at some institutions.

      The investigators would like to determine how effective US imaging is compared to MRI imaging
      in accurately diagnosing and following SBCD in children. Along with enteric ultrasound (EnUS)
      we will also be comparing a new ultrasound technology called Ultrasound Elastography Imaging
      (UEI) for this study in which we will be using a second form of UEI called Acoustic Radiation
      Force Impulse (ARFI). This technique uses sound waves to asses the stiffness properties of
      soft tissue. The study will compare costs, patient preferences, and imaging accuracy.
