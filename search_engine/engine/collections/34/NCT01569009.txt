      have not been caused by cystic fibrosis. Promoting physical activity and decreasing
      inactivity (e.g. sedentary periods of activity such as sitting/lying) has been proposed as a
      key component of care for chronic disease but there is no research on physical activity in
      bronchiectasis. There is research describing physical activity in other respiratory
      populations, however, the disease trajectory and demographic profile of bronchiectasis is
      sufficiently different to warrant the proposed research specifically in bronchiectasis

      The investigators need to explore physical activity in bronchiectasis and also provide
      specific information on the instruments used to measure physical activity. There are several
      methods which could be used to assess physical activity including subjective methods (e.g.
      questionnaires), objective methods (e.g. motion sensors). In this study the investigators are
      using a range of assessment tools to help determine their usefulness (feasibility and
      acceptability from the health professional and patient perspective) for quantifying physical
      activity in bronchiectasis.

      This study will also assess patients' readiness to change (stages of change, self efficacy,
      decisional balance and processes of change). Understanding patients with bronchiectasis
      readiness to change physical activity behaviour and the links between the other important
      outcome measures will help to inform a future physical activity intervention specifically in
      patients with bronchiectasis.
