      a number of indications, such as: airway obstruction, need for a long respiratory support,
      improvement in respiratory toilet, prophylaxis before head and neck procedures and cases of
      severe obstructive sleep apnea.

      Several studies have shown that the procedure is safe and economically efficient in
      comparison to open surgical operation in the operating room.

      In many places around the world it is customary in to perform the operation under the
      guidance of a bronchoscope to prevent damage to adjacent structures, high or low position of
      the tube, and damage to the posterior wall of the trachea and to approve the final position
      of the tube. However, the use of a bronchoscope depends on the availability of the equipment,
      knowledge of the operator, temporary occlusion of the trachea and hypercarbia, increased
      length of the procedure, and maintenance cost (disinfection, replacement, etc.).

      Ultrasound that is performed before percutaneous procedure may be useful in preventing damage
      to para tracheal adjacent structures, and preventing high placement of the tube. The use of
      duplex sonography with real-time visualization of the needle path is done routinely in
      procedures such as central venous catheterization, and may improve the safety and accuracy of
      percutaneous tracheostomy without causing airway obstruction or hypercarbia. Feasibility of
      the procedure has been reviewed in an article by Rajajee et al .

      In our institution as in a number of institutions in the country, it is acceptable to perform
      the operation by placing the tube on a high position near the vocal cords by direct
      laryngoscopy and then puncturing the trachea with a needle, by location of the anatomy by
      palpation of the neck.

      So far, no systematic comparison has been made among the three methods.
