      diabetes that may be associated with increased daytime sleepiness and fatigue, increased
      diabetes-related distress, decreased self-management behavior, and worse glycemic control.
      The main hypothesis of the current application is that a web-based cognitive behavioral
      treatment of insomnia (Sleep Health Using the Internet: SHUTi) in persons with T2DM will not
      only improve their nighttime sleep, but also improve their ability to integrate diabetes
      education into their daily behavior and positively affect their glucose control compared to a
      web-based Information Control (IC) group. The aims of this study are to 1) obtain preliminary
      data to facilitate further hypothesis development and enhance the feasibility of conducting a
      randomized clinical trial to examine if treatment of insomnia results in participant's being
      better able to integrate diabetes education into their self-management behavior and result in
      improved glucose control, 2) explore the associations among changes in insomnia severity,
      fatigue, daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, A1C (a measure of glucose control over the last
      three months) and diabetes self-management (DSM) behaviors, 3) explore average
      pre-intervention to post-intervention changes in insomnia severity, daytime symptoms
      (fatigue, sleepiness, mood) and DSM behaviors (diet and physical activity) in subjects
      treated with SHUTi + DSM compared to IC + DSM subjects at 3 months, and 4) explore sleep
      fragmentation as a potential physiological mechanism linking impaired glucose control (A1C)
      and sleep in subjects with insomnia and T2DM at baseline and 3 months.
