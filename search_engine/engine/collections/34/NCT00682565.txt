      on symptom-limited exercise tolerance in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and angina.
      The secondary objectives are to assess the tolerability of CK-1827452 administered three
      times daily (tid) to steady state in an immediate-release (IR), blend-in-capsule oral
      formulation to outpatients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and angina and to assess CK-1827452
      plasma concentrations at trough and 1 hour after dosing with CK-1827452 administered tid to
      steady state in an IR, blend-in-capsule oral formulation to outpatients with ischemic
      cardiomyopathy and angina.
