    
      This is an open label placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of
      mixed OL-HDF (mOL-HDF) on different circulating mediators of vascular dysfunction.

      Inclusion criteria: age > 18 yrs, hemodialytic treatment from at least 6 months (3 times for
      week), blood flow rate (Qb) â‰¥ 250 ml/min using arterovenous fistula (AVF) or permanent
      central venous catheter (CVC), blood creatinine clearance <5 ml/min, urine output<500 ml/die.

      Exclusion criteria: neoplastic diseases, chronic autoimmune diseases, lack of consent, solid
      organ or bone marrow transplantation.

      Safety Assessment: the use of mOL-HDF has been approved by the European Medicines Agency as
      routine hemodepurative technique for end stage renal disease patients. Patients were
      evaluated for adverse reaction at each dialysis section; investigators recorded intra and
      extra-dialytic adverse events.

      Study Treatment, Dosage, and Route of Administration: Enrolled patients have been randomized
      in 2 groups: 15 patients continued high flux bicarbonate hemodialysis (BHD), whereas 15
      patients switched to mixed on-line hemodiafiltration (mOL-HDF using FX 1000 CorDiax,
      Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) for 9 months.

      Efficacy Assessments:

      Main outcome variable: changes in RNA content of circulating exosome/microvesicles (at 9
      months) Secondary outcomes: changes in circulating inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein,
      Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin, Interleukin-6, Ferritin) at 3-6 and 9 months.
      changes in RNA content of circulating microvesicles (at 3 and 6 months)

      Study Duration: 9 months

      Statistical Methods: Data have been analyzed according to an intention-to-treat approach.
      Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired Student t -test, ANOVA, or
      Kruskal-Wallis test when appropriate. A two-sided value of p=0.05 was considered significant.
