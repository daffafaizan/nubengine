        -  Determine the antitumor effects of low-dose beta-alethine in patients with low grade
           B-cell lymphoma.

        -  Assess the effects of this regimen on delayed-type hypersensitivity in these patients.

        -  Assess the safety of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is an multicenter study.

      Patients receive low-dose beta-alethine subcutaneously once every 2 weeks for a total of 6
      doses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no evidence of tumor progression
      may receive additional courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed for 2 weeks from the last dose or for a minimum of 30 days if they
      withdraw due to an adverse event.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
