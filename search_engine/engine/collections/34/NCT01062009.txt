      septic shock is characterized by large scale repression of genes that either directly depend
      on normal zinc homeostasis or directly participate in zinc homeostasis. Functional validation
      studies demonstrated that nonsurvivors of pediatric septic shock have abnormally low serum
      zinc concentrations. A follow-up pilot study in a general population of critically ill
      children demonstrated that the presence of low plasma zinc concentrations is a prevalent
      problem in critically ill children. In addition, low plasma zinc concentrations correlate
      inversely with indices of inflammation and directly with the number of organ failures. These
      preliminary data, coupled with the expected safety of zinc supplementation, provided the
      rationale for a double blinded, prospective, placebo-controlled trial of zinc supplementation
      in critically ill children, with the two primary study endpoints to assess efficacy being
      highly clinically relevant: reduction of the lymphopenia rate and improvement of glucose
      homeostasis. Although the proposal was well-received, the primary concern precluding funding
      of this trial were lack of safety and dosing data for intravenous zinc. We have therefore
      developed a proposal for a Phase I/II study of safety and pharmacokinetics to address these
      concerns. It is anticipated that data generated through this proposal will provide the
      necessary preliminary data to re-submit our application for an interventional efficacy trial
      of zinc supplementation in critically ill children
