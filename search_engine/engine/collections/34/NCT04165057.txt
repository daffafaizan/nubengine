      will be randomized to receive optimal muscle tension management or conventional anesthetic
      management without optimal muscle tension management. Our primary hypothesis is that optimal
      muscle tension management provides improved surgical conditions and less intra-abdominal
      pressure required. The secondary endpoints include surgical duration, intraoperative
      complications, total amount of muscle relaxants, respiratory and hemodynamic changes during
      surgery, extubation time and any events during post-anesthetic recovery.
