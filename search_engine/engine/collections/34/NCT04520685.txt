      social communication deficits and restricted and repetitive interests. Individuals with ASD
      often have behavioral issues and psychiatric comorbidities which can be very hard to manage.
      Currently, there are only two FDA approved medications (aripiprazole and risperidone) for the
      treatment of irritability in ASD. Both medications have the potential for side effects and
      are not tolerated in all children with ASD. Anecdotal and some preliminary studies suggest
      that cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in the marijuana plant, may lead to
      improvements in symptoms of ASD including irritability, aggressive behaviors, and anxiety.

      In this study the investigators will test whether CBD leads to differences in behaviors
      commonly associated with ASD. The main behavioral problems investigators will study are
      irritability and aggressive behavior. This study will also measure changes in other behaviors
      seen in ASD such as anxiety, social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors,
      attentional problems, hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, and quality of life. Study
      investigators will also test whether there are any important side effects of CBD in children
      and adolescents with ASD.
