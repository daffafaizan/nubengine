    
      This study investigates the effects of valaciclovir treatment to individuals with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment of Alzheimer's Disease Type. It is an open pilot
      trial where 36 participants will receive 4 weeks of oral valaciclovir treatment. To find 36
      persons fulfilling inclusion criteria, up to 120 persons will be screened. Important
      inclusion criteria are Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positivity (HSV
      carriage), Apolipoprotein E allele 4 carriage and sufficient kidney function (estimated
      glomerular filtration rate above 30 ml/min). All participants must give their informed
      consent to participation.

      The valaciclovir dose will be 500 mg three times daily the first week and 1000 mg three times
      daily week 2-4.

      Participants will be investigated using different measures before and after the treatment
      period: Mini Mental State Examination to assess cognitive function, Cerebrospinal fluid
      biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and [18F]-FHBG-PET/CT
      (9-[4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography)) to possibly indicate active HSV infection within the central nervous system.
