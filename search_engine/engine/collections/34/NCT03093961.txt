      patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, despite appropriate
      medical management. The implant is designed with a center barrel opening that, in the setting
      of elevated LAP, allows left to right flow. Since many of the symptoms these patients
      experience are believed to be due to elevated LAP, the IASD System II has the potential to
      significantly reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life in patients with otherwise
      limited treatment options.

      The study design is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm feasibility trial. This study
      will implant up to 10 subjects. The population will include heart failure patients with
      reduced ejection fraction, and elevated left sided filling pressures, who remain symptomatic
      despite GDMT, including optimal doses of recommended pharmaceutical treatments, surgical, and
      device intervention(s) (CRT, AICD, reduction of MRI). After analysis of the 1 month results
      (including baseline and 1 month Core laboratory echocardiographic and hemodynamic data) of
      the first 5 implanted patients, a decision will be made to implant an additional 5 patients,
