      ultrasonography guided percutaneous cholecystostomy in Cheju Halla General Hospital were
      consecutively enrolled.

      Among 82 patients, 35 were performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after recovery
      (Cholecystectomy group) and 47 treated by best supportive care without additional surgery
      (BSC group).

      The investigators analyzed their surgical risks and clinical outcomes of both patients
      retrospectively.
