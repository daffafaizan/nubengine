    
      Prospective study of a fast recovery program evaluating the impact on the hospitalization
      length and the incidence of re-hospitalization for complications for 60 patients undergoing a
      minimally invasive nephrectomy.

      The cohort will beneficiate of an extra preoperative information about the enhanced recovery
      after surgery program, they will benefit from a strategie of low morphine consumption during
      the per end post operative phase, they should need no bladder or abdominal drainage, they're
      encourage to eat and drink a few hours after surgery, the intravenous fluid is interrupted as
      early as possible, and the patients are encourage to sit, stand up and get dressed as soon as
      they are capable.

      A form completed by the patient registers their every day capabilities to eat, drink, move,
      and their limitations due to pain, dizziness, and nausea. Their bowel and urine transit are
      also registered. This form is complete until discharge from the hospital.

      Their laboratory test is monitored to identify kidney insufficiency or anemia and compared
      with the preoperative laboratory tests.

      The hospital discharge is allowed after medical and surgical criteria are met in both groups.

      A surgical evaluation is planned a week, one month, and 6 months after surgery with
      laboratory exams.

      1 month after the discharge, a satisfaction questionnaire is filled up by the patient,
      answered by telephone.

      At the 6 months post operative consultation, a questionnaire about chronic pain is submitted.
      If the patient is eligible, a chronic pain consultation is further organized.

      The result will be compared to those of a retrospective cohort (+/- 60 patients) with no
      enhanced recovery after surgery program.
