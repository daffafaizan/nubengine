    
      Patients, who are to be treated with internal fixation due to a femoral neck fracture, will
      be randomized by the surgeon to Pinloc or Hansson Pins using an on-line randomization system.

      The patients will be followed up at open visits at 3 months and 1 year. At two years the
      patients will be contacted by phone and medical records studied in order to detect any
      fracture complications.
