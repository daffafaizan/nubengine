      examining the effects of BHV-0223 on public speaking anxiety. Twenty participants with DSM-5
      defined social anxiety disorder and clinically significant public speaking anxiety on the
      Impromptu Speech Task will be enrolled in a challenge study. Participants will be given
      BHV-0223 (or placebo) under double-blind crossover conditions 1 hour prior to performing each
      of 2 impromptu speech tasks. The two study days involving BHV-0223 (or placebo)
      administration and impromptu speech task will be separated by 2 to 10 days to allow for
      medication washout. There will be a final follow-up visit 2 to 10 days later to perform a
      complete Physical exam and do follow-up liver function testing and a Complete Blood Count.
      Our primary outcome will examine BHV-0223's effects (compared to placebo) on self-rated
      anxiety during the impromptu speech task. The investigators will also collect physiological
      measures of anxiety, clinician-rated measures of anxiety, and measures of speech performance
      as secondary outcomes.
