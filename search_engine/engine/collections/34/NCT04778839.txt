      part is dose Expansion.During the course of dose escalation, 18-27 subjects will be enrolled
      to assess the safety、tolerability、pharmacokinetics、preliminary efficacy ,and determine the
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of Paclitaxel Micelles for
      Injection, and explore phase II clinical dosages. The second part will be adjusted according
      to the result of the first part. It will be divided into 4 groups, including advanced breast
      cancer group, ovarian cancer group, non-small cell lung cancer group and gastric cancer
      group, with 20 subjects in each group, to further evaluate the safety, tolerance, PK and
      anti-tumor activity of paclitaxel micelle.
