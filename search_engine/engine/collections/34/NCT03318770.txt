    
      Since the treatment after dasatinib and blinatumomab is not uniform and highly dependent on
      medical decisions, the primary aim of this ancillary trial is to evaluate the long-term
      follow-up of patients enrolled in the GIMEMA 2116, in terms of overall survival (OS).
      Furthermore, the secondary objectives are the collection of data and survival outcomes
      relative to the therapeutic choices carried out after dasatinib and blinatumomab (i.e.
      allo-SCT, autologous transplant, TKI maintenance, etc), duration of CMR, DFS, long-term
      safety profile. A correlation of survival outcomes (OS, DFS, etc) with the clinical and
      biological findings will be carried out with data collected at diagnosis and during the
      follow-up within the LAL2116 trial.
