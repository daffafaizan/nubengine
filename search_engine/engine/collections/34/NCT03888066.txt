    
      Phase 3b multinational, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal,
      parallel group study that includes screening and 12 weeks Run-in Phase (where RAASi
      medications, including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) will be optimized for all
      subjects) and a randomized withdrawal Blinded Treatment Phase.

      Subjects with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who are hyperkalemic
      (serum potassium [K+] > 5.0 mEq/L) while receiving treatment with renin angiotensin
      aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) medications or who are normokalemic (serum K+ 4.0 - 5.0
      mEq/L) but have a history of hyperkalemia in the 12 months prior to screening with subsequent
      reduction or discontinuation of a RAASi medication

      Each subject's participation includes a Run-in Phase (maximum 12 weeks) followed by the
      Treatment Phase (anticipated to be at least 6 months per subject). The study will continue
      until the required number of composite endpoint events have occurred. Study duration for
      individual subjects will vary, depending on the rate of occurrence of composite endpoint
      events. Given the assumptions underlying the study design, accumulation of the requisite
      number of composite endpoint events is expected to occur over approximately 2.5 years.
      Subjects who prematurely discontinue patiromer/placebo will remain in the study for the
      collection of composite endpoint event data and will receive usual care.
