      disease (HFMD) occurring in pediatric population. Although EV71 vaccine has been licensed in
      China, vaccine for CVA16-associated HFMD is currently not available anywhere. The purpose of
      this phase I study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of EV71/CVA16 bivalent
      vaccine in healthy adults.
