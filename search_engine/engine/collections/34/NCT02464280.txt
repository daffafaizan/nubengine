      expected value of this project is the definition of proven indications for tomosynthesis,
      which allow replacing CT. Specific goals are the early detection of pulmonary consolidations
      / parenchymal changes as well as the monitoring of patients with ostesynthetic implants.

      This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomised, non-blinded trial with Tomosyntheis of
      Patients referred to the investigators institution to assess lung alterations and bone
      structure. All patients will undergo chest x-ray and tomosynthesis after informed consent. In
      addition they will undergo an ultralow-dose CT, wich is used as standart reference. The
      radiation dose of each method will be recorded. After completion of these three examinations,
      the participation in the study is completed.
