      retinal blood flow after retinal stimulation by viewing commercially available content
      through the VISIOR video goggles.

      Both groups will undergo measurements of arterial blood pressure, cardiac pulse (heart rate),
      intraocular pressure, and retinal blood flow using Heidelberg retinal flowmetry (Heidelberg
      Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) at baseline and then ten minutes, thirty minutes, and sixty
      minutes after viewing commercially available content through the VISIOR video goggles for
      thirty minutes.
