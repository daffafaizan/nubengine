      1990 and 2013 in a single institution. We evaluate the recurrence free survival rate after
      surgical and medical treatment of patients with GCTB of the extremities to determine the
      influence of the surgical approach, denosumab therapy, local tumor presentation, and
      demographic factors on the risk of recurrence.
