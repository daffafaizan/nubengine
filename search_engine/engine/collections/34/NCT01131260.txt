      Fetal Heart Rate Monitoring (STAN):

      Fetal ECG analysis of the ST segment (STAN) is now FDA-approved and clinically available in
      the United States as an adjunct for the interpretation of electronic fetal heart rate
      patterns. There have been a number of randomized controlled trials as well as observational
      studies in Europe documenting utility of this modality in terms of reducing fetal acidosis at
      birth, and decreasing the need for operative vaginal delivery. However, despite these
      endorsements, there remain concerns with the application of the technology to the United
      States. None of the randomized trials were performed in the United States where patient
      case-mix and obstetrical practice, such as the use of fetal scalp pH, differ from Europe,
      which may affect the impact of this technology on perinatal outcomes. Moreover, the results
      of the European studies are not uniformly positive.

      This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial of the STAN technology as an adjunct to
      electronic fetal heart rate monitoring versus fetal heart rate monitoring alone.
