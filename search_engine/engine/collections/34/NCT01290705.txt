    
      Exercise therapy is widely used in the conservative treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome
      (PFPS), but there is still no consensus on recommending any specific rehabilitation program.

      This study evaluates two different therapeutic exercise regimens in patients with PFPS and
      their effect on pain at rest and function.

      Supervised exercise therapy will be applied in both groups three times a week over a 3-month
      period with individually tailored and graded exercise programs, differing between groups in
      terms of number of exercises, number of repetitions and sets, and time spent on performing
      aerobic exercises.
