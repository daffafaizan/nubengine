      regimens that have reached a therapeutic plateau. The selection of these regimens is
      completely empirical and physician dependent. Potential predictors of specific agent efficacy
      exist in the form of tumor molecular markers that are a reflection of the individual's
      genetic make up. Thus our study aims at utilizing these markers to more efficiently select
      the regimen in order to maximize the benefit to the patients rather than using empiric
      approaches. Fortunately, each of our selected regimens contains active and well-studied
      agents in the treatment of lung cancer (Table 1). This pilot study will help us determine the
      benefit, and safety of this approach (not individual regimen). The study is not to compare
      individual regimens but it aims at testing the whole concept of customization of chemotherapy
      based on molecular markers to help us in the future at selecting regimens based on these
      markers and not empirically. The results then will be used to determine more definitive
      future studies.

      Furthermore, circulating tumor cells in the blood represent the future distant metastases
      that result in disease progression to incurable stages. The circulating tumor cells have the
      ability to cross into vessels, travel in circulation, and exit the vessels into tissues where
      they have the capability to grow. Therefore, these cells may express different biological and
      molecular features from the stationary cells in the primary tumors. Therefore, exploiting
      these circulating tumor cells for augmenting treatment approaches is of vital importance and
      utility.
