      12 weeks before and 12 weeks after 8 weeks of acupuncture intervention. MIDAS, HIT-6 and
      BDI-II measurements will be done at the beginning of the study (12 weeks pre-intervention),
      directly before the intervention, directly after, and 12 weeks post-intervention.
      Measurements will be compared before and after intervention. This is a follow-up to a
      successful earlier study when these same acupuncture points were used on subjects with
      chronic daily headache, the majority being migraine.
