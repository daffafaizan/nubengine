      I. To evaluate 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) following treatment with rituximab
      intense dosing and CHOP-21 (RID-CHOP) in previously untreated patients with high risk
      (International Prognostic Index [IPI] 3-5) DLBCL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate, in previously untreated patients with high risk (IPI 3-5) DLBCL treated with
      rituximab intense dosing and CHOP-21: Complete response (CR) rate, (as defined by
      International Harmonization Project criteria using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG] -positron
      emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]).

      II. Overall survival.

      III. Toxicity profile.

      IV. Rituximab pharmacokinetics for this dose and schedule.

      V. Effect of immunophenotype of DLBCL on outcome.

      VI. Effect of Fc-Gamma Receptor III (FcyRIII) polymorphism genotype on outcome. OUTLINE:
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 0, 1, 4, 8, and 15 of course 1; days 1,
      8, and 15 of course 2; and day 1 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive CHOP
      chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine
      sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, annually for up to 10 years.
