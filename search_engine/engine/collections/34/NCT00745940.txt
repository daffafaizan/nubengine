      (TBI), and its treatment is difficult. A promising approach to treat depression is
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a relatively new therapeutic approach rooted in
      mindfulness-based stress-reduction (MBSR) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This
      multi-site, randomized, controlled trial of a MBCT intervention will examine the value of
      this intervention in improving quality of life and decreasing depression in people with TBI.
      MBCT may represent a time-limited, cost-effective group intervention through which clinicians
      would have an opportunity to address some of the most debilitating aspects of TBI.
