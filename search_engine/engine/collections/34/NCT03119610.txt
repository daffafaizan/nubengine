      sedentary subjects will be screened for sarcopenic obesity using a modified consensus
      definition and evaluated at baseline for safety labs, glucose tolerance, body composition,
      cognition and physical performance, as well as systemic inflammatory markers in blood and
      muscle tissue.

      Eligible subjects self-administer 24 IU intranasal oxytocin four times a day for 8 weeks.

      The study will examine whether the intervention will promote weight loss and preserve muscle
      mass, thereby preserving and/or improving physical function in older subjects with sarcopenic
      obesity.

      Generalized linear mixed effects model will be used to evaluate the effect of oxytocin on the
      change of each continuous measure. The effect of oxytocin will be assessed by whether the
      time by oxytocin interaction is significantly different from 0 with a 2-sided p-value<0.05.
