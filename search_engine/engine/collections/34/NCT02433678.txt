      be included in the study. One group will be randomized to dapagliflozin (a dose of 5 mg daily
      will be titrated to 10 mg daily during the first week) while the other will be placebo. The
      patients will be treated for 12 weeks. Only half the patients (equal numbers in both groups)
      will be tested for the secondary endpoints related to postprandial and single dose induced
      changes. The primary endpoint of the study is to detect a significant difference in the
      percent change in fasting Nuclear factor-k B (NFÎºB) activation (DNA binding activity) in
      mononuclear cells (MNC) before and after dapagliflozin use (0 week vs. 12 weeks) as compared
      to placebo.
