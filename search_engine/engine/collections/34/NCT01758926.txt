      local barrier function as determined by CLE of subjects with IBD versus controls. Despite
      discontinuities in the cellular layer, the intestinal barrier function is maintained during
      this high cell turnover rate at the apical pole of the epithelial layer. Gaps first
      identified in vivo through acriflavine have pivotal definitions (lacked nuclei or cytosol,
      appeared to be filled with an impermeable substance). However, Current endoscopic technology
      does not identify whether there is material present in human gaps, so investigators could not
      formally resolve whether human epithelial gaps compromise or defend the epithelial barrier.
