      pain and improving quality of life. But dislocation remains the leading early complication
      after total hip arthroplasty with a reported frequency between 0.4% and 11%. There are
      several risk factors of dislocation after total hip arthroplasty including patients, implants
      and surgical approaches. Among lots of risk factors, surgical approach has been debated as
      one of the important key factor influencing dislocation and abductor function. Direct lateral
      or posterolateral surgical approach is most commonly used in the total hip arthroplasty. The
      modified lateral approaches generally are thought to have lower dislocation rates and allow
      excellent acetabular exposure although limping is increased. The posterolateral approach may
      allow maintenance of abductor strength but it generally results in a higher dislocation rate.
      However, there are several reports that the posterolateral approach with capsular repair
      might be reduced dislocation rate.

      We hypothesize the dislocation rate for the posterolateral approach with capsular repair is
      similar to modified lateral approaches for total hip arthroplasty. A prospective,
      randomized-controlled study was to examine the null hypothesis that the dislocation rate for
      the posterior approach with capsular repair was similar to modified lateral approaches for
      total hip arthroplasty at up to 2 year followup. We attempted to determine whether there was
      a difference in surgical parameters, component positioning, and clinical results of the
      modified lateral approach compared with the posterolateral approach.
