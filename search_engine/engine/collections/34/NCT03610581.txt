      women with HPV types 16 or 18 infection, with a focus on early disease interception. The
      study consists of 3 periods: Screening period of up to 42 days (6 weeks), followed by prime
      and boost immunizations and follow-up visits up to 12 months after the first vaccination.
      Evaluation of the safety/reactogenicity of the vaccine regimens will include physical
      assessment by study-site personnel, participant reports on signs and symptoms and laboratory
      assessments following vaccinations. Immunogenicity and Virology/Histology assessments will
      also be performed.
