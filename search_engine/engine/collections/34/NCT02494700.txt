      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ultra low dose 4 Gray (Gy) orbital radiation, measured as
      local orbital control (i.e. local control within the radiation field), in patients with
      limited and advanced stage low grade B lymphocyte (B cell) lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma
      involving the ocular adnexa.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of ultra low dose 4 Gy orbital radiation, measured as complete
      response, in patients with limited and advanced stage low grade B cell lymphoma and mantle
      cell lymphoma involving the ocular adnexa.

      III. To evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of radiation to the orbit.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can predict response
      to ultra low dose radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo low dose orbital external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) on 2 consecutive
      days. Patients experiencing stable or progressive disease after 12-16 weeks of EBRT undergo
      additional low dose orbital EBRT over 10 fractions. Patients experiencing partial response or
      minimal response 1 year after EBRT also undergo low dose orbital EBRT over 10 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 6-8
      months, every 6-12 months for up to 2 years, and then periodically thereafter.
