      effects of technologically well-designed training masks used in athletes have been shown on
      hypoxia and heart rate responses during exercise, but there are no studies examining the
      exercise capacity and hemodynamic responses given to exercise in healthy normal
      individuals.This study is planned to evaluate the effects of the use of surgical masks that
      are widespread in the community due to pandemic on the exercise capacity and exercise
      responses (heart rate, blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, fatigue).

      Exercise tests will be carried out for each individual randomly, twice with a mask and
      without a mask. The materials used before and after each exercise test will be sterilized.
      During the exercise test, individual antibacterial filters will be used for each person.Bruce
      protocol will be used to determine exercise capacity.
