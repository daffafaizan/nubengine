      Phase will have 2 periods: Screening and Baseline. The Randomization Phase will consist of
      three 6-day long Treatment Periods with each Treatment Period separated by a 1-day long
      Baseline. Sixty participants will be evenly randomized to 1 of 6 possible treatment sequences
      (A, B, C, D, E, or F). The 3 treatments vary by the level of crystalline polymorph Type-C
      present in the drug product batch used in each arm, respectively: Treatment 1 - low Type-C
      crystal level less than 12%; Treatment 2 - reference Type-C crystal level 12% to 26%; and
      Treatment 3 - high Type-C crystal level greater than 26%.
