        -  overall survival

        -  event-free survival (events are defined as: death,non-engraftment/2nd transplant, immune
           reconstitution failure)

        -  acute toxicity of the conditioning regimen

        -  engraftment frequency immune reconstitution frequency and tempo acute and chronic
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), frequency and severity.

      The outcome from this protocol will be compared to the retrospective cohort consisting of all
      patients who have undergone haplo-identical HSCT for SCID at CHLA from 1984-2006 based on the
      assessment of the above-listed endpoints.

      The CliniMACS device will be used for CD34+ selection in place of the Isolex 300i. The
      CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System is an investigational medical device that has not yet been
      approved by the FDA. This device is used in vitro to select and enrich specific cell
      populations. When using the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent, the system selects CD34+ cells from
      heterogenous hematological cell populations for transplantation in cases where this is
      clinically indicated.
