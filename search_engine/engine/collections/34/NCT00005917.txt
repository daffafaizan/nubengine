      classical form by oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding diathesis, recurrent infection due to
      abnormal neutrophil and natural killer cell function, and often progression to a
      lymphohistiocytic infiltration known as the accelerated phase . Death generally occurs within
      the first decade as a result of infection or the development of the accelerated phase; bone
      marrow transplantation is curative except for the late occurrence of neurological
      deterioration. However, our research has identified mildly affected individuals who present
      primarily with a neurological phenotype characterized by central and peripheral nervous
      system involvement. In addition, classical cases treated with bone marrow transplant (BMT)
      and surviving into adulthood usually develop neurological symptoms adding relevance to the
      study of pathophysiology of this disease outside of the hematological and immune systems. The
      only gene known to be associated with CHS is LYST; however, there are some patients with CHS
      in whom mutations have not been found, suggesting locus heterogeneity. A genotype-phenotype
      correlation had begun to emerge, but recent reports noted exceptions to this correlation. The
      basic defect is unknown, although it probably involves abnormal fusion or trafficking of
      intracellular vesicles. With regards to neurologic involvement, LYST likely also plays a role
      in neuronal axonal transport and neurotransmitter pools. We plan to evaluate individuals with
      CHS clinically, biochemically, and molecularly, and perform cell biological studies on their
      fibroblasts, melanocytes, and transformed lymphoblasts. Routine admissions may be 3-5 days
      and may occur every one to two years, or as required by changes in clinical symptomatology.
