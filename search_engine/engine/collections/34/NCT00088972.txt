        -  Compare 1-year mammographic density in premenopausal women at high risk for developing
           breast cancer treated with celecoxib vs placebo.

        -  Compare 1-year proliferation of breast epithelial cells, as measured by Ki67 staining,
           in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare the expression of other biomarkers, including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme
           and a marker of apoptosis, in breast tissue of patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare 1-year plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF binding
           protein-3, and prostaglandin E_2 in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these drugs in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to risk category (lobular carcinoma in situ or ductal carcinoma in
      situ vs BRCA1/2 mutation AND any Gail risk vs Gail risk ≥1.7% but < 5% vs Gail risk ≥ 5%) and
      prior tamoxifen use (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Celocoxib: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.

        -  Placebo: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues
           for 12 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of cancer.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
