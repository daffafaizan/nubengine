      side, the tourniquet was inflated immediately before incision and deflated after the
      hardening of the cement. On the other side the tourniquet was inflated immediately before
      cement application and deflated after its hardening. Blood loss, operating time, transfusion
      rate, postoperative pain, limb swelling, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence and clinical
      outcomes were monitored for comparison.
