      status through imaging of calcium and glucose in skin fibroblasts. The investigator will
      obtain skin samples from patients in the Barnstable Brown Obesity and Diabetes Center at the
      University of Kentucky to test the hypothesis that calcium and glucose dysregulation are
      present in fibroblasts from patients with Type 2 diabetes, and are exaggerated in more
      difficult-to-treat patients or those with poor glucose control. The innovation of the project
      focuses on results that can potentially lead to earlier treatment for patients with diabetes
      and thereby reduce the risk for long-term complications.

      Three levels of analyses will be conducted to assess the relationship between Ca2+ and
      glucose homeostasis in four patient groups (lean non-diabetics, obese non-diabetics, Type 2
      Diabetics with good glucose control, and Type 2 Diabetics with poor control.

      Participants will be required to attend only one study visit that will last approximately 2-3
      hours. During the study subject will undergo the following: 1. Collection of two 4 ml tubes
      of blood for adiponectin analysis, 2. A skin biopsy, 3. Collection and review of medical
      history and current/past medication use 4. Collection of demographic information, 5. Height
      and weight measurement 6. Body mass index evaluation, 7. Vital signs assessment (blood
      pressure, pulse).

      Follow-up for all enrolled patients will occur on a yearly basis through a phone interview.

      The punch biopsy will be performed under local anesthesia.
