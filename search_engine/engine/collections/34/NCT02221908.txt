      CVP measurement, then this skill is worth being passed to physicians in training. Previously
      it was not possible gather enough information about the response of patients' because of the
      risk of using indwelling CVP sensors. But now because there is a low risk tool (Venus 1000
      System), this study is now practical and safe.
