    
      Global, multicenter, Phase 2b, open-label extension study of subjects with AL amyloidosis who
      had a hematologic response to first-line treatment for their amyloidosis (e.g., chemotherapy,
      autologous stem cell transplant [ASCT]) and completed Study NEOD001-201. Subjects in this
      study may receive concomitant chemotherapy. Subject screening will occur during the 28 days
      prior to the first administration of study drug, which may overlap with the last visit in
      Study NEOD001-201. If all eligibility requirements are met, the subject will be enrolled and
      Screening assessments will be completed. Study visits will occur every 28 days based on
      scheduling from Month 1 Day 1. A ±5-day window is allowed for visits starting after Month 1.
      Subjects who discontinue study drug before the End of Study Visit (EOS) should have an Early
      Treatment Discontinuation Visit 30 (±5) days after their final administration of study drug.
      Each subject's study participation may be up to 38 months or until the study is terminated,
      whichever occurs first. The study consists of a Screening Phase (1 month), Treatment Phase
      (36 months), and EOS Visit (30 [±5] days after the last dose).
