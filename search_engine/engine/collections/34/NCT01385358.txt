      thoracoscopically assisted, surgical ablation strategies using a case control design.

      The study population will be patients between the ages of 18 and 80 with symptomatic
      long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (≥1≤5 years) and good left ventricular function
      where at least one anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) has failed, or where such drugs are
      contraindicated or not tolerated.

      Thoracoscopically Assisted Surgical Ablation Group Patients assigned to this group will
      undergo minimally invasive, thoracoscopically assisted, surgical ablation to isolate the
      pulmonary veins (PVI) using a radiofrequency (RF) clamp device. This will include
      ganglionated plexi ablation +/- LAA excision/exclusion.

      Catheter Ablation Group Patients will undergo pulmonary vein isolation, linear and
      electrogram based ablation.

      Recurrences Only one redo procedure is allowed for atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrences in the
      12 month follow-up period.
