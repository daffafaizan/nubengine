      Posturography (CDP) testing using the modified Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in
      Balance (mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects will be required to stand on a hard or compliant
      surface (a 4" tall foam cushion of known mechanical properties) in a comfortable posture,
      feet shoulder width, with eyes open or closed, head straight and arms to the side and free to
      move, gazing forward, and breathing normally. Immediately prior to the CDP testing, subjects
      will have their heart rate, blood pressure and pulse Ox measured. These will constitute the
      baseline information.

      Subjects will then be divided into two groups: the isometric exercise group (they will be
      instructed to perform specific isometric exercises three times a week, for the next 8 weeks)
      and the control group (no exercises will be prescribe to them).

      The same testing procedure indicated above will be followed at the end of the 8 weeks. The
      mental speed test, CDP testing, heart rate, blood pressure and pulse Ox will constitute the
      follow-up information.
