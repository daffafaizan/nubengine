      develop surgical approaches to augment it. The majority of them, are described as bilaminar
      techniques obtaining a subephitelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) from the palate (P).
      However, recent studies have demonstrated that tuberosity (T) tissue is a very dense and
      coarse tissue that seems to contain more collagen and less fat and glandular tissue than that
      from the P, and therefore may have better tissue qualities for soft tissue augmentation, but
      there is limited scientific evidence comparing these areas.

      The main goal of this study is to compare the soft tissue volume gain and stability around
      implants in cases where a SCTG of the same dimensions from the P or T is used randomly. To
      calculate volume changes and stability an intraoral optical scan is used and
      three-dimensional images superimposed.

      The secondary goal is to compare histologically both tissues and changes in clinical
      parameters. Histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry evaluating levels of Type I-III
      collagen, long lysyl hydroxylase, matrix metalloproteinase 1-2, and monoclonal antibody
      against cytokeratin 4-10-13 is performed.
