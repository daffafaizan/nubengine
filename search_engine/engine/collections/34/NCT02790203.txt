      patients, with a significant clinical and economical effect.

      Many preventative measures have been tested to promote gastrointestinal motility following
      intestinal surgery have been suggested.

      The medical intervention in the proposed study includes administration of a selective COX-2
      inhibitor, specifically Celecoxib, in the peri-operative period following an elective colon
      resection. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory,
      analgesic, and antipyretic therapeutic effects.

      The drug is approved for use in by the ministry of health in Israel and in the United states.
      The study aims to assess the use of this widely used medication for evaluation of the
      clinical effect on post-operative bowel transit, as well as the drugs' effect on
      post-operative pain.
