      Diverter (Surpass System) in the endovascular treatment of large or giant wide-necked
      intracranial aneurysms in the internal carotid artery up to the terminus. The Surpass Flow
      Diverter is an intracranial implant designed to be placed in a parent artery so as to divert
      blood flow away from an aneurysm. Use of the Surpass System may be associated with a decrease
      in neurological death or ipsilateral stroke in patients with large or giant wide-neck
      aneurysms. In a given patient, the Surpass System will be deemed effective if treatment
      results in complete occlusion of their aneurysm without clinically significant stenosis of
      the parent artery, or requires retreatment of the aneurysm through 12 months.
