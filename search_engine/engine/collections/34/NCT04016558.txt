    
      Diabetes Distress (DD) is the personal, often hidden side of diabetes: it reflects the unique
      emotional burdens and strains that individuals with diabetes may experience as they struggle
      to keep blood glucose levels within range. When high, DD can have a major, negative impact on
      disease management and glycemic control. High DD is characterized by frustration, feeling
      overwhelmed, and feeling hopeless and discouraged by the unceasing demands of diabetes. DD is
      also linked to an individual's beliefs, expectations, current life situation, and personal
      and social resources.

      The proposed study is a three-arm, 12-month randomized comparison trial to test the added
      value of a DD-targeted (TunedIn) intervention vs. a unified DD and management intervention
      (FixIt), relative to a traditional, educational/behavioral-management intervention
      (StreamLine). Each of the three programs (arms) will follow a separate, standardized
      protocol. All participants will receive three months of intervention with nine months of
      follow-up.
