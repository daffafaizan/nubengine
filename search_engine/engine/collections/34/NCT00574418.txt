      generally oval in shape and often highly vascular. On MR imaging exams, uterine fibroids are
      easily identifiable. They occur in 20-25% of women of reproductive age and can cause a
      variety of problems generally described as either bleeding or mass effects from the fibroid.

      We are postulating that energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the uterus will shrink
      the benign tumors.
