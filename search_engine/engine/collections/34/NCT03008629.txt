      were included. Investigators divide patients to 3 group: (1) combiped group: Participants
      with non-infected or mild infected ingrown nail, combiped nail brace was applied instantly.20
      patients(2) combine combiped and podofix group: Participants with severe paronychia with
      pyogenic granuloma, oral analgesics and antibiotics were prescribed first and nail brace was
      applied 1 week later. Depends on disease condition, investigators applied 1-2 combiped nail
      brace. If the pyogenic granuloma is not resolved after 1 week, investigators applied podofix
      first for 2-4 weeks and then combiped nail brace. After the nail brace applied, participants
      must come back between 2-4 weeks depends on disease condition.10 patients (3) podofix group:
      participants who are afraid of combiped implantation, or with mild recurrence will be applied
      with podofix.

      assessment (0-6),Patient global assessment (VAS 0-10), Treatment satisfaction (VAS 0-10), and
