    
      Study AV-45-A11 is designed to determine if brain amyloid aggregation imaged on 18F-AV-45 PET
      scans is predictive of progression of cognitive impairment during the subsequent 36 months.
      Approximately 180 subjects enrolled in a prior clinical study (AV-45-A05[NCT00702143]) will
      be offered an opportunity to be studied under this protocol. The initial visit will occur as
      soon as possible following the AV-45-A05(NCT00702143) imaging day. Subjects who qualify for
      the study and their caregiver/partners will be contacted approximately 6,12,18,24 and 36
      months after PET imaging in study AV-45-A05(NCT00702143), and will undergo a standardized
      functional and psychometric evaluation.

      NOTE: This study is a clinical follow-up of subjects previously enrolled in trial
      18F-AV-45-A05(NCT00702143). No new patients are being enrolled in this trial.
