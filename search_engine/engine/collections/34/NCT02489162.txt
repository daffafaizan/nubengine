      diagnosis and monitoring of neuromuscular recovery is limited to clinical examination,
      electromyography (EMG) and electroneurography (ENoG). EMG and ENoG is invasive for the
      patient and has practical and cost disadvantages. The MyotonPRO is a handheld device, which
      is pain-free and quick to use. Therefore this research is assessing MyotonPRO technology for
      this clinical application and may be effective at evaluating rehabilitative and surgical
      interventions. Phase 1 - Variation of measurements Phase 2 - Mimic muscle dysfunction
      assessment Phase 3 - Peri-operative Mimic and temporalis muscle assessment Phase 4 - Phase 3
      including electromyography Phase 5 - Temporalis and mimic muscle assessment following facial
      reanimation surgery
