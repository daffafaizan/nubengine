      (separated by a week). The three treatments include control (no supplement), carbohydrates -
      protein (Generation UCAN supplement, 250ml, 10% solution) and carbohydrates alone (Mirexus
      PhytoSpherix, 250ml, 10% solution). Participants will report to the lab between 4-5 pm and 4
      hours after their last meal on day they have not exercised. Participants will record food
      intake the day of the first experiment and will be asked to replicate both type and quantity
      for subsequent visits. Upon arrival at the lab, baseline measures (blood glucose as well as
      rating of satiety ratings, appetite and desire to eat (10-point visual analogue scale). Then
      the treatment will be given and all the aforementioned variables will be remeasured at 15,
      30, 45 and 60 minutes post drink. At 65 minutes, participants will be provided with an ad
      libitum pizza meal. Participants will be told to eat until they are "comfortably full"
      (Bellissimo et al., 2008). The pizza provided will be weighed initially and once the
      participant is done eating and has left the lab, the remaining pizza will be weighed and
      recorded. The pizza will be a cheese only pizza to minimize any difference in energy intake
      due to the location of additional items placed on the pizza.

      Participants will not be told the true purpose of this experiment, instead they will be told
      that the pizza meal is a reward for participating in the study. Later, at the conclusion of
      the study all will be debriefed.
