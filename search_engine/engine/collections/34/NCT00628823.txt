      with crypt hyperplasia (Marsh III). However, the mucosal damage develops gradually and the
      patients may have clinical symptoms and endomysial antibodies before the development of
      villous atrophy.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the natural history of gluten sensitivity in
      endomysial antibody positive adults with celiac disease suspicion, who were found to have a
      only mild enteropathy (Marsh I-II) in the small-bowel mucosa. We hypothesize that these
      subject are indeed gluten-sensitive, as measured by clinical, serological and histological
      indicators. If this would be the case, the current diagnostic criteria for celiac disease
      might need re-evaluation.
