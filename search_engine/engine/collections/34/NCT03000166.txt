      receiving chemotherapy, but no studies have tested a physical activity intervention to
      improve fatigue in young adults receiving chemotherapy. This study will determine the impact
      of a physical activity intervention on the self-management process variables of self-efficacy
      and self-regulation and their relationships to physical activity and fatigue severity in
      young adults receiving chemotherapy.
