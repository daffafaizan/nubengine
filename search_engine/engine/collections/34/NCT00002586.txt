        -  To determine if alpha tocopherol can reduce the toxicities of low dose 13-cis retinoic
           acid administered for one year.

        -  To access the adequacy of the collected specimens for studies of intermediate endpoint
           markers.

        -  to establish a depository of biologic specimens for future studies of new biomarkers.

             -  Arm 1: Patients receive oral 13-cis retinoic acid daily.

             -  Arm 2: Patients receive oral 13-cis retinoic acid and oral vitamin E daily.

             -  Arm 3: Patients undergo observation only. Treatment continues in arms I and II for
                1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (33 Arm 1, 33 Arm 2, and 34 Arm 3) will be accrued
      for this study within 3 years.
