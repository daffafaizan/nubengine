        -  Compare changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with stage II
           prostate cancer up to 2 years after treatment with radical prostatectomy or
           brachytherapy.

        -  Compare the effect of baseline HRQOL, age, and other covariates on HRQOL improvement or
           deterioration in these patients up to 10 years after these treatments.

        -  Compare the effect of treatment modality on HRQOL improvement or deterioration in these
           patients up to 10 years after these treatments.

        -  Compare the effects of treatment failure on HRQOL, in terms of disease progression, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms on ACOSOG-Z0070 (radical prostatectomy vs
      brachytherapy).

      Patients in both arms complete a quality of life questionnaire at baseline, 2 and 6 months
      after treatment, and then at 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 years after treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (250 per group) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.
