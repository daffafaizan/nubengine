      trials. It may be preferable, however, to avoid the stent-in-stent approach in treating
      in-stent restenosis (ISR). In prior animal trials, we demonstrated a highly significant
      reduction of neointimal formation by drug-eluting balloon catheters (DEB). The aim of the
      PACCOCATH ISR study is to investigate the novel DEB in the treatment of ISR.

      Methods and results: The PACCOCATH ISR study is a randomized, double-blind German multicenter
      trial on the efficacy and tolerance of the DEB in coronary ISR. Patients are randomized to
      rePTCA of ISR either using the coated PTCA balloon (3 µg paclitaxel/mm² balloon surface) or a
      non-coated balloon of the same type (n=56 patients). Balloon inflation time is 60 seconds in
      both cases. Major inclusion criteria are an ISR in a coronary artery with a diameter stenosis
      of at least 70%, < 30 mm length, and a vessel diameter of 2.5 to 3.5 mm. The primary endpoint
      is late lumen loss after 6 months (independent angiographic core lab). Secondary endpoints
      are binary restenosis rate and major adverse cardiac events.
