      the fatal complications. Oral anticoagulation has been the mainstay therapy for decades to
      mitigate stroke risk. However, in poor candidates for long-term anticoagulation
      non-pharmacological stroke prevention with percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion
      (LAAO) is a considerable treatment option. LAA shape and size varies widely and incomplete
      LAA closure or new leaks, due to LAA remodeling after the procedure, are observed in up to
      30% of patients. Those leaks may cause turbulent flow and increase the risk for thrombus
      formation and subsequent thromboembolic events. However, the clinical significance after
      percutaneous LAAO has yet to be determined.

      If significant leaks are present, patients usually remain on oral anticoagulation. In very
      few cases, an interventional approach is used to close peri-device leaks.

      This is the first systematic study, trying to include a respectable number of patients who
      underwent peri-device leakage closure after LAAO. In this multi-center, collaborative study
      the investigators aim to identify different peri-device leak closure strategies with
      associated clinical outcomes and evaluate safety and feasibility of the procedure.
