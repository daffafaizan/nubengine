      two or every four weeks and will be assigned a dose of picoplatin dependent on the study
      results to date. Each patient will also receive therapy every two weeks with 5-FU and
      leucovorin. In each schedule, the cohort size will be 3 subjects, to be expanded to 6
      subjects if a dose-limiting toxicity is observed. If not dose-limiting toxicity observed
      among the 3 subjects within a cohort, picoplatin dose escalation may proceed, until the
      maximum tolerated dose is established.
