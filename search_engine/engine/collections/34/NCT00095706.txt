      aggressive behavior of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers is due in part to increased
      angiogenesis resulting from HER2-induced increases in vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) expression. In vivo experiments suggest that combined blockade of the HER2 receptor
      and VEGF results in superior anti-tumor efficacy compared with either treatment alone.

      The current clinical trial, for which the phase I portion has been completed, will examine
      the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) in
      the treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.
