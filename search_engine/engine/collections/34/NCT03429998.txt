    
      STUDY DESIGN An open-label, prospective phase III study to compare the efficacy and safety of
      administering evolocumab versus treatment with LDLapheresis in patients with familial
      hypercholesterolemia and high cardiovascular risk.

      STUDY POPULATION The chosen population is constituted by patients belonging to the
      LDL-apheresis program of the General University Hospital Gregorio Marañón with the diagnosis
      of familial hypercholesterolemia and a history of cardiovascular disease.

      Number of patients expected to participate in the study according to the base of patients
      treated with LDL-apheresis: 10.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Non-controlled intervention study to evaluate the different therapies in the treatment of
      hypercholesterolemia, in which each patient will be self-controlled. The variables will be
      analyzed during different phases

        1. LDL-apheresis phase: Retrospectively during the previous year, pre- and postapheresis
           variables will be collected from the following lipid parameters: total cholesterol,
           LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, atherogenicity index, Lipoprotein A,
           apo-A, apo- B; inflammatory parameters: PCR, ferritin, fibrinogen, leukocytes and
           polymorphonuclear and immunological parameters: immunoglobulins and complement.

        2. Evolocumab phase: LDL-apheresis will be suspended for three months and Evolocumab
           administered: 140 mg / 15 days subcutaneously. The same parameters indicated in the
           previous section will be measured every two weeks.

        3. Combined phase: During the following three months evolocumab will continue to be
           administered biweekly and the LDL-apheresis procedure will be spaced from biweekly to
           monthly, the same analytical parameters being measured again every two weeks.
