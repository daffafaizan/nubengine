      mass drug administrations to the standard-policy malaria control measures in the Sahel
      (seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children, maximum long-lasting insecticidal net
      coverage, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy), for reducing the incidence of
      uncomplicated malaria episodes in enrolled village children (≤ 10 years of age) assessed by
      active case surveillance. The investigators will also examine the safety of the intervention,
      as well as entomological and parasitological endpoints. This is a double-blind, cluster
      randomized trial in that will occur in villages in southwestern Burkina Faso over two
      consecutive rainy seasons. For the intervention, mass administration of ivermectin or placebo
      will be given monthly over 4 months of each rainy season to the eligible village population,
      each as 3-day course of 300 µg/kg/day. These mass drug administrations will occur
      simultaneously with the distribution of seasonal malaria chemoprevention drugs on the same
      monthly schedule to eligible children aged 3-59 months.
