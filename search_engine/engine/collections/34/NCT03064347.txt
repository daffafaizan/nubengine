      circulating levels of some glucose and appetite regulating hormones when compared to usual
      oral ingestion. Such an enhancement could be of value in the management of type 2 diabetes
      and obesity. In this study enteric-coated nutrients will be ingested to allow for direct
      delivery of nutrient to the upper intestine. Levels of select hormones and glucose, and
      measures of satiety and adverse effects will be compared following the ingestion of uncoated
      and enteric coated nutrient.
