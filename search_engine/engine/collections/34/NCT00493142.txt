      functional endpoints after surgery. Therapeutic exercise improves function in patients with
      arthritis of the knee, yet little evidence has examined the impact of pre-operative exercise
      for TKA.

      Single blinded randomized clinical trial comparing a pre-operative home exercise program to
      pre-operative usual care for patients who are waiting for TKA.Comparison group is usual care
      within the health region which does not include pre-operative rehabilitation program.

      Primary outcome: WOMAC function subscale. Secondary outcomes: 1) quality of life; 2)
      ambulation; 3) self-efficacy; 4) anxiety; 5) patient satisfaction; 6) cost-effectiveness of
      this intervention.

      Total Enrollment: 230 patients

      If the intervention improves function prior to surgery, results will be clinically applicable
      for patients waiting for surgery
