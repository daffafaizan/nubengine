      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) with the combination of MLN8237 and
      bortezomib. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicities associated with the combination of
      MLN8237 and bortezomib. (Phase I) III. To evaluate the overall response rate to the
      combination of MLN8237 and bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess progression-free survival in patients treated with this combination. (Phase II)

      II. To assess overall survival in patients treated with this combination.(Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study followed by a phase II study. Patients
      receive oral aurora kinase inhibitor MLN8237 once daily on days 1-14 and bortezomib IV on
      days 1, 4, 8 and 11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment all patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and
      then every 3 months for 1 year.
