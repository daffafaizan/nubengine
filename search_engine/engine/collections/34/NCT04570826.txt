      allocation of participants into intervention (n = 18) or control group (n = 17). Due to
      ethical reasons, it was not possible to randomize the patients.

      The investigators invited from different associations in Granada city and its province
      through word and mouth or by telephone to 45 volunteer informal caregivers. 40 of them
      enrolled in this study but only 37 finalized the program, 24.3% male and 75.7% female with a
      mean (SD) age of 44.03 (7.30) years. The people that have previous experience in mind body
      practices or cardiovascular diseases were excluded. All the caregivers received information
      about the study and informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study was
      approved by the CEI-GR (C-9) ethics committee and followed the principles of the Declaration
      of Helsinki. Convenience sampling was used to assign caregivers to the control or
      experimental groups.
