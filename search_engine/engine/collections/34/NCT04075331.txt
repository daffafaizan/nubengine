      of which a proportion are driven by eosinophilic inflammation. Whilst oral corticosteroids
      are beneficial in exacerbations, a considerable proportion of patients experience treatment
      failure, with 50% of patients readmitted within 3 months (www.RCPLondon.ac.uk).

      Therapy, such as mepolizumab, reduces eosinophil count and has been shown to reduce
      exacerbation frequency when given in the stable state in both eosinophilic asthma (Papi et
      al. 2018) and COPD (Yousef, in press).

      The investigators hypothesise that starting mepolizumab at the time of a hospitalisation for
      an exacerbation of COPD in patients with significant eosinophilia will result in a reduction
      in readmission to hospital in a high risk population.

      Therefore, 238 participants will be recruited over an 18-month period and will be randomised
      into a 48-week treatment period in which they will receive monthly subcutaneous injections of
      either 100 mg mepolizumab or placebo. Secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline (week
      0), 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 48 weeks.
