      tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells and a biodegradable carrier for highly effective
      treatment and prevention of scarring and adhesions in the uterus acquired as a result of
      cesarean section or chronic inflammatory processes in the uterine mucosa and fallopian tubes;
      to conduct the clinical trials of the biomedical cell product in the treatment of uterus
      scarring and infertility in women.
