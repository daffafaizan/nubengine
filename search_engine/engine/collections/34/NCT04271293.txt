      antagonists (VKA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

      The 2018 EHRA/ESC practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
      affirmed that "data have shown that administration in a crushed form (e.g. via a nasogastric
      tube), does not alter the bioavailability for apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban". However,
      at the moment, there are no evidences supporting unequivocally the use of DOAC via
      Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

      PEG is a method developed throughout the early 1980s for patients who need long-term enteral
      nutrition due to neurodegenerative, neuromuscular and oncological diseases. This class of
      patients is expected to increase significantly in the next decade.

      Several studies have proven the safety of DOAC compared to VKA even recommending to prefer
      DOAC over VKA wherever possible in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. However, there is no evidence to support
      unequivocally the use of DOAC in patients fed PEG.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Edoxaban administered
      through PEG in patients with an indication of anticoagulation according to the current
      clinical practice.
