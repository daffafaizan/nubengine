      Patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, undifferentiated
      oligoarthritis, monarthritis) suffer from recurrent pain, functional impairment and impaired
      capacity. Consequences of such hard to treat diseases are occupational incapacity and early
      retirement. The treatment options we have today such as nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs
      (NSAIDs such as diclofenac), glucocorticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) and disease modifying
      antirheumatic drugs (such as methotrexate) partly are effective but also have serious side
      effects and complications (e.g. gastric and duodenal ulcers, nephrotoxicity, degeneration of
      cartilage, cushing´s syndrome…).

      A new therapeutic approach without such complications is represented by the intraarticular
      (i.a.) application of low-concentrated, systemically inactive dosages of an opioid (e.g.
      morphine). This treatment showed a significant reduction of pain in patients with chronic
      arthritis in controlled clinical trials without systemic or local side effects [1, 2]. This
      effect is based on an activation of peripheral opioid receptors, which could be identified on
      peripheral nerve endings of sensoric neurons [3-5]. The activation of these opioid receptors
      leads to a decrease of neuronal excitability and the transmission of noziceptive impulses as
      well as to a reduced release of proinflammatory neurotransmitters (e.g. substance p) [6].
      Several studies showed that locally applied opioids act analgetic, that such analgetic
      effects mainly occur in inflamed tissue, that the analgetic effects increase with the degree
      of inflammation and that peripherally acting opioids act analgetic [6-9]. In human beings the
      analgetic effect of peripherally applied opioid agonists has almost only been shown in
      patients with acute post-surgical pain [4, 10-15]. In a first case report [16] we found
      indices for the analgetic effect of i.a. given morphine in patients with chronic arthritic
      pain. In patients with osteoarthritis a double blind cross-over study it was shown that 1mg
      morphine leads to a long-lasting analgetic effect up to 9 days [1]. In a second controlled
      trial we compared patients with chronic joint inflammation in different diseases in regards
      of the analgetic effect of i.a. morphine (3 mg) versus placebo versus a standard therapy with
      i.a. dexamethasone (4 mg) [2]. Dexamethasone as well as morphine lead to a significant pain
      reduction under rest and under strain compared to placebo. This analgetic effect lasted up to
      6 days after injection. Moreover we found first indications for an anti-inflammatory effect
      as the number of inflammatory cells in the synovial fluid was reduced after the i.a. morphine
      application [2].

      In addition to the question whether morphine can stimulate local peripheral opioid receptors,
      it should be investigated, whether intraarticular morphine has an anti-inflammatory local
      effect in arthritis of the knee in the setting of inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as
      rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, undifferentiated oligoarthritis or monarthritis
      (17, 19, 31). This question should be answered through investigation of cellular infiltration
      and cytokine expression in the synovial membrane and synovial fluid.

      Next to the exogenous application of opioids also endogenous opioid peptides play an
      important role in inflammatory processes. Experimental and clinical investigations show an
      expression of opioid peptides in immune cells, which invade into inflamed tissue [3, 4, 6,
      20, 21]. Under certain circumstances these opioid peptides are locally released and unfold a
      strong analgetic effect through the activation of opioid receptors on peripheral sensoric
      nerve endings [22-24]. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) can release - similar as in the
      hypophysis- opioid peptides from immune cells [25-28]. CRF receptors are located in
      regionally invaded immune cells, and the number is up regulated among inflammatory cells.
      [29]. Experimental investigations from our or other groups showed a significant analgetic
      effect of local CRF which was given into the inflamed tissue [24, 26, 30].

      In this study we want to test the hypothesis, that i.a. applied CRF leads to a reduction of
      pain intensity and pain duration in patients with inflammatory knee trauma. Initially this
      effect is to be tested in acute and then - if successful- in chronic knee pain.

      Background for dosage

      The intraarticular application of morphine 3mg and dexamethasone 4 mg respectively has turned
      out from previous studies (2, 15) in patients with inflammatory knee joints of different
      causes, without evidence of relevant systemic side effects.

      Background for patient selection:

      Several patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,
      spondyloarthropathies, undifferentiated oligoarthritis or monarthritis suffer from
      symptomatic knee arthritis despite intake of disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) or systemic low
      dose glucocorticosteroids. To achieve a adequate comparability of the different drugs a
      patient number of 20 for each group seems to be sufficient. Patients are supposed to have
      arthritis of the knee and a sufficient pain intensity according to the visual analogue scale
      for pain > 30 mm. Patients will be seen in the rheumatology department of the Klinikum
      Benjamin-Franklin, Berlin, Germany as well as in the Immanuel-Krankenhaus, Berlin, Germany
      examined. Arthroscopies will only take place in the rheumatology department of the Klinikum
      Benjamin-Franklin, Berlin, Germany.
