      functionality. However, when there is access, it causes changes in the hands and changes the
      motor in relation to the force and range of motion, or generates changes in activities of
      daily living. Thus, a system with 5 devices, where each one the devices were prints in
      three-dimensional, and instrumented with force sensor for static-dynamic force analysis e
      potentiometer for analysis range of motion, during the execution of movements cylindrical
      grip, spherical grip, hook grip, pulp-pulp pinch, and pulp- side pinch in different
      activities of daily living. Elaborated a data storage interface through MATLABÂ® software that
      allows recording the data of each device. For the system functionality tests, 30 volunteers
      were selected for both sexes, young adults between 20 and 39 years old, students of the
      Physiotherapy and Graduate courses of the University of Mogi das Cruzes. The tests are
      divided into two sessions and are repeated after 7 days of the first test
