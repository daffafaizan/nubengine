    
      Primary Objectives: A pilot Study to evaluate the feasibility, safety and tolerability of a
      two day course per cycle of Bendamustine plus CPI-613 in patients with relapsed and
      refractory T cell non-hodgkin lymphoma.

      Exploratory Objectives

      To evaluate:

        -  Overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) derived from the Lugano
           classification.

        -  Duration of response (DOR) derived from the Lugano classification.

        -  Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) derived from Lugano classification.

        -  Overall Survival (OS).

        -  Single cell transcriptomics from PMBCs pre- and post-treatment; for correlative analyses
           of blood PBMC (and possibly excess pre-treatment tumor biopsy) cell population diversity
           and functional states to reveal potential mechanisms of drug treatment with regard to
           patient response status.
