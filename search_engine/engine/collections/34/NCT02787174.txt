      best design the intervention. This has helped us create the questions that are being used in
      the intervention, and make the computer program appealing and acceptable to parents of
      children with asthma.

      The investigators will study the success of the intervention for children who receive it
      compared to children who obtain routine emergency department care. Participants who receive
      the intervention will complete a series of questions on a tablet computer. Questions will
      guide creation of individualized education and advice to improve medication use for each
      participant. The intervention will also allow for customized communication with each child's
      primary care provider. The investigators will include educational boosters at 2 and 4 weeks
      after the intervention delivered as chosen by the participant (email / text / RSS / mail).
      Children in the routine asthma care arm will not receive the intervention, and instead will
      receive routine discharge instructions by the emergency room doctors.

      The investigators will compare the success of the intervention group to routine emergency
      department care by using a device (DOSER CT) that measures daily administered doses of
      medicine. Data from the DOSER CT will be collected monthly at home visits for three months.
      The investigators will also measure health care use and quality-of-life for each child using
      a survey at these home visits. The investigators believe that the intervention will improve
      doses of medicine given, reduce unnecessary health care use, and improve children's quality
      of life.
