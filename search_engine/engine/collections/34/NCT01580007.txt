      phenylbutyrate and vitamin D3 therapy daily for 2 months in newly diagnosed sputum smear
      positive pulmonary TB patients. The clinical trial will take place in the National Institute
      of the Diseases of the Chest and Hospital (NIDCH) in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

      Our specific aims are:

      Objective 1: To determine the optimal oral dose of PBA required for induction of
      antimicrobial peptide in macrophages from healthy adults.

      Objective 2

      The second aim of this study is to determine whether adjunctive sodium phenylbutyrate and
      vitamin D treatment (for 2 months) of newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients:

        1. Can improve response to standard short course TB therapy towards a rapid recovery
           (clinical, radiological, mycobacterial).

        2. Can induce expression of LL-37 in macrophages (immunological).

        3. Can enhance killing capacity of macrophages from TB patients infected in vitro with MTB
           (functional measures of treatment outcome).

      Study Design: The study will be a randomized, double blind (Subject, Caregiver, Investigator,
      Outcomes Assessor), placebo control trial for 2 months. It will also be a safety and efficacy
      phase III study. The study will have a 4x4 factorial design with 4-cell interventions.
      Enrolled patients will be randomized into the following four treatment arms in a 1:1:1:1
      ratio:

      Group 1: PBA Group 2: Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) Group 3: PBA plus vitamin D3 Group 4:
      Placebo
