      enrollment, muscle soreness was induced and participants were subsequently randomized to
      receive either (1) focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Verum), (2) sham shock wave
      (Sham) or (3) no treatment (Control). Thereafter, treatments were administered once, only.
      Measures were repeated after the treatment and at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Main outcome parameter
      was the pain intensity at rest and in movement as assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) in
      the elbow region of the non-dominant arm. Secondary outcome included the pressure pain
      threshold (PPT) over the biceps muscle belly, the maximum isometric voluntary force (MIVF) of
      the elbow flexors and the assessing the impairment of activities of the daily living.
      Participants were followed-up 72 hours after the induction of Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness.
