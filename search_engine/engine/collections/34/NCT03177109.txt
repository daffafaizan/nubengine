      applied desensitizing agents in the reduction of dentine hypersensitivity over a period of 4
      weeks. Patients presenting to the dental clinic with Dentine hypersensitivity and fulfilling
      the inclusion criteria will be included in the study after taking informed consent.
      Participants will be divided into three groups. Sixty eligible subjects will be recruited
      into 3 study treatment groups (n=20 per group) through computerized randomization. Subjects
      in group 1 will be treated with 8% arginine containing paste(Colgate® Sensitive Pro-Relief™),
      group 2 with 5% topical fluoride varnish (Acclean) and group 3 with self-adhesive resin (Seal
      and protect, Dentsply). the subjects in the study will be evaluated for tactile and air-blast
      hypersensitivity criteria at baseline, two and at four weeks by another dentist who would be
      a blind assessor.
