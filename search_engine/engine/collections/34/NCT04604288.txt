    
      Once eligibility has been confirmed, the subject will return approximately 14 days later for
      a single autologous HB-asMSC intra-articular injection in the left hip with 100 million
      (1x10⌃8) cells/2ml. At this visit, the following procedures will occur:

        -  A verification of patient consent will be verbally performed

        -  Review of medical history, and concomitant medications.

        -  Physical examination.

        -  Vital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)

        -  Weight measurement

        -  Blood samples will be collected for baseline efficacy laboratory assessments:

        -  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-Reactive Protein.

           •. A "time-out" verification of patient/consent/procedure/cell product will be performed
           prior to intra-articular injection.

        -  Baseline Pain assessments, Index of Severity and Disability scoring will be obtained at
           this visit.

        -  Adverse events monitoring The subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 1hr after
           the investigational product administration.

      Forty-eight hours (2 days) after the intra-articular injection, the subject will return for a
      single autologous intravenous infusion of 2 x10⌃8 cells infused over 1 hour at 250mL/hr. The
      patient will be closely monitored during the infusion and for a minimum of 1 hour after. At
      this visit, the following procedures will occur:

        -  A verification of patient consent will be verbally performed.

        -  Review of medical history, and concomitant medications.

        -  Physical examination

        -  Vital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)

        -  Weight measurement

        -  Patient pain assessment - Visual Analog Scale.

        -  During this visit a video recording will be made with the purpose to capture patient's
           overall status (gait, range of motion assessments, etc.).

        -  Adverse events monitoring

      Follow-up visits will occur at weeks 4 and 12. At these visits, the following procedures will
      occur:

        -  Review and update of medical history

        -  Update concomitant medications list

        -  Weight measurement

        -  Vital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)

        -  Physical examination

        -  Blood samples will be collected:

      Hematology Chemistry Coagulation Panel Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-Reactive Protein.

        -  Patient pain assessment - Visual Analog Scale

        -  Index of Severity for Osteoarthritis of the Hip by Lequesne et al.

        -  WOMAC Survey Form

        -  ICOAP: Measure of Intermittent and Constant OA Pain

        -  During this visit a video recording will be made with the purpose to capture patient's
           overall status (gait, range of motion assessments, etc.).

        -  Adverse Events Monitoring

      The End of Study Visit will occur at week 26. At this visit, the following procedures will
      occur:

        -  Review and update of medical history

        -  Update concomitant medications list

        -  Weight measurement
