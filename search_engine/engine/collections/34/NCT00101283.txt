      Primary

        -  Estimate the response rates in patients with advanced malignant mesothelioma of the
           pleura treated with pemetrexed disodium combined with either gemcitabine or carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Estimate survival time in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate smoking status with outcome in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms. While randomized, the study is not a comparative study. Rather, outcomes on each arm
      will be compared to a historical control rate from previous studies. Randomization allows
      simultaneous testing of two experimental arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive intravenous (IV) pemetrexed disodium over 10 minutes and
           carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium as in arm I and gemcitabine IV over 30
           minutes on days 1 and 8.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Beginning approximately 5-10 days before the start of chemotherapy and continuing until
      approximately 3 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, all patients receive oral folic acid
      once daily and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) intramuscularly every 9 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-60 patients (16-30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 12.8-27.0 months.
