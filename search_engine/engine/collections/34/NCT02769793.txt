      anti-parkinsonian medication is delayed more than 40 minutes after intake. In the most severe
      cases, the effect does not appear even until next medication schedule, so called "No ON"
      status. It is important to manage delayed ON properly because it can interfere motor
      functions and quality of life of PD patients.

      Levodopa/benserazide dispersible can be absorbed rapidly in the intestine, so theoretically
      it can break the poor response to conventional treatment of PD patients with delayed ON.
      However, this has not been proven by clinical trials till now.
