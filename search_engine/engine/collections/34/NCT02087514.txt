      hospitalized patients. Red cells may be stored in a refrigerator prior to transfusion for up
      to 42 days by current FDA standards. Refrigerator storage of red cells is associated with a
      storage lesion and the survival of transfused red cells decreases with increasing storage
      time, thus older blood is associated with an increased delivery of hemoglobin-iron to certain
      parts of the body. The investigators have preliminary data in mice and humans suggesting that
      delivery of a significant iron load from aged red cells leads to the production of a
      potentially toxic form of circulating iron called non-transferrin-bound iron.

      In this prospective study of healthy volunteers, each subject will be randomized to receive
      transfusion of one RBC unit after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 weeks of storage. The primary outcome
      will be the 24 hr area under the curve (AUC) of the serum non-transferrin bound iron
      concentration calculated from samples collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 24 hours
      after transfusion.
