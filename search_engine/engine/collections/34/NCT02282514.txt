        5. Blood draw for laboratory tests- these tests will include a complete blood count,
           evaluating liver and kidney function, assessing immune system, tissue typing, and
           checking for certain germs that can cause infections, including a pregnancy test for
           females and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for male as well as testing for HIV

        6. Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)

        7. Electromyography (EMG)

        8. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Abdomen and Pelvis

        9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Spinal Cord

       10. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain with Gadolinium (only if PERM of
           cerebellar ataxia)

       11. Colonoscopy

       12. Mammogram (if female)

       13. Timed ambulation

       14. Quality of Life Questionnaires [ Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF36) and Barthel Index]

       15. Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ)

       16. Rankin Functional Scale

       17. Modified Ashworth Scale

       18. Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Antibody, Type 1 (PCA-1), Purkinje Cell Cytoplasmic Antibody,
           Type 2 (PCA-2) antibody (only if cerebellar ataxia)

       19. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 genes (only if ataxia)

      Study Treatment

      Stem Cell Collection: Cyclophosphamide 2.0 gm/m2 will be given on day 0, G-CSF 5-10
      mcg/kg/day subcutaneous (SQ) will start on day +5 and will continue until apheresis is
      discontinued. Apheresis will begin when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.0 x 109/L and
      continue until >2.0 x 106 cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34)+ cells/kg patient weight are
      cryopreserved. A 10-15 liter apheresis will be performed unless stopped earlier for clinical
      judgment of toxicity (e.g., numbness, tetany). A maximum of four apheresis will be performed.
