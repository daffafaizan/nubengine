      All patients will receive four weeks of 1-Hz rTMS to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (R_DLPFC). In addition, all patients will undergo baseline and post-treatment measures,
      including rTMS while they are in the MRI scanner, neurophysiology (Electroencephalography
      (EEG)/Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)), cognitive testing, behavioural assessments and a
      blood smear. There will also be a 1-week, 4-week, and 12-week follow-up following completion
      of the treatment course.
