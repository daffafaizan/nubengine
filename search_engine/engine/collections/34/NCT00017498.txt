        -  Assess the therapeutic activity of gemcitabine, in terms of objective response and
           duration of response, in patients with recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma
           of the head and neck.

        -  Determine the acute toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks until disease progression and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study.
