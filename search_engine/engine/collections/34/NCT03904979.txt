      resource and opportune time to optimize mental health, positively impacting outcomes.
      Cumulative psychosocial stress is a risk factor for several adverse obstetric outcomes
      including preterm birth (PTB), preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and postpartum
      depression.

      The overarching hypothesis of this study is that pregnant women with high levels of stress
      can be identified through easily-implemented screening tools; importantly, the investigators
      propose that these women can be engaged in care via a cost-effective therapeutic writing
      intervention combined with the availability of expert pastoral and perinatal psychiatry
      resources.

      Women will be enrolled early in pregnancy and followed prospectively. Some women (if
      randomized to a writing group) will complete a standardized writing prompt at several time
      points during gestation. The investigators will follow their outcomes prospectively.
