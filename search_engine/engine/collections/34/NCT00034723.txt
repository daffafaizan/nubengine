      inflammatory CNS diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and HTLV-1 Associated
      Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM-TSP). It is widely used as a marker for disease
      activity and progression. However, conventional MRI methods are only suitable to study gross
      anatomical features, such as size and shape of a particular area of the brain; questions
      regarding intrinsic microstructure and morphologic specificity cannot be addressed. But
      axonal damage or structural abnormalities even in normal appearing brain tissue may play an
      important role in the development of irreversible disability. Magnetization Transfer Imaging,
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Diffusion Tensor MRI are imaging techniques described to
      be capable of the detection of such changes. Spectroscopy can detect molecular components in
      tissue, whereas the Magnetization Transfer Ratio (MTR) allows the measurement of
      water-macromolecule interactions. Diffusion Tensor MRI (DT-MRI) is an imaging modality that
      combines features of in vivo anatomical MRI and histopathology: it is an in vivo MRI method
      that provides information about tissue composition, microstructure, organization and
      architecture. This is possible because water diffusion properties in tissues, as measured by
      DT-MRI, are affected by tissue constituents, such as macromolecules, membranes, organelles,
      as well as by tissue microstructure, architecture and organization. A study comprising
      Magnetization Transfer-, Spectroscopy- and DT-MRI furnishes important information that cannot
      be obtained using conventional MRI methods.
