    
      This is a phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center clinical trial
      involving a device, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS). TENS is a
      non-pharmacological agent which delivers electrical stimulation by a battery operated device
      via electrodes placed on the skin. TENS is considered to be a safe, inexpensive and
      non-invasive modality used to treat a variety of acute and chronic pain conditions. The
      initial phase of the study will randomly allocate subjects to receive active TENS, placebo
      TENS or standard care (No TENS). After participating in the 1 month random assignment, all
      subjects will receive active TENS for 1 month. The subjects will make 4 visits to the clinic
      approximately 2 to 3 1/2 hours each visit. Visits will entail questionnaires, functional
      tasks, accelerometry, TENS, pain and fatigue assessments.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of repeated TENS use on
      movement-related pain in people with fibromyalgia with random assignment to three treatments:
      standard care, placebo TENS and active Aim #2: A secondary aim will test if pain reduction by
      TENs results in a concomitant decrease in fatigue and fear of movement, and an increase in
      function and quality of life. Outcome measures will include physical function by directly
      assessing daily activity with an accelerometer, as well as performing specific functional
      tasks
