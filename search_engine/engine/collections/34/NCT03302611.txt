      service members with major depressive disorder who are seeking surf or hike therapy as part
      of their standard medical care. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of
      either surf or hike therapy. Assessor-administered and self-report measures will be completed
      at pre- and post-program, as well as three months following program completion. Participants
      also will complete brief, self-report assessments before and after each program activity
      session.
