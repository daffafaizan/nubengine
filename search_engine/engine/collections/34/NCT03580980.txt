      Postoperative pain has nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic components.Inadequate
      relief of postoperative pain leads to significant morbidity, delayed recovery, and
      mortality.Despite the development of new drugs and analgesic techniques, up to 40% of
      hospitalized children - especially surgical patients - experiences moderate to severe pain.
      Adverse reactions of medications used for postoperative pain management, particularly
      opioids, are common including pruritus and nausea and vomiting.The incidence of
      opioid-related respiratory depression was reported to range from 0.11 to 0.41%.Regional
      anesthesia was suggested as an alternative to opioid-based analgesia in pediatric patients.
      Caudal epidural analgesia is a relatively safe and simple technique for postoperative pain
      management in children.However, there is a potential for adverse effects related to the
      technique of catheter placement or systemic toxicity of the local anesthetic.

      Preemptive analgesia is defined as analgesic treatment that starts before surgical incision
      to prevent central sensitization caused by incisional and inflammatory injuries.However,
      studies in animal models of incisional pain demonstrated that single analgesic treatment
      before the incision does not reduce postoperative pain. Once nociceptive afferent block
      subsides, the wound reinitiates central sensitization. Also, clinical trials reported similar
      results.Multimodal analgesia uses a combination of delivery routes administered at variable
      time points to optimize outcomes in the treatment of acute pain.

      Therefore, in this pilot study, the investigators are trying to evaluate safety and efficacy
      of preemptive multimodal analgesia compared with preemptive caudal analgesia and PCA morphine
      in pediatric cancer patient undergoing major abdominal surgery.
