      compared to placebo as per the AFFIRM trial. The benefit on relapse rate and progression
      appears to be sustained in longer-term studies such as STRATA. In clinical practice however
      despite a stable EDSS patients often complain of cognitive deterioration.

      The investigators' preliminary results from the first pilot study have shown that cognition
      in Tysabri treated MS patients for two or more years, as measured by the SDMT or Cogstate
      battery is maintained, including the ability to learn. The investigators' final data will be
      presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in 2015.

      The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a sensitive and validated test of cognition in MS.
      CogState offers a standardized battery of cognitive tests frequently used in clinical
      research in the fields of dementia and Parkinson's disease. The CogState battery of tests
      consisting of the Detection test (processing speed), Identification test (attention), One
      Back test (working memory), International Shopping List test (verbal learning) and the Groton
      Maze Learning test (reasoning and problem solving) will further confirm and validate the
      results of the SDMT in MS patients as well as examine other cognitive domains.

      The Beck Depression Inventory-II [Beck 1996] is a validated and well recognized clinical
      research tool for depression in the field of multiple sclerosis.

      Together the above tests done prospectively can assess the evolution of cognitive function in
      Tysabri treated MS patients over the longer term.
