    
      In this triple arm, prospectively randomized multi centre phase IV study 200 patients per
      study arm will be investigated for 12 months.

      Based on the results of the Symphony study the low dose tacrolimus study arm will be modified
      to further improve efficacy (prevention of BPAR, best possible renal function) and safety
      (adverse event profile regarding infections, cardiovascular risk factors, malignant tumours)
      of immunosuppression. For this, CNI will be reduced and in addition the rate of steroid free
      patients after 1 week will be maximized to achieve a long lasting improved post surgical
      cardiovascular risk profile (in particular concerning de novo induction of diabetes mellitus
      and other adverse events caused by steroids). Safety should be increased without loss of
      efficacy of immunosuppression (measured in rejection rate and allograft loss rate) as
      compared to an immune suppressive therapy comprising steroids. Therefore, following the
      successful study arm of the Symphony study, immunosuppression in the first of the three study
      arms comprises a steroid in combination with Advagraf and CellCept in addition to a two dose
      induction therapy with Simulect (group A). The regimen of the second study arm is similar but
      discontinues steroids on day seven after transplantation (group B). Therapy of group three is
      similar to group B but Simulect is replaced by T-cell depleting polyclonal antibodies
      (Thymoglobulin) (group C).
