    
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase II trial is to examine the
      safety and efficacy of AracmynÂ® [Antivenin Latrodectus (Black Widow) Equine Immune F(ab)2], a
      new antivenom, for treatment of patients envenomed by the widow spider. Twenty-four subjects
      will be randomized to receive either the study drug or control (normal saline) through
      intravenous (IV) infusion. Following infusion, subjects will be monitored for changes in pain
      and clinical signs during a two-hour observation period. A standard dose of IV fentanyl will
      be offered to all subjects as pain medication at specific intervals following treatment.
      Vital signs, blood samples, and pain intensity scores (using a visual analog scale, VAS) will
      be collected before and after the infusion, as well as during the observation period. This
      study uses a treatment failure protocol, which involves administration of Merck Antivenin to
      subjects who do not obtain adequate pain relief from the study drug or control. Primary
      efficacy and safety endpoints for this 12-month trial will be improvement in pain intensity
      and clinical signs and incidence of adverse events, respectively.
