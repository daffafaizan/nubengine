      ED's who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be identified by the treating trauma
      surgeons. Data collected will include basic patient demographics, data regarding the
      patient's injuries, data regarding tourniquet use, and data regarding outcomes. Please see
      the attached data collection tool for specifics (Appendix 12.1). Data will be collected
      prospectively in an observational manner using the data collection tool. Data collected on
      individual collection sheets will be de-identified. We plan to complete the data collection
      and analysis by 01\01\2021.
