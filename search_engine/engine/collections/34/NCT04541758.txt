      this study. Subjects were patients with two to four displaced non-flail chest fractures of
      the ribs. Operation group (Group 1) : minimally invasive internal fixation operation group
      under spontaneous breathing anesthesia. In the operation group of minimally invasive internal
      fixation under autonomic respiratory anesthesia, the fracture was determined preoperatively
      by chest CT+ three-dimensional reconstruction of the ribs, and the optimal incision location
      was determined. The fracture was exposed through as many small incisions as possible, and
      fixed with titanium plate or clon-type plate. During the operation, the autonomic respiratory
      anesthesia and paraviral nerve block technology was adopted. In the conservative group (group
      2), routine treatment measures such as analgesia, hemostasis and chest band fixation were
      adopted. The effects of the two treatments on lung function, pain index, complications and
      QoL were evaluated. It provides theoretical basis for the treatment of rib fracture
