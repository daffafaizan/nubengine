      or progressive within 6 months of completing first-line, platinum-containing chemotherapy.
      Subjects will be centrally randomized 2:1 to receive picoplatin plus BSC every 3 weeks, or
      BSC alone. After discontinuation of picoplatin, all subjects will continue to receive BSC and
      will continue to be evaluated every 3 weeks until discontinuation from the study, death, or
      the end of the study. After discontinuation of picoplatin, subjects may be treated with
      another chemotherapy at their physician's discretion and then will be followed for survival.
