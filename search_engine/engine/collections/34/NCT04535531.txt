    
      This is a phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group
      study to be conducted in up to approximately 850 subjects 6 months of age and older with
      molluscum contagiosum (MC). After obtaining informed consent/assent, subjects who satisfy
      entry criteria will be randomized 1:1 (active:vehicle). Subjects receiving current treatment
      for MC at the time of the Screening Visit will enter a wash out period of up to 14 days prior
      to randomization.

      Subjects or their caregivers will apply treatment once daily to all lesions identified at
      Baseline and new lesions that arise during treatment for a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12
      weeks. If the investigator determines all lesions are cleared at a visit, the treatment may
      stop. If treatment is stopped due to clearance, subjects will continue regularly scheduled
      visits through Week 24/ET2. Study drug will be dispensed through Week 12/ET1 in case of
      lesion recurrence between study visits. At each visit subsequent to stopping treatment due to
      clearance, the investigator will determine if new lesions have occurred since the last visit,
      and if so, the subject or caregiver will be instructed by the investigator to re-initiate
      treatment. If the subject or caregiver see new lesions or re-occurrence of lesions in between
      visits, they should treat these lesions until the next visit. No study drug will be provided
      after the Week 12 visit. The subject or caregiver will apply study drug to the individual
      lesions. Periocular lesions will be treated if the lesions are at least 2 cm from the edge of
      the eye. Subjects will visit the clinic in person at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4
      (unless visit is performed remotely), Week 8, Week 12, and Week 24.
