    
      Partial epilepsy, the commonest form of epilepsy, is a difficult condition to treat with many
      patients continuing to have symptoms despite trying several medications. Lack of efficacy and
      adverse effects are commonly associated with current anti-epileptic drugs.

      This study will examine the efficacy in addition to safety and tolerability of a new
      anti-epileptic drug, Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093), as an adjunctive therapy for
      refractory partial seizures in children.

      The primary analysis variables are:

        -  The responder rate (the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in
           standardised seizure frequency)

        -  The relative reduction in standardised seizure frequency
