      university. The aim of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of human amniotic
      membrane in promoting closure of large macular holes.

      Included participants with large macular holes will undergo complete vitrectomy is performed
      with an accurate vitreal base shaving (Constellation; Alcon Surgical). A human amniotic
      membrane hAM plug is taken from the hAM patch, and the final dimensions are adjusted with
      vitreoretinal scissors before insertion into the vitreous. The hAM plug is rolled inside the
      vitreoretinal forceps and inserted through the trocar into the vitreous. Then the human
      amniotic membrane is transplanted through macular hole into the subretinal space; it is then
      spread to cover the entire portion of the hole. Afterward, perfluorocarbon is injected to a
      complete overfilling of the break to permit good adhesion of the hAM plug to the underlying
      RPE and the overlying retina. Fluid-air exchange and an endotamponade injection is performed
      at the end of surgery.
