      autoimmune paleo (AIP) diet in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
      (UC).

      Specific aims:

        1. To evaluate the effect of the AIP diet on clinical and endoscopic disease activity for
           CD and UC,

        2. To examine changes in inflammatory biomarkers during AIP diet

        3. To characterize changes in RNA expression from intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens from
           prior to diet initiation to end of the study.

        4. To characterize changes in fecal microbiome during diet intervention
