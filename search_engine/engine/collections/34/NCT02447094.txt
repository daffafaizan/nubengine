      States. AIS is a a leading cause of long-term disability and the third-leading cause of
      mortality. Effective therapies exist to ameliorate the disability associated with AIS, but
      implementation of these therapies is time-sensitive. Currently, there is a shortage in health
      care professionals with expertise in the treatment of stroke and such expertise tends to be
      concentrated in large community-based or academic medical centers. To respond to this
      shortage, stroke networks are being organized in a "hub-and-spoke" model to facilitate the
      rapid delivery of time-sensitive interventions such as intravenous (i.v.) tissue plasminogen
      activator (tPA) or rapid evaluation for AIS. Some networks are also using telemedicine to
      facilitate this approach and bring the needed expertise via robotic tele-presence (RTP).
      Though the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and i.v. tPA utilization may be higher in RTP based
      networks, the impact of this model on patient's outcomes has been difficult to elucidate. To
      this end, meaningful validated outcome assessments are crucial to understand the impact of
      stroke interventions including telemedicine or RTP based networks. The objective of this
      study is to translate evidence-based practice of healthcare, patient-centered outcome
      assessments, and patient-family perceptions of delivery of care into meaningful data. This
      will aid in the validation of the role of interventions such as "hub-and-spoke" RTP based
      models in stroke care.
