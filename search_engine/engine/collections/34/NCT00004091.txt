      receptor, and the MaTu-MN protein in exfoliated cervical epithelial cells from women with
      abnormal Pap test using fluorescent labeled antibody probe vs histology.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a Pap test and a colposcopy. Cervical epithelial cells are
      collected from the most abnormal appearing lesion. Cells are examined for molecular markers
      using a fluorescent antibody test. The presence or absence of these markers is compared to
      results of the Pap test and the histology of the cells.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
