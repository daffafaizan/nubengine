      forms the tissue without creasing or folding. It allows the allograft tissue to safely pass
      into the anterior chamber without compression, crushing, or squeezing the endothelial cells.

      The device provides continuous irrigation into the eye to prevent collapse of the anterior
      chamber during insertion. Our study will focus on the safety and efficacy of the novel
      instrument over the current method of insertion (forceps).

      FDA has classified the device as Class I, Reserved.
