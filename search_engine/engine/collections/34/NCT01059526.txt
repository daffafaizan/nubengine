    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate immunogenicity and hypersensitivity upon exposure
      to KALBITOR, in particular:

        1. Determine the rate of anaphylaxis and Type I hypersensitivity reactions upon exposure to
           KALBITOR.

        2. Determine the rate of seroconversion to anti-ecallantide antibodies upon exposure to
           KALBITOR.

        3. Determine the rate of adverse events related to disordered coagulation
           (hypercoagulability and hypocoagulability) upon exposure to KALBITOR.
