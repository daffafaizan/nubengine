      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD1775 as a treatment for
      any type of cancer. Cisplatin is FDA approved for other cancers and has been shown to be an
      active treatment for breast cancer.

      AZD1775 is a drug that is designed to block a protein called Wee-1 which may control the
      ability of certain cancer cells to grow or divide. Cisplatin works by damaging the DNA inside
      the cancer cells which prevents them from dividing. By combining AZD1775 and Cisplatin,
      cancer cells may potentially be more effectively killed.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine whether the combination of
      AZD1775 and cisplatin is an effective treatment for triple negative breast cancer that has
      spread to other parts of the body.
