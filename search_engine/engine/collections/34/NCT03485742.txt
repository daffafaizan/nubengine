      future acute cardiovascular events, especially myocardial infarction. However the use of
      statins in this context (i.e., primary prevention) is governed by guidelines that limit the
      use of statins to four high risk populations: (1) hose with known cardiovascular disease, (2)
      those with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels 190 mg/dl or above, (3)
      diabetics with LDL-C levels 70-189 mg/dl, and (4) those with an estimated 10-year
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score of 7.5% or more.

      Unfortunately, some individuals are still at risk of sustaining MI despite the fact that they
      do not fit into one of these four high risk groups eligible for statins.

      StainEPIC will enroll consecutive patients admitted with MI who are not on statins to examine
      their eligibility for these medications based on the AHA/ACC guidelines.
