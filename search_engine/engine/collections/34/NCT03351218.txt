      behavioural and novel multimodal neuroimaging techniques to address the study aims.

      The battery of the tasks will include explicit-agency tasks, a visual discrimination task on
      objects movement perception. The magnetic resonance acquisition protocol will include MP2RAGE
      structural (10 min duration), multi echo (3 echo times) multiband (MB factor 4) resting state
      functional neuroimaging (15 minutes duration) and multi shell diffusion imaging sequence (15
      minutes duration)
