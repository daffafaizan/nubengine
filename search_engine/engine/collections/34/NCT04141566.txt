      abdominoperineal resection (APR) is still indicated in over 20% of these cases.

      A permanent left abdominal stoma is the standard salvage technique.

      The pseudo continent perineal colostomy (PCPC) is an alternative technique especially in low
      income countries where the stoma bag and stoma care is not covered by health insurances.

      Furthermore, this technique allows the conservation of body image, which is frequently
      requested by muslim patients whenever it is possible.

      The aim of this study is to compare the cost effectiveness of both techniques as well as the
      quality of life of patients in the 6 first months following the surgery.
