      types of treatment; pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgery. Though ultrasound, a
      non-pharmacological treatment, is increasingly used in knee osteoarthritis, the advantages
      and disadvantages of low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) and high intensity continuous
      ultrasound (HICUS) are yet to be clarified. Therefore, a randomized control trial will be
      done to compare LIPUS and HICUS in participants with knee osteoarthritis presenting to
      Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Yangon General Hospital, Myanmar.
