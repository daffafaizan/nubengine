      (OCR) is difficult to achieve. This study was designed to investigate pre-operatively
      measured parameters of various anaesthetic regimes, iris color, sex, age, surgical time,
      severity of Marcus-Gunn Pupil (MGP), type of mechanical stimulation of eye, and number of
      extraocular muscle (EOM) under tension as predictors of significant OCR in pediatric
      strabismus surgery.

      Methods: Three hundred patients were randomized to one of three anesthetic regimes: group P:
      propofol (2 mg/kg), alfentanil 0.02 mg/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg at induction; group K:
      ketamine (2mg/kg), alfentanil 0.02 mg/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg at induction; group T:
      thiopental (5mg/kg), alfentanil 0.02 mg/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg at induction. OCR was
      defined as a 10% change in heart rate induced by traction.

      Results: Incidence of OCR was significantly lower in patients in group k compared with
      patients in group T or P. Chi-square test results showed that the occurrence of OCR was
      significantly associated with difference of iris color (P=0.01). The occurrence of the OCR
      did not correlate with sex, age, duration of surgery, iris color, severity of MGP, number of
      EOM under tension, and type of mechanical stimulation of eye. Type of mechanical stimulation
      of eye or number of EOM under tension increased risk of developing OCR by 0.81 (95% CI,
      0.66-0.98) and 1.29 (95% CI; 1.12-1.63) respectively.

      Conclusions: Induction of anesthesia with ketamine is associated with least hemodynamic
      changes induced by OCR during strabismus surgery. The prediction of oculocardiac reflex
      propensity remains elusive.
