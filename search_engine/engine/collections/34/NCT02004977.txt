      and11th grade students.

      Student-level Secondary Aims Secondary Aim 1: High school students in the intervention
      condition will decrease their rate of weight gain relative to height gain as measured by
      change in body mass index and percent body fat compared to students in the control condition.
      Hypothesis: Body mass index and percent body fat will be maintained or reduced in the
      treatment versus control group.

      Secondary Aim 2: High school students in the intervention condition will maintain or decrease
      their energy intake while improving dietary intakes of low fat dairy, whole grains and fresh
      fruits compared to the control students.

      Hypothesis: Energy intake (measured by 3, 24-hour recalls) will be maintained or reduced and
      intakes of low fat dairy, whole grains and fresh fruits will increase more in the
      intervention groups.

      Secondary Aim 3: Compared to students in the control condition, high school students in the
      intervention condition will report receiving more support to eat school breakfast. Support
      will be social (increased peer and school support) or related to the school environment
      (satisfaction with serving locations and times, eating locations, foods and increased
      availability of low fat dairy, fruits and whole grains for breakfast).

      Hypothesis: The treatment group will report receiving more social and school environment
      support for eating school breakfast than the comparison group (measured by a student survey).
