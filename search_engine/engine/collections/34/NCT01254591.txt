        -  To determine the ability of preoperative fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission
           tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning in assessing tumor angiogenesis in
           patients with potentially operable non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast
           cancer, esophageal cancer, or head and neck cancer.

        -  To determine the ability of preoperative fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT scanning in
           assessing prognosis by means of measuring angiogenesis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography (PET/CT) scanning for staging, tumor perfusion measurement/angiogenesis, and
      glucose metabolism. If staging confirms operable disease, then the patient proceeds to
      surgery as planned. Resected tumor tissue samples are examined for tumor angiogenesis in the
      various cancer types.

      Some patients undergo a half-dose of rubidium Rb-82 or 18F-fluoromisonidazole or [18F]-ML-10
      PET scan or fluorescence angiography. Patients with colorectal cancer undergo a CT scan for
      perfusion of the tumor after the staging PET/CT. Patients with breast cancer undergo infrared
      thermometry as well as a MRI scan for staging and to predict angiogenesis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 6
      months for 5 years.
