      until exit from the study . Enrolled subjects are assessed once daily throughout the
      follow-up period. Assessments are performed at the sacrum and both heels; if one or more
      locations are not assessable with the SEM Scanner, only the assessable locations are
      assessed. Each study site may include one or two wound care specialist (or a similarly
      trained clinician; the "Specialist") and one or two clinician/patient care provider(s) (the
      "Generalist") who perform assessments in the study.

      Study assessments include (i) daily Risk Assessment and (ii) daily Skin Assessment performed
      by the Specialist blinded to the SEM readings; and (iii) daily SEM Scanner readings collected
      by the Generalist blinded to the Risk and Skin assessments. The outcome of interest is the
      diagnosis of a pressure ulcer by the Specialist using clinical judgment. The Specialist
      stages any diagnosed pressure ulcers according to NPUAP/EPUAP 2014 guidelines.

      Note: If applicable, enrolled subjects continue to receive facility's standard of care
      practices for pressure ulcer preventive care. Participation in the study does not alter
      patient's standard of care.

      This study involved two study objectives -

        1. A primary objective to demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the SEM Scanner
           200 in detecting early pressure ulcers before clinical judgment ("diagnose PU before
           clinical judgment").

        2. A secondary objective to determine how early the SEM Scanner can detect signs before
           visually identified via clinical judgment ("time to detection").
