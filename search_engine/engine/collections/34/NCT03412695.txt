      Disease-related malnutrition increase the morbidity and mortality among patients and leads to
      longer length of stay. There is a lack of tools to follow up the nutritional treatment of
      patients at nutritional risk. The decision support system "MyFood" is developed in the
      project with the purpose to prevent and treat disease-related malnutrition. MyFood includes 4
      modules: 1) A function to register patient needs and symptoms, 2) Dietary assessment
      function, 3) Automatic evaluation of dietary intake compared to individual needs, 4)
      Feedback, including a report on intake of energy, protein, and liquids compared to individual
      needs, and recommendations for nutritional measures and an individual nutrition plan.

      Clinical effects of using MyFood among hospitalized patients will be studied in a randomized
      controlled trial. In addition, the implementation of the tool among nurses and other
      healthcare workers will be explored.
