      the most significant problems facing the public mental health system. We have been conducting
      a project to develop a multifaceted treatment for substance abuse in dual disordered patients
      (Behavioral Treatment for Substance Abuse in Schizophrenia; BTSAS). Results have shown that
      the treatment is well-accepted by patients and has a significant effect on drug use. While
      BTSAS has been effective at retaining subjects and fostering reduced drug use, a major
      problem that occurred was low rates of engagement. The main purpose of this study is to
      determine if BTSAS is more effective in reducing drug use than a supportive control treatment
      and to determine if adding a case management component (Critical Time Intervention; CTI) will
      increase treatment engagement and retention in BTSAS.
