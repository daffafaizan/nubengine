      interventional and is left to the judgment of each physician during the observational period,
      which defines the survey for each patient. Follow-up of patients should enable two patient
      visits during this period.

      The screening/inclusion visit (Visit 1) will be performed when the decision for Klacid SR
      therapy in a daily dose of 1000 mg is made. The second visit of the patient will occur 10 -
      16 days from the screening/inclusion Visit (upon physician's decision). The physician can
      change the numbers and time of the visits. As a result, failure to meet these suggested dates
      will not constitute a breach of the protocol.
