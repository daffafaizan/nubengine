    
      From April 2017 onwards, only patients operated by mastectomy or those receiving neoadjuvant
      therapy and having a sentinel node biopsy before its initiation may be recruited into
      SENOMIC. The inclusion target has been met for those patients operated by breast-conserving
      therapy, and from now on, these patients will not be included in SENOMIC anymore. Recruitment
      of the above-mentioned patient selection will continue until 452 patients operated by
      mastectomy have been enrolled.
