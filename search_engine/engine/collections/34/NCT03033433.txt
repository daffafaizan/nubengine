    
      This is a single center, open-label, phase-I study consisting of two stages: Stage 1 will be
      dose-escalation study to assess the safety and tolerability profile of three escalating doses
      of DCB-DM101 in healthy volunteers and Stage 2 will apply optimum dose of DCB-DM101 as add-on
      treatment in T2DM patients. In Stage 2, patients are allowed to receive metformin for T2DM
      for routine use of which the dosing regimen should not be adjusted. No other
      medication/treatments for T2DM are allowed. Stage 2 can only be proceeded upon the approval
      of health authority in Taiwan. After determining the optimal dose for Stage 2, the reasons
      for determining such dose together with relevant supporting data should be submitted to
      health authority in Taiwan for review and to determine whether stage 2 can be proceeded and
      which dose should be employed for stage 2.
