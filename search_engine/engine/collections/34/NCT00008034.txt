      epirubicin in women with locally advanced or inflammatory or large operable breast cancer.
      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter dose escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive
      neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide IV and epirubicin IV on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily
      on days 1-14. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-33 patients will be accrued for this study.
