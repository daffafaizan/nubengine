      participate in split-mouth design and provided informed consent. Subgingival plaque sampling
      and clinical recording at baseline, 15 days and 1 month was performed. The patients received
      scaling and root planing, followed by Propolis administration subgingivally in the test
      sites. Significant differences between test and control were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney
      U test and Wilcoxon rank test.
