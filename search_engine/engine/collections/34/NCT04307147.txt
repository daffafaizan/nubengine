      effectiveness and safety of vinorelbine plus capecitabine as adjuvant treatment for non-pCR
      Luminal B breast cancer patients after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Non-pCR Luminal B
      patients who completed 6-8 cycles of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be included in
      this study and receive 4 cycles of NX regimen chemotherapy for 4 cycles (vinorelbine 25 mg/m²
      d1,8 and capecitabine 1250 mg/m² d1-14, every 3 weeks) or not. the investigator's primary
      endpoint is disease free survival (DFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS),
      recurrence free survival (RFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS)rates and safety.
