      thoracic surgery, primarily for lung cancer. We aim to establish a fundament for the conduct
      of nationwide population-based studies by linking patient-level data from the Swedish quality
      register for thoracic surgery (ThoR) and other national health-data registers maintained by
      the government agencies Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare.
      Cross-linking patient-level data is possible through the Personal Identity Number assigned to
      every individual who has resided in Sweden on a permanent basis. The Swedish Personal
      Identity Number is the unique identifier in all national registers.

      Specifically, we aim:

        1. To analyze the association between socioeconomic factors and prognosis in patients
           undergoing pulmonary resection for lung cancer.

        2. To investigate the implementation of minimally invasive surgery for lung cancer in
           Sweden.
