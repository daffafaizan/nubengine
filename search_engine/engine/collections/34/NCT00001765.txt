    
      Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder of neutrophil function. Patients
      are profoundly immunocompromised, and are plagued early in life with recurrent, and life
      threatening infections. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only cure for CGD.

      The goal of this phase I/II study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a novel
      approach to allogeneic stem cell transplantation aimed at decreasing transplant related
      morbidity and mortality. We will treat patients with CGD with an allogeneic, G-CSF mobilized
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant from an HLA identical family member. The graft will be
      T-cell depleted which will decrease the incidence of acute graft vs. host disease. Donor
      T-cells will be infused post-transplant if engraftment of donor stem cells is unsatisfactory.
      The preparative regimen utilized will provide intense immunosuppression without
      myeloablation. It is designed to allow donor stem cell engraftment while minimizing serious
      transplant related toxicity.

      The end points of this study are engraftment, degree of donor-host chimerism, incidence of
      acute and chronic GVHD, transplant related morbidity and mortality as well as overall
      survival.
