      on timing of loading dose]), and follow-up phase of 28 days post randomization. Participants
      will have assessments at Days 7, 10, 14, and 28 to evaluate safety, efficacy, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK). The primary hypothesis of study is a positive dose-response
      relationship of active treatment on average hMPV viral load area under concentration versus
      time curve (AUC) over 7 days, meaning that either average AUC on pooled active treatments is
      lower than on placebo, or average AUC on high active dose is lower than average AUC on
      placebo using multiple contrast testing. Based on review of PK, efficacy and safety data,
      Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) may recommend modifications to study design that
      is changes in dose and treatment duration.
