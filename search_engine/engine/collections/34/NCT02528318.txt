      conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lucinactant for inhalation in
      conjunction with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in comparison with nCPAP
      alone. The study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lucinactant for inhalation,
      administered as an aerosol in 4 escalating doses.

      For this study, lucinactant for inhalation refers to the active investigational agent,
      lyophilized lucinactant, in combination with the prototype investigational delivery device.
      Reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant was aerosolized by the investigational device and
      introduced into the nCPAP circuit. Those randomized to the control arm continued to receive
      nCPAP alone. Dose assignments were unblinded, as the primary objective of this study was
      safety and tolerability.

      Preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) between 26 and 28 completed weeks
      PMA who were within the first 20 hours after birth and who had successful implementation of
      controlled nCPAP within 90 minutes of birth were considered to be potential subjects. Before
      study enrollment, legal guardians were provided a written informed consent form (ICF) for
      each potential subject.
