      cancer, tumors falling into the PAM50 HER2-enriched subtype have androgen receptor
      (AR)-dependency. To test this hypothesis directly in patients' tumors, we propose an
      exploratory, open-label, non-randomized, two-cohort, multicenter, prospective, phase II study
      which evaluates the effect of enzalutamide on proliferation after 2 weeks (14-21 days) of
      treatment in patients with endocrine-resistant, locally advanced or metastatic
      HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer. After 2 weeks (14-21 days) of treatment, patients will
      continue enzalutamide. Exemestane will be allowed to be added to enzalutamide per
      investigator discretion and will be administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity.
