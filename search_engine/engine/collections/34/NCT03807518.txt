      the exact same care as the intervention group patients but will receive no exercise training
      program.

      The primary goal of this multi-centre randomised controlled trial are to investigate the
      effects of peri-operative exercise training programmes on physical fitness, measured with a 6
      minute walk test, in patients undergoing a major curative upper-GI resection for either
      oesophageal or gastric cancer.

      The secondary aims will look at the effect of peri-operative exercise training on patients
      quality of life, optimism and well being, post operative morbidity, nutritional status and
      blood markers of inflammation.
