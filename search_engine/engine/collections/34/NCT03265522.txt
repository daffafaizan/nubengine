      lifestyle education intervention to encourage behaviour change in patients with MCI. The
      proposed study will be a 6 month RCT with a total of 60 MCI patients who will be randomised
      to 1 of 3 groups:

        1. Group 1 will receive the Mediterranean lifestyle education resource on one occasion at
           baseline

        2. Group 2 will receive the Mediterranean lifestyle education resource at monthly intervals
           for 5 months accompanied by telephone feedback from the research dietitian

        3. Group 3 will receive standard care (control group). Participants will receive the
           Mediterranean lifestyle education resource after their final 6 month study visit (i.e.
           delayed intervention).
