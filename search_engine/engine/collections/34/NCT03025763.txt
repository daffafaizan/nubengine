      and abnormal craniofacial biology to ultimately improve the treatment of craniofacial
      disorders. Craniosynostosis and other skull abnormalities are among the most common human
      malformations usually requiring surgical and medical intervention. The Network will integrate
      three projects and two cores. Scientists with diverse expertise including anthropology,
      morphometry, imaging, birth defects, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, epidemiology,
      statistics, and systems biology will explore the determinants of the fate of the relevant
      mesenchymal progenitor cells, abnormalities in osteogenesis that contribute to global skull
      growth abnormality and premature closure of cranial sutures, especially the coronal suture.
      High quality genomic data will be obtained from patients with coronal nonsyndromic
      craniosynostosis (cNSC) and their available parents. Novel genome-wide variant-, gene- and
      network-level analyses will be performed on these families to identify novel variants and
      genetic regions associated with coronal craniosynostosis.

      This study is a multi-center, open-enrollment, retrospective study, employing both
      family-based and case-control study designs.

      Approximately 4000 cNSC patients, their family members, and controls will be recruited by
      Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the majority will be recruited from the more than
      10 collaborating institutions worldwide.
