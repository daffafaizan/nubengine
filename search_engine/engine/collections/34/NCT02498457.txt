      group (with dialysate calcium concentration 1.5mmol/L) and low calcium dialysis group (with
      dialysate calcium concentration 1.25mmol/L). All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly for 4
      hours with a bicarbonate-based solution. They were followed up in every dialysis interview
      during the 1-year study, the occurrence of all adverse reactions associated with dialysis
      were recorded during the study. All patients received heart spiral CT examination before and
      at the end of the study. Coronary artery calcification was assessed by a certain professional
      who was not affiliated to the dialysis center.
