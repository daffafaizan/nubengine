      and inadequate. Current treatment options include pharmacological treatments, physical
      therapy, nerve blocks, surgical interruption of the pain pathway, or back surgery. Many
      patients either do not have adequate pain management with conventional treatments or are not
      able to tolerate the treatments due to significant side effects. Similarly, many patients are
      either not candidates for surgical interventions, or are unwilling to undergo such
      procedures. Spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective treatment for patients with
      pain following a failed back surgery, and this study will investigate spinal cord stimulation
      as a treatment option for the treatment of chronic back pain in patients who have never had
      back surgery. A successful study outcome will establish spinal cord stimulation as a
      less-invasive treatment option to be considered prior to surgery.
