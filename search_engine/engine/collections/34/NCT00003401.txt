      receiving peripheral blood stem cells supported by gemcitabine and high dose carmustine and
      melphalan followed by consolidation therapy with gemcitabine plus
      cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone/etoposide/cisplatin (DCEP) and
      dexamethasone/paclitaxel/cisplatin. II. Evaluate the incidence of early death in comparison
      with historical data in this patient population. III. Evaluate the feasibility of
      chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus DCEP and dexamethasone/paclitaxel/cisplatin following
      autotransplantation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on day -5 and again 6 hours after
      administration of carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2, followed by melphalan IV over 20
      minutes on day -1. Patients receive intravenous CD34 peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. At
      3 months and 9 months, patients with adequate hematologic counts receive cyclophosphamide IV,
      oral dexamethasone, etoposide IV, and cisplatin IV for 4 days. On day 3 of continuous
      infusions, gemcitabine is given over 100 minutes. At 6 and 12 months after autotransplant,
      patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, paclitaxel IV over 6 hours on day 2, and
      cisplatin IV over 24 hours on day 3. Patients are followed every 6 weeks to 3 months until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-63 patients will be accrued within 2.5 years.
