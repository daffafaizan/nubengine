      or every 3 weeks in patients with malignancies for whom single agent paclitaxel is a
      reasonable treatment option. All patients will receive paclitaxel either at a dose of 80
      mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Arm A) or at 175 mg/m2 administered on day 8 of
      a 21 day cycle (Arm B). Patients on both arm A and arm B will receive premedication with
      diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 30 minutes prior to treatment; ranitidine 50 mg IV 30 minutes prior
      to treatment and dexamethasone 20 mg IV at 30 minutes prior to treatment. The 1st cohort of
      patients on Arm A will receive perifosine orally at a dose of 50 mg per day for the first 21
      days of the 28-day cycle and on Arm B will receive perifosine orally at a dose of 50 mg per
      day for the first 14 days of the 21-day cycle. On each arm, the perifosine dose will be
      escalated in subsequent groups to 50 mg bid and then 50 mg tid as tolerated. (See below)
      Alternating cohorts of 3 patients will be entered first to Arm A and then to Arm B. The
      perifosine dose escalation for Arm A and Arm B will be performed separately according to the
      following algorithm. For each arm, a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as a dose
      that can be given without grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity in more than 1/3 patients. If
      2/3 patients in any cohort encounter a grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity, an additional 3
      patients will be added. If the dose is intolerable for >3/6 patients then the previous dose
      level will be declared the MTD for that arm.
