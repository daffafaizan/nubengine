      viable myocardium initiates a process of adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling1,
      compromising clinical outcome.

      Experimental data have suggested that autologous bone marrow-derived or circulating
      progenitor cells may be beneficial for LV function recovery, but underlying mechanisms are
      unclear and prominent cardiomyocyte transdifferentiation has only been reported under
      selected experimental conditions. Early non-randomized clinical investigations indicate
      feasibility, safety and enhanced functional recovery after autologous human bone
      marrow-derived stem cell (BMSC) infusion into the infarct-related artery. More recently, a
      randomized open study demonstrated improvement of LV systolic function but not of LV
      remodeling following BMSC transfer.

      In the absence of trials, in which the control group reproduces the exact conditions of the
      cell transfer group, including bone marrow aspiration and a placebo intracoronary injection,
      the true benefit of cell transfer cannot be fully appreciated.

      We, therefore, designed a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled exploratory study
      to investigate the effect of autologous BMSC transfer on LV functional and structural
      recovery after myocardial infarction. In view of the exploratory nature of the study and to
      detect potential mechanisms for the biological effect, we also assessed myocardial perfusion
      and oxidative metabolism using serial 1-[11C]acetate positron emission tomography (PET).
