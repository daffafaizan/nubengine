      estimated to affect approximately 30% of the US population and is closely associated with the
      metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and
      abnormal function of the adipose tissue is thought to be a major feature of insulin
      resistance and NAFLD. Whether fatty acid oxidation is also dysregulated in patients with
      NAFLD is unclear. In this study we aim to measure total-body fatty acid oxidation of an oral
      fat load using the BreathID breath test device and a meal containing 13C-labeled palmitate.
      Results will be compared between patients with NAFLD, healthy controls and patients with
      metabolic syndrome but not NAFLD, as well as within NAFLD patients before and after
      therapeutic interventions.
