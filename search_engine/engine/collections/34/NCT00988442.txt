      medications prescribed to them when and how they are instructed. However, a third or more of
      patients on ART are not able to adhere to their medication regimens. Therefore, making sure
      that these patients stay healthy involves making sure they are motivated and informed about
      the importance of adhering to their ART. Nurses can deliver interventions to motivate and
      inform patients through regularly scheduled phone calls. These calls allow nurses to check in
      between clinic visits, are convenient to patients, and are cost efficient. This study tested
      an enhanced telephone support intervention provided by nurses that aimed to improve ART
      adherence and treatment outcomes.

      Follow-up for this study lasted 72 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to receive
      either care as usual or the enhanced telephone support intervention plus care as usual. The
      telephone support intervention involved phone calls made weekly for the first 8 weeks of the
      study and then every 2 weeks for the next 40 weeks. Nurses made these calls at a time and
      place participants chose. During the calls, nurses provided information, motivational
      enhancement, and problem-solving skills.

      Study assessments took place at study entry and after 12, 24, 48, and 72 weeks. Assessments
      measured CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, adherence, and illness events. Adherence was
      measured through questionnaires and an electronic pill cap.

      This study was closed early to both accrual and follow-up due to low recruitment. The study
      aimed to enroll 296 participants. The actual study accrual at the time of early closing was
      59 participants.
