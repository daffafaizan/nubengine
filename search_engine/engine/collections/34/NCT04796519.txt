      population and are substantial contributor to increase healthcare cost burden. Pain, strength
      deficits, knee joint deformities, balance and proprioceptive impairments associated with
      severe knee OA, contribute to an increased risk of falling among elderly, and more than 50%
      of this population experience a fall each year. Static or dynamic postural control cannot be
      fully restored in patients with Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). Moreover, deficits in balance
      and postural control may still be present in both extremity after TKA. Increased
      weight-bearing on the operative side after TKA and reduced weight-bearing weight in the
      contralateral osteoarthritic knee can reduce pain and improve balance-related functions.
      However, the contralateral knee OA grade, asymmetrical gait pattern, and postural sways still
      remain a risk factor for balance deficits and falls. Based on this rationale, the aim of this
      study is to evaluate the balance and fall risk before and after TKA in patients who suffered
      from bilateral knee osteoarthritis and to clarify the balance and fall risk difference
      between unilateral and bilateral TKA patients.
