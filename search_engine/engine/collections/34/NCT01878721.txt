      conditions caused by bacterial infection or vasculitis. Our aim is to:

        1. investigate whether FDG (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/CT and
           68Ga-(Gallium-68) citrate PET/CT enable the early and accurate detection of metastatic
           infection foci in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

        2. study the usefulness of FDG PET/CT in detection of endovascular infection in bacteremia
           caused by Salmonella spp.

        3. find an optimal FDG PET/CT protocol for detection of infectious endocarditis and
           metastatic infection foci related to endocarditis.

        4. study the value of FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of infection of pacemaker or implantable
           cardioverter defibrillator.

        5. investigate the usefulness of FDG PET/CT, 68Ga-citrate PET/CT, and 11C- (carbon-11)
           translocator protein ligand (PK11195) PET/CT in diagnosis of vasculitis and in imaging
           of the magnitude of the vascular changes.
