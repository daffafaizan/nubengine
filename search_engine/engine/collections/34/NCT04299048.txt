    
      This 12-week open-label study will explore how PF-06946860 is tolerated, the effects of the
      study drug, the best dose for treatment and how participants with non-small cell lung,
      pancreatic or colorectal cancer and cachexia feel after receiving repeated subcutaneous
      dosing. During the 12-week treatment period, study drug will be administered subcutaneously
      every 3 weeks for a total of 5 doses. There is a 12-week follow-up period following the last
      dose of study drug. Additional assessments include:

        -  body weight measurements

        -  blood pressure and heart rate measurements

        -  Lumbar Skeletal Muscle Index (LSMI) by CT scan

        -  Blood samples:

             -  to evaluate safety,

             -  to measure the amount of the study drug in the blood,

             -  to evaluate if the study drug causes an immune response,

             -  to examine the effects of the study drug on levels of a specific cytokine,

             -  and for exploratory samples for bio banking.

        -  Measure the impact of the study drug on appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, physical
           function, and health-related quality of life with questionnaires.

        -  Measure the impact of study drug on physical activity using wearable digital sensors.

        -  To evaluate the effect of study drug on ability to complete anti-tumor treatment and
           survival in participants with cancer and cachexia.

        -  To evaluate tumor size.
