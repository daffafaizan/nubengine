    
      OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objective is to compare HRQOL of patients with pITP with that of a matched
      Italian population control Group.

      Secondary objectives include evaluation of:

        -  Patient-reported fatigue amongst the three different pITP groups.

        -  Social support and psychological wellbeing as a possible determinant of HRQOL.

        -  Possible association between socio-demographic (e.g., age, living arrangements,
           education and employment status) and clinical variables (e.g., time from diagnosis, and
           current treatment if any) with patient reported health outcomes (e.g., HRQOL, fatigue,
           and social support).

        -  To assess patients' preferences for involvement in treatment decision-making and the
           relationships between preferences and patient characteristics and to compare patient's
           stated preferences for involvement in treatment decision with the perceptions of their
           treating physicians (only for Newly Diagnosed pITP).
