      the diagnosis and assessment of severity of heart failure. In addition to numerous reports
      describing the diagnostic and prognostic utility of BNP, reports from various pilot studies
      have described decreases in BNP in association with various heart failure therapies. Other
      reports have described modest increases in BNP in association with digitalis and
      beta-receptor antagonism. The observation that the circulating BNP concentration decreases
      during heart failure therapy, coupled with the ability of BNP to be used as a prognostic tool
      and assess the severity of heart failure, it is hypothesized that using BNP measurements to
      guide heart failure therapy could have a significant impact on the care of heart failure
      patients. This hypothesis is supported by various reports of pilot studies that describe a
      significant benefit of administering therapy tailored to concentrations of BNP and related
      peptides. Patients that are discharged after a hospitalization for heart failure will be
      approached for study enrollment.This is a multi-center, single (patient)-blinded
      cluster-randomized study. Half of the sites will have BNP measurements available to guide
      therapy (experimental arm) and the other half of the sites will not have BNP measurements
      available (control arm). Blood (plasma) will be collected at each visit and appropriate forms
      completed. Patients will be asked to complete a Minnesota living with heart failure
      questionnaire and to do a 6-minute walk test. Patients will be followed for 12 months.
