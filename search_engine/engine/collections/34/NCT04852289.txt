      vaccinated participants. Pfizer and Moderna made vaccines will be used in this study. As both
      vaccines are mRNA based encoding S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and require two doses, the CD8 T
      cell response is expected to be comparable. We will also measure general health factors using
      blood samples. By analyzing the frequency, differentiation, and expansion of these SARS-CoV-2
      S protein specific CD8 T cells, we hope to shed light into the CD8 T cell response to
      COVID-19 vaccine and its change with age.
