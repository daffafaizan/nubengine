      with cognitive behavioral therapies for PTSD, but combined initial treatment of PTSD has not
      been studied under controlled conditions. Also, there are few studies of either treatment in
      survivors of terrorism. This randomized controlled trial evaluates efficacy of combined
      prolonged exposure (PE) and the SSRI paroxetine in the treatment of survivors of the World
      Trade Center (WTC) attacks.
