      consequences such as lung diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, aging, skin lesions, and
      benefit of quitting such as improved cardiopulmonary functions, skin conditions and risk of
      diseases, etc. The effects of the information are limited by the generic messages,
      unattractive images, and lack of interaction. This proposal aims to enhance the "Warn" and
      "Advice" materials using mobile phone-based augmented reality (AR) technologies to provide
      personalized, interactive, and attractive images to encourage smokers to quit smoking.
