      adult patients with MDD. the investigators hypothesized that MDD patients taking add-on PTX
      would present greater amelioration of their depressive symptoms than patients taking add-on
      placebo. Furthermore, the investigators assessed the relationship between HAM-D score and
      several peripheral biomarkers as well as their role in diagnosis and therapeutic targets of
      MDD.
