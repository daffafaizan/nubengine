      alpha plus oral isotretinoin in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the
      following body sites: head and neck, cervix, skin, esophagus, lung, and penis. II. Determine
      the toxicities and side effects of this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-agent Chemotherapy with Biological Response Modifier
      Therapy. Isotretinoin, 13-CRA, NSC-329481; with Interferon alpha (Schering or Hoffmann-La
      Roche), IFN-A, NSC-377523 or NSC-367982.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14-50 patients per tumor category (and any other tumor location, if
      available) will be enrolled. If none of the first 14 patients in any tumor category responds,
      or if only 1/22, 2/30, 3/37, 4/44, or 5/50 respond, the treatment will be considered
      ineffective for that tumor type.
