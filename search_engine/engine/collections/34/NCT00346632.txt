      leukemias, high risk MDS, and CML who are not candidates for approved therapy. Over an
      18-month period, the investigative sites collectively will enroll up to a total of 96
      subjects. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of 7 dose groups to evaluate 2 dosing
      schedules (Arm A = 14 consecutive days of dosing followed by a 7-28 day rest period as
      determined by recovery from any acute hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities, or Arm B =
      28 consecutive days of dosing followed by a 7-28 day rest period, as determined by recovery
      from any acute hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities). The safety of a dose level in Arm
      A (14-day dosing regimen) will be established prior to enrollment of subjects in the same
      dose level in Arm B (28-day dosing regimen).

      In April 2007 the protocol was amended to discontinue Arm B (28 consecutive days of dosing).
      The protocol will continue as planned for Arm A (14 days of consecutive dosing).

      Enrollment will proceed until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established for each
      study Arm. Once the MTD has been reached, 12 additional subjects, with 1 or more of the
      hematologic conditions included in this study, may be enrolled at the MTD as an expanded
      safety cohort.
