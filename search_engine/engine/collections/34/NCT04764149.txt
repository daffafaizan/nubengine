      high sensitivity to ionizing radiation, but failure in local control was observed in
      approximately 15% of patients.

      Chemotherapy is the cornerstone of the treatment of recurrent NPC. Many studies were aimed at
      the systemic treatment of recurrent NPC, but most of them were retrospective studies or phase
      II trials with small samples. Platinum-containing doublet chemotherapy is generally regarded
      as the standard treatment for recurrent NPC. After a multicenter phase III randomized
      clinical trial was published in 2016, gemcitabine plus cisplatin is recommended, however,
      less than 60% of patients could complete the treatment in the trail. Finding a proper regimen
      with promising efficacy results as well as high tolerance is still a big challenge.

      Cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (PF) is a classical regimen widely used in recurrent NPC. The
      continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil with low dose was investigated in esophagus carcinoma,
      rectal carcinoma and prostate carcinoma with encouraging outcome and acceptable toxicity.
      Whereas, data of platinum containing chemotherapy with low-dose continuous infused
      5-fluorouracil in recurrent NPC was absent. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
      antitumor activity of platinum plus low-dose long-term continuous intravenous infused
      5-fluorouracil (PFLL).
