      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AUR101 in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

      Approximately 108 patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (defined as
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥12 and Body Surface Area (BSA) involved ≥10%) will
      be randomized to six groups (five dose groups of AUR101 and one placebo group) in the ratio
      of 1:1:1:1:1:1.

      The patients in each arm will receive AUR101 of 100 mg twice daily, 200 mg twice daily, 300
      mg twice daily, 400 mg twice daily, 400 mg once daily or matching placebo for 12 weeks in a
      double blind, double dummy fashion. All patients will be followed up for 14 ± 2 days of their
      last dose for safety assessment.
