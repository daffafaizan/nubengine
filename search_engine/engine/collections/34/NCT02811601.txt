      paradigm (percutaneous externally assembled laparoscopy, or PEAL) in porcine and cadaveric
      models in order to allow laparoscopic surgery to take place with improved cosmesis and
      decreased pain while still allowing the use of larger instruments and maintaining instrument
      triangulation. The investigators now seek to study the use of these instruments in the human
      patients undergoing laparoscopic urologic surgery.

      This will be a single-arm prospective internally-controlled study. Patients will undergo
      percutaneous externally-assembled laparoscopic urologic surgery where one or more 3 mm
      instruments are added or substituted for conventional 5 or 10 mm trocars. Multiple outcome
      measures (endpoints) will be measured including time to first opioid use, total inpatient
      opioid dosage, patient ranking of painfulness of each port site, duration of ileus, time to
      ambulation, length of hospital stay, presence of any intraoperative or postoperative
      complications, operating time, estimated blood loss, and other routine parameters collected
      in a prospective surgical study.
