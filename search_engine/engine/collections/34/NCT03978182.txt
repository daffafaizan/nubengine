    
      An initially double-blind sham-controlled cross-over study in geriatric depressed patients to
      investigate whether accelerated (a)dTMS is a safe and effective clinical option for this
      cohort. After the first week evaluations and MRI, there will be an open label phase in which
      patients who did receive active treatment in the first week will not receive any further rTMS
      sessions, those patients who had received sham however will get their active treatment in the
      second week. The independent researcher will use the treatment allocation list to inform the
      investigators if an active treatment faze is needed in the second week.
