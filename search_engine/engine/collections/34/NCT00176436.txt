      Watchers group to help patients lose the weight they have gained taking olanzapine or
      clozapine. All participants should have been on Olanzapine or clozapine for at least 6 months
      and gained 7% of baseline weight or have a BMI of 27 or greater. In addition to the group
      support, participants are provided supervised exercise sessions and medical supervision.
      Previous studies of the group process alone were successful in helping patients lose weight.
      It is hoped that the addition of atomoxetine, which is known to cause appetite suppression,
      will be more effective in helping subjects lose weight. All subjects will receive either
      atomoxetine or placebo during the 6 month study.
