      metastatic disease which will not be irradiated will be candidates for the study. Patients
      will be randomized (1:1) to CBI combined with SBRT or CBI alone. SBRT at 9.5Gy x3 fractions
      will be delivered within 1-21 days of the start of first cycle of CBI. The first six patients
      will be treated and observed for toxicity in the safety run-in phase for 30 days after
      radiation before continuing with further accrual. Radiation dose reduction is allowed if
      necessary to meet tissue constraints (6Gyx3 Minimum Dose). Response rates will be determined
      from the non-irradiated lesion/lesions. Blood draws will be obtained to analyze anti-tumor
      immune responses.
