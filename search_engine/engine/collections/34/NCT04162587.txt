    
      Patients:

      Ischemic stroke patients admitted to Neurology department in Mansoura University hospital
      (MUH) will be studied

      The patients will be grouped as follow:

        1. Patients with significant carotid stenosis without intracranial stenosis.

        2. Patients with carotid and intracranial stenosis.

        3. Patients with lone intracranial stenosis.

        4. patients with no significant carotid or intracranial stenosis.

      Methods:

      Studied patients will undergo the following:

        -  Clinical assessment with NIH scale with is a systematic assessment tool that provides a
           quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit, Modified Rankin Scale, Arabic
           version of Montereal Coginitive Assessment and Arabic version of Beck's Depression
           Inventory at presentation and after 6 months.

        -  carotid duplex+/- MRA neck and brain MRA+/-CT angio on carotid and brain (at 0day) and
           6m after.

        -  MRI brain with diffusion to detect asymptomatic stroke at 0 day and 6 months later.

        -  DSA (digital subtraction angiography) in some cases to confirm diagnosis.

        -  Laboratory investigations: complete blood count, liver function and renal function
           tests, random blood sugar, lipid profile.

      All patients will be treated with acetyle-salicylic acid(150/day) +/-clopidogrel (75mg /day)
      +/- statins, plus modification of risk factors.
