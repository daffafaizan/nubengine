      impairment and high personal distress for those who suffer. Psychological treatment for SAD
      has traditionally been verbal-linguistic cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). However, a
      significant number of individuals who complete CBT for SAD do not achieve full response and
      continue to struggle with significant residual symptoms. One innovation that has received
      attention recently in the literature is using imagery-based CBT as a way to augment treatment
      outcome in SAD. Results from a pilot and benchmarking study suggest that participants who
      received imagery-based CBT were more likely to complete treatment than those who received
      traditional CBT and treatment outcome was strong for both groups, but stronger in the
      imagery-based CBT group.

      However, before re-training hundreds of practitioners in using a completely novel treatment
      approach, it is important to see if a brief augmentation of traditional CBT programs is
      effective in producing further change for individuals with residual symptoms after group CBT.
      It is possible that individuals just require a few more sessions of the same
      verbal-linguistic CBT to consolidate treatment gains or work on lingering triggers of
      anxiety. It is also possible that more of the same is not as valuable as offering therapy
      using a different modality, such as imagery. Therefore, we propose to evaluate a brief
      imagery-based augmentation of traditional group CBT to explore its effects on further symptom
      reduction.
