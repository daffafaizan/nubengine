      efficiently close wounds across various levels of muscle, fat, fascia and/or skin.

      Surgical sutures continue to be the material of choice for wound closure. However,
      complications of sutures are those associated with tying knots to secure the suture. Examples
      of associated suture complications, although not comprehensive, include knot breakage and
      slippage, suture extrusion or spitting, infection, ischemia and scarring, reduced wound
      strength and inflammation and dehiscence.

      Both interrupted and continuous suture patterns require knots for suture line security when
      conventional suture constructs are used. Barbed sutures are designed to eliminate the need
      for tying knots during closure, thus ameliorating the detrimental aspects of knots.
