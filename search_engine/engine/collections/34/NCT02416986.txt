    
      Adult smokers (n=25) will complete 4 visits and a 6 month follow-up phone call. Participants
      will complete a Delay to Smoking Task following 6 hours smoking abstinence. The task involves
      viewing pictures of smoking and non-smoking locations and participants will have the choice
      to smoke a cigarette at any time during the session. A monetary reinforcer will be provided
      for each 6-minute period that a participant resists smoking. Once participants stop the task
      they can choose to smoke as much or a little as they want for the next 30 minutes.
      Participants will be provided with a smoking tab. Each cigarette they light will cost them
      from their tab. Measurements of tobacco craving, emotion ratings, and nicotine withdrawal
      will be assessed.
