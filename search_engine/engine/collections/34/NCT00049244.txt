        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of BMS-247550 and capecitabine, on 2 different
           schedules, in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with a taxane
           and an anthracycline.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, any antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine
           twice daily on days 1-14.

        -  Group II: Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 and capecitabine as in
           group I.

      Treatment in both groups repeats every 3 weeks for 2-18 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 and capecitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined for each group. The MTD is defined as the dose at
      which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients
      are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed for at least 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 34-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-12
      months.
