      insomnia can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, senile dementia,
      anxiety, and depression. Therefore, the insomnia sparked a heated discussion in medical
      research.

      It has a good effect in treating insomnia with TCM,but there are problems such as strong
      subjectivity of syndrome differentiation and large difference in efficacy between doctors.

      The previous study found that the infrared Image reflects the visceral function of insomnia
      patients to a certain extent.Modern studies have shown that insomnia is closely related to
      the dysfunction of functional coordination between the brain's sleep and the arousal center,
      and neuroactive substances played an important role on it."Syndrome" is the key of clinical
      diagnosis and treatment of TCM. Investigators believe that the central nervous system
      imbalance of different syndrome of insomnia has a certain correlation with the infrared
      Image.
