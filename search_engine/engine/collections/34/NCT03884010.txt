      in professional male soccer player aged 18 years and older. Standardized and certified
      personnel carried out anthropometric measurements and DXA whole body scan the same day.

      Skeletal muscle mass was estimated with several anthropometric equations. The reference
      skeletal muscle mass was obtained assessing appendicular lean soft tissue from a whole-body
      DXA scan and then transformed into skeletal muscle mass with Kim equation (2002).

      The estimated skeletal muscle mass from anthropometric equations was compared with DXA, and
      those with non-significant differences were further analyzed for calculating mean differences
      and 95% limits of agreement with DXA. This analysis was carried out for all equations.
