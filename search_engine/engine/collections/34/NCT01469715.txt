      maintenance of strict glycemic control without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia and for
      the successful implementation of an artificial pancreas. Glucose binding protein-based (GBP)
      continuous glucose monitors offer several potential advantages over commercially available
      glucose oxidase based sensors. Unlike glucose oxidase based sensors, GBP sensors do not
      require establishment of an equilibrium reduction/oxidation reaction and are not as
      susceptible to interference from other compounds because they are engineered to recognize
      only glucose. As a result, GBP-based glucose sensors are exceptionally accurate at low blood
      glucose levels and have a faster warm-up time than glucose oxidase based systems. The
      principal idea of this proposal is to evaluate the accuracy and performance of a second
      generation glucose binding protein-based continuous glucose monitor (GBP CGM) developed by BD
      Technologies in subjects with type 1 diabetes, with emphasis on warm-up period after
      insertion, accuracy in hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges, and lag time over a 24 hour
      period of sensor use. In order to accomplish this, the investigators will conduct a clinical
      trial consisting of 25.5-hour studies involving 15 subjects, each wearing one active and one
      mock (no GBP) device simultaneously during meals and induced hypoglycemia to observe a wide
      range of glucose values. The investigators envision that the glucose binding protein-based
      continuous glucose monitor will demonstrate minimal warm-up time after insertion, overall
      accuracy comparable to commercial glucose oxidase sensors with excellent performance in the
      hypoglycemic range and a nominal lag time to sensing a change in blood glucose.
