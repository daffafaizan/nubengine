      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In recent years studies have been published
      presenting the relationship between heart failure (HF) and central sleep apnea (CSA). CSA
      associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a form of periodic breathing in which central
      apneas and hypopnea alternate with periods of hyperventilation, characterized by a regular
      crescendo-decrescendo oscillation of tidal volume, which is thought to be caused by
      dysfunction of central respiratory control. Unlike, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), CSA likely
      arises as a consequence of HF.Since 2002, several results have reported on the benefit of
      atrial overdrive (AOP) pacing in patients suffering from sleep apnea. These results could not
      be confirmed for obstructive sleep apnea in several subsequent studies. Cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been proposed as another potential therapeutic pacing
      approach for CSA by two recently published investigations.The combined therapeutic impact of
      AOP and CRT (CRT+AOP) so far has not been investigated.We aimed to evaluate the effect of CRT
      alone and CRT+AOP on CSA in patients with CHF.
