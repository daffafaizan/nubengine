      Despite this large number of critically ill patients treated annually, little research exists
      in the area of acute severe hypertension, specifically hypertensive emergency, a serious
      condition that contributes to morbidity and mortality.

      Two agents that are commonly used to treat acute hypertensive crisis include labetalol and
      nicardipine. Cardene may provide benefits in titration and has shown to have lower dosage
      adjustments compared to labetalol. Nicardipine has also shown a decreased need for additional
      antihypertensives when compared to labetalol in patients with stroke in a neurological ICU.
