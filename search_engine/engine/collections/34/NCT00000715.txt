      many patients treated with the two standard treatments, PEN given by injections and SMX/TMP,
      have had adverse effects that required a change in treatment. There is also a high relapse
      rate after the standard treatments. Preliminary experiments in humans suggest that
      aerosolized PEN is as effective as the standard treatments for PCP, and causes few adverse
      effects.

      Patients entered in the study are randomly assigned to aerosolized PEN or to intravenous
      SMX/TMP, for a 21-day trial. SMX/TMP is given 4 times a day and aerosolized PEN once a day.
      Doses are determined by body size. Patients who receive aerosolized PEN also receive a
      placebo intravenous injection and patients who receive SMX/TMP also receive a placebo
      aerosol. Patients are hospitalized at least 5 days. Patients who improve may be discharged
      after 5 days at the discretion of the attending physician. Discharged patients continue the
      study with oral SMX/TMP and aerosolized placebo or aerosolized PEN and oral placebo. Patients
      who fail to respond or who develop severe adverse effects are switched to intravenous PEN or
      other standard therapy. During the 21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used. AZT may be
      resumed after therapy for the acute PCP episode is completed.
