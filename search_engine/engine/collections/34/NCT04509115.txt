    
      The purpose of this study is to characterize patient pain and opioid use after an initial
      opioid prescription for acute pain. The investigators aim to enroll a total of 300 patients
      receiving a prescription for an opioid in primary and urgent care, inpatient care (child
      birth and total knee arthroplasty), and in the emergency department. Patients not currently
      using opioids who receive a new short-acting opioid prescription for acute pain will be
      recruited and followed prospectively for 180 days to assess pain trajectories, analgesic and
      non-pharmacologic treatment use, activity, and health care service use. The patient-centered
      health data sharing platform (Hugo) will be used to collect patient-reported outcomes and
      structured data from pharmacy and electronic health records patient portals as well as
      patient-generated data collected through personal digital devices (Fitbit).

      Specific aims

        1. To assess patients' pain and opioid use patterns in episodes of acute pain for which
           opioids were prescribed, characterizing pain severity and persistence, as well as other
           prescription and over-the-counter pain medication use

        2. To examine associations between patient demographic, clinical and emotional
           characteristics and outcomes of pain severity and persistence, opioid and non-opioid
           treatment patterns, satisfaction with care, and barriers to care

        3. To assess how patients handled unused opioids
