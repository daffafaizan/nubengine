    
      This study is an open label Phase I trial to determine the safety and feasibility of bone
      marrow-derived mononuclear cells to the right ventricle of subjects with Ebstein anomaly at
      the time of a planned surgical Ebstein repair compared to the control group undergoing the
      same planned surgical intervention without the cell delivery add-on procedure. Subjects will
      be screened at outpatient clinic visits at Mayo Clinic and interested qualified subjects will
      be consented and offered participation in this trial. Subject/Family will decide to
      participate in cell delivery or control arm. Once informed consent has been obtained,
      subjects will undergo identical evaluation (other than Hematology consultation and BM harvest
      occurring only in the cell-treatment group),preoperative values will be established/confirmed
      and a selection committee will review subjects within three days prior to planned procedure
      to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria.However, individuals at high-risk, primarily
      neonates and those with preoperative advanced right heart failure will NOT be included such
      that the risk of this add-on procedure may not be acceptable. Following surgical Ebstein
      repair for the control group and following cell-based product delivery for the treatment
      group, all subjects will be followed for 24-months according to a pre-determined schedule
      that includes imaging studies along with a questionnaire, electrophysiology and laboratory
      studies at 1, 6, and 24 months post procedure. All subjects will be contacted for
      surveillance by phone at 3, 12, and 18 month post procedure.
