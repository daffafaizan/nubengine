        -  Determine the impact of current procedures for diagnosis, management, and follow-up on
           disease status of patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

        -  Determine the natural history of patients with CML who achieve response to imatinib
           mesylate.

        -  Determine the health perceptions, symptoms, insurance issues, and work issues of these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether medication compliance and planned dose reduction affect imatinib
           mesylate effectiveness in these patients.

        -  Determine the molecular and biologic factors associated with disease progression and
           good and poor response to imatinib mesylate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a longitudinal, prospective, cohort study.

      Patients complete quality of life, functional status, medical and treatment history, and
      medication questionnaires at baseline and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and then every 6 months for 5 years. Specimens may be
      examined in the future in gene array studies and mutation analyses.
