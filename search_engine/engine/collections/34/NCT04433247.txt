      Project has reduced eating disorder symptoms and future eating disorder onset over 3-4 year
      follow-up, produced larger reductions in outcomes than credible alternative interventions,
      been shown to engage the intervention target (valuation of the thin beauty ideal), and
      produced effects in trials from several independent teams. Although undergraduate
      peer-educator-led Body Project groups have produced larger reductions in outcomes than an
      eating disorder education video, an unmoderated Internet-based prevention program, and even
      clinician-led Body Project groups, it can be logistically difficult to schedule in-person
      Body Project groups with high school and college students. One solution to this key
      implementation barrier is to have peer educators deliver Body Project groups virtually over
      the Internet. A pilot trial in Sweden provided initial evidence that virtually-delivered
      peer-led Body Project groups produced greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms and
      future onset of eating disorders than an active expressive-writing intervention. The proposed
      pilot study will evaluate whether Body Project produces greater reductions in risk factor
      symptoms, eating disorder symptoms, and future onset of eating disorders in this population.

      Participation in the intervention will last four weeks. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to the intervention condition or waitlist-control condition. Assessments will take
      place at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6 month follow up. Waitlist control
      participants will receive the intervention after they complete their post-test assessment.
