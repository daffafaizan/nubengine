      treatment regimen will be eligible to enroll prior to surgical resection of the primary
      tumor. Following implantation of fiducial markers within the tumor bed and autologous
      hematopoietic rescue, patients will begin the planning process for abdominal irradiation;
      this requires multiple baseline studies, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), renal scintigraphy, and bloodwork. Most of these tests will be
      repeated on a varying schedule over the five year follow-up period of the protocol, in order
      to evaluate the impact of conformal radiotherapy on intra-abdominal tissues.

      Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery will follow current conventional
      volume-targeting guidelines, however, appropriate application within the abdomen will be
      determined by ascertaining intra-abdominal organ motion and the potential for reducing normal
      tissue dose, while simultaneously increasing dose delivered to target tissues, particularly
      when dose escalation for gross residual disease is required. Concurrent neuro-hormonal tests,
      cytokine analyses, functional and morphologic imaging will generate novel data describing the
      acute and chronic effects of radiotherapy within the abdomen.

      NOTE: This study is currently closed to accrual, however, it is expected to re-open to
      accrual later in 2015.
