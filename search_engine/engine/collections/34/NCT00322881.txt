      Primary

      â€¢To determine the completion rate of six cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel with no dose
      reductions because of toxicities.

      Secondary

        -  Assess cancer antigen 125 (CA125) response rates of paclitaxel/carboplatin in this group
           of patients

        -  Assess significant toxicities in this group of patients and compare to a non-elderly
           population.

        -  To determine which clinical parameters will predict lack of completion of six cycles of
           carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy.

        -  Assess quality of life changes during chemotherapy and up to one year after completion
           of chemotherapy.

        -  Assess progression-free survival and overall survival for this group.

        -  To determine the feasibility of accrual.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      Using a one sample binomial design, with 37 patients there was 83% power to detect a null
      hypothesis of a 45% therapy completion rate versus an alternative hypothesis of a 66% rate
      assuming a one-sided 5% alpha. The regimen would be declared ineffective if there were 19 or
      fewer patients who completed 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy without dose
      adjustments.
