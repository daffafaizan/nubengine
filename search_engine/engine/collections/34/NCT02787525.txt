    
      Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia with an estimated prevalence
      of 1-2% in the general population, increasing with age. Patients with AF are at increased
      risk of thromboembolism, in particular ischemic stroke.

      LAAC seems at the actual knowledge to be a valid alternative to OAC. The objective of this
      study is to compare intermedium-term clinical outcomes, including thromboembolic events and
      bleeding complications between patients receiving Amplatzer devices vs. propensity score
      matched patients treated with OAC.

      A questionnaire is sent to the patients asking about thrombo-embolic events, stroke, death,
      any bleeding but also on their current medication, comorbidities (i.e. arterial hypertension,
      diabetes mellitus, renal impairment and liver disease), any hospitalizations and their
      quality of life. If there is some information missing or unclear, the investigators will
      contact the patient or the treating physicians to get the missing information.

      The study is an investigator-initiated, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected
      data. The study population consists of 500 patients with non-valvular AF who underwent LAAC
      between the years 2009 and 2014 in two centers (the Bern University hospital und Zurich
      University hospital) and a propensity score matched patients group of 500 patients with
      non-valvular AF treated with OAC.

      Covariates for matching will be age, gender, renal function, coronary artery disease and its
      status of revascularization, left-ventricular function, HAS-BLED and CHA2DS2-VASc-Score.

      Study hypothesis is that left atrial appendage closure is non-inferior in terms of efficacy
      and safety in comparison to lifelong oral anticoagulation in patients with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation.
