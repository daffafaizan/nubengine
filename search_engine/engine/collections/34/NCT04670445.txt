    
      This two-part study will 1) refine and 2) pilot test an intervention to improve participant's
      and caregiver knowledge and increase communication with the oncology team about
      immunotherapy.

      - The intervention involves watching a video developed to educate patients regarding the
      risks, benefits, and potential outcomes of immunotherapy treatment and reviewing an
      immunotherapy-focused QPL prior to ICI initiation.

        -  In Part 1 of this study, investigators will conduct a small open pilot to refine the
           intervention and study procedures.

        -  In Part 2, investigators will conduct a single-site pilot randomized controlled trial
           including 130 patients and their caregivers, to evaluate the feasibility of intervention
           delivery, and the preliminary efficacy of the intervention in improving patient and
           caregiver knowledge.
