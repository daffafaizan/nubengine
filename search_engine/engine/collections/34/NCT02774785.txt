    
      Almost 60% of all patients diagnosed with breast cancer (48000 annually in the UK) undergo
      breast conserving surgery (BCS. Surgical removal of the cancer aims to reduce the risk of
      local recurrence and patient mortality. In order to minimise the amount of tissue removed,
      excision up to the cancer-free area (margins) is undertaken. Further surgery, following
      initial breast cancer surgery, is required in 25% - 30% of patients because of disease found
      at the edges of the tissue removed.

      Reducing the need for further operations benefits patients (by reducing the number of
      operations required, improving cosmetic outcome and minimising anxiety) and the NHS (by
      realising economic benefits).

      MarginProbe, a disposable probe which measures the margins of tissue removed during breast
      cancer surgery, allows the surgeon to remove further tissue during the same surgical
      procedure to clear any involved margins, minimising subsequent re-operations. Four hundred
      and sixty patients in 6 specialist Breast Units will be randomly allocated after BCS (and
      specimen radiology), by telephone randomisation, to either:

        -  MarginProbe assessment of the surgical specimen with re-excision of margins if required;

        -  Standard BCS (clinical and radiological clear margins) whereby the wound will be closed
           and the surgery completed (standard UK practice).
