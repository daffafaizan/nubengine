      Testing based on questions 5,6,7, and 11 of the National Eye Institute 25 item visual
      function questionnaire, (NEI VFQ-25) which includes a speed reading test, identifying
      objects, physically taking them and returning the items to correct original placement, once
      with glasses only, once with the head mounted visual device placed over the worst eye
      visually. There will also be an video tracks showing a conversation between 2 individuals -
      Subjects will be queried about the facial expressions of the actors during the conversation.
      The device is a wide field of view (FOV) monocular head-mounted visual enhancement device
      (HMD). The HMD has a camera mounted coaxially with the visual axis of the worse vision eye,
