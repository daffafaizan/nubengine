      important public health problems. As the most common etiology of ICH/IPH is hypertension,
      this places a large proportion of the population at risk. In 2011 The American Heart
      Association (AHA) estimated that in the US, there were 610,000 new stroke cases of which 10%
      were ICHs, and many required long-term health care. ICH/IPH is associated with the highest
      morbidity and mortality and only 20% of patients regain functional independence. Temperature
      modulation to hypothermia (T, 32-34Â°C) has been associated with modulation of
      physiopathologic processes associated with inflammatory activation and degradation of
      blood-brain barrier after all types of brain injury. Currently, there are no therapies to
      specifically target ICH/IPH. To this end, novel strategies that go beyond control of glucose,
      blood pressure, and intra-cranial pressure, aimed at reducing the enlargement of the hematoma
      and "swelling" surrounding it, could be "the new frontier in the management of ICH/IPH".
      Since the early resuscitation phase in the Neuro-ICU represents the greatest opportunity for
      impact on clinical outcome after ICH/IPH, it also appears to be the most promising window of
      opportunity to demonstrate a benefit when investigating novel therapies.
