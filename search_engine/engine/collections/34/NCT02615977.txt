      matched controls. All subjects will be treated with Zooming Joystick Task (ZJT) training to
      alter a habitual alcohol cue approach bias. The primary aim of this project is to assess

        1. which behavioural and neuroimaging alterations (fMRI) associated with reward-based
           learning are altered by ZJT treatment and which alterations predict treatment outcome
           (primary outcome: relapse, secondary outcome: amount of alcohol intake) within the
           follow-up period of 6 months,

        2. how these alterations interact with clinical and psychosocial factors that can modify
           relapse risk, and

        3. to provide data for genetic and imaging analyses and modelling. Furthermore, the
           investigators will explore gender effects on functional imaging parameters of learning.

      Patients will be detoxified in an inpatient setting, receive six sessions of the ZJT in a
      randomized placebo controlled design and will be followed for six months using the Time-Line
      Follow-Back Procedure. Clinical assessments, behavioural paradigms of learning, and brain
      imaging will be carried out within at least four half-lives after any psychotropic
      medication. Subjects will undergo medical management with biweekly follow-ups and predefined
      inclusion and exclusion criteria as previously described. Functional imaging paradigms will
      be applied, assessing

        1. Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer,

        2. habitual versus goal directed behaviour and

        3. working memory.

      The investigators will associate model parameters of learning with functional activation and
      prospective intake controlling for comorbidity, psychosocial and neurobiological disease
      severity markers.
