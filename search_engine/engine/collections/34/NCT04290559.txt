    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a higher risk of stroke, heart failure and
      deterioration in patients' quality of life and it also has great effect on health care
      resource utilization due to increasing morbidity and mortality. Catheter ablation has shown
      to improve patients' quality of life (QOL), even in those who undergo a repeat procedure,
      equalizing healthy population and lowering subsequent health care resource utilization.

      Success rates are usually based on an endpoint of total elimination of AF, typically absence
      of any AF recurrence >30 seconds. While this is a high standard for clinical trial reporting,
      it does not necessarily measure the "clinical" success, since many patients will experience
      significant reduction in their AF burden with accompanying improvement in their functional
      status despite having ongoing brief recurrences of AF.

      This is a prospective non-randomized, single-arm, cohort study. 200 patients with persistent
      atrial fibrillation undergoing catheter ablation will be enroled. AF burden post procedure
      will be evaluated with continuous monitoring with an implantable loop recorder (ILR) to
      assess recurrences and AF burden. QOL will be measured using the CCS-SAF severity scale,
      SF-36 and AFEQT scales pre-ablation and at 12 and 24 months.
