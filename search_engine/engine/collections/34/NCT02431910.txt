      members each: control group (CG) - 10 minutes at rest; placebo group (PG) - Kinesio Taping
      (KT) without application of tension in the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus (VM) and rectus
      femoris (RF); and Kinesio Taping group (KTG) - application of KT with tension in VL, VM and
      RF. All volunteers will be evaluated for their distance from the single and triple hop test,
      postural balance (baropodometry), the joint position sense (JPS), the knee extensor torque
      (concentric and eccentric assessment at 60 Â°/s) and electromyographic activity of the VL
      muscle in five distinct stages: the first before the intervention (AV1), the second
      immediately after (AV2) and the following three 24h (AV3), 48 (AV4) after the intervention
      protocol. Soon after the AV4, KT will be removed after 24 hours and take place the last
      review (AV5).
