      a result of traditional securement techniques (dressings). These issues lead to the patients'
      increased health care utilization and possibly to restriction of movement and delayed
      development as the children are restricted in their home environment. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if a wearable central line securement device, can decrease the number
      of line breaks, line dislodgment and line infections as compared to traditional securement
      techniques. The hypothesis is that the use of this wearable central line securement device
      can reduce line breaks, line dislodgment and line infections as compared to the traditional
      adhesive dressing. A secondary outcome for evaluation will be quality of life. Children are
      naturally active, however their activity is restricted by the parents given the delicate
      nature of their line. This study looks to see if quality of life can be improved a more
      secure wearable attachment device, as compared to traditional securement techniques.
