      responsive to therapy, drug resistance commonly evolves.

      Novel mechanisms of drug resistance in ovarian cancer have been identified and include
      genetic mutations that result in the activation of a drug efflux pump and secondary mutations
      in BRCA1/2 genes that restore the cancer cell's ability to repair treatment related DNA
      damage. It is hypothesized that patients with BRCA1/2 mutant high grade serous ovarian cancer
      or carcinosarcoma who have progressed on recent therapy and have an activated efflux pump
      without a secondary BRCA1/1 mutation will be selectively sensitive to a new PARPi, Pamiparib,
      which does not get effluxed out of cancer cells.

      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the clinical benefit rate at > 4 months in 2
      cohorts of patients (cohort 1: post substrate-PARP inhibitor and cohort 2: post chemotherapy)
      defined as response or absence of progression. Secondary objectives are to determine the
      median progression free and overall survival of patients treated with Pamiparib and the
      impact on symptom burden and benefit.
