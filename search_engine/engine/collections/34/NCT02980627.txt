      management of type 1 diabetes (T1D); despite this, there are no effective treatments.
      Combining the use of mobile technology with individual therapy may help individuals with T1D
      identify their triggers for insulin omission in their natural environment and cope more
      effectively. In the current study, the investigators examine whether pairing a mobile
      application, Recovery Record, with individual therapy helps reduce intentional insulin
      omission for weight control among individuals with T1D. In Phase 1, the investigators build
      T1D-specific content into the Recovery Record app based on our empirical evidence of triggers
      for insulin omission and qualitative feedback from T1D patients. The fully functional app is
      beta tested with 10 T1D patients who intentionally omit insulin. In Phase 2, 25 T1D patients
      that misuse insulin complete 3 months of app-supported individual treatment and 6 months of
      follow-up. The investigators test whether treatment is associated with decreases in mean
      blood glucose, eating disorder symptoms and emergency care utilization. The investigators
      also test whether frequency of app use in months 0-3 corresponds with outcomes, and calculate
      attrition..
