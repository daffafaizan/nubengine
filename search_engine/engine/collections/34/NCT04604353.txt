    
      Patients undergoing a polygenic risk score (PRS), metabolic risk score (MRS) and coronary
      calcium score (CCS) will be randomized to receive PRS and CCS information and followed for
      the reduction of risk over 12 months. This information will provide information about how to
      motivate people to adhere to therapy, by providing feedback in a meaningful form to both the
      clinicians and the patients.
