      concerns with PRP's long term outcomes. Another option that has become more popular for
      physicians treating this debilitation condition is bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMA),
      which use's undifferentiated cells found in the bone marrow to promote healing and tissue
      regeneration. These cells have the ability to replicate into a multiple different tissue
      types. With BMA, the marrow is concentrated provide better healing of the damaged tissue and
      aid in growth and repair. The full benefits of BMA are still unknown, but studies have shown
      the treatment can reduce swelling, relieve pain, and improve healing in articular cartilage
      and bone grafts.

      Autologous BMA has shown promising clinical potential as a therapeutic agent in regenerative
      medicine, including the treatment of osteoarthritis and cartilage defects, and the clinical
      efficacy platelet rich plasma has been documented to alleviate symptoms related to knee
      osteoarthritis. However, randomized, prospective comparison of the two techniques has not
      been reported in the literature and long term follow-up for both treatments is limited, and
      especially limited in the use of BMA for osteoarthritis treatment.
