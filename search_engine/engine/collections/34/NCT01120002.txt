      which has a higher receptor selectivity and activity for the Retinoic Acid Receptor subtypes
      compared to the natural retinoid.

      Tamibarotene decreased insoluble amyloid-beta (Ab) 42 deposition in APP mice, and also
      increased TTR, VAChT and ACh in the brain of SAMP8 mice, which suggest the enhancement of
      neurotransmission. In the behavioral model such as reduced anxiety of SAMP8 mice and rat
      passive avoidance test, tamibarotene showed improvement.

      Tamibarotene as in other retinoids are known to moderate the immune system and reduce
      inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which may control the excessive stimulation of
      astrocyte and microglia around the Ab plaque. Tamibarotene reduced cytokines and showed
      clinical efficacy in the rat experimental autoimmune encephalitis model.

      Furthermore, retinoids are known to have critical roles during the regeneration stage in the
      differentiation from neural stem cells (NSC).

      In spinal cord injured rats treated with tamibarotene showed better recovery compared to the
      control.

      By these preclinical results, we plan by this study to evaluate the efficacy together with
      the safety of tamibarotene to the patients of Alzheimer's Disease.

      Tamibarotene is used clinically in Japan since 2005. It's side effects are known to be
      similar to that of other clinically used retinoids.
