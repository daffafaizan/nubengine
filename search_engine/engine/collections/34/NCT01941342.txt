      peri-ampullary cancer. It is regarded that proper surgical resection is the only possible way
      of radical cure for those patients without evidence of metastasis. Since high preoperative
      bilirubin level is suggested to be a risk factor for pancreatoduodenectomy, preoperative
      biliary drainage has been applied to clinical practice to improve the outcome of surgery.
      However, results from previous studies have inconsistent results showing that PBD may have
      adverse effect on patients by elevating the prevalence of complications. Since PBD is widely
      performed worldwide, its value needs to be clarified. Thus the present study is designed to
      systematically evaluate the value of PBD via recruiting participants who may most likely
      benefit from PBD. It is anticipated that results from this study can present an instructive
      conclusion on whether PBD should be performed prior to pancreatoduodenectomy as well as
      reveal the preferable type of PBD.
