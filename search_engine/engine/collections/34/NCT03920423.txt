      phase, factors relative to success catheterization without posterior puncture and success in
      first attempt are evaluated. In validation phase, patients are randomized into different
      depth group with or without injection of saline. Success without posterior wall puncture,
      success in first attempt and overall, catheterization time are compared between groups.
