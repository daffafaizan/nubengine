      a great opportunity to improve fitness and to decrease cardio-metabolic disturbances, to
      prevent excessive weight gain, to improve general health status, and to reduce health care
      utilization. Furthermore, beneficial effects of fitness on adverse maternal health outcomes
      related to obesity might decrease the development of long-term obesity and metabolic
      repercussions in the offspring.

      The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) recommends that all women
      without contraindication be encouraged to participate in aerobic and strength-conditioning
      exercises as part of a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy. Despite these recommendations,
      obese women are inactive during pregnancy and are currently still at high risk of poor
      physical fitness.

      Thus, although exercise clearly improves maternal health status and thus potentially prevents
      adverse perinatal outcomes, obese pregnant women poorly adhere to experts' recommendations
      about the need for exercise during pregnancy. Therefore, this situation justifies the need to
      develop adapted strategies aimed at increasing the implementation of guideline
      recommendations in this population.
