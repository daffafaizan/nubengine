      the control group will take part in three conditions whereby participants will receive a high
      GI, a low GI, or a water breakfast delivered in a counterbalanced order. Participants will
      then perform the battery of cognitive tests on 2 occasions throughout the morning; 30 minutes
      after breakfast and 180 minutes after breakfast. Blood glucose will be measured from
      capillary finger-prick blood samples using diabetic glucose meters throughout the morning.
