    
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial at 7 years of follow-up comparing two
      level ProDisc-C vivo artificial cervical disc replacement and hybrid construct, i.e.,
      combining ACDF (Anterior cervical discectomy fusion) and ProDisc-C vivo to treat degenerative
      disc disease (DDD). 542 DDD patients (age from 20 to 70) from several hospitals matching the
      inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to two groups (271 patients in each group). One
      group will be treated with two level ProDisc-C vivo disc replacement. The other group will be
      treated with hybrid construct. Clinical outcomes and radiological analysis will be done at
      1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 84 months after the surgical treatments.
