      Eisenmenger's Syndrome in order to determine the effect of endothelin receptor antagonists,
      alone or in combination, with Sildenafil, on symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. This review
      will be conducted on Standard of Care procedures such as New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      classification, six-minute walk exercise capacity, pulmonary pressures and oxygens
      saturations. Pulmonary pressures determined by echo or cardiac catheterization will be
      analyzed where available. We hypothesize that patients with congenital heart defects who
      develop ES will have an improved six-minute walk distance, improved pulmonary arterial
      pressures and improved oxygenation after treatment with endothelin receptor antagonists and
      other pulmonary vasodilators.
