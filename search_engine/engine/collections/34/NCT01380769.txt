      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancer. The
      development of targeted therapies has changed the approach to treating NSCLC significantly
      over the past decade with targeted therapies generally possessing safety advantages over
      traditional cytotoxic regimens. However, combination paradigms and resistance patterns
      complicate the use of these agents. CRLX101 is a nanoparticle comprised of camptothecin (CPT)
      conjugated to a cyclodextrin-based polymer. CRLX101 is designed to increase the exposure of
      tumor cells to CPT while minimizing side effects.
