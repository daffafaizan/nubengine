    
      The dose-escalation phase will consist of a modified 3+3 dose escalation and will be open to
      patients with metastatic lung cancer with an activating EGFR mutation who have progressed on
      and are currently receiving osimertinib therapy. The dose-escalation and expansion phases
      will be open to patients who have received any number of therapies as long as they are
      currently being treated with and tolerating osimertinib 80 mg orally once per day, and who
      have demonstrated radiographic progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria on their most recent scan.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination osimertinib + alisertib in
      patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC and identify a recommended phase II dose.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of adding alisertib to osimertinib compared to
           "historical" data of platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients who have progressed on
           osimertinib monotherapy.

        2. To explore tumor biomarkers, including TPX2, that predict response to osimertinib +
           alisertib.

        3. To evaluate alisertib and osimertinib pharmacokinetics

        4. To evaluate the CNS response rate of alisertib + osimertinib

      Patients may continue treatment indefinitely until disease progression, intolerance, or other
      contraindication to study treatment.
