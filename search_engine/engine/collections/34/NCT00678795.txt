      study to evaluate the efficacy of SativexÂ® on urge incontinence associated with neurogenic
      unstable bladder. Multiple sclerosis patients with incontinence symptoms are screened to
      determine eligibility and complete a two-week baseline period. They then return for a further
      eligibility check, randomisation and initial dosing. Subjects titrate and self-medicate with
      study medication between study visits at weeks two and five. They will also complete efficacy
      assessments in their diary-books and at visits.
