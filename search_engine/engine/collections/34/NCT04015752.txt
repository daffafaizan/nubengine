    
      Sepsis is a physiologic, pathologic, and biochemical abnormalities induced by infection.

      sepsis is considered as a leading cause of mortality and critical illness worldwide by many
      conservative estimates.

      sepsis epidemiology studies worldwide revealed a highly variable incidence of 13-300 per
      100,000 inhabitants per year for severe sepsis and 11 per 100,000 inhabitants per year for
      septic shock .

      factors such as advancing age, immunosuppression and multi-drug-resistant infection play a
      role in increasing incidence of sepsis during recent decades .

      patients who survive sepsis often have long-term physical, psychological, and cognitive
      disabilities with significant health and social implications.

      Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of developing infections and sepsis
      and they constitute 20.1-22.7% of all sepsis patients.

      Infection also remains an important cause of death in diabetics. The prevalence of diabetes
      mellitus in Intensive Care Unit patients is as high as 30%, And such patients are at
      increased risk of experiencing in-hospital Complications, compared to patients without
      diabetes.

      Infective complications may be reduced with lower blood glucose concentrations Moreover, in
      critically ill patients without diabetes, Hyperglycemia is associated with increased
      mortality, risk of infection, Kidney injury and cardiovascular complications.

      Moreover, diabetes is a major risk factor for both Acute Kidney Injury and sepsis.

      Sepsis also is a major cause of Acute Kidney Injury, which develops in one-fourth of all
      patients with sepsis and half of patients with bacteremia or shock .

      Sepsis-related Acute Kidney Injury is associated with high mortality rates of up to 70%.
