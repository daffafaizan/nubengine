      will be particularly beneficial to patients receiving intravenous propofol breathing
      spontaneously with natural airway. Assessment and management of respiratory function and
      early intervention when indicated is a multifaceted, complex task often complicated by the
      unavailability of a cohesive and continuous monitoring system to guide clinical decisions.
      The ExSpiron system is designed for these patients and is intended to address some of the
      limitations of the current generation of hospital monitors and to provide healthcare
      providers with continuous real-time data regarding the patient's respiratory status. Recent
      RVM data has shown that stratification of patients based on the MV % of predicted, prior to
      opioid dosing has made it possible to identify patients who are at risk for further decrease
      in MV and opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD).

        1. In the spontaneously breathing, non-ventilated patient, current monitoring devices do
           not provide continuous, objective non-invasive, continuous real time information of
           important respiratory parameters such as TV, MV and RR.

        2. Current monitoring of non-intubated patients mostly relies on oximetry data, subjective
           clinical assessment and occasionally EtCO2 measurements. In appropriate clinical
           settings, the ExSpiron system can provide direct quantitative measure of ventilation
           parameters for use in clinical assessment and trend prediction as well as response to
           medications and other interventions.
