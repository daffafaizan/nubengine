    
      Recta-angular scleral flap (one half the scleral thickness) is dissected,reaching 2 mm into
      the cornea. The dissection through the cornea is carried out with great care, leaving only
      thin corneal stroma over Descement's membrane.

      Application of direct heat cautery using a prob Imm in size (the prob was heated for 45
      seconds) the cautery was applied at 4 points two of them just in front of blue corneal line
      and the other two at 2 mm anterior to the blue line, the diameter of each point is 1 - 1.5
      mm. The horizontal distance between each point is 3.5 mm Figure(1). The application of the
      cautery continue till the color of the tissue becomes brown.

      Then with aid of a 23-gauge needle we penetrate these cauterized points to create 4 holes,
      each of them is nearly 0.3-0.5 mm in length (the opening of each hole takes the shape of a
      slit). Through one of these holes iridectomy is done.

      These holes drain the aqueous under the scleral flap with anatomical preservation of tissue
      in between.

      Close the scleral flap by two 10-0 nylon suture.
