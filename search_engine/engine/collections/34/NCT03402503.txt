    
      This is a randomized Phase IIa, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a new
      buccal film of montelukast in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Study drug
      (montelukast or matching placebo) will be administered once or twice daily for 26 weeks, and
      treatment effect will be assessed primarily using the global NTB composite score at Week 26.

      Patients who consent to participate will undergo screening assessments to determine
      eligibility. This study will enroll patients who are ≥50 years of age with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's Disease and on a stable treatment of donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine for
      ≥3 months. Patients will be randomized (using a balanced block randomization schedule) to one
      of two treatment groups:

        -  Group A: Montelukast buccal film

        -  Group B: Matching placebo buccal film

      In addition to the global NTB composite, patients will also be evaluated using the MMSE,
      ADCS-CGIC, ADCS-ADL23, NPI and S-STS. Patients will be followed for any safety concerns
      throughout the study and for 4 weeks following the last study visit.
