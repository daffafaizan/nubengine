      progression-free interval and survival in patients with suboptimally resected stage III
      ovarian epithelial carcinoma treated with paclitaxel/cisplatin. II. Determine the morbidity
      of secondary cytoreductive surgery in these patients. III. Assess prospectively the quality
      of life (QOL) of these patients and determine whether secondary cytoreductive surgery affects
      QOL.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Following treatment on Regimen A, patients with stable or
      objective response are randomized to Arms I and II. Regimen A: 2-Drug Combination
      Chemotherapy. Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers), Taxol, NSC-125973; Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875. Arm
      I: Surgery followed by 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Laparotomy with resection of residual
      disease; followed by Taxol/CDDP. Arm II: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. Taxol; CDDP.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 470 patients will be entered over 20 months to provide 400
      evaluable patients.
