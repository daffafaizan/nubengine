      patients with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia that has come back (recurrent) or does not
      respond to treatment (refractory). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill
      cancer cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and will have a new
      gene put in them that makes them able to recognize BAFFR, a protein on the surface of cancer
      cells. These BAFFR-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill
      BAFFR+ cancer cells.
