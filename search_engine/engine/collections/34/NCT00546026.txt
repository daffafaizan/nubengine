      preeclampsia, coagulation problems), often develop anxiety because of the possibility of a
      poor outcome. Such anxiety can affect fetal development, neonatal wellbeing, child
      development and maternal mental health but it often goes unrecognized. Also, women are often
      reluctant to use medications during pregnancy, especially if they perceive there may be the
      slightest risk to the fetus. By assessing placental function at mid-pregnancy in this
      population, we can provide an accurate estimate of which women will develop severe
      complications later in the pregnancy. We propose to perform a pilot randomized control trial
      formally incorporating placental assessment (Doppler ultrasound of the uterine artery and
      reassessment of diagnostic tests done earlier in pregnancy), with one group of "high-risk"
      women receiving the intervention (followed by feedback). Measures of pregnancy outcome and
      anxiety will be compared with a control group receiving standard "high-risk" pregnancy care.
      Levels of anxiety will be measured throughout the pregnancy using standardized scales. We
      hypothesize that placental function testing will reduce the burden of anxiety for the
      majority of women who test negative in the placental assessment arm and that these women will
      have improved outcomes and measures of anxiety during and following pregnancy in comparison
      with untested women who perceive themselves to be at risk of pregnancy complications
      throughout pregnancy. We also anticipate that the outcome of the pregnancy in women in the
      "tested" group will be more favorable (e.g. reduced admissions of neonate to NICU).
