      sites to obtain tumor tissue. Patients in whom sufficient tumor mRNA has been amplified by
      PCR to transfect the assigned dendritic cell dose will undergo leukapheresis and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells will be cultured in vitro for 7 days with GM-CSF and IL-4 to generate
      precursor derived dendritic cells. Dendritic cells will then be cryopreserved for later use.
      On the day the patient returns to receive his infusion (weeks 0, 2, and 4) the dendritic
      cells will be thawed, reconstituted, and transfected with amplified total tumor mRNA.
      Patients will receive a total of 3 treatments consisting of combined I.V. and I.D.
      injections, each on study week 0, 2, and 4. Repeat leukapheresis will be performed 2 weeks
      after the last dose to determine immune function. PSA levels will be measured prior to the
      start of treatment and 2 weeks following the last infusion. Patients who do not receive
      therapy due to a failure to produce sufficient RNA or dendritic cells will be replaced in
      order to assess toxicity.

      Data Analysis: 1. To determine the short and long term toxicities associated with
      administration of tumor RNA dendritic cells in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. 2.
      To determine feasibility of dendritic cell vaccine generation according to the proportion of
      patients for whom sufficient cells are generated to provide treatment. 3. To determine the
      cellular immune response to intravenous infusion of tumor RNA dendritic cells. 4. To measure
      the PSA response of patients with metastatic prostate cancer to intravenous infusion of tumor
      RNA dendritic cells.
