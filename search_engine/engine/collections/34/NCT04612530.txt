      new treatment options have demonstrated only moderate improvements for pancreatic cancer in
      terms of overall survival. Patients with metastasized disease (stage IV, AJCC) that are
      treated with chemotherapy in the Netherlands currently present a median overall survival of
      6.4 months. Previous research has shown promising results for patients with locally advanced
      pancreatic cancer (LAPC, stage III, AJCC) with regards to combination treatment with
      chemotherapy and irreversible electroporation (IRE), a local ablation technique that utilizes
      electrical pulses to destroy cancerous tissue. In addition to an increase in overall
      survival, IRE induced a systemic immune response. However, the immune response was not potent
      enough to generate a lasting anti-tumor effect. Leveraging the body's own immune response by
      using local and systemic immunotherapy may create a synergistic effect, potentially inducing
      a durable anti-tumor response. The PANFIRE-III is a prospective randomised phase 1 trial with
      the primary aim to determine safety of the combination therapies IRE + Nivolumab (arm B) and
      CpG + IRE + Nivolumab (arm C) in patients with oligo-metastasized pancreatic cancer. The
      secondary goal is to determine efficacy of the experimental arms (arm B, C) compared to the
      control arm A (Nivolumab monotherapy). This will be assessed by looking at the overall and
      progression-free survival as well as the locoregional and systemic immune response. The
      treatment combination of IRE with immunotherapy has the potential to generate systemic
      protection by in vivo vaccination against pancreatic cancer cells, hereby inhibiting both
      local and distant tumor growth.
