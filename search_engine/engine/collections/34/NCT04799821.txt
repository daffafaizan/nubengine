      conducted in an 18-week randomized crossover trial, in which participants will be initially
      assigned to intervention or control conditions for 8-weeks. After 2 weeks of washout,
      subjects will be crossed over to the alternate intervention and will continue for another 8
      weeks. Note that throughout the whole study, each participant will attend 5 visits: 1 initial
      visit (baseline) and 2 visits in each one of the study conditions (intervention and control).
