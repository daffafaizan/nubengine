      There is then a need for new therapeutics allowing a better asthma control. Synbiotic
      (association of probiotics and prebiotics) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory
      properties as well as immunomodulatory activities. Moreover, synbiotic appeared to be very
      well tolerated and safe.

      One hundred severe asthmatic patients (ACQ> 1.5 and beclomethasone > 200 µg per day) will
      receive "Probiotical ®" (3 pills a day, content: Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium et
      Streptococcus thermophilus, 18 billion of bacteria per pill) or a placebo during 3 months.

      They will be evaluated before and 1-3-6 months after the first administration and different
      tests will be realized:

        -  lung function tests (spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity)

        -  exhaled nitric oxide value (FeNo, linked to airway eosinophilia)

        -  blood tests: leucocyte count, c reactive protein, fibrinogen. Plasma and serum will be
           kept for inflammatory mediators measurements.

        -  sputum induction: leucocyte count and mediators measurements using the sputum
           supernatant and sputum cells.

        -  bronchial reactivity (bronchial challenge test)

        -  microvascular health: to assess the glycocalyx state, see: http://glycocheck.com/ for
           details.

        -  questionnaires: asthma control test (ACT), asthma control questionnaire (ACQ), asthma
           quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ ).
