      Yet, this way of transmission is effectively limited by the use of antiretroviral therapies
      during pregnancy in HIV infected women. The study TEmAA (ANRS 12109) we conducted allowed us
      to suggest a therapeutic scheme of administration of the association tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF) - emtricitabine (FTC) to reduce the risk of postpartum resistance that may
      occur with the administration of a single dose of nevirapine before delivery. However, we
      also observed a large interindividual variability of TDF in vivo placental transfer that
      remained unexplained. Placental membrane transporters, including efflux transporters
      belonging the ABC transporter superfamily and uptake transporters, may constitute a source of
      variability. In this case, we showed such an association for maraviroc with a significant
      inverse correlation between its clearance index and the placental expression level of several
      efflux transporters of the ABCC/MRP family. Regarding TDF, it has been shown that this drug
      is a substrate of several efflux transporters (ABCC2/MRP2, ABCC4/MRP4, ABCC10/MRP7) and an
      uptake transporter (hOAT3). As these transporters are expressed on the placental barrier, it
      may be hypothesized that their expression levels could contribute to modulate the placental
      transfer of this drug. To test this hypothesis, an ex vivo model known as "the perfused ex
      vivo cotyledon model" allows to reproduce the conditions of the third trimester of pregnancy.
      Our first aim is to evaluate the potential effect of ABCC2, ABCC4, ABCC10 and hOAT3 placental
      expression on TDF placental transfer (First year). We also want to investigate whether a
      potential interaction between TDF and FTC could take part to variability.
