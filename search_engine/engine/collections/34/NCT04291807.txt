      the ERCP procedure and satisfaction degree after the ERCP procedure between September 1st
      2017 and December 31st 2018 at Bagcilar Medipol Mega University Hospital. Patients were
      grouped into two in a randomized manner. In control arm, patients underwent ERCP procedure
      with the information provided by the gastroenterologist who recommended the procedure.
      Patients in experimental arm, besides the information provided by the gastroenterologist,
      watched video of ERCP procedure and answered all the questions about the procedure by an
      experienced nurse. A total of 70 patients (35 in each arms) was planned to enroll to the
      study. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) form was applied to measure anxiety level and
      visual analog score (VAS) was applied to measure the satisfaction about the procedure.
