    
      AASV, including Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and renal
      limited vasculitis (RLV), are progressive, multisystem, autoimmune diseases which require the
      prescription of immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment using corticosteroids and cytotoxic
      drugs has been standardised (ECSYSVASTRIAL project), but relapse rate remains high and
      treatment-related toxicity is non negligible. The IMPROVE trial aims to reduce this relapse
      rate by using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for maintenance therapy. The potential benefit of
      MMF has been suggested in a published open and uncontrolled study. Patients with newly
      diagnosed systemic AASV will be randomly assigned to receive either MMF or reference
      treatment with azathioprine (AZA), once remission has been obtained with cyclophosphamide and
      prednisone. MMF and AZA will be continued for a total of 42 months of therapy with
      concomitant prednisone dose tapering. The study will last 48 months. Hence, within the last 6
      months of the study duration, the patients will not receive any immunosuppressive drugs.

      The primary end-point will the disease-free period, taken as the period of time from
      remission until relapse or study end; secondary end-points will be adverse events, cumulative
      damage (assessed using damage score VDI) and immunosuppressive drug cumulative dose.
