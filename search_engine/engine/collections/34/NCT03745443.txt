      I and II scheduled for non-cardiothoracic surgery were allocated in two groups.
      Interventional group (n=35) received PEEP titration and Control group (n=35) didn't. They
      were ventilated only with PEEP 3. PEEP titration: In Intervention group, 20 minutes before
      the end of anesthesia PEEP was increased by 2 on every 5 breaths to 11. Ventilation with PEEP
      11 was maintained for 2 minutes. Then PEEP was reduced by 2 on every 5 breaths to 5 and
      remain as until awakening. Total time to perform titration was 5 minutes. Blood was collected
      in both groups, in equal points of time that is: after induction, 20 minutes before the end
      of surgery and after the end of surgery (20th minute). Investigators tested differences of
      outcome variables between groups and within the Interventional group before and after PEEP
      titration. Hemodynamic monitoring and monitoring of lung function were conducted in
      Interventional group to observe changes during PEEP titration.
