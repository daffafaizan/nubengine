    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the primary clinical problem in 3.3% to 10.0 % emergency
      department (ED) admissions. Rate control is an integral part of the management of symptomatic
      tachycardic AF patients.

      According to the recent guidelines beta-blockers, digoxin, the calcium channel blockers
      diltiazem and verapamil, amiodarone or combination therapy should be considered for rate
      control. Haemodynamic side-effects in particular hypotension may occur. Heart rate and blood
      pressure behavior in an ED population during rate control therapy in patients with
      tachycardic atrial fibrillation will be analysed.
