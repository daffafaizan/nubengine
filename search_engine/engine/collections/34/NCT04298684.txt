      with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there are no
      guidelines for the management of TN in this target population. In 2013, the French National
      Health Insurance reported that thyroid surgery procedures for benign nodules have increased
      unjustifiably. The impact of such surgery on the patients could be serious, with
      psychological repercussions and risks of surgical complications and the need of a
      substitutive lifetime hormonal treatment. The investigators hypothesize that metformin may
      reduce the need of TN surgery by decreasing benign TN size through a reduction of IR profile.
      A 2-years multicentric prospective study will be conducted to compare efficacy of metformin
      versus sitagliptin on benign thyroid nodules size in patients with initial benign thyroid
      nodules ≥ 2 cm. The percentage of thyroid surgery avoided, IR profile measured by Homeostasis
      Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance-Index (HOMA-IR-index) and adipokines concentrations
      will be also collected at inclusion ad at 2 years. The Primary outcome will be the percentage
      of patients in each group who had at least a 20% decrease in one or more nodules of more than
      2 cm at 2 years. Several secondary outcomes will be registered: percentage of thyroid surgery
      observed in each group at 2 years, number of new TN (≥ 10mm) after 2 years of follow-up ,
      percentage of metabolic syndrome before and after treatment, proportion of subjects with
      improvement of the HOMA-IR index and adipokine concentrations, plasmatic thyroid-stimulating
      hormone (TSH), T4 and T3 levels evolution, percentage of insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
      and adiponectin receptor expression in thyroid tissues after TN surgery.
