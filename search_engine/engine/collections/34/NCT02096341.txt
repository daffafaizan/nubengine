      RRx-001 administered as subcutaneous injections twice weekly for at least 8 weeks. At least
      three subjects must complete 2 weeks of treatment with RRx-001 at each dose level, before
      escalation to the next higher RRx-001 dose level; 2 doses-16 and 27 mg/m2- will be tested.

      The purpose of the study is to extend the dosage options for RRx-001 since faster
      subcutaneous (SC) administration may increase convenience versus the traditional IV method.
      The study also will also measure the mean concentrations of an RRx-001 metabolite in the
      blood (pharmacokinetics; PK) versus the IV formulation.
