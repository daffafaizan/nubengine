      in most hospitals. The operating theatre involves significant resources - materials,
      medications and manpower. One of the common problems affecting optimal OT utilization is the
      cancellation of scheduled surgeries. This results in a significant waste of resources,
      especially when cancellation occurs within 24 hours of the scheduled surgery, when it is too
      late to arrange replacement surgery. Cancellation also impacts the patient and their
      families.

      Reported cancellation rates range between 5% to 40%. Reasons for cancellations vary,
      including patient factors, surgeon factors, and system issues relating to the preoperative
      anaesthesia assessment clinic attendance, the surgery itself, and the availability of
      post-surgical care facilities. Between 60% to 90% of cancellations have been reported to be
      potentially avoidable.

      The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with cancellation within 24 hours
      of scheduled surgery in a tertiary academic hospital, and the reasons for cancellation, with
      the goal of identifying areas for intervention to reduce avoidable surgery cancellations and
      reduce unnecessary waste.
