    
      in this trial we will compare the early introduction of EPO alfa to the delayed introduction
      in lower risk MDS with non RBC transfusion dependent anemia.

      At enrollment patients will be randomised in the 2 arms (early and delayed start of EPO
      alfa).

      Treatment Regimen Epoetin alfa 60000 UI/week for at least 12 weeks

        1. Early onset arm: early onset of EPO ALFA 60000 IU/week , at patient inclusion

        2. Delayed onset arm: late introduction of EPO ALFA 60000 IU/week, whenever the patient
           reaches the level chosen RBC transfusions (based on age, comorbidities, anticipated
           tolerance of anemia).
