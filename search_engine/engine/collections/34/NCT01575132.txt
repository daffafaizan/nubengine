    
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is caused by a progressive loss of dopamine-producing cells in
      substantia nigra in mesencephalon.

      PD is characterized by the symptoms resting tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. Later in the
      course of the disease, patients develop gait- and balance symptoms. In the first years of the
      disease, the patients' symptoms are treated well with levodopa. As the disease develops and
      the loss of dopamine-producing cells grows, the physiological buffer-capacity for levodopa is
      lost and patients develop motor fluctuations in the shape of on-off symptoms and dyskinesias.
      Patients with these symptoms may benefit from implantation of electrodes in the subthalamic
      nucleus, which is stimulated by an pulse generator on the chest.

      A number of studies have found a long-term effect of DBS, but most of these studies have a
      follow-up time of no more than five years. Overall, these studies show a beneficial effect of
      DBS after five years: The patients need less medication, the number of off-periods is
      decreased and they score lower on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, part three.
      However, the axial symptoms and the bradykinesia progress.

      As of yet, few studies examine the effect of Deep Brain Stimulation after 10 years. In our
      study we wish to examine the effect of DBS for all patients operated at Aarhus University
      Hospital in the years 1998-2002, which gives us a follow-up time of 10-14 years.
