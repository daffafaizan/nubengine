      aspects according to R-IDEAL stage 1 criteria. Five (5) patients with bone metastases will be
      treated with palliative intention in this study. Treatment will consist of a single fraction.

      The MR linear accelerator (MRL) integrates a radiotherapy accelerator and a diagnostic
      quality 1.5T MRI, enabling soft-tissue visualization during the actual radiation delivery for
      improved targeting. This enables on-line treatment optimization for precise radiation
      delivery. Better visualization of the tumour targets and the surrounding healthy tissues, at
      the exact moment of treatment, makes it possible to adapt the dose to the actual anatomy
      while optimally sparing normal tissues.
