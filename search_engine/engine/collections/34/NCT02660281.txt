      regimens, designed to validate the process of related donor haploidentical-SCT at the Wilmot
      Cancer Institute Blood and Marrow Transplant Unit. Enrolled patients will receive
      chemotherapy +/- radiation as a pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Patients will then
      receive haploidentical stem cells, either bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood, followed
      by GvHD prophylaxis that will include cyclophosphamide. Multiple data points will be
      collected prior to, during, and following transplantation to ensure safety of the process and
      to evaluate the stated objectives.
