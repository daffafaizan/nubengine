      challenge that the investigators overcame through the expertise of neurologists within their
      stroke unit.

      First, they will describe the cognitive profile consecutive to a lesion of the thalamus,
      assessed with standardized neuropsychological tests.

      Second, and more specifically, they will study performances at experimental tasks focusing on
      higher-order cognition (decision-making, updating, interference managing, multitasking).

      They will use the automatic localization method already performed : the lesions will be
      manually segmented from T1 morphologic sequences, and then normalized in a template. Finally
      a numerical atlas of thalamus will be applied on the lesions, determining the injured
      substructure and the lesion volume.

      Besides, this method will be compared with new high resolution thalamus-centered anatomical
      sequences allowing direct and individual identification of the involved thalamic nucleus.
