      prevention measures to decrease vertical transmission of HIV.

      According to current statistics from the study site, approximately 70% of the pregnant HIV
      infected women in this study will have begun antenatal ZDV prior to the initiation of NVP at
      labor. The remaining 30% of the HIV infected women enrolled in this trial will have been
      previously undiagnosed. These women will be diagnosed with HIV infection either at the time
      they present to the delivery room in stage 1 of labor or immediately postpartum if they
      present for delivery late in labor and cannot provide informed consent for HIV screening
      prior to delivery.

      All infants will receive the standard does of NVP at 72 hours postpartum. Infants will then
      be randomized to receive either daily NVP and a daily multivitamin (MVI) or a daily MVI
      alone. Infants will take NVP/MVI or MVI alone during Weeks 2 to 6 postpartum. The primary
      outcome measure is infant HIV infection rates at 6 months.

      Two additional related cohorts of women will be followed for comparison: 1) an equal number
      of HIV uninfected women and their children will be enrolled for comparison of postpartum
      morbidity and mortality; and 2) consenting HIV infected women and their children who choose
      not to enroll in the clinical trial or are ineligible because they are not breastfeeding will
      be enrolled in an ancillary cohort.
