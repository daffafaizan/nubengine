      properties of quick onset and offset of action of nitroglycerin have made this the preferred
      drug to be used in acute scenarios where uterine relaxation is necessary.

      As nitroglycerin causes changes to intracellular calcium levels and the ability uterine
      muscle to engage in effective contraction, it is plausible that the effects of nitroglycerin
      may interfere with subsequent uterine contractility and action of oxytocin.

      The situation where a difficult fetal extraction is encountered at cesarean section may be in
      two broad groups of patients. Those pre-exposed to oxytocin and those with an oxytocin na√Øve
      myometrium. Given the large observational variation in dosages of nitroglycerin usage seen in
      the literature we feel it is vital to investigate whether pre-exposure to oxytocin impacts on
      the ability of nitroglycerin to relax uterine smooth muscle. Furthermore, once the uterus has
      relaxed following nitroglycerin exposure, is there a need for higher doses of oxytocin to be
      administered in order to re-engage the uterus in effective contraction? And is this
      requirement further exacerbated by the phenomenon of oxytocin receptor desensitization? These
      clinically important questions will be addressed by the design of this in vitro myometrial
      study.
