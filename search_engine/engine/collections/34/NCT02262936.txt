      Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and Baycrest. It will be a 12 week prospective, randomized
      double-blind trial comparing treatment of nocturia using Fesoterodine and Desmopressin.
      Patients who agree to participate in the study will receive a starting dose of either
      Fesoterodine 4mg tablet at bedtime or Desmopressin 0.1mg tablet at bedtime. After 4 weeks, if
      patients have had minimal improvement in their symptoms and are not significantly affected by
      side effects, patients will have the option of increasing the dose of their medication to 8mg
      of Fesoterodine or 0.2mg of Desmopressin. This decision will be made by the patient and
      physician together.

      Patients will undergo block randomization by pharmacy. All patients and investigators will be
      blinded to the treatment group. Patients will be followed for 12 weeks, with visits at 4 and
      12 weeks. Patients will also have urine cultures and uroflowmetry with measurement of
      post-void residuals at these visits, as per clinic standard of care. Venipuncture to monitor
      electrolyte levels will be done at baseline, 1 week after randomization and then monthly
      until the end of the study. If patients choose to increase their dose at the 4 week visit,
      electrolyte levels will be repeated one week after the dose adjustment and then monthly until
      the end of the study. The last follow up is at 12 weeks, when a 3 day voiding diary and the
      NNES-Q will be collected.
