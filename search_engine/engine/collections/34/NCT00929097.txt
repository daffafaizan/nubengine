      (CRC) in patients at increased familial CRC risk. Currently, the majority of these at-risk
      individuals are not properly referred for increased surveillance by colonoscopy or genetic
      counselling. In 2008, a national multidisciplinary evidence-based guideline on familial and
      hereditary CRC was launched in the Netherlands. Clinicians have new tasks in familial CRC
      risk calculation, interpretation and communication. A clustered randomized controlled trial
      including an effect, process and cost evaluation will be conducted in eighteen Dutch
      hospitals to determine the most cost effective way to implement these new guidelines.

      Surgeons and gastroenterologists in both the intervention group and the control group will
      receive background information on familial colorectal cancer risk and the guidelines.
      Patients and clinicians in the intervention group will receive an additional intervention
      strategy.

      The effect evaluation is done by assessing the number of CRC patients for whom correct risk
      calculation, interpretation and communication is performed, as well as patients' uptake of
      the recommended follow up policy. The actual exposure to the different elements of the
      implementation procedure and the experiences of users will be assessed in the process
      evaluation. The costs of the implementation procedure will be determined by means of a cost
      evaluation.
