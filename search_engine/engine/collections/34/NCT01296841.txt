      subspecialties: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), motility, therapeutic endoscopy, and
      transplant hepatology. Telemedicine, the application of information technology in support of
      health care delivery from a distance, has been employed with good success in various chronic
      conditions with excellent patient satisfaction.

      Primary Aim: Our primary study endpoint was measuring patient clinical experience between two
      groups: A telemedicine remote clinic visit and a standard "in-house" visit.

      Secondary Aim: To compare standard clinic metrics including clinic wait time, patient
      throughput, and appointment time between the two groups.
