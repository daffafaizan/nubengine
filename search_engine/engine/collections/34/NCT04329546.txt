      immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 or to cross-reactive viruses correlate with the virological
      and clinical characteristics of SARS- CoV-2-infected patients and their exposed household
      contacts. Through iterative sampling, the viral kinetics of at least 50 infected patients
      will be evaluated in relation to symptom severity and innate and adaptive immune responses,
      while their household contacts will be observed for viral detection and immune responses.
      Patients and contacts will be followed for 8 and 2 weeks, respectively. The study will
      include a maximum of 250 participants.
