      exercise intolerance and premature fatigue during physical activity. An abnormal exercise
      pressor reflex mediated by neural feedback from mechano- and/or metabosensitive group III and
      IV muscle afferents may contribute to these debilitating symptoms. However, little is known
      about the role and relative contribution of group III/IV afferents in circulatory control and
      fatigue development in patients with HFpEF. By studying both patients with HFpEF and
      well-matched controls, the investigators will evaluate the contribution of these muscle
      afferents to circulatory control and fatigue development, factors recognized to be major
      contributors to exercise intolerance. The investigators will use lumbar intrathecal fentanyl
      to block the central projection of group III/IV muscle afferents during voluntary and passive
      exercise (no concomitant effect on feedforward drive). This proven approach will enable us to
      evaluate, and distinguish between, the effects of group III and IV muscle afferents on
      central and peripheral hemodynamics during exercise, the exercise-induced development of
      central and peripheral fatigue (femoral nerve stimulation techniques), and on exercise
      tolerance. The investigators will also study muscle morphometry, baroreflex and chemoreflex
      sensitivity, and investigate intramuscular metabolic changes of the quadriceps during
      exercise using 31phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy to evaluate disease-related
      alterations in cardiovascular reflex sensitivity and intrinsic muscle characteristics as a
      potential factor determining alterations in circulatory control and fatigue resistance in
      patients with HFpEF. Finally, the investigators will repeat these studies after a supervised
      12-week knee-extension exercise training program, allowing us to investigate the effect of
      chronic exercise on the role of group III/IV muscle afferents in the hemodynamic response to
      exercise, the development of fatigue, and, ultimately, exercise tolerance. If this project
      confirms a significant contribution of group III/IV muscle afferents to the exercise
      intolerance exhibited by patients with HFpEF, and that chronic exercise can alleviate these
      impairments, the proposed work will provide the scientific basis for a paradigm shift in the
      treatment of this growing population.
