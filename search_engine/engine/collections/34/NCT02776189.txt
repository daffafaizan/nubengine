      status of 6 hours was confirmed and consent taken from the parent. In recovery room after
      recording of vitals, children were given intranasal midazolam 0.2mg/kg body weight. The
      intravenous line was secured after the child was sedated. Patients were then divided in two
      groups. In the MRI console, the dexmedetomidine group received intravenous dexmedetomidine
      1mcg/kg body weight over 10 minutes. An intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine was then
      started at 1mcg/kg/hour.

      The propofol group received 2mg /kg of intravenous propofol and an infusion of
      100mcg/kg/minute.

      MRI monitoring included pulseoximetry, cardioscope, respiratory pattern and rate. Oxygen was
      delivered by nasal prongs. Primary outcome measured was the time for recovery.

      Secondary outcomes were number of awakening during procedure, haemodynamic stability,
      induction time and any adverse events.

      After MRI the children were observed in the recovery room and discharged after achieving
      'modified aldred score' of 10. Vitals and any adverse events were recorded during this phase.
