      care. The primary outcome will be urinary tract infection. Secondary outcomes will include
      days of indwelling urinary catheterization, symptomatic urinary tract infection, isolation of
      antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from catheterized urine, antimicrobial use, bacteremia
      (blood-stream) infection secondary to urinary tract infection, and cost. We hypothesize that
      use of the automatic stop order will significantly reduce hospital-acquired urinary tract
      infection.
