      Day 4). Screening takes place from Day -23 through Day -3. Subjects are admitted to the
      clinic on Day -2 of Period 1. Within each cohort (young and elderly subjects), subjects are
      randomized to one of 24 treatment sequences of 4 treatment options (3 different doses of
      FG-4592 and placebo) and 4 periods.

      On Day 1 of each period, subjects receive a single oral dose of FG-4592 or placebo followed
      by a 72-hour evaluation period. Subjects are discharged on Day 4, if there are no medical
      reasons for a prolonged stay. Each period is separated by a wash-out period of at least 10
      days between dosing on Day 1 of the previous period and dosing on Day 1 of the following
      period. The subjects return for an end-of-study visit (ESV) 5-9 days after the last
      assessment of Period 4 (or after early withdrawal).

      Plasma and urine samples are collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)
      assessments. Safety assessments are performed throughout the study.
