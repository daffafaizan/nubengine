      diseases, or children who have had a liver transplant will be entered into a database. No
      extra tests are done for participating in this study, and no extra visits to the doctor are
      required. The clinical data collected is then entered into a database and followed
      longitudinally. The information obtained from this study will help researchers learn more
      about pediatric liver disease, therefore providing better routine clinical treatment.
