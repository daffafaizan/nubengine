      significant morbidity and mortality. It is associated with a risk of impaired coagulation
      caused by a reduced platelet count, very rarely by disseminated intravascular coagulation
      disorders. The degree of clotting correlates with the severity of preeclampsia. It is planned
      to calculate the blood loss using mathematical formulas and to compare the different blood
      loss in the two groups (preeclampsia vs. healthy pregnant women). Furthermore, this project
      will try to correlate the blood loss with the underlying coagulation situation. The aim is to
      be able to better assess the bleeding risk in healthy pregnant women, but also in
      pre-eclamptic patients in the future.
