    
      Specimens will be collected by venipuncture at 3 time points, including baseline (time 0),
      after one week of biotin supplementation (time 1, day 7), and then one week later (time 2,
      day 14). The time 1 specimen will be drawn approximately 2 hours after the last ingested dose
      of biotin on day 7. Specimen collection will include three 10 ml red top (no gel) tubes at
      each timepoint.

      Specimens will be separated for isolation of serum using routine methods of the clinical
      chemistry laboratory. Serum will be stored at -80 degrees C until batch measurements as
      described Measurements Biotin levels will be measured on each sample. Hormone measurements
      will be performed using specific commercially available streptavidin-biotin assays and using
      different analyzers as indicated below. Immunoassay methods, not employing
      biotin-streptavidin methodology, will be used for negative assay controls.
