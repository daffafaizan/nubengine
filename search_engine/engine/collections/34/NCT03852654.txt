    
      This is a single arm Phase II clinical trial in Veterans with prostate cancer, no prior local
      therapy, who are at risk of having metastatic disease (PSA greater than 10, or Gleason Score
      greater than or equal to 4+3, or clinical stage greater than or equal to T2c). Veterans who
      are planned to undergo or have recently undergone conventional, routine care initial staging
      scans for prostate cancer (99mTc-MDP or NaF PET bone scan and diagnostic CT or MRI of pelvis)
      will also receive a 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT scan. The primary endpoint is the percent of Veterans
      with prostate cancer in which the 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT scan identifies evidence of M1 disease at
      initial staging.
