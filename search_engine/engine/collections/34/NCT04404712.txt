      pathophysiology and therapeutics of disorders including PTSD, substance use disorders (e.g.,
      alcohol use disorder, cannabis/cannabinoid use disorder, nicotine use disorder), psychotic
      disorders including schizophrenia, and mood disorders. The endocannabinoid system is a
      neuromodulatory system that has been implicated across a wide range of psychiatric disorders
      and may be implicated in the regulation of mood, appetitive behaviors, sleep, and cognition.
      Thus, alterations in the ECS have wide ranging implications. Finally, the ECS is being
      explored as a novel therapeutic target for several psychiatric disorders. Additionally, the
      test/retest reliability of the radiotracer, [11C]MK-3168, will be studied in up to 10 healthy
      control individuals.
