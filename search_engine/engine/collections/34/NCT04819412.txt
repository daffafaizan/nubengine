      single-blinded, randomized clinical trial with two phases: exploratory phase and confirmatory
      phase.

      Exploratory phase:

      1. Infants of 6-8 weeks of age will randomly be assigned to receive 3 doses of two different
      formulations of ROTAVAC 5C (BBIL-R2014-1 &BBILR2014-2) or ROTAVAC®. In this phase,
      immunogenicity and safety of the two new formulations will be compared with each other and
      with ROTAVAC® in the three treatment arms when administered at 4 weeks interval (+1week
      window). The first dose will be administered at 6-8 weeks of age. Each of the rotavirus
      vaccine formulations contains NLT 105fluorescent focus units (FFU)/Dose. After completion of
      the exploratory phase, analyses will be undertaken for selection of the most suitable
      formulation to undergo confirmatory phase of the study.

      Confirmatory Phase:

        1. Infants of 6-8 weeks of age will randomly be assigned to receive 3 doses of the selected
           formulation of ROTAVAC 5C (3 production lots) and ROTAVAC® to evaluate lot consistency.
           Additionally, non-interference with immune response to antigens contained in childhood
           vaccines will be evaluated.

        2. Active surveillance will be conducted for all participants for seven days after each
           dose of vaccine to ascertain information on solicited adverse events.("Reactogenicity")

        3. Surveillance for unsolicited AEs for all participants will be conducted from the time
           between first dose and 4-6 weeks after the 3rd dose.

      Surveillance for SAEs for all participants will be conducted from the time between first dose
      and 4-6 weeks after the 3rd dose
