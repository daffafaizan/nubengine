      Health Organization (WHO) stipulated goals of a minimum of 20 functional teeth at the age of
      80 years have been reached in some industrialized countries. Oral Health means more than good
      teeth and is integral to general health. The relationship between oral and general health has
      been recognized. For example, periodontal disease is associated with diabetes and rheumatoid
      arthritis. The severity of periodontal disease and number of teeth have been associated with
      an increased burden of cardiovascular disease.

      There is a lack of longitudinal studies of oral Health and risk factors for oral disease.
