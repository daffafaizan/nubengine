    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1) To assess 1 year relapse free survival in high risk patients undergoing hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant (HSCT) using the Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) 2 step approach with 2
      days inserted between the last fraction of total-body irradiation (TBI) and the infusion of
      donor T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion [DLI]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess regimen related toxicity in this updated conditioning regimen,
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence and severity, and overall survival in
           patients undergoing treatment on this protocol.

        2. To assess the consistency and pace of engraftment.

        3. To assess the pace of T cell and B cell immune recovery.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients undergo TBI twice daily (BID) on days -10 to -8, undergo DLI
      on day -6, and receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ selected allogeneic HSCT on
      day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) beginning on day -1 with
      taper beginning by day 42, and mycophenolate mofetil IV BID on days -1 to 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
