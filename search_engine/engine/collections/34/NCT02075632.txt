      caused by eczema or psoriasis or any occasional itchy skin experiences will be enrolled into
      the study to get 250 participants who complete the study (at least 100 to each of the
      cohorts). After evaluation of the study criteria, the site staff will dispense product and a
      diary card to the subject to use over the next 14 days. At the end of the 14 days, each
      participant will come to the research site to return the remaining product and undergo the
      study termination interview with the Concentrics nurse via telephone. The study will be
      conducted in approximately 15 research sites located throughout the United States (US).
