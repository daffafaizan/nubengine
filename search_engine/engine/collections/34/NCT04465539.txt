      available as tablets of Celphos, Alphos or Quickphos which are known as rice tablets. Each
      tablet weights 3 grams and contains 56% ALP and 44% of aluminum carbonate and paraffin. The
      incidence of ALP poisoning increased steadily specially in developing countries . ALP
      poisoning is considered to be one of the major causes of suicidal poisoning owing to its wide
      accessibility and low cost. However, accidental poisoning may occur during occupational
      exposure.

      Signs and symptoms of acute AlP poisoning include gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic,
      renal, and neurologic (1). Ingestion of ALP causes mild gastrointestinal (GIT) manifestations
      as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, in addition to chest tightness, hypotension, headache
      and dizziness. In severe cases, GIT hemorrhage, shock, severe metabolic acidosis, cardiac
      arrhythmia, convulsions and coma may occur. Later, signs of hepatic damage and renal
      insufficiency may develop.

      Death usually occurs in 30-70% of cases within the first 24 hours resulting from refractory
      cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmia, severe hypotension and metabolic acidosis.The main
      causes of cardiovascular collapse are increase capillary permeability, insufficient systemic
      vasoconstriction with low ventricular ejection fraction. On autopsy examinations, point to
      extravasation of fluid into the third space.

      The management is exclusively supportive as gastric lavage with KMnO4 solution, treatment of
      hypotension and acidosis in view of the fact that there is no specific antidote available.
