    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, multicenter, Phase I/II clinical study in
      which up to 40 eligible subjects with active Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) will be randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio as follows: SF0166 low dose twice daily (BID) or
      SF0166 high dose BID.

      The study population will include male and female subjects, aged 18 or older, with diabetic
      macular edema (i.e., retinal thickening secondary to type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus with
      Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) with central subfield thickness ≥325 microns (μm) on spectral
      domain optical coherence tomography [OCT]) and no treatment with antivascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) therapy in the study eye within up to 60 days of study entry.

      If a subject qualifies in both eyes, SF0166 may be administered to both eyes (study eye and
      non-study eye) at the discretion of the Investigator.

      Study subjects will administer the randomly assigned treatment for 28 days. There is an
      additional 28-day post-treatment follow-up period. All study subjects will return for
      examination every 2 weeks for 8 weeks (2 months).

      All outcomes and assessments will be summarized descriptively for Days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56.
      No formal hypotheses will be tested.
