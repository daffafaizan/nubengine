      treatment period: chemoradiation therapy (radiation plus temozolomide [RT/TMZ]) and adjuvant
      therapy (TMZ). All participants received depatuxizumab mafodotin during both phases of the
      treatment period plus 1 of 3 prophylactic ophthalmologic treatments (standard steroids;
      standard steroids with vasoconstrictors and cold compress; and enhanced steroids with
      vasoconstrictors and cold compress. The study comprised a screening period of up to 7 weeks

      approximately 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, and a Follow-Up Phase.
