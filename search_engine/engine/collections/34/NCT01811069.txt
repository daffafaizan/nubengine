      30 kg/m2 to 50 kg/m2, between 18-65 years of age meeting ASA physical status classification
      I-III requiring general anesthesia for elective surgery will be recruited from the main
      operating room of the Massachusetts General Hospital. We will start the recruiting process at
      least 12 hours ahead of the surgery at a pre-admission test area.

      The PI/Co-I who approaches a potential subject who has expressed interest will not be the
      anesthesiologist providing anesthesia care for the subjects. In addition the PI/Co-I
      approaching the patient will reinforce that she or he does not have to participate and that
      the decision not to participate will not affect their care at anytime.

      The Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator will participate in the informed consent
      process in operative holding area. Subjects to be recruited will be given a thorough review
      of the informed consent, as well as the study purpose and procedures, and its risks,
      discomforts, and potential benefits. When the subject is comfortable with and knowledgeable
      about the protocol, he or she will sign the consent form in the presence of the investigator.
      Investigator will also sign the informed consent form. All subjects will be given ample time
      to read the consent form and consider participating in the trial. Any complaint or problems
      related to our recruitment plan will report in real time to the IRB.
