      complete 4 weeks of supplementation with 400mg of PS and 4 weeks of placebo. Subjects will
      have a 4-week washout period between regimens. Assessment visits (2) will occur after each of
      the 4-week dosing schemes and include: Vitals, DEXA scan for body composition, fasting blood
      work, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS),
      skeletal muscle biopsy, glycocalyx integrity assessment via Glycocheck, and 1-hour insulin
      clamp procedure with blood flow measurements.
