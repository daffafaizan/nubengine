      HCC patients, currently available diagnostic markers are still inadequate and limited by
      their low sensitivity and specificity. For instance, the gold standard marker,
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), has a false negative rate up to 40% for early stage of HCC. It is
      worthy to mention that the level of AFP was reported in a normal range of 25% of patients
      with advanced HCC. These discrepancies suggest the need of discovering new reliable
      diagnostic markers for patients with HCC. miRNAs are small endogenous, non-coding, ssRNA that
      are 21-30 nucleotides in length. As for the relationship between miRNA and HCC several
      studies have demonstrated that the aberrant expression of specific miRNA can be detected in
      HCC cells and tissues.

      miRNAs expression profile analysis has allowed the characterization of 'identity' associated
      with each type of human cancer and this 'identity' is correlated with carcinogenesis, tumor
      progression, and response to tumor treatment.
