      indicate that only HER2-positive patients are eligible for trastuzumab therapy.HER2
      positivity is defined as a HER2 score of 3+ by IHC or FISH. However, gastroscopic biopsies
      are spatiotemporally limited because of the highly heterogeneous expression of HER2. And this
      procedure is invasive and may substantially increase the incidence of side effects.
      Additionally, patients with false-negative HER2 results miss the chance for targeted therapy.
      Moreover, HER2 status can change during the disease process.Thus, a noninvasive, whole-body,
      HER2-targeted imaging method may be valuable for choosing patients suitable for anti-HER2
      therapy and monitoring the therapeutic efficacy. Direct labeling of HER2 antibodies with
      radionuclides allows clinicians to monitor HER2-targeted therapy and assists in patient
      staging. With the feasibility of a long half-life and decay time, positron emission
      tomography (PET) nuclides, such as 64Cu (T1/2= 12.7 h) and 89Zr (T1/2= 78.4 h), can label
      trastuzumab for the clinical PET imaging of HER2 in GC and breast cancer. Because of the long
      half-life of 89Zr, 89Zr-trastuzumab is estimated to produce a dosimetry exposure of 0.5
      mSv/MBq (compared with the 0.019 mSv/MBq of 18FDG) in patients. Additionally, imaging needs
      to be performed several days after injection due to the slow blood clearance of antibodies.

      In this study, 68Ga-HER2 Affibody or 18F-HER2 Affibody PET/CT imaging will be performed in
      patients with HER2-positive tumors to access the potential of 68Ga-HER2 Affibody or 18F-HER2
      Affibody PET/CT to screen patients who can benefit from HER2 target treatment.
