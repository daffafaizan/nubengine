      to chloroquine and then sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (the first line therapy in Ethiopia
      1998-2004), artemether- lumefantrine (Coartem or AL) was adopted as first line therapy in
      Ethiopia in 2004. According to the current national malaria diagnosis and treatment
      guidelines, first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum infection is AL. First-line
      treatment for Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is with chloroquine (CQ) alone without primaquine therapy
      in malarious areas. For all clinical infection without laboratory confirmation, AL which is
      effective against both Pf and Pv is the first-line treatment. Thus, in Ethiopia, where
      treatment for malaria without laboratory confirmation occurs frequently, Pv is often treated
      with AL as the standard of care. Furthermore, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends AL
      for the treatment of Pv, where AL has been adopted as first-line treatment for Pf. Now with
      wide-spread use of AL and CQ, we propose to conduct an antimalarial efficacy study to monitor
      the effectiveness of these therapies in Ethiopia and to determine how efficacious these drugs
      remain. This information will inform future policy changes with respect to appropriate
      antimalarial strategies.

      The simplest and most universally accepted measure of testing for antimalarial drug treatment
      efficacy, the standardized procedures outlined in the World Health Organization Assessment
      and monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria and the WHO Monitoring antimalarial drug resistance, will be followed.
