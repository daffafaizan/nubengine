      patients with CKD compared to their age-matched healthy controls and further examine whether
      ACE-I may delay the progression of aortic stiffness in elderly CKD patients. If ACE-I therapy
      appears beneficial in preventing or delaying arterial stiffening in elderly patients with
      CKD, this work has important implications for improving the overall health of this
      population.
