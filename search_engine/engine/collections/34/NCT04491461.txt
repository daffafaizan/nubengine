      consumption of 1 cup of an herbal tea blend to consumption of the same volume of warm water.
      The study is of 3 weeks' duration, with evaluation of the herbal tea blend versus warm water
      at week 1 and week 2 with a one week washout between visits. On each visit, a baseline blood
      draw is performed, followed by consuming of the herbal tea blend or warm water. Blood draws
      are performed at 1 and 2 hours after consumption.
