      abnormalities. Exercise training performed during cardiac rehabilitation improves exercise
      tolerance measured by cardiopulmonary exercise test. Low frequency electromyostimulation
      (EMS) was proposed as an alternative to exercise training (ET) in this population.

      However, the effectiveness of the combination (EMS +ET) compared with ET alone is not proved.
      The main objective is to compare exercise capacity judged by peak VO2 after treatment by ET
      alone versus EMS+ET. The secondary end points are results on sub maximal parameters, muscular
      resistance, quality of life and effectiveness regarding clinical sub-groups.

      This study is a controlled, randomized, multicentric (14 centres) designed to include 90
      patients by group in two years period. Inclusion criteria are: CHF patients , NYHA class II
      to IIIb, with LVEF < 40% referred to complete a cardiac rehabilitation program.

      All the patients benefit from a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program including
      educational program, therapeutical optimisation and exercise training for 20 sessions, 3 to 5
      days a week. The group of patients randomized for additional EMS has 20 sessions of 1 hour
      electrical quadricipital myostimulation.
