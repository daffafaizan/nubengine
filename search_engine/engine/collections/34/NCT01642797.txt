      prognosis for patients with this cancer clearly depends on stage at diagnosis. At least for
      the intestinal subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma, a cascade of histopathologic lesions has
      been defined: chronic gastritis, atrophic chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia (IM), and
      intraepithelial neoplasia (IN). The identification of these lesions and follow-up of patients
      in whom they are found could lead to diagnosis of gastric cancer at an early stage, thus
      improving patients' survival. The diagnosis of these lesions, which often appear in flat
      mucosa, is currently based on histopathologic examination of endoscopic biopsy specimens.
      However, conventional white-light endoscopy (WLE) for this purpose has high interobserver
      variability and a poor correlation with histopathologic finding.

      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), producing both conventional WLE and confocal microscopic
      images, can provide a direct histological observation of the in vivo tissue without the need
      for biopsy. Recently, CLE has shown its value for diagnosing gastric IM, intraepithelial
      neoplasia and carcinoma. However, none of those CLE criteria for gastric IM, IN or carcinoma
      (CA) has been validated in various endoscopic centers, hence reducing the reliability and
      clinical application of them.
