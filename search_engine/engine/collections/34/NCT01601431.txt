      patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy with a conventional colonoscope or with a
      cap-assisted colonoscopy. The aims of the study are:

        1. Compare ADR between Hispanic patients undergoing a screening colonoscopy with and
           without cap.

        2. Compare the overall polyp detection rate between Hispanic patients undergoing a
           screening colonoscopy with and without cap.

        3. Compare the cecal intubation rate and cecal intubation time between standard colonoscopy
           and cap assisted colonoscopy.

        4. Compare the complication rate between standard colonoscopy and cap assisted colonoscopy.
