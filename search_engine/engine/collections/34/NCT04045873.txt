      viable alternative for these patients with complex coronary artery disease combined with
      multiple comorbidities and poor hemodynamics. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) can
      direct blood flow out of the body, oxygenate it, and then return it, to either completely or
      partially replace the function of the heart and lungs, and potentially increase the
      likelihood of functional recovery. Limitations of ECMO include lack of direct LV unloading,
      and increased LV afterload with subsequent LV overload, which in turn can increase myocardial
      oxygen demand and therefore limit any cardioprotective benefits . Measures to concurrently
      decrease LV afterload during ECMO, such as use of an Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP), may in
      theory offset some of the disadvantages of ECMO. To date, ECMO has most commonly been used in
      patients suffering from cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock . As far as we are aware, there
      exist very limited reported data from monocentric observational studies and individual case
      reports on the use of ECMO for elective, high-risk PCI in the literature . More importantly,
      no previous randomized studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a strategy combining
      VA-ECMO and IABP during high-risk PCI have been conducted to date. Most importantly, the
      strategy of combined VA-ECMO and IABP has never been investigated in any randomized trial
      that we could find.
