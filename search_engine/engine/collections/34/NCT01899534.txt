      treatment, our IMPACT pilot trial is evaluating integrated screening and care (see Summary of
      Progress) versus usual prenatal care. The proposed trial engages 2 unique clinics with
      experienced staff who conduct routine screening (with referrals and treatment in place) to
      evaluate different modalities of screening. Since widespread screening is unlikely to be
      successfully implemented if it entails additional human resources, this trial assesses the
      potential for a sustainable, e-health alternative.
