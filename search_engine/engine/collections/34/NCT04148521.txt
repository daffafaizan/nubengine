      exists for patients who are being admitted to a psychiatric hospital from the Emergency
      Department (ED).Additionally, commitment to a hospital setting may have adverse effects on
      patients psychologically, degrade relationships with therapists, and disrupt continuity of
      care. ED providers often decide to admit to a psychiatric hospital because of limited
      availability of behavioral health resources. To better enhance transitions of care for those
      with mental illness, Atrium Health has designed a behavioral health virtual patient
      navigation (BH-VPN)program that helps coordinate services and follow-up care, while
      facilitating the safe discharge of patients. Patients presenting to an ED that have a tele
      psychiatric consult who are recommended for discharge are eligible for services. The
      Behavioral health Service line is expanding the program to additional rural emergency
      departments. Using an outcomes evaluation, the investigators will inform Atrium Health on the
      effect of the BH-VPN program to reduce hospital admissions among patients with a tele
      psychiatric consult in the ED. The proposed hypothesis is that by having the BH-VPN program
      available in an ED, more patients will be discharged from the ED than admitted.
