      treatment of bladder neck insufficiency/incompetent outlet. Fragmentation of muscle fibers
      derived from autologous muscle tissue can be injected through a needle into the sphincter
      region. The injected muscle fibers are able to assemble into long muscle fibers in the
      direction of host muscle fibers. More importantly, muscle progenitor cells residing on the
      fragmented muscle fibers survive and integrate into host vasculature and nerve to restore
      damaged muscle function. Preclinical results indicate that this technology can be used to
      repair and restore damaged sphincter function in urinary incontinence. The development of an
      autologous, readily available muscle fiber fragment treatment that may involve less risk and
      recovery time than those associated with the standard surgical therapies and urethral bulking
      agents, could alter the treatment paradigm of urinary incontinence. The study team
      hypothesizes that injected MFFs will incorporate into skeletal muscle and re-assemble along
      the fiber direction. The Investigators anticipate that the MFFs can safely be injected into
      the atrophied rotator cuff muscle and will help restore the functional contractile properties
      of the supraspinatus muscle following rotator cuff repair.
