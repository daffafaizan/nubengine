        -  Determine the clinical activity of rosiglitazone in patients with liposarcoma.

        -  Assess the impact of this regimen on markers of tumor proliferation and differentiation
           status in these patients using biologic and biochemical testing and correlative imaging.

        -  Determine the tolerance and safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by histologic subtype (well differentiated vs
      dedifferentiated vs myxoid/round cell vs pleomorphic).

      Patients receive oral rosiglitazone twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1-3 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-120 patients (14-30 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 15 months.
