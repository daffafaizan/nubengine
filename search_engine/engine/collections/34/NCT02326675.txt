    
      As a participant the following will happen:

      There will be a random assignment (much like the flip of a coin) to one of two study groups:

        -  Group A: Standard mouth care plus cryotherapy, or

        -  Group B: Standard mouth care.

      Standard Mouth Care plus Cryotherapy (Group A)

      Will receive the standard mouth care plus Cryotherapy and will consist of:

        -  Mouth care 3 times daily with a soft-bristle toothbrush or foam toothbrush

        -  Cryotherapy - beginning 15 minutes before etoposide chemotherapy starts, the consumption
           of ice chips and/or other very cold and frozen foods (popsicles, Italian Ice etc.)
           continuously for 30 minutes.

           o Short (1 to 3 minutes maximum) breaks over the course of the 30 minute period as long
           as at least 15 minutes are spent actively engaged in the cryotherapy

        -  Saline "swish and spit" mouth rinses - you will be asked to rinse your mouth with saline
           for approximately 30 seconds before spitting out the saline into the sink or basin

           o You will be asked to do this 3 times over 15 minutes following each 30 minute period
           of cryotherapy

        -  The cycle of 30 minutes of cryotherapy followed by 15 minutes of saline mouth rinses
           will be repeated until 30 minutes after the etoposide infusion (approximately 3 cycles
           for a typical 120 minute infusion).

      Standard Mouth Care (Group B)

      Randomization to the Standard Mouth Care group will consist of:

        -  Mouth care 3 times daily with a soft-bristle toothbrush or foam toothbrush

        -  Saline "swish and spit" mouth rinse - rinse the mouth with saline for approximately 30
           seconds before spitting out the saline into the sink or basin

             -  At the beginning of each etoposide infusion, perform three 30-second saline rinses
                over 15 minutes followed by a 30-minute break from the rinses

             -  The cycle of 15-minute saline mouth rinses followed by 30-minute break periods will
                be repeated until 30 minutes after the etoposide infusion (approximately 3 cycles
                for a typical 120 minute infusion).

      The standard mouth care group, will not be permitted to eat ice chips or consume frozen foods
      during the times these times.

      All groups will have the following interventions and assessments performed:

        -  Mouth Care Diary - the time and type of mouth care and/or cryotherapy

        -  Mucositis Assessments - pain levels, appetite, ability to swallow liquids and/or food
