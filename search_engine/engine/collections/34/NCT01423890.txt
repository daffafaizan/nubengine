      by the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC). There is only one small
      published prospective study that reports on Oncotype DX速 changing clinical management. The
      economic models that estimated the potential advantages of using an Oncotype DX速 guided
      treatment strategy may have overestimated the benefits because they assumed that all patients
      with tumors >1cm in the absence of Oncotype DX速 testing would receive chemotherapy in
      addition to tamoxifen, and that the magnitude of benefit with chemotherapy over tamoxifen is
      relatively large, i.e. reduces recurrence risk by 74% and associated with an absolute benefit
      of 28%. (The benefit comes from one trial and is applied to all patients). It is estimated
      that there are about 3,300 incident cases with node negative, ER positive, HER2 neu negative
      tumors annually in Ontario, it is important to evaluate the adoption of this test for
      decision making in Ontario.
