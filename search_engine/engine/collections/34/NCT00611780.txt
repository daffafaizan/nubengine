      criteria. Patients are included if they have stable sinus rhythm (heart rate <100 bpm) and a
      body weight < 90 kg or a body mass index (BMI) < 30. Informed signed consent is obtained from
      these patients and the CT scan is prepared. After topogram scan and the native scan for
      Ca-Scoring, patients are randomized in two groups with the use of sealed envelopes. After
      that contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography is performed with the 120kV- or
      100kV-protocol.

      The CT examination is evaluated by two experienced investigators on a per-vessel basis and
      all results and study-related data are collected in a dedicated database. For assessment of
      image quality, a previously established 4-point score system is used and quantitative image
      quality parameters are measured.

      A 30 day follow-up after the CT examination aims to evaluate if patients underwent invasive
      coronary angiography or were scheduled for a myocardial stress / perfusion test (such as
      stress-echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy or stress perfusion imaging by MRI).
