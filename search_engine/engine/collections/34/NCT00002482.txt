      given with low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced malignancies. II. Perform
      serial immune monitoring on patients treated with this regimen. III. Identify any clinical
      responses produced by this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Biological Response Modifier Therapy with Suppressor Cell Inhibition. Anti-CD3
      Murine Monoclonal Antibody OKT3, MOAB OKT3; with Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 9 evaluable patients per diagnostic category will be required
      initially; if any response is seen during the dose-finding portion of the study, a total of
      24 patients with that diagnosis will be entered.
