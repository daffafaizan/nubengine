      emergency departments. Its mechanism may at times leads to fracture. The Ottawa Ankle Rules
      (OAR) provide guidelines to clinicians concerning the need to perform radiographic test to
      verify whether patients with ankle injuries are suffering from fracture. If all clinical and
      anamnestic criteria are negative in accordance with the OAR, the probability of a fracture
      being present is about 0% (IC 95%). OAR are validated for adults.

      Actually, a meta-analysis has suggested that it may be beneficial to introduce a
      nurse-initiated radiographic test protocol as a standard practice in emergency departments.
      However this early prescription is not a standard of care in most of emergency departments in
      France.

      The implementation of OAR decreases irradiation levels of patients and reduces medical
      expenses. In addition, it allows to reduce patient's duration of stay in already encumbered
      emergency departments, thus reducing also overcrowding, which is known to be a major factor
      of non quality of care in such departments.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases of 4 weeks each :

        -  The first one (Phase A) will occur in the emergency department with the application of
           OAR only by the physicians (without changing the standard of care)

        -  The second one (Phase B) will occur after the Phase A, and nurses will apply OAR before
           physicians, according to the protocol.
