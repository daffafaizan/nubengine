      years of children referred to the Dermatology Department at the Royal Children's Hospital for
      management of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. They will be sequentially recruited and
      randomized to the wool-standard clothing arm or standard clothing-wool arm.

      The study will run for 12 weeks for each participant with two 6-week periods, either of wool
      followed by standard clothing or standard followed by wool clothing. Participants will be
      assessed by a blinded trained researcher during this time, at their initial appointment, 3
      weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks and 12 weeks.

      The primary outcome is change in the severity of atopic eczema at 6 weeks. Severity of atopic
      eczema will be measured using the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index.

      Secondary outcomes include the change in the severity of eczema using the SCORAD at 3 weeks
      and the Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) score at 3 and 6 weeks and quality of life
      assessment using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at 3 and 6 weeks.
