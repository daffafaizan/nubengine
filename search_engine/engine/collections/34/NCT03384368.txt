      for the clinician and researcher) will be conducted. A total of seventy patients with single
      thoracolumbar AO type A3 or A4 fractures who are candidates for application of short-segment
      pedicle screws of fractured vertebrae will be randomly allocated to either the DS group
      (distraction-screws ) or the SD group (screws-distraction) at a ratio of 1: 1. The primary
      clinical outcome measures are compression ratio of anterior border of vertebral body height,
      depth of nail into injured vertebrae and kyphosis (Cobb) angle. Secondary clinical outcome
      measures are complications, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of back and leg pain, neurological
      function, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA)
      scores and Oswestry Disability Index. These parameters will be evaluated preoperatively,
      intraoperatively, on day 3 postoperatively and then at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
      postoperatively.
