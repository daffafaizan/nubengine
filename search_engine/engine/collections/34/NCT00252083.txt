      (ADAPT), has two main goals: first, to assist the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC) to better understand the processes needed for adapting evidence-based behavioral
      interventions to fit new conditions or target populations; second, to utilize the CDC's draft
      adaptation guidance to adapt Jeff Kelly's Popular Opinion Leader (POL) for use with adult,
      seropositive Hispanic men who have sex with other men (MSM). The target population will
      directly participate in all phases of the intervention adaptation process.

      ADAPT, known as ADAPT-POL in El Paso, will include formative research and outcome monitoring.
      Throughout both periods, the ADAPT-POL staff will conduct process monitoring and evaluation
      to assess the delivery of the intervention, and to help the CDC understand how the draft
      adaptation guidance procedures work in a real world setting. Representatives of the target
      population will participate in focus groups, key informant interviews, and community advisor
      meetings during the formative phase; and potentially serve as popular opinion leaders (POLs)
      during the implementation phase.

      The knowledge obtained during the ADAPT-POL intervention will be diffused to other
      interventions and programs at the Planned Parenthood Center of El Paso (PPCEP). This will
      allow PPCEP management and staff to make informed decisions about the adoption of
      interventions and what steps might be necessary to adapt existing and future PPCEP
      interventions that target Hispanic populations. At the conclusion of ADAPT activities, the
      CDC-developed draft adaptation guidance will be revised based on lessons learned.
