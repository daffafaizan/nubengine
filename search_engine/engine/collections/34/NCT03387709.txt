      and cardiovascular disease risk factors in 100 overweight or obese men and women who are
      participating in a 4-month behavioral weight loss intervention. Participants will be assigned
      to a cognitive-behavioral weight loss intervention and will be provided either general
      dietary advice as a component of the behavioral curriculum or prescribed an individualized
      pistachio-enriched reduced-energy diet plan. The pistachio-enriched diet will prescribe 42
      g/day of pistachios, or approximately 13-20% (averaging 18%) of energy intake across a range
      of 1200-1800 kcal/day. Dietary intake will be assessed at three time points (baseline, one
      month, and four months) to examine changes in dietary intake and food choices that may be
      indicative of compensatory intake in response to regular nut consumption. Results from this
      study will contribute to understanding the role of pistachios in weight control, including
      further knowledge of the metabolic factors linked to chronic disease, and will expand
      knowledge of how pistachios in the diet may contribute to the prevention and management of
      obesity.
