    
      Injury to the ureter, the duct by which urine passes from the kidney into the bladder, is a
      well-known and serious complication of pelvic and abdominal surgery that frequently goes
      unrecognized intraoperatively. This study seeks to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      intravenous IS-001 injection to improve surgeon ureter visualization during robotic-assisted
      surgery with the da Vinci® Surgical System and Firefly® imaging. Stage A will be a
      dose-escalation to determine the optimal dose for ureter visualization and Stage B will be an
      expanded safety and efficacy evaluation of the optimal dose. Stage B will include a no-drug
      safety control to evaluate the effects of surgery alone on the safety parameters of the
      study.
