      anatomic substrate of most acute myocardial infarctions (AMI). Macro- and microembolization
      of thrombus during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in AMI is frequent and may result
      in obstruction of the microvessel network, and decreased efficacy of reperfusion and
      myocardial salvage. Direct stenting without predilation or postdilation is the most
      simplistic approach to the problem of embolization, and may decrease embolization and the
      incidence of the no-reflow phenomenon. Other approaches to the problem of microvessel
      embolization include percutaneous rheolytic thrombectomy (RT) with the AngioJet catheter
      before stent implantation. The objectives of the study are: to assess whether RT before
      direct infarct artery stenting results in improved reperfusion success in patients with acute
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and angiographically evident thrombus; and
      to validate a technique for use of the AngioJet RT catheter in the treatment of STEMI.

      Comparisons: Treatment with AngioJet RT immediately before direct infarct artery stenting
      versus direct stenting alone, in patients with STEMI and angiographically visible thrombus
      presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset for primary PCI.
