      evaluate the efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan compared to valsartan, on morbidity
      and mortality in heart failure patients (NYHA Class II-IV) with preserved ejection fraction.
      Specifically, the study evaluated the effect of sacubitril/valsartan compared to the active
      comparator valsartan in the reduction of the rate of CV death and total HF hospitalizations
      in patients with HFpEF. The trial consisted of two periods: (1) a single-blind treatment
      run-in epoch that lasted from 3 to 8 weeks, in which patients received valsartan 80 mg bid,
      followed by sacubitril/valsartan 100 mg bid and (2) a double-blind randomized treatment epoch
      (sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg bid or valsartan 160 mg bid). In this study, investigators were
      responsible for assessing and submitting all events which could potentially fulfill the
      criteria for the primary, secondary, or other clinical endpoints to a Clinical Endpoint
      Committee (CEC). Investigator reported events were assessed by the CEC for adjudication.

      For angioedema or angioedema-like events, investigators completed an Adjudication
      Questionnaire for an Angioedema-like Event form. All angioedema reports were forwarded to an
      Angioedema Adjudication Committee (AAC) by Novartis for assessment.
