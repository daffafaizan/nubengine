    
      Twenty (20) healthy volunteers (about 50% males and 50% females) will be randomised.

      Primary end-point:

        -  Evaluation of the relationship between the plasma concentration of trazodone (free base)
           and the change from baseline in QTc, placebo-adjusted and corrected for HR based on the
           Fridericia correction method (QTcF) method (∆∆QTcF).

        -  Trazodone can be declared to have no influence on QTc if the null hypothesis, that the
           upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI of the predicted mean placebo corrected change from
           baseline for QTcF is greater than 10 msec at the observed mean Cmax for the therapeutic
           dose of trazodone, can be rejected.
