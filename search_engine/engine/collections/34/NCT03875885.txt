      investigators will determine their ability to recruit caregivers of patients with head and
      neck cancer being treated at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center to a study that
      uses a technology-based intervention, CONNECT, which may increase head and neck cancer
      caregivers' knowledge about the benefits of supportive care resources, identify their unmet
      needs, and connect them with supportive care resources. In this study the investigators also
      want to look at their ability to recruit a control group of caregivers, that is, caregivers
      of patients with head and neck cancer being treated at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive
      Cancer Center that will receive a list of supportive care resources. Control groups are used
      in research to see if the intervention being studied really does have an effect. In addition,
      the investigators will determine whether or not the intervention has led to improvements in
      caregivers' use of supportive care resources, quality of care, and overall quality of life.
