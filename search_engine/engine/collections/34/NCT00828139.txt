      I. Evaluate the efficacy of topotecan hydrochloride with vs without aflibercept
      (ziv-aflibercept), in terms of progression-free survival at 3 months, in patients with
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer previously treated with platinum-based therapy.

      SECONDARY OBEJCTIVES:

      I. Assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) in a
      subset of patients with measurable disease.

      II. Assess the overall survival of these patients. III. Evaluate the frequency and severity
      of toxicities of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior
      platinum-based therapy (platinum-sensitive disease vs platinum-refractory disease). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ziv-aflibercept IV over 1 hour on day 1 and topotecan hydrochloride
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responsive or stable
      disease after 4 courses may then receive ziv-aflibercept IV on day 1 and topotecan
      hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responsive or stable disease after 4 courses may then
      receive topotecan hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
