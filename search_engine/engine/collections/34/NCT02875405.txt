      is observed in 30-40% of patients. POAF may cause stroke, systemic embolism or cardiac
      failure and Its detection mandates for additional treatment with variable combinations of
      drugs to control cardiac rate or rhythm, anticoagulation, and electrical cardioversion, with
      their side effects and complications. As a result, POAF prolongs hospital stay and increases
      the costs of hospitalization. Several strategies aimed at reducing the incidence of POAF have
      been investigated, including beta-blockers, amiodarone, and statins, with unsatisfactory
      results. Posterior left pericardiotomy has been associated with a reduction in the incidence
      of POAF in a few studies. However, these studies are flawed by methodological limitations in
      terms of sample size, inclusion/exclusion criteria, randomization procedure, and suboptimal
      electrocardiographic monitoring strategies. Moreover, posterior left pericardiotomy requires
      additional operative time and is associated with procedure-specific complications. As a
      result, current evidence on posterior pericardiectomy failed to translate into changes in
      clinical practice and the incidence of POAF remains high.
