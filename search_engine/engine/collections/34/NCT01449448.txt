      home physical therapy and follow-up in four weeks. Each patient was evaluated in terms of arc
      of motion, Visual Analog Scale and the UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale.

      The outcome measures were taken at the preinjection state, immediately post injection, and at
      4 weeks follow-up.
