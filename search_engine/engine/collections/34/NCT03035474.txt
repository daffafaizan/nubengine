    
      This trial will be a large-scale, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial to evaluate
      the effect of a customized, multifaceted, health system-level quality-improvement (QI)
      program compared with usual care on heart failure (HF) outcomes and HF quality-of-care
      metrics. Outcomes will be assessed following discharge for participants hospitalized with
      acute HF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. All participants in the trial will
      be consented for follow-up as part of the CONNECT-HF registry on clinical outcomes,
      medication use, and participant-centered outcomes, including quality-of-life (QOL)
      assessments will be collected up to 12 months post-discharge at pre-specified intervals (6
      weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months).

      The health-system QI program will involve site visits and ongoing mentoring from teams of
      healthcare professionals with specialized training and field experience to help health
      systems and individual hospitals to design local QI plans.

      A key substudy will assess a participant-engagement strategy (digital) of a mobile
      application utilizing behavioral tools to reinforce health behaviors, including
      self-monitoring/self-management and medication adherence.

      Follow-up will occur via a centralized telephone interview by trained personnel via the DCRI
      Call Center. At each interview, participants will be asked to report current medications,
      rehospitalizations, and QOL assessments. Based on participant-reported events, medical
      billing data for rehospitalizations, emergency department visits, and procedures will be
      obtained.

      Quality of life assessments will include the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)
      and EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D).
