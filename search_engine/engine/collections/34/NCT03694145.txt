      evaluate the predictive accuracy of: (a) machine learning models developed to grade diabetic
      retinopathy and assess the presence or absence of diabetic macular edema and (b) the
      assessments of optometrist readers, both from digital retinal images, against standard of
      care dilated retinal examinations by board-certified ophthalmologists and/or
      retinal-specialty fellows for 300 diabetic patients utilizing a Los Angeles County reading
      center.

      For the study, the investigators will recruit 300-500 eligible diabetic patients for
      in-person eye examinations performed by board certified ophthalmologists and/or
      retinal-specialty fellows at Los Angeles County reading centers. The study will take place
      over the course of two visits: a teleretinal screening and an in-person eye examination.

      The in-person dilated eye examinations that the study participants will participate in and be
      compensated for follow the usual standard of care that patients receive in a setting that
      does not utilize teleretinal screening. Yearly dilated eye examinations are standard of care
      for all persons with diabetes.
