    
      This clinical trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, parallel, open study designed
      to compare epicardial left ventricular pacing to transvenous left ventricular pacing for
      delivering cardiac resynchronization therapy.

      After a pre-implant baseline evaluation, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one
      of two groups:

        -  Control group: resynchronization via a transvenous left ventricular lead (TVN CRT);

        -  Treatment group: resynchronization via an epicardial left ventricular lead (EPI CRT).

      All patients taking part in this study will undergo the implantation of a CRT device with or
      without ICD back-up (depending on the physician's decision), with right atrial and right
      ventricular transvenous leads.

      Patients will attend protocol scheduled visits before implant (pre-implant baseline
      evaluation), and post-implant: before hospital discharge, 6 weeks post-implant (optional
      visit), 3 months (optional visit), and 6 months after implant, time of study termination.
