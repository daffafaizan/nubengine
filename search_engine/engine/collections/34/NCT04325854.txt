      pregnancy. Previous studies have reported an increased incidence of EP in Assisted
      reproductive technologies techniques (ART) (Clayton et al., 2006), and in particular with
      fresh blastocyst embryo transfer compared with warmed embryo transfer (Londra et al., 2015).
      However a metanalysis on the topic argued that the results of many studies vary significantly
      within years of publishing and center locations; therefore, an accurate management strategy
      for patients at risk of ectopic gestation after invitro fertilization and embryo transfer
      (IVF-ET) procedure has not been established(V. Muller et al., 2016). In addition literature
      on I level ART procedures appears to be lacking. In consideration of the widespread use of
      ART techniques in gynaecology and the high morbidity and mortality associated with EP,
      providing further insight into the risk factors associated with EPs in ART appears of great
      relevance. Indeed, revising EP risk factors may help in reducing EP incidence in ART through
      the stratification of women according to their characteristics and the employment of special
      measures.

      The objective of this study is to compare the incidences of EPs in all ART procedures (both I
      and II level) in a single, third level ART center throughout a 10-year period. In addition,
      we also aim to revise recognized EP's risk factors among patients undergoing these procedure
      and to evaluate their impact in determining extrauterine implantation.
