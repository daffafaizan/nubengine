      associated pathoetiological/physiological processes in nigrostriatal structures has hindered
      discovery research and limited the ability to evaluate disease-modifying therapies. Recent
      research has generated excitement for using DTI and R2* MRI measures as biomarker(s) for
      PD-related pathology in nigrostriatal pathways, but they fall short by the lack of
      understanding of their clinical implications and biological/pathological underpinnings.
      Working closely with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)
      Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP), the proposed work will investigate multimodal
      MRI techniques in combination with fluid-based iron (Fe) protein profiles to serve as in vivo
      markers for PD-related nigrostriatal pathology that can be used as biomarkers for diagnosing
      PD, following its progression, and gaining mechanistic understanding of PD pathoetiology and
      pathophysiology.
