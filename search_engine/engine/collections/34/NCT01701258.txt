      Session 1 (SCID Session) The first session takes place at the Center for Depression, Anxiety,
      and Stress Research (CDASR) or Neuroimaging Center (both at McLean Hospital) and involves
      consenting, a clinical evaluation, a series of questionnaires, and a medical assessment.

      Session 2 or 3 (fMRI Session) The third session takes place at the Neuroimaging Center. Using
      a double-blind design, participants will be administered either amisulpride (50 mg) or
      placebo. Participants will complete the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task during functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the Probabilistic Stimulus Selection Task (PSST)
      afterwards.

      Session 2 or 3 (PET Session) This session takes place at Massachusetts General Hospital. 9
      mCi of [11C] altropane will be injected by a trained nuclear medicine technician and positron
      emission tomography (PET) scanning will begin. Prior to the PET scan, a blood serum pregnancy
      test will be administered for females.

      Session 4 (ERP Session) The fourth session takes place at the CDASR and involves an
      electroencephalography (EEG) recording, the Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT), and collecting
      saliva samples to assess cortisol levels.
