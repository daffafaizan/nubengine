      1-year and 3-year bleeding rate of 33% and 41%, respectively. Screening for varices with a
      video endoscopy is limited by its cost, patient compliance, and the risks of sedating a
      patient with portal hypertension. Capsule endoscopy is a novel method that may reduce the
      costs and increase compliance for screening.

      The investigators propose to screen 100 consecutive patients with advanced cirrhosis for
      esophageal varices. A capsule endoscopy and video endoscopy will be done on the same day. The
      varices seen on video endoscopy will be graded using a standard grading scale. Both capsule
      and video endoscopy images will be assessed in a blinded fashion by 4 independent
      investigators. Finally, the video endoscopic images will be compared to capsule endoscopy to
      develop a capsule endoscopy grading system that corresponds to video endoscopy.

      The primary endpoint of the study will be to develop a grading system for esophageal varices
      using capsule endoscopy. Secondary endpoints of the study include sensitivity, specificity,
      inter- and intraobserver variation of variceal grading using capsule endoscopy; patient
      acceptance as assessed on a visual analogue scale; and a cost comparison (facility fees +
      professional fees) of the two screening methods.
