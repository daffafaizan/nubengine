      That said, significant disparity in rates exist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and other sexual
      minority women (LGB) versus non-LGB teen women: Research suggests that lesbian and bisexual
      teen women are between two and four times more likely to report having been pregnant than
      teen women who identified as exclusively heterosexual. Despite this compelling evidence that
      lesbian and bisexual adolescent women are at risk for teen pregnancy, programs tailored to
      the unique needs of adolescent LGB women are nonexistent. Evidence-based teen pregnancy
      prevention (TPP) programs targeting LGB teen women are urgently needed.

      The Girl2Girl intervention text messaging-based TPP program designed specifically for LGB
      women ages 14-18 years, nation-wide. The investigators will test the intervention in a
      randomized control trial (RCT) of 840 LGB teenage women randomly assigned to either the
      intervention (n = 420) or control (n = 420) arms. Our primary efficacy outcome measures,
      measured at 12-months post-intervention, will be: (a) abstinence from penile-vaginal sex; (b)
      condom use during penile-vaginal sex, (c) use of other birth control methods during
      penile-vaginal sex, and (d) pregnancy.

      If effective, Girl2Girl has promise to be quickly and cost-effectively implemented to scale
      to help to curb the spread of teenage pregnancy among women who identify as LGB.
