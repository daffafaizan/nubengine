      lung infections are often caused by a bacteria called PA. Treatment with antibiotics can stop
      or slow down the growth of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given by mouth, intravenously
      (IV), or by inhalation as a mist. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI), an investigational formulation of the
      antibiotic administered using the eFlowÂ® Electronic Nebulizer by PARI GmbH, in CF patients
      with PA.

      In this study, participants were screened for eligibility at Visit 1 (Day -42) and returned
      to the center for Visit 2 after a 14-day evaluation period. At Visit 2 (Day -28),
      participants began a 28-day course of open-label Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (TIS). At
      Visit 3 (Day 0), following completion of the 28-day course of TIS, participants began
      randomized, blinded treatment with either AZLI twice a day (BID) or three times a day (TID)
      or placebo BID or TID, and continued treatment for a total of 28 days, with a clinic visit at
      Day 14 (Visit 4) and at the end of treatment (Visit 5 [Day 28]). Participants returned for
      visits every 2 weeks for 8 weeks after the end of the blinded treatment (Visits 6 to 9 [Days
      42 to 84]).

      Two hundred and forty-seven participants were treated in the TIS phase of this study. Two
      hundred and eleven subjects completed the TIS phase and were treated in the
      placebo-controlled phase with study drug (AZLI or placebo).
