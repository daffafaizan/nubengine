    
      Rotator cuff surgery is a painful arthroscopic surgery. In outpatient surgery, the surgeons
      have to increase the security and surveillance after the surgery to reassure the patient and
      avoid complications.

      Most patients receiving ambulatory rotator cuff surgery have high pain score, and management
      and aspects of the rehabilitation can be challenging. However, regular follow-up is still
      considered important in the early post-operative phase. In between the conventional
      appointment 6 weeks post op and 12 weeks post op, the surgeons have no status of the patient,
      and no markers to check if the postoperative care is evolving right.

      Currently, the investigators are using a mobile application (Orthense by Digikare, Blagnac,
      France) to complement in-person postoperative follow-up care for patients.
