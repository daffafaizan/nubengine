      likelihood of long-term opioid use. Many efforts have been made to reduce postop pain and
      opioid use, including developments in incisional site injections of local anesthetics,
      continuous incisional site anesthetic pain pumps, as well as multimodal comprehensive pain
      management, yet patients undergoing lumbar spine surgeries continue to depend on opioids for
      relief. Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) (Exparel) is a novel formulation of long-acting
      bupivacaine, lasting for up to 72 hours following injection. LB has been shown to be
      efficacious in reducing postop pain and opioid utilization in several different surgical
      settings, however its utility in spine surgeries has still yet to be established. The goal of
      this study is to determine the efficacy of liposomal bupivacaine vs saline in lumbar spine
      surgeries in reducing opioid utilization as well as determine if there difference patient
      reported outcomes and length of hospital stay.
