      amount of severe side effects including mainly erosion of the atrial wall, embolizations and
      arrhythmias. The IRFACODE study has shown excellent results in Patients with various
      generations of the Occlutech devices. IRFACODE II study will evaluate the performance and
      safety of the OcclutechÂ® Flex II device in patients with closure of secundum atrial septal
      defects (ASD II).

      Methods: The IRFACODE II study is a retrospective, non-randomized open access study for
      centres with a minimum of about 50 patients to evaluate the safety and side effects of ASD
      closure with this device. A minimum of 2000 patients that have an ASD II closed with this
      device until 31. June 2016 will be enrolled, the follow-up will be until 31. June 2017.
      Primary outcome measures for safety are the amount of erosions over a minimum follow-up time
      of 12 months. Primary outcome measures for device performance will include the success of
      complete ASD closure. Secondary outcome measures for safety will include the technique of
      implantation, the success rate in anatomically difficult ASDs, the incidence of arrhythmias
      (AV block, atrial fibrillation or flutter), device embolization, embolic events or migraine.
      A subgroup analysis according to patients age and anatomy of the defect will be performed.

      Outlook: The IRFACODE II study is the first trial intended to detect the actual incidence of
      erosion after ASD closure using the Flex II device. Although the trial is primarily designed
      to study the safety and device performance, the incidence of other potential side effects
      will be also evaluated.
