      arm of this study will be orally supplemented with high doses of vitamin D to achieve serum
      25(OH)D concentrations of 200-250 nmol/L (80-100 ng/ml). Therefore, the supplementation
      dosage is not pre-set but will be determined on an individual basis. Vitamin D
      supplementation will be continued for 16 months, followed by a 12 month follow up period.
      Monthly monitoring of serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels will assure the safety of our
      treatment protocol. Subjects in the control arm of the study will be receiving standard
      cancer care at InspireHealth that includes supplementation with at least 2,000 International
      Units of vitamin D.
