      have a prolonged ICU stay. It is well established that prolonged ICU stay is associated with
      reduced muscle strength, functional ability and quality of life.

      Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) via a threshold device has been proposed as an effective
      exercise for minimizing the detrimental effect of mechanical ventilation in critical ill
      patients with prolonged weaning. Additionally, Nasal High Flow (NHF) oxygen has been proved
      to support efficiently either high or low-risk patients after extubation and thus preventing
      re-intubation.

      A randomized intervention study was designed to assess the efficacy of combining IMT and NHF
      as therapeutic strategies for difficult weaning. Once patients with prognostic factors of
      difficult weaning are awake and co-operative they will be randomized to one of the two
      following study groups: 1) IMT and NHF group, 2) IMT and Venturi mask group. IMT will start
      as soon as the patient wakes up and is cooperative, ventilated with support settings. Each
      allocated oxygen delivery device will be applied immediately after extubation. IMT
      intervention will continue until patients' discharge from the ICU.
