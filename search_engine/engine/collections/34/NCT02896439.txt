    
      Methodology Design: This is an interventional study in routine care, prospective,
      single-center.

      Main objective / secondary:

      Primary objective :

      To evaluate the sensitivity of the neurophysiological monitoring combining two specific new
      procedures to detect intraoperative complications on the sciatic trunk (by measuring
      potential with somatosensory storied collection of P15 and electromyographic recording with
      the potential of sciatic nerve in the popliteal fossa).

      secondary objectives

      Frequency of neurophysiological changes on the interventions of the acetabulum.

      An anomaly being retained as:

        -  Interval prolongation N8-P15> 10%

        -  And / or decrease in the amplitude ratio P15 / N22> 50%

        -  And / or elongation of the latency of nerve potential> 10% of the value-operative OprÃ©

        -  And / or reducing the amplitude of the nerve potential> 50% Correlation between the
           impact of changes neurophysiological intraoperative and

        -  The occurrence of postoperative neurological deficit:

             -  motor deficit

             -  and / or sensory deficit

             -  territory of the sciatic trunk

      Correlation between the incidence of intraoperative neurophysiological modifications and:

        -  The type of surgery

        -  The type of fracture
