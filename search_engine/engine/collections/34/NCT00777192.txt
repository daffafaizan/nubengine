      regularly scheduled visit. The questionnaires are designed to measure pain and other
      symptoms, your mood, and your quality of life.

      You will also give a tissue sample by inserting a cotton tipped swab into your mouth and
      rubbing firmly against the inside of your cheek or underneath your lower or upper lip for
      about 1 minute at the most.

      Completing the 5 questionnaires and the swab sample should take about 30 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      After you complete the questionnaires and the swab sample collection, your active
      participation in this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 500 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
