      who are not seeking treatment for their alcohol use. Epidiolex is an FDA-approved formulation
      of cannabidiol, the primary non-psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Participants in the
      study will be randomly assigned to take Epidiolex or placebo for 8 days. There are 3 study
      visits, including a day-long visit in the laboratory.
