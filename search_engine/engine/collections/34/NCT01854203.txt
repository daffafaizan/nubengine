      combine intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without concurrent cisplatin in patients
      with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), in order to reevaluate the value
      of concurrent cisplatin when 4 cycles induction chemotherapy (gemcitabine+cisplatin) and IMRT
      is used.
