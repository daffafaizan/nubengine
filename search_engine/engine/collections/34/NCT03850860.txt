      recommended after the initial surgery of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). However, the
      tolerability of such high-dose intravenous regimens is poorly known. The empirical
      antimicrobial therapy of PJI is associated with an important rate of adverse, linked with the
      use of the vancomycin and the piperacillin-tazobactam combination. Some studies suggest to
      use vancomycin-cefepime, which remains to be evaluated in PJI.
