    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of GDC-0449 (vismodegib) in terms of 6-month clinical
      benefit rate (complete response, partial response, and stable disease, as per the revised
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria 2009).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Best overall response (as per the revised RECIST criteria 2009). II. 1- and 2-year
      progression-free survival. III. 1- and 2-year overall survival. IV. GDC-0449 safety. V.
      Pharmacogenomics analysis of predictive markers of treatment outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months.
