    
      -  Primary endpoint: To examine the effects of a practical lifestyle intervention that can
           be implemented by overweight or obese women (BMI greater or equal to 25) with early
           stage breast cancer (I-III) on outcomes such as body weight and change in BMI over the
           course of the study.

        -  Secondary endpoint: To assess the impact of such intervention on lipid profiles and
           hemoglobin A1C. The study group will be compared with a historical control group of
           patients with early stage breast cancer who are obese or overweight who were not given
           the intervention

        -  Secondary endpoint: To examine whether an active intervention program will lead into
           longstanding lifestyle modification in breast cancer patients with a BMI greater or
           equal to 25.
