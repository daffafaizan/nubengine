      suboptimal anatomically controlled neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Patients who
      consent will undergo screening assessments to evaluate their eligibility based on the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Afterwards, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      one of the two treatment arms and attend 15 planned visits. Subjects in the loading arm will
      receive 3x monthly loading doses followed by treatment every 12 weeks. Subjects in the
      non-loading arm receive one initial injection followed by treatment every 12 weeks.
