    
      This is an open label study evaluating the impact of SBI 5.0 g twice daily on

        1. nutritional status (plasma amino acid profile and kynurenine to tryptophan ratio),

        2. intestinal permeability (in vivo) and

        3. mucosal expression of pivotal genes including tight junction, secretory mechanisms,
           tissue repair proteins and chemokines status in patients with IBS-D.

      Plasma, duodenal and stool samples will be collected. Fifteen eligible subjects will be
      enrolled to receive SBI for 8 weeks (SBI 5.0g BID for 8 weeks).

      Intestinal permeability will be measured in vivo by two sugar urine excretion(s) after oral
      ingestion.

      Biopsies from the distal second or third portion of the duodenum will be obtained
      endoscopically, to measure mRNA expression of tight junction proteins and markers of immune
      function,
