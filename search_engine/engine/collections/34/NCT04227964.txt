      periodontitis subjects with a severely compromised tooth with attachment loss to or beyond
      the apex were randomized to PR or TER with either an implant or a tooth supported fixed
      partial denture. Subjects were kept on a strict periodontal supportive care regimen every 3
      months and examined yearly. Survival, complication free survival, recurrence analysis, oral
      health related quality of life and patient reported outcomes analyses will be performed.
