    
      The primary objective of this post-market registry is to further evaluate the safety and
      performance of the ACURATE neo™ Aortic Bioprosthesis and the ACURATE TF™ Transferral Delivery
      System in 500 consented patients with severe aortic stenosis and treated according to the
      instructions for use (IFU).

      Examinations to evaluate the aortic valve regurgitation performed as standard of care in
      patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement will be analyzed by an external
      Core Laboratory. These examinations are limited to echocardiography and/or contrast
      aortography assessments.

      The secondary objective is to collect adverse events and evaluate them according to the
      VARC-2 consensus document.
