    
      -  Patients will receive lenalidomide orally once daily for 21 days followed by a one week
           rest period (this is equivalent to one cycle).

        -  Four to seven days from the first dose of lenalidomide, the patient will start radiation
           therapy for approximately 6-7 weeks.

        -  A neurologic exam and routine blood tests will be performed weekly while the patient is
           receiving radiation therapy.

        -  Following the 11th week of treatment a MRI/CT scan will be performed to assess the
           status of the tumor. If there is no change, or there is shrinkage in the size of the
           tumor, the treatment will continue for another 4 week cycle.

        -  The four week cycle will continue as long as the disease remains stable or improved and
           the patient does not develop intolerable side effects. A MRI/CT scan will be done every
           2 cycles (8 weeks).
