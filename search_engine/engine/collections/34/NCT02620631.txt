    
      This is a prospective, case-controlled randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study
      expected to enroll up to 100 patients scheduled to undergo unilateral total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA) under regional anesthesia (defined as intrathecal spinal + femoral nerve blockade +
      femoral nerve catheter for post-operative analgesia) at Stony Brook Hospital. The patients
      were randomized to receive either IT morphine 0.2 mg (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2) in
      combination with their standard-of-care spinal anesthesia. Post-operatively, the patients
      were given an intravenous patient-controlled analgesic opioid for breakthrough pain.

      Only the pharmacist preparing the drug/placebo has knowledge of how each subject was
      randomized. Study staff completed multiple questionnaires regarding subjects' pain scores and
      patient disability from pain to assess changes between different study periods (ie.
      pre-operative, post-operative and follow up). Biological samples were also taken from each
      subject to measure and analyze differences and changes in endocannabinoid levels.
