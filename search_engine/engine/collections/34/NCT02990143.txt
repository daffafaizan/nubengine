      AGV-FP7 are in wide use upon glaucoma and comprehensive surgeons. The success of aqueous
      shunt surgery depends on the formation and maintenance of a thin permeable capsule around the
      posterior plate of the aqueous shunt. Encapsulated bleb formation, where the capsule is thick
      and elevated, is a common cause of drainage failure in the early post-operative period. This
      finding is usually accompanied by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), which requires
      additional intervention, often surgical and therefore reduces the success rate of the initial
      surgery.

      Recently, a biodegradable porous collagen-glycosaminoglycan copolymer matrix implant
      (Ologen), has become available for glaucoma surgery. This device is constructed so as to
      minimize random growth of fibroblasts and instead to allow them to grow through the pores in
      the matrix. OlogenÂ® CM,a biodegradable scaffold matrix, induces a regenerative non-scarring
      wound healing process without using anti-fibrotic agents.

      This study is to investigate whether placing Ologen over the posterior plate of the Ahmed
      glaucoma drainage device during initial implantation will allow the formation of a thinner
      capsule, and decrease the incidence and/or the extent of IOP elevation during the
      postoperative period.
