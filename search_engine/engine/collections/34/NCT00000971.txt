      children can be done, it is important to study the pharmacokinetics of this drug in this
      population, to get information regarding its use in pediatric patients receiving currently
      available antiretroviral drugs, and to get information on the antimycobacterial activity of
      this drug.

      Patients that are included are HIV infected and have started zidovudine (AZT) or didanosine
      (ddI) at least 4 weeks before entry into this study. Patients continue taking the medications
      at prescribed doses. In addition they also take clarithromycin. Patients continue treatment
      with AZT or ddI plus clarithromycin for 12 weeks.
