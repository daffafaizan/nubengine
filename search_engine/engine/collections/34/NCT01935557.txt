      heparin is administered during the procedure to achieve recommended activation clotting times
      (ACT) values, typically >300 seconds to prevent thromboemboli during the procedure.

      Most of the practitioners was that ACT level should be checked at 30- to 60-minute intervals
      and then have injected intermittently.

      intermittent heparin infusion, concentration is great changed because the heparin has
      30minutes half-period.

      researchers postulate that a constant therapeutic concentrations would be beneficial to
      continuous infusion than intermittent infusion.
