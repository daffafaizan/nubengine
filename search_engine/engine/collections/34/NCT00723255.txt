      I. To assess the activity of bevacizumab and temsirolimus, in terms of 6-month
      progression-free survival (PFS) and objective tumor response, in patients with recurrent or
      persistent endometrial cancer.

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of PFS and overall survival of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      II. To determine the effects of prognostic factors (i.e., performance status, histological
      subtype, and grade) in patients treated with this regimen.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the proportion of patients with objective tumor response and PFS at 6 months
      receiving the combination of bevacizumab and temsirolimus with those for the single agents
      bevacizumab and temsirolimus using historical controls.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV on days 1 and 15 and temsirolimus IV on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then
      every 6 months for 3 years, for a total of 5 years.
