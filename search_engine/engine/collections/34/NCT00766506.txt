    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), multicentre (when more than one
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), open-label (participants
      and physicians are told which treatment the participants are receiving), active-controlled
      (experimental treatment is compared to a standard treatment), parallel group study (a study
      comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments).
      The study will consist of 2 phases: screening phase and an open-label treatment phase. The
      duration of participation in the study for an individual participant will be 72 hours.
      Eligible participants (who require pain treatment with strong opioids [morphine like
      medications] for at least 24 hours after an elective spine or elective orthopedic surgery)
      will be randomly assigned to receive either Ionsys or morphine IV PCA. Participants' safety
      will be monitored.
