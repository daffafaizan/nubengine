      that appears to be associated with NRTI therapy. The natural history of lactate elevation as
      a complication of NRTI therapy is not clearly understood; however, some patients receiving
      these therapies experience a progressive increase in lactate to symptomatic levels.
      Deficiencies in thiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) have been implicated as
      cofactors in producing hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis in NRTI-treated patients. A
      nontoxic intervention that could prevent or reverse advancing lactic acidosis and preserve
      NRTI use would be highly desirable. To date, no controlled studies have been done to examine
      the potential role of dietary intake, B vitamin deficiency, and B vitamin therapy on the
      pathogenesis and clinical course on NRTI-associated lactic acidosis. The hypothesis proposed
      is that high-dose vitamin B treatment can normalize elevated lactate levels among
      NRTI-exposed individuals with moderately elevated lactate levels.

      This study consists of 2 steps: Step 1 (screening) and Step 2 (treatment). Patients are
      screened during Step 1 for sustained hyperlactatemia and Step 2 eligibility. Patients with
      sustained hyperlactatemia but no symptoms that indicate high risk of progression to lactic
      acidosis and with no plans to change existing NRTI-containing antiretroviral therapy may
      enter Step 2. A fasting, nonexercise, venous lactate level is obtained at Step 2 entry for
      use as a baseline measurement, and every patient receives high-dose oral vitamin B1 and B2
      therapy for 4 weeks. Fasting, nonexercise, venous lactate levels are measured at Weeks 1, 2,
      and 4 to observe the kinetics of changes in lactate levels on study treatment.
