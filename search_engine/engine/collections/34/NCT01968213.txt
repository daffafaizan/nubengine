    
      Rucaparib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate
      [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated
      with homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency (HRD). Clinical data have shown that
      ovarian cancer patients with and without evidence of a gBRCA mutation benefit from treatment
      with a PARP and that maintenance treatment with a PARP inhibitor following a response to
      platinum-based treatment increases PFS in patients with ovarian cancer. While patients with a
      BRCA mutation derived the most benefit, patients without evidence of a BRCA mutation also
      derived significant benefit.

      Patients enrolled into this study will be stratified into 3 groups based on tumor HRD status.
      The purpose of this study is to identify which of these groups of patients will most likely
      benefit from treatment with rucaparib. It is anticipated that rucaparib will provide
      therapeutic benefit and increase PFS in patients with HRD associated with a BRCA gene
      mutation or other HR gene alteration.
