      effective strategy in lowering viral load in HIV-1 infected patients when regular triple drug
      combinations have lost efficacy due to the emergence of HIV resistance mutations.

      This is an open label, crossover pilot study to explore the safety and efficacy of a rapid
      cycling regimen of antiretroviral combination therapy in HIV-1 infected patients with virus
      harboring genotypic resistance to at least three classes of antiretroviral therapy.

      The objectives are to study the feasibility, safety and efficacy of sequential combination
      therapy in HIV-1 infected patients with virus harboring genotypic resistance to at least
      three classes of antiretroviral agents and who currently have no adequate treatment options
      available.

      This is an open-label, crossover, pilot study. Patients that fail their current regimen, and
      who currently have no adequate treatment options left, will be randomized to start either an
      alternating triple combination, or to start a continuous quadruple regimen of drugs. After 6
      weeks, patients will crossover from either strategy to the other strategy for another 6
      weeks. Each period is preceded by an interruption of all antiretroviral therapy for 4 weeks.
      In the study period when regimens are alternated, two combinations of three drugs with the
      least possible cross-resistance will alternate every week.
