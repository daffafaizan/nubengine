      leading causes of anaesthesia related morbidity and mortality. Using the technique of video
      laryngoscopy, the alignment of the oral and pharyngeal axis to facilitate endotracheal
      intubation is obsolete. In this study we evaluate the C-MAC video laryngoscope (STORZ,
      Tuttlingen, Germany) for endotracheal intubation in difficult intubation situations (Cormack
      & Lehane (CL) grade 3 and 4) validated by Macintosh laryngoscope. We hypothesize that
      endotracheal intubation is possible using the C-MAC in patients after failed direct
      laryngoscopy. We also examine whether visualisation of the glottis is improved with this
      device compared to direct laryngoscopy and possible complications such as soft tissue injury.
