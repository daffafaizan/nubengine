      I. Examine the feasibility of a couple-based and a caregiver yoga program in glioma patients
      undergoing radiotherapy (RT) and their partners.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the initial efficacy of the yoga program in patients and their partners
      regarding quality of life (QOL) outcomes (i.e., fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressive
      symptoms, and overall QOL and health care utilization).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore potential moderation (e.g., baseline psychological distress, patients' tumor
      grade, performance status and class attendance) of the intervention effects.

      OUTLINE: The first five couples are assigned to arm I. All subsequent couples are randomized
      to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients and their partners attend up to 15, 45-60 minute sessions of Hatha yoga over
      the course of radiation therapy 5 times a week for 5-6 weeks. The program comprises four main
      components: joint loosening with breath synchronization; postures with deep relaxation
      techniques; breath energization with sound resonance; and meditation. At the fifth session,
      patients and their partners receive a digital video disc (DVD) and are encouraged to practice
      on their own (individually and/or together) on the days when they do not meet with the
      instructor.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care provided by the health care team and complete
      questionnaires before and after radiation therapy.
