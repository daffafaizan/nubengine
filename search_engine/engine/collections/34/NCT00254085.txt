      insulin resistance. At an intravenously glucosestimulation, patients with Type 2 diabtes has
      a decresed first phase insulin response compared to healty peoples. Because the hyperglycemia
      after meal, observed i Type 2 diabetics patients, is related to the defect in the first phase
      insulin response it is our hypothesis that substitution of the first phase insulin response
      with a little dose of insulin could normalise the blood glucose after the meal.

      20 patients with Type 2 diabetes will in a randomised, placebocontrolled, dobble-dummy study
      be included for three days treatment with Insulin aspart vs placebo. Primary endpoint is
      bloodglucose fluctuations monitored by a continously glucose monitor.
