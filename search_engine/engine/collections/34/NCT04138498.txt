      crossover study in approximately 36 adult ADHD subjects. All subjects considered eligible at
      Screening will proceed to tolerability test day, dosing 40 mg Focalin XR to evaluate safety
      and tolerability of the higher dose of d-MPH. If subject is able to safely tolerate the test
      dose, and meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be considered eligible for
      randomization into the study. All subjects will be randomized to receive four treatments
      throughout the course of the study; one CTx-1301 trimodal d-MPH tablet containing 6.25 mg
      d-MPH, one Focalin 5 mg XR capsule, one CTx-1301 50 mg tablet, and one 40 mg Focalin XR
      capsule. Administration of study drug will occur only on Assessment Days; no study drug will
      be administered during screening or unscheduled days (USVs).

      The lowest and highest doses of CTx-1301 (dexmethylphenidate, 6.25 and 50 mg) were selected
      to bridge to the lowest and highest doses of Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate, 5 and 40 mg) in
      this comparative BA study.
