      of function in already disabled individuals. Almost all patients with PD report disturbed
      sleep, including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), disorders of initiating and maintaining
      sleep (DIMS) or parasomnias.1 The underlying pathology associated with PD and medication
      effects have both been implicated in the sleep disorders affecting these patients. EDS has
      become the focus of attention because of its effect on quality of life and impairment in
      driving and predisposition to traffic accidents. Its prevalence has been estimated between
      15-50%. Treatment of EDS has become an important factor in the management of the PD patient,
      and the recent introduction of modafinil, a wakefulness promoting agent approved for
      narcolepsy, has led to increasing off-label use of this agent. Prior to modafinil,
      amphetamine and methylphenidate, two classical psychostimulants, were the agents of choice in
      treating EDS. However, these agents also have a direct effect on the dopaminergic system.
      They increase both sleep and REM latency, while reducing total sleep time and REM sleep. By
      comparison, the mechanism of action of modafinil is unknown, yet distinct from that of the
      psychostimulants. A direct comparison of the effect on EDS of modafinil with classical
      psychostimulants is lacking. The overall goals of this research proposal are to determine
      which agent is most effective in treating EDS in PD patients by using an open-label
      randomized control study comparing efficacy, onset of action and tolerability.
