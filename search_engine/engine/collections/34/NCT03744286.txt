      or can allow a slip in the forward and/or backward direction of up to 8 inches. This distance
      was determined from a review of slip bio-mechanics that noted that a slip is likely to occur
      when a slip distance exceeds 10 cm (3.9 inches) with the probability of recovery decreasing
      as the distance increases. The first goal of the project is to determine the optimal distance
      required for individuals with incomplete spinal cord injuries to have a 50% fall rate, as
      healthy individuals were found to have a fall rate of 50% at 11 inches. Investigators will
      then look at common clinical assessments and examine their ability to predict an individual's
      ability to recover from the individual's identified optimal slip distance. Investigators will
      also look at within session training effect on a person's balance control following a
      training session using the device.
