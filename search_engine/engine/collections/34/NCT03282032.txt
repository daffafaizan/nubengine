      thoracic surgery. However, OLV may cause serious pulmonary complications due to
      intraoperative hypoxia.

      Animal studies showed a positive effect of OLV preconditioning (Intermittent OLV before
      surgical intervention) on perioperative pulmonary oxygenation.

      Thus, we designed a study to observe the effect of OLV preconditioning on perioperative
      oxygenation during thoracic surgery
