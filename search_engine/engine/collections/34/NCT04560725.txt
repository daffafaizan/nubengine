      specific membrane antigen is a highly specific prostatic epithelial cell membrane antigen,
      which is highly expressed in solid tumors such as prostate cancer. More than 90% of prostate
      cancer cells express PSMA, so PSMA can be used as an important imaging target for prostate
      cancer.Positron emission tomography has the advantages of non-invasive, high resolution and
      high sensitivity, etc. The PET tracer based on PSMA radiographic label is developing rapidly,
      which is of great significance for the early diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of prostate
      cancer.Used for radionuclide 68Ga has a half-life of PET imaging (T1/2 = 68 min) is
      appropriate, prepared from 68Ge-68Ga generator, relatively low cost, coordination marking
      method is simple, easy to realize automatic synthesis technology and advantages of medicine
      preparation, so 68Ga- labeled PSMA targeted molecular probe in prostate cancer has been
      widely applied in the diagnosis of disease.

      [68Ga]P137 is a novel PSMA targeted molecular probe labeled with 68Ga. DOTA is used as a
      bifunctional linker to coordinate with 68Ga3+. The labeling method is simple, the biological
      stability is high, the tumor site has obvious radioactive enrichment, and the imaging effect
      is superior.This project provides research on [68Ga]P137 PET/CT imaging for patients with
      suspected PCa, and provides basis for early diagnosis of PCa, formulation of treatment plan
      and efficacy evaluation.
