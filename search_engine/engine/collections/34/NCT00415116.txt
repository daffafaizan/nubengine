      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when administered with docetaxel
           and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV on day 1. Patients also
      receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      stable or responding disease after completion of 6 courses of treatment may continue
      lenalidomide alone once daily on days 1-14. Patients whose disease is stable or responding
      after completing 2 or 4 courses and who are unable to tolerate further chemotherapy may
      continue lenalidomide alone once daily on days 1-14, at the investigator's discretion.
      Treatment with lenalidomide repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lenalidomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6-8 patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
