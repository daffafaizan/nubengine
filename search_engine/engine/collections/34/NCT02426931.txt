      for renal calculi < 3.0 cm and is recommended by the European Association of Urology due to
      its minimally-invasive nature and satisfactory result.

      However, some limitations still remain. Poor maneuverability, extra costs for the ureteral
      access sheath, and high device vulnerability still preclude flexible ureteroscopy from wider
      distribution.

      Recently, the investigators present a novel ureterorenoscope, which is composed of a
      retractable rigid sheath and a semi-rigid ureteroscope with a flexible part on the tip. When
      the flexible tip of the inner shaft maintains within the sheath, working in the "rigid mode",
      the tip-flexible semi-rigid ureterorenoscope is capable of passing either the orifice or the
      physiological tortuosity of the ureter with ease. When the inner shaft is extended beyond the
      sheath, the endoscope is switched to the "flexible mode", capable of performing an intrarenal
      approach.

      This endoscope integrates the classic semi-rigid and flexible ureteroscope both structurally
      and functionally, and has been approved for clinical application by the China Food and Drug
      Administration. In this study, transverse comparison is designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the tip-flexible semi-rigid ureterorenoscope for the treatment of renal calculi.
