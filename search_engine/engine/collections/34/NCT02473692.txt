    
      Objective 1. To examine the feasibility and user usage patterns/demand of an online
      intervention designed to enhance adherence and optimize abortive medication-use for
      migraineurs.

      Goal 1: To evaluate the practical utility of an Internet-based user environment to host an
      intervention designed to increase knowledge of and facilitate adherence and optimize abortive
      medication use.

      Hypothesis 1A: That an Internet-based user environment can be appropriately suited to deliver
      an adherence intervention that, in turn, could be made widely accessible and readily
      employed.

      Hypothesis 1B: That a high proportion of patients referred to the adherence facilitation Web
      site will actually visit and make use of the adherence intervention Web site.

      Hypothesis 1C: That once the Web-based intervention is initiated, a low attrition rate will
      be observed and the majority of patients will complete the intervention.

      Objective 2. To examine the efficacy of an online adherence facilitation and medication
      optimization intervention in increasing knowledge of optimal abortive medication-use.

      Goal 2: To conduct a pilot trial examining the efficacy of an adherence and medication
      optimization intervention for improving knowledge and medication-use behavior in a wide range
      of migraine sufferers.

      Hypothesis 2A: That patients who complete the Web-based intervention will demonstrate
      improved knowledge of optimal abortive medication strategies at post-treatment and this
      knowledge will be maintained at follow-up.

      Hypothesis 2B: That patients who complete the Web-based intervention will report improved
      abortive medication use strategies at post-treatment and this behavior change will be
      maintained at follow-up.
