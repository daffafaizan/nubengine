      doses of indinavir, and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) to which the
      patient has not been exposed. Treatment C includes ritonavir, indinavir, and 2 NRTIs to which
      the patient has not been exposed. When virologic failure is first observed, the patient must
      return in 2 weeks for confirmation of failure and start the salvage regimen within 1 month of
      the first assay in which failure was observed. Patients who have less than 400 copies/ml HIV
      RNA after 16 weeks of therapy are considered responders and continue on the study. Those who
      have more than 400 copies/ml after 16 weeks of therapy are considered nonresponders and
      should be discontinued from the study. In addition, patients who respond and subsequently
      rebound with a viral load 0.5 log above the nadir and greater than 400 copies/ml on 2
      consecutive assays at least 2 weeks apart are considered treatment failures and should be
      discontinued from the study. Patients have regular physical exams, as well as virologic,
      immunologic, and pharmacokinetic assessments.
