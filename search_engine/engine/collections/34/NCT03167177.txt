      year or until they experience progressive disease (PD) or experience unacceptable toxicity
      (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraw consent, or if the Investigator feels it is
      no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete
      response (CR) in the induction phase will enter phase 2 of the study. Subjects may remain on
      phase 2 of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment will continue in phase 2 until the subject
      experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws
      consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to
      continue treatment. The maximum time on study treatment, including both phases, is up to 2
      years.
