    
      Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of HBI-8000 administered
      orally. Patients must be hospitalized as per guidance of the treating investigator throughout
      Cycle 1. Patients will receive HBI 8000 twice weekly (BIW) (after breakfast), in 28 day
      treatment cycles.

      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients. The first cohort of 3 patients will
      receive 30 mg BIW. Decisions regarding cohort escalation will be based upon the clinical
      experience in Cycle 1 (first 28 days) only. For a given cohort, if 1 patient enrolled in the
      cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within 28 days of the first dose, the
      cohort will be expanded to 6 patients.
