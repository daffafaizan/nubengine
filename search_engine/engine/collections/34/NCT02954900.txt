      prevention of this disease is a major public health issue. The U.S. Preventive Services Task
      Force and other professional organizations recommend that clinicians discuss chemoprevention
      with high-risk women. Breast cancer chemoprevention with anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen,
      raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole, is under-utilized, despite several randomized
      controlled trials demonstrating a 40-65% decrease in breast cancer incidence among high-risk
      women. Compounding this underutilization is the fact that a large proportion of women may be
      unaware of their high-risk status due to the investigators inability to adequately screen
      them in the primary care setting. Further research is needed to determine how knowledge about
      breast cancer, actual/perceived risk, and risks/benefits of chemoprevention are best
      communicated to women in order to promote breast cancer prevention strategies.

      This study assesses risk communication and shared decision-making in patient-clinician dyads
      by administering validated measures at baseline, after interacting with the tools prior to
      the clinic visit, and after the clinical visit (quantitative analysis); and by using
      observer-based methods of audio-tape recordings of their clinical encounters (qualitative
      analysis).

      The investigator hypothesizes that combining a patient-centered decision aid with a
      physician-centered decision support tool integrated into clinic workflow will improve
      accuracy of breast cancer risk perception, facilitate referrals for specialized risk
      counseling, and increase chemoprevention uptake.
