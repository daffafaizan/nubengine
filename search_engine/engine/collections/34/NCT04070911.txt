      their operation and met study criteria. Patients divided into three groups as the study
      (water group=50, ice group=50) and control (n=50). Patients in the study group were performed
      oral water/ice popsicle after their accession to PACU. However, the control group patients
      have performed rutin treatment and care without any other intervention. Physiologic variables
      and symptoms with thirst were followed in every three group patients at certain times. Data
