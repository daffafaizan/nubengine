      requested from all pediatric emergency patients presenting as a reason for "diarrhea"
      consultations between June 1 and September 30, 2020. It will be given by the nurse organizing
      the reception, a medical information questionnaire and a stool collection container for those
      accompanying a child with diarrhea.

      If the child presents stool during the waiting period or during the medical consultation,
      these will be collected and sent to the medical biology laboratory of the University Hospital
      for a broad analysis (virological, bacteriological and parasitological).

      The doctor in charge of the patient will complete a pre-established clinical information
      sheet.

      In the laboratory, the stool will be taken care of and a DNA extract will be made and
      preserved. The search for pathogens will be carried out by molecular biology, by series,
      non-prospectively. The results will only be transmitted at a distance and will not be
      communicated to families.

      Therapeutic management of children included in the study will be identical to the usual
      practice. Microbiological analysis will not delay, prolong or disrupt the treatment of the
      acute episod of diarrhea.
