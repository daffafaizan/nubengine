      A) Prognostic capacity of serum S100B levels to predict seizure recurrence. B) Association
      between the variation (%) of serum S100B levels between first seizure episode and scheduled
      follow-up (D14-D28) and seizure recurrence.

      C) Correlation of S100B with IL-1b, IL-6, NSE serum levels at the same time points.

      D) Association of serology data with: a) EEG profile (normal/abnormal); b) recurrence of
      seizures (Y/N).

      E) Comparison of S100B serum levels in lesional vs non-lesional patients. F) Establishment of
      a bio-bank (serum and cells).
