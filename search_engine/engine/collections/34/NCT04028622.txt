      Telemedicine anesthesia consultation (TCAD) experiments have been successfully conducted in
      the United States, demonstrating the technical feasibility and medical relevance of the
      approach. In partnership with the Rh√¥ne-Alpes Regional Health Agency, an Telemedicine
      anesthesia consultation will be set up at the University Hospital Grenoble for low-risk
      anesthetic and surgical patients via a telemedicine platform accessible to patients' homes.
      Avoiding transport, unclog consultations in hospitals, and avoiding absences from work for
      traditional consultations are some of the advantages of this new method of consultation. This
      project involves assessing the feasibility, safety, and costs associated with home anesthesia
      teleconsultation for patients requiring outpatient surgery.
