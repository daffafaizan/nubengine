      hypothesize is that commonly used excipients in oral medications change the rate or extent of
      Class 3 drug absorption and result in bioINequivalence. 2) Alternative hypothesis is that
      commonly used excipients in oral medications do not change the rate or extent of Class 3 drug
      absorption and do not result in bioINequivalence.
