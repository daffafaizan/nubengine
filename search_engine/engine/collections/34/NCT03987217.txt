      I. To evaluate the change in lean mass with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance
      training compared to resistance training alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate change in other body composition variables (i.e. fat mass, fat-free mass,
      percent body fat, appendicular lean mass) with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation +
      resistance training compared to resistance training alone.

      II. To evaluate the change in health outcomes associated with body composition (i.e. physical
      function, fatigue, insulin regulation) with 12 weeks of creatine supplementation + resistance
      training compared to resistance training alone.

      III. To examine associations between creatine supplementation use and changes in biomarkers
      linked with prostate cancer progression (prostate specific antigen [PSA] and inflammatory
      markers).

      IV. To evaluate the degree of adherence to the creatine supplementation protocol.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients complete Personal Optimism with Exercise Recovery (POWER) resistance
      training program sessions twice weekly over 30-60 minute each for 12 weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients complete POWER resistance training program sessions twice weekly over
      30-60 minutes each for 12 weeks and receive creatine monohydrate supplementation orally (PO)
      4 times daily during week 1, and then once daily (QD) during weeks 2-12.
