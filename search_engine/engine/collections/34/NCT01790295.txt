      related and unrelated donor transplants. In each donor transplant group, the first stage of
      this design will include 11 patients evaluated for death or graft failure by 100 days
      post-transplant. In each stratum, we will enroll additional patients (up to 20%) of stratum
      total to take into account exclusions due to donor failure (such as donor deemed unsuitable
      for stem cell donation due to medical or other reasons) only. Those patients who have
      toxicities related to Ruxolitinib and not been able to reach HCT due to these toxicities will
      be included in the estimation of overall failure rates. Only those patients who are excluded
      based on donor related issues without any regimen related complications will be excluded from
      the estimation of failure rates. However, all data on these patients will be reported.
