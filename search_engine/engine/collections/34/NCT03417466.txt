    
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, prospective single-sample correlational design
      without controls. Up to 72 subjects will be enrolled in order to have approximately 60
      subjects complete the study. Three investigational centers in China will be used during this
      study.

      Each subject will wear the following devices:

      • Two Enlite Sensors each connected to an iPro2 for approximately 6 days

      Sensor Location:

      • The 2 Enlite Sensors will be worn in the abdomen area. Investigational center staff will
      insert sensors and connect to the iPro2s.

      During the study, each subject will be randomized and undergo one Yellow Springs Instrument
      (YSI™) frequent sample testing (FST) (Day 1, 3-4, or 6).

      During the study, subjects will continue with their current diabetes regimen independent of
      the study devices. Subjects will be instructed by the investigational center that they are
      not to use the study devices (except for the study meter) for the management of their
      diabetes. The Study Meter may be used for treatment decisions and calibration of Enlite
      Sensor.
