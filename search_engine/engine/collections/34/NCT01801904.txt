      to wild-type RAS gene, including KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4)

      RAS mutational status of tumors of patients enrolled before amendment 1 approval will be
      centrally revised. Patients whose tumors will result RAS mutated at the biomarkers central
      revision, will be replaced. Therefore, the overall sample size at both the stages may be
      higher than the one initially planned.
