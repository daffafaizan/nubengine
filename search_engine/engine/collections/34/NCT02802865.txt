      mechanisms of action. Letrozole has been shown to be superior to clomid in achieving live
      birth rates in women with infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome. However, the combination
      of these medications has not been studied. This is a pilot study to evaluate if the
      combination treatment has improved efficacy as measured by ovulation rate.

      This is a randomized controlled trial of letrozole versus letrozole and clomiphene citrate
      (CC) for one menstrual cycle. Women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive letrozole
      2.5 mg or combination of letrozole 2.5 mg and clomiphene 50 mg for 5 days on days 3-7 of
      menstrual cycle. The women and their partners will be instructed to have regular intercourse
      with the intent to conceive during the cycle. Patients will have an transvaginal ultrasound
      mid cycle and to evaluate number of follicles (>15 mm), follicle size, endometrial thickness
      and pattern. Patients will have mid- luteal phase progesterone level drawn to evaluate
      ovulation. Side effect profile will also be monitored.
