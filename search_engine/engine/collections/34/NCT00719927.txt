      recommended weight loss and weight loss maintenance practices. In the national Behavioral
      Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, Latinas were found to be more likely to attempt
      weight loss than white or black females. However, they were least likely to follow the
      recommendations of consuming less calories and exercising at least 150 minutes per week. In
      fact, Latinas more than whites reported using fasting or diet pills as a method of weight
      control. Furthermore, participating in organized weight loss programs was less common among
      Latinas than whites. Hence, a weight control intervention aimed at helping Latinas develop
      the behavioral skills shown to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance is warranted.
      We propose to recruit 30 overweight or obese adult Latinas and randomly assign them to one of
      two conditions. Both conditions will offer 12 weekly group sessions involving a standard
      behavioral treatment. Behavioral techniques will be taught for the promotion of weight loss
      via adherence to a reduced caloric diet and increased physical activity. The first condition
      will consist of women participating with a female friend (comadre), while the second
      condition will consist of women participating without a support partner. An intervention
      strategy in which women participate in a behavioral weight loss program with a comadre will
      be evaluated in terms of participant recruitment and retention in this pilot study.
