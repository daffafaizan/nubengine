      110 Danish schools (27 schools from the Capital Region of Denmark, 18 schools from Region
      Zealand, 25 schools from Region of Southern Denmark, 30 schools from Central Denmark Region
      and 10 schools from Region of Northern Denmark).

      The schools included the total of 191 school teachers for teacher training (56 teachers from
      the Capital Region of Denmark, 28 teachers from Region Zealand, 42 teachers from Region of
      Southern Denmark, 50 teachers from Central Denmark Region and 15 teachers from Region of
      Northern Denmark). Each included teacher will be asked to recruit a class of pupils (15-25
      pupils) to test the effectiveness of the .b-programme (in total approx. 3000 pupils).
