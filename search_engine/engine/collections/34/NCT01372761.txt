    
      This protocol is designed to test the safety and efficacy of a drug called Beloranib
      (ZGN-433). It is to be tested for its ability to reduce weight in obese female subjects who
      are of non-childbearing potential. The study will provide information on how much ZGN-433
      gets into the blood, how long it stays in the body, and how it affects other biological
      markers.
