    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label study assessing the efficacy and safety of
      RBX2660 as an adjunct to antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent CDI. Efficacy of RBX2660,
      measured by the recurrence-free rate of CDI diarrhea without the need for retreatment with C.
      difficile anti-infective therapy or fecal transplant through 56 days after completion of
      study treatment with RBX2660, will be evaluated by comparing the recurrence-free rate
      observed in the study population to the recurrence-free rate identified from
      antibiotic-treated historical controls.

      Patients who have had either a) at least two recurrences after a primary episode (i.e., at
      least three episodes) and have completed at least two rounds of standard-of-care oral
      antibiotics or b) have had at least two episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization
      may be eligible to participate in the study. Study visits are 1- and 8-weeks after treatment
      with additional follow-up assessments at 3,6,12, and 24 months post treatment.
