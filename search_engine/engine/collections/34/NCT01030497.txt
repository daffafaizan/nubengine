    
      If you agree to take part in this study, right after your already scheduled routine PET/CT
      scan is complete, a study staff member will take you to a separate imaging room located in
      the same clinic area where your routine PET/CT scan was just performed.

      You will then sit in a chair as a study staff member positions the PEMFlex Solo II on either
      side of the part of the neck that has, or is suspected to have cancer. It will take about 20
      minutes to set up the PEMFlex Solo II and take the PET scan images.

      Length of Study:

      After the PET scan images have been taken using the PEMFlex Solo II, your participation in
      this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study. The PEMFlex Solo II is commercially available for PET scan
      imaging of the breast. Using the PEMFlex Solo II for imaging any other parts of the body is
      investigational.

      Up to 10 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
