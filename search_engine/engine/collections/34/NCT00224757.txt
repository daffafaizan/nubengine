      vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and aspirin reduces the risk of thromboembolism (TE)
      dramatically. Risk stratification is nowadays based on clinical characteristics. However,
      many high risk AF patients may actually be at low risk, identified by trans-oesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE).

      HYPOTHESIS A comprehensive strategy of TEE based aspirin treatment in AF patients eligible
      for VKA therapy is safe and feasible.

      OBJECTIVES

        1. To show that TEE based aspirin treatment is safe when compared with VKA therapy.

        2. To test the feasibility of TEE as a tool to detect all four echocardiographic features
           of high stroke risk.

      METHODS In this multi centre pilot study we will perform TEE in patients with AF who are
      eligible for VKA treatment. TTE will be used as pre-screening: if TTE shows left atrial
      abnormalities or aortic plaque, patients will be excluded from randomisation. TEE will be
      performed in all other patients to detect or exclude complex aorta plaques or signs of left
      atrial stasis. Three hundred patients who do not have these features on TTE will be randomly
      assigned to treatment with aspirin or VKA. Follow-up will be 1 year.

      EXPECTED RESULTS Application of a new echo-guided antithrombotic strategy as proposed herein
      is feasible and may help to reduce bleeding whilst stroke prevention is maintained. If the
      lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the yearly incidence of the primary endpoint on
      aspirin remains below 4.4% then a large multi centre randomised controlled trial will be
      performed.
