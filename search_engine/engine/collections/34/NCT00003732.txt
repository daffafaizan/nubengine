        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and quantitative and
           qualitative toxic effects of oral topotecan combined with intravenous carboplatin and
           paclitaxel in patients with stage IIB, IIC, III, or IV ovarian epithelial cancer. (phase
           I closed to accrual 12/21/00)

        -  Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of topotecan.

      Patients receive oral topotecan on days 1-5 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 5. Courses repeat every 21 days for a maximum of 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase I: Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6
           patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. (phase I closed to accrual 12/21/00)

        -  Phase II: An additional 50 patients receive up to 6 courses of treatment as in phase I
           at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (30 in phase I and 50 in phase II) will be accrued
      for this study. (phase I closed to accrual 12/21/00)
