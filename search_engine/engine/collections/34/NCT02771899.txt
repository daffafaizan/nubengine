      Paris, France) allows 3D spine reconstructions. The EOS system presents some advantages over
      MRI or CT Scans. The weight bearing position allows assessment in the functional position and
      the radiation exposure is 800-1000 times less then CT scans, allowing full spine acquisition
      even in pediatric patients. Selected anatomical landmarks are utilized to reconstruct a 3D
      model of the spine allowing global assessment as well as localized analysis.The aim of the
      study is to assess the clinical relevance of 3D stereographic reconstructions (from spineEOS
      3D) on patients, adults and children, who undergo spine surgery. This study will observe the
      value of 3D parameters at three different steps of the standard of care surgical procedure:
      preoperatively, peri-operatively, and post-operatively. The goal of this prospective study is
      to observe how 3D reconstructions could enhance the planning, the surgery and the post-op
      analysis and outcomes. This pilot study could help to understand which and how 3D parameters
      could improve adult and pediatric spine surgery.
