      undergo a clinical exam (inspection and palpation of the foot, measurement of bilateral
      passive ankle range of motion). All participants will complete the Foot and Ankle Outcome
      score and the EQ-5D-5L health questionnaire to obtain pain and functional scores.
      Participants will be able to familiarize with treadmill walking at their preferred walking
      speed. Surface electrodes will be placed bilaterally over the tibialis anterior,
      gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, soleus, and peroneus longus. Isokinetic muscle strength
      in ankle plantarflexion/ dorsiflexion will be tested using the Biodex system 4 Pro.
      Reflective surface markers will be placed bilaterally on anatomic landmarks according to the
      PlugIn Gait model9 and a specific foot model. These markers are seen by 8 Vicon cameras. Data
      for a standing reference trial will be collected, and participants will be asked to walk back
      and forth on a flat walkway until three valid left and right steps will be recorded (force
      plate hit centrally, approximately 10 minutes). Then, they will be asked to balance on one
      leg for 30 seconds per leg. Participants will be asked to stand on the treadmill (h/p cosmos,
      Zebris), and they will perform three single-limb heel rises with each leg while kinematic,
      electromyography (EMG), and pressure data will be measured. Participants will then walk
      barefoot for 2 minutes at 0% slope while kinematic, EMG, and pressure data will be recorded.
      Subsequently, the treadmill incline will be increased to 15%, and data for 2 minutes walking
      at this slope will be recorded.
