    
      The study is a randomized crossover trial comparing the effect of atorvastatin (10 mg/day)
      and probucol (500 mg/day) for 24 weeks in 30 patients (urinary albumin excretion 0.3-2.0
      g/day, and creatinine clearance > 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or serum creatinine concentration < 2
      mg/L). Lipid parameters, mean LDL particle diameter, creatinine clearance, and urinary
      albumin to creatinine excretion ratio are measured before and during treatment periods. It
      will be evaluated that, first, whether atorvastatin and probucol significantly reduce serum
      total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations, second, whether atorvastatin and
      probucol significantly increase the LDL particle size, third, whether significant differences
      in urinary albumin/creatinine excretion ratio and creatinine clearance are observed in both
      groups during treatment.
