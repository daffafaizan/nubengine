    
      Approximately 30 healthy volunteers will be randomized to Albuterol or placebo. We powered
      our study to detect a difference of 0.5 mmol/L, but hypothesize that the difference will be
      greater than 1.0 mmol/L.

      All volunteer subjects will sign a written consent, approved by the Institutional Review
      Board. The intended pool of volunteers will be from residents, attendings, and medical
      students in the hospital. The consent form will clearly specify that their participation in
      the study will not impact their academic status or employment.

      The subjects randomized to the Albuterol arm will receive a one hour 10 mg continuous
      Albuterol nebulizer treatment. Those randomized to placebo will receive a one-hour saline
      nebulizer treatment. The chief pharmacist for the study will randomly assign a number between
      one and thirty to fifteen Albuterol treatments and fifteen placebo treatments.

      Subjects will be monitored with cardiac monitor and serum lactate levels will be drawn every
      15 minutes.
