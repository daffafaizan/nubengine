    
      The primary aims of this study are:

      AIM #1 - To assess the effect of weekly antenatal administration of oral vitamin D3 (875
      mcg/week = 35,000 IU week â‰ˆ 5,000 IU per day) started in the third trimester (26-29 weeks
      gestation) on maternal vitamin D status and fetal-neonatal vitamin D status (cord blood), in
      comparison to a placebo control supplement.

      AIM #2 - To demonstrate the maternal and fetal safety of weekly maternal antenatal (second
      and third-trimester) vitamin D supplementation at a dose of 875 mcg/week by monitoring
      maternal serum calcium, urinary calcium excretion, cord blood calcium concentration, and
      newborn clinical parameters.

      AIM #3 - To measure the effect of antenatal vitamin D supplementation on selected biomarkers
      of fetal-neonatal immune function in cord blood: in vitro stimulated cord blood mononuclear
      cell (CBMC) LL-37 expression, gene expression related to inflammatory and immunoregulatory
      pathways, Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion, and bactericidal properties.
