      path has been previously modeled, with the identification of the facial nerve. Milling will
      be done in 2 stages with a CT (computerised tomography scan) and electromyographic
      verification of the facial nerve. The insertion of the implant will be performed manually
      under endoscopic control. The preoperative and postoperative course of the patient will be
      identical.
