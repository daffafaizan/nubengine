      The success of any therapeutic intervention, whether preventive or curative, is ultimately
      dependent on the individual's adherence to treatment. Unfortunately, the failure of a large
      percentage of patients to adhere to prescribed medical regimens is a widely recognized and
      well documented phenomenon. It has been estimated that as many as 50 percent of patients do
      not take their prescribed medications, and of those remaining, less than two-thirds take
      their medication as prescribed.

      The study was part of a two grant initiative, "Evaluation of Adherence Interventions in
      Clinical Trials", developed by the Behavioral Medicine Branch staff and the Clinical Trials
      Branch staff and by members of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee
      Behavioral Medicine and Prevention Working Groups. The initiative, jointly sponsored by the
      NHLBI and the National Center for Nursing Research (NCNR), was released in September 1991 and
      awarded in September 1992.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      All participants medication adherence was measured by self-report, canister weighing, and
      with the Nebulizer Chronolog, a microprocessor-based monitor of inhaler adherence that
      recorded the date and time of each inhaler use. The subjects were assigned to one of three
      adherence treatment groups; a control condition, an informed condition, and a feedback
      condition. Adherence outcomes were analyzed with respect to treatment assignment, as well as
      CAMP measures of asthma morbidity, pulmonary function, medication side effects, psychosocial
      development, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness analyses were also conducted.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
