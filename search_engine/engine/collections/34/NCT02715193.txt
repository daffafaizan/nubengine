      with type 1 diabetes will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical
      research unit, to carefully monitor blood glucose; and establish the baseline insulin
      requirement for maintaining targeted normoglycemia (postabsorptive: 90-120 mg/dL; and
      postprandial: <180 mg/dL).

      The patients will then be subjected to a hyperglycemic period (250-300 mg/dL) by a stepwise
      reduction in insulin infusion. After receiving a single SC dose of REMD-477 or matching
      placebo in a double-blinded fashion, all subjects will be assessed for the post-treatment
      24-hour insulin requirement needed to maintain targeted normoglycemia (postabsorptive: 90-120
      mg/dL; and postprandial: <180 mg/dL); and to be monitored closely for safety, tolerability
      and targeted glycemic control, for a 48-hr period. After the in-patient residency period,
      subjects will return to the clinic for weekly out-patient safety follow-up visits for 8
      weeks.
