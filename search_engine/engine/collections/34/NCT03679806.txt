      well-controlled posture provides improved upper limb functions which are limited in almost
      75% of pwMS due to weakness, spasticity or tremor. It is an already known fact that hand
      dexterity is an indicator of fall risk due to neuromuscular causes and/or abnormalities in
      the corpus callosum in pwMS.

      Aquatic therapy (AT) provides a safe and effective environment for many therapeutic purposes.
      It is important to understand the effects of each type, intensity, and duration of the
      aquatic interventions to accomplish most suitable aquatic exercise program.

      Halliwick method, neuromotor treatment approach which uses fluid and mechanical properties of
      water, is based on postural control by mobilizing and controlling body parts through the Ten
      Point Program.

      During Aquatic Plyometric Exercises, proximal part of the body needs to be stabilized to
      generate a sudden and powerful contraction at the distal part and stabilization of the
      proximal joints is necessary for maintaining distal movements in a coordinated way.

      It is important to understand the effects of each type, intensity, and duration of the
      aquatic interventions to accomplish most suitable aquatic exercise program. This study aims
      to compare and contrast the effects of two different aquatic exercises on postural control
      and hand function.
