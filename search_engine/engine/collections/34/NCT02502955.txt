    
      Patients dying within 96h after a cardiological intervention of a cardio-/vascular-surgery
      are eligible to be included in the study.

      If the next of kin give oral informed consent a virtual autopsy based on a CT angiography
      followed by a classic medical autopsy will be performed.

      Ante mortem findings will be compared to findings from both autopsy methods and presented to
      the clinicians.

      Primary outcome will be the inter-method agreement. Secondary outcome will be the
      satisfaction of the clinicians evaluated by a standardized questionnaire.
