      responsible of a wide range of hepatological diseases and side effects. Those are poorly
      described, due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition of several
      of these adverse events. This study investigates the main characteristics of patients
      affected by rare hepatological side effects imputed to drugs. A causality assessment
      according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center) is
      systematically applied.
