        -  Validate a prognostic score for death at the end of the first week from initial data.

        -  Validate a predictive score of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients
           with septic shock by comparing with the Gold Standard of the International Society on
           Thrombosis and Haemostasis (overt-DIC in the first 5 days after inclusion).

      As for the main objective, these scores are based on biological markers scored under
      emergency situations within the first 24 hours of routine clinical practice management for
      septic shock.

      The objectives and endpoints stated correspond to the protocol directly submitted to ethics
      authorities prior to the first inclusion and can be verified by contacting the Committee for
