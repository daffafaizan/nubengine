    
      Multicenter , Phase IV, open labeled, non-randomized trial to assess the Efficacy of
      Hansenula-derived recombinant pegylated interferon α 2a (Reiferon Retard® in treatment of
      naïve chronic hepatitis c virus Egyptian patients.

      Each participant will be subject to thorough history taking, complete clinical examination,
      Biochemical laboratory and hematological tests, U/S imaging as well as histologic assessment
      of liver disease stage and severity to ensure his/her eligibility to be enrolled in the study
      according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria .

      Eligible subjects will be treated with Reiferon Retard® 160 µg once weekly by subcutaneous
      injection for 48 weeks treatment plus weight-based Ribavirin orally (1200 mg/kg daily for
      those > 75 Kg or 1000mg/Kg daily for those ≤ 75 kg in divided doses). HCV RNA will be
      assessed at week 12 of initiation of therapy to identify Early Virologic Response (EVR), at
      week 24 to identify breakthrough viremia, at week 48 to identify End of treatment Response
      (ETR), and at week 72 to identify Sustained Virologic Response (SVR).

      All subjects will be followed up during the study as described in the table below (Section 4
      Study Design).
