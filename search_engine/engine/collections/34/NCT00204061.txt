      untreated psychotic and a prodromal state. The duration of untreated psychosis correlates
      with a significant worsening of several outcome variables and persons fulfilling criteria of
      a prodromal state are already suffering from prodromal symptoms and from a significant
      deterioration of social and vocational functioning. However, a sufficient strategy for early
      intervention is still lacking. The study will provide an empirical basis for a
      pharmacological treatment option. An open-label, randomized, multi-centre parallel group
      design is used. An intensified clinical management (CM), which allows needs-based
      psychological crisis intervention, is compared to a combination of such a CM and the atypical
      neuroleptic amisulpride. For analysis 130 patients will be recruited within three years, the
      treatment period is two years.
