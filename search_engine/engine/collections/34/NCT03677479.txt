      alveolus in both jaws was significantly more pronounced on the buccal aspect. This comes as
      no surprise, as the buccal surface of the anterior alveolar ridge is commonly thin and
      fragile. The maxilla tends to exhibit greater reductions in width than in height. The loss of
      tissue contour takes place mostly during the first 1 to 3 months following tooth extraction.
      Because the healing patterns of human sockets are unpredictable architecture), then such
      common procedures as extractions may lead to intraoral situations in which the remaining
      healed ridge does not allow for an esthetic and functional solution without the aid of
      significant bone grafting.
