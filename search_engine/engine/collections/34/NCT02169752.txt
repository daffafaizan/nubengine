      ventricle function in people with systemic sclerosis-associated pre-pulmonary arterial
      hypertension. It is also looking at using right ventricle function changes as a marker of
      disease severity.

      Pre-pulmonary arterial hypertension is a borderline elevation in blood pressure in the lungs.
      Pre-pulmonary arterial hypertension is not currently treated with the drug therapies that are
      used for pulmonary arterial hypertension. It represents a group of patients that are at risk
      for developing pulmonary arterial hypertension.

      The administration of ambrisentan is the experimental part of this study. Ambrisentan has not
      been approved by the FDA for use of improving right ventricle function in people with
      pre-pulmonary arterial hypertension. You will still receive your normal clinical care.

      The purpose of this study is to learn more about ambrisentan and its role in treating
      systemic sclerosis-associated pre-pulmonary arterial hypertension. Ambrisentan is already
      approved for use in people with systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial
      hypertension, but this study wants to research its role in people with pre-pulmonary arterial
      hypertension.
