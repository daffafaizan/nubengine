    
      Randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of collagen infiltrations in pelvic pain
      caused by cesarean scars and/or episiotomies.

      Those patients who are referred to the Rehabilitation consultation for pelvic pain secondary
      to pain in the cesarean/episiotomy scar who meet the inclusion criteria and who agree to
      participate and sign the informed consent will be included.

      In the baseline assessment, the patient's clinical information will be collected: age,
      obstetric history, pathological history, active treatments and if they breastfeed. The
      following questionnaires will be passed: the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Short Form
      McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) to evaluate the pain caused by the scar, the Vancouver
      Scale of Healing (VSS) and the Patient Component (PSAS) of the Patient and Observer Objective
      Assessment Scale (POSAS) for the evaluation of the scar and initial photograph of the scar. A
      physical examination of the pelvic floor will be performed and the areas to be infiltrated
      will be detected.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to a Control group, will perform the conventional
      treatment, and an Experimental Group, who will perform the conventional treatment and will
      also have 3-5 infiltrations with collagen.

      At 6 and 16 weeks to finalize the treatment, a blinded assessor will perform the final
      assessment by passing the questionnaires used in the baseline assessment. The subjective
      satisfaction of the clinician and the patient will also be assessed using the questionnaires
      Clinical Global Improvement Impression Scale (GGI-I) and the Patient Global Improvement
      Impression Scale (PGI-I).
