        -  Assess the balance of risks and benefits in prolonging the duration of adjuvant
           tamoxifen by at least 5 years in patients with curatively treated breast cancer who have
           already had about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. After about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen,
      recurrence-free patients are randomized to stop tamoxifen treatment immediately or to
      continue tamoxifen treatment for at least 5 more years.

      Patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
