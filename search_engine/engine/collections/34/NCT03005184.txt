      will undergo a three-week run-in period in which any prior angiotensin-converting enzyme
      (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker they were taking will be discontinued and
      they will be given valsartan 80 mg bid in a single-blind fashion. After the run-in, subjects
      will undergo four study periods in random order. During two study periods they will receive
      enalapril 10 mg bid and during two they will receive sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) 200 mg bid
      for seven days. On the seventh day or each period, subjects will complete a study day in
      which they are randomized to receive either the bradykinin B2 receptor blocker icatibant or
      placebo intravenously. Each study period will be separated by a three-week washout during
      which subjects receive valsartan 80 mg bid.
