      insulin sensitivity. The insulin sensitivity is described by the M-value,which is calculated
      from glucose infusion rates during the last 30min of the clamp.

      Glucose is metabolised in the periphery: 50% by neural tissues, 20% by splanchnic bed and
      liver, 15% by skeletal muscle, 5% by adipose tissue and 10% by blood cells and other tissues.
      Under hyperinsulinemic conditions there is a strong shift in glucose utilization: 85%
      skeletal muscle and 15% by neural tissues, splanchnic bed and liver, adipose tissue, blood
      cells and other tissues. The contribution of skeletal muscle varies with different insulin
      sensitivity.

      We now want to investigate whether there is a difference in tissue-specific insulin
      sensitivity measured from a Botnia clamp (intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT) and
      following clamp) and a single hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp? After a 60min ivGTT blood
      glucose levels in type 2 diabetic subjects are still elevated compared to baseline. High
      blood glucose levels can influence several parameters and may also affect insulin
      sensitivity. Until now, it is not proven, that the clamp preceding ivGTT does not have a
      significant influence on the M-value.
