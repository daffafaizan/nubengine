      Pneumonectomy or lobectomy is associated with a high risk for postoperative complication. The
      benefit of lung protective ventilation with low tidal volume has been demonstrated in
      patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). Recent
      clinical studies have suggested that mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume may also
      profit in others setting. Lung protective ventilation during anaesthesia has been found to
      limit the inflammatory response in the lung and to decrease postoperative systemic
      inflammatory response. However, others trials did not found benefit of protective ventilation
      strategy during anaesthesia.

      This study will be a randomized, controlled, doubled blind trial comparing two management
      ventilator strategies during anaesthesia for thoracotomy. Only patients undergoing
      pneumonectomy or lobectomy for lung primitive cancer will be included in this trial. During
      anesthesia, one group will receive mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume (5 ml/kg of
      ideal body weight) plus PEEP and the other will receive tidal volume of 10 ml/kg of ideal
      body weight without PEEP. After surgery, data concerning oxygen delivery, blood analysis,
      complications, cancer recurrence and death will be collected.
