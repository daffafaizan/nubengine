      different disease characteristics as well as aetiological and pathophysiological factors in
      (sub)groups of patients with this heterogeneous disorder. Various phenotypical and
      genotypical markers will be evaluated. For this purpose, blood and faecal samples as well as
      symptom questionnaires will be collected and visceral perception and intestinal permeability
      will be measured. In order to increase the sensitivity of the barostat procedure, a pilot
      study will be performed by measuring patients and healthy controls under meal stimulated and
      fasting conditions. We aim to set up a biobank for studies on the pathophysiology of IBS, in
      order to identify genetic factors that may help unravel the pathogenesis of IBS and provide
      novel therapeutic targets. Consent will be asked to collect data from questionnaires, to
      store serum samples, DNA, stool and, when endoscopy is performed for clinical reasons, also
      biopsy specimens.
