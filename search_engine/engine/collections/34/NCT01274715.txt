      for quality of life and health. Due to the complex interrelation between diabetes and
      depression, patients often experience both psychological and physiological difficulties.
      These comorbid problems demand focused interventions that blend physical and emotional health
      treatments with self-management strategies.Rural-dwelling veterans with diabetes and
      depression are typically treated in community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). Patients with
      diabetes in rural areas tend to have more problems controlling their blood sugar, blood
      pressure and cholesterol compared to urban patients; thereby increasing their risk of
      diabetic complications. Similarly, rural patients with depression have similar barriers to
      care that increase their risk of poorer health outcomes as well. Using behavioral health
      coaches (BHCs)to deliver telephone-mediated therapies may enhance the reach of treatments for
      co-occurring diabetes and depression. The implementation of such treatments requires the
      development and testing of therapeutic manuals and BHC training protocols to ensure
      standardization and effectiveness. The BHC intervention has been labeled Health Outcomes
      through Patient Empowerment (HOPE) and will be offered to eligible patients receiving care
      through MEDVAMC and its CBOCs. Preliminary data obtained through this pilot grant is to
      support a larger VA grant.
