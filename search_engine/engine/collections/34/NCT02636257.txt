      the quality of life. The treatment principle is to restore or rebuild the lacrimal duct
      drainage channel. The classic operation type is dacryocystorhinostomy(DCR), which is complex
      for face-section particularly. However, with the development of endoscopy, the investigators
      prefer to the silicone nasolacrimal intubation under nasal endoscopy, which is more simple
      and efficient. With endoscopy, the investigators can see anatomical structures clearly and
      then can perform the operation much more perfectly.Compare to the classic one called DCR, its
      short and long term therapeutic effects are equal and even better.Therefore,the latter type
      does do good to both doctors and patients.
