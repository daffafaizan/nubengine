      to the second cycle after completing the first. After the Phase 1 results were evaluated,
      eligible participants entered Phase 2. After Phase 2 results were evaluated, participants who
      consistently reported the highest and the lowest comfort scores entered Phase 3 and were
      defined as either survivors or strugglers.
