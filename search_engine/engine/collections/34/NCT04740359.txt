      disturbance. In addition, coordination disorders can be seen in extremities, speech and eye
      movements. Atrophy is common in the cerebellum. Friedreich's ataxia, ataxia telangiectasia,
      ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, infantile-onset spinocerebellar atrophy and
      Marinesco-Sj√∂gren syndrome are autosomal recessive hereditary ataxias. The constant main sign
      of autosomal recessive ataxia is progressive ataxia.

      The trunk has an important role on dynamic stabilization for postural reactions and limb
      movements. A good trunk support enables movements in other parts of the body to occur more
      regularly. Trunk stabilization is important to support upper and lower extremity movements,
      to meet the loads, and to protect the spinal cord. The relationship between upper extremity
      function, daily living activities and trunk functions has been emphasized in many studies but
      comparative studies about the rehabilitation were very less.

      This study is to evaluate the effect o functional trunk training in patients with autosomal
      recessive ataxia.
