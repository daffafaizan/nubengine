      age, making it one of the most common endocrine disorders in this population. PCOS is
      associated with a broad range of adverse sequel, including hypertension, dyslipidemia,
      insulin resistance, hyperandrogenaemia, gestational and type 2 diabetes,which ultimately
      increase the cardiovascular morbidity in these patients. Also PCOS is increasingly recognized
      as a component of the metabolic syndrome. Management depends on symptoms or the source of
      androgen excess. Several treatment options are available, which allows for an individualized
      approach. Spironolactone is the safest potent available antiandrogen. It is effective in
      lowering the hirsutism score by approximately one third, although considerable individual
      variations exist. Other antiandrogens used to treat hirsutism and hirsutism equivalents
      include cyproterone acetate that has weak antiglucocorticoid effects. Metformin and
      thiazolidinediones, are promising adjuncts for treating PCOS. Although both of them increase
      insulin sensitivity, but their mechanism of action differ.

      Serum complement, homocysteine and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been reported to be
      linked with insulin resistance.

      The investigators want to measure serum complement, homocysteine and hs-CRP levels in
      patients with PCOS before and after three-month course of treatment with Cyproterone
      compound-Spironolactone (CC-S), metformin (M) and pioglitazone (P).
