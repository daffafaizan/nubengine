      vs. 1.5 ml/kg) during caudal anesthesia, high volume of local anesthetics resulted in
      significant increase of intracranial pressure (ICP). Increase of ICP can reduce regional
      cerebral flow and oxygen saturation causing the safety of patients. In addition, increase of
      ICP can result in headache, syncope, and transient loss of visual acuity. Although it is very
      invasive method, ICP can be measured directly at the brain parenchyme. Among methods to
      measure the ICP indirectly, measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter using ultrasound is
      known to reflect the degree of ICP. It is reported that optic nerve sheath diameter increases
      when higher volume of medication is injected during epidural anesthesia. Previous reports
      showed that epidural pressure varies according to different posture. When epidural pressure
      was measured in patients of spinal stenosis, lumbar flexion showed lower epidural pressure
      than epidural pressure of lumbar extension. In addition, when epidural pressure was measured
      in the sitting position, it showed lower pressure than pressure of lateral decubitus.
