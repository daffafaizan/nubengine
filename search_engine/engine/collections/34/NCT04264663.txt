      recognized as a main risk factor of multiple gastric pathologies, especially non-cardiac
      gastric cancer. Strongly evidence supports that H.pylori eradication is an effective approach
      to reduce the incidence of those pathologies.However,Helicobacter pylori eradication is a
      challenge in patients allergic to penicillin. Therefore, the investigators aim to assess and
      compare the effectiveness of furazolidone-tetracycline-containing and
      tinidazole-tetracycline-containing quadruple regimens for the rescue treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori infection in patients allergic to penicillin.
