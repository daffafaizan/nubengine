      pathological fatigue including mental and physical, both neurological (central and
      peripheral) and non-neurological diseases. Among the last ones, cancer, infections and drugs
      are factors associated with fatigue, although the mechanism of how non-neurological diseases
      cause fatigue is not clear. Evidence exists to suggest that patients who have been critically
      ill continue to face a multitude of physical, psychological and social difficulties in the
      long term after discharge. As far as fatigue is concerned, greater than 50% of Intensive Care
      Unit survivors overall reported lowered energy levels and fatigue in the first year after
      discharge.
