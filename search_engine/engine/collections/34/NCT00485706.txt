      Patient with a higher ∆ Calcium (Calcium post - Calcium pre) have a diminished bone buffering
      capacity indicative for adynamic bone disease compared with patients with smaller ∆ Calcium.

      This may result in higher extraosseous calcification and higher pulse wave velocity

      ∆ PTH/∆ Calcium may reflect the sensitivity and density of the calcium receptors; this may
      reflect parathyroid "health"
