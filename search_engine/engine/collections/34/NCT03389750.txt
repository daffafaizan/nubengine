    
      Significant public health concerns have arisen from the misuse of oxymorphone, a potent mu
      opioid pain medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration as Opana and Opana ER.
      However, little is known about its abuse potential relative to other mu opioid analgesics.
      The present study is designed to examine the abuse liability of intravenous oxymorphone
      compared to other mu opioid agonists (oxycodone, morphine, and hydromorphone). A total of 20
      participants who are physically dependent on opioids and who meet DSM 5 criteria for Opioid
      Use Disorder will complete the study across 2 sites, New York State Psychiatric Institute
      (NYSPI) and the University of Kentucky; a total of 6 additional participants across the 2
      sites will complete a pilot phase of the study in order to establish comparable opioid
      dose-response functions based on subjective ratings of Drug Liking. All participants will
      reside on clinical inpatient units for the duration of the studies (both the 8- to 9- week
      main and 4- to 5-week pilot studies; please note that the pilot study is identical in design
      to the first 4-5 weeks of the main study). The study design is based on the 2017 FDA
      Assessment of Abuse Potential of Drugs: Guidance for Industry [Center for Drug Evaluation and
      Research (CDER), 2017], which suggests use of a double-blind, positive- and
      placebo-controlled design that includes a qualification phase and VAS measure of Drug Liking.
      The proposed study also examines the reinforcing effects of oxymorphone and other mu opioid
      agonists using two different drug self-administration procedures, namely Drug versus Money
      and Drug versus Drug choice procedures.
