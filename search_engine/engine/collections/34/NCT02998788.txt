      estimate the association of lifestyle behavior (e.g., alcohol, tea and coffee consumption,
      sedentary behavior, smoking habit, sleep disorder and physical activity), intermediate
      conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia), genetic risk factors and
      circulating biomarkers with heart failure prognosis. Another goal is to improve the health
      status and reduce cardiovascular events and death for heart failure patients via patient
      education, disease monitoring and medication titration. This study planned to consecutively
      enroll 1,000 heart failure patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Each participants will
      be followed up for at least 5 years. The study endpoints, all-cause mortality and
      cardiovascular events, will be identified by directly contacting participants during the
      follow-up surveys, checking pertinent medical records and discharge lists from the hospitals,
      or checking death certificates from local vital statistics offices. The Cox proportional
      hazard model will be used to estimate the risk factors for health outcomes in heart failure
      patients.
