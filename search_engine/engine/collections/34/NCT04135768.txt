      thirds being intra-articular fractures. While most fractures treated with a variety of
      methods achieve satisfactory patient reported outcomes at one year post treatment, patients
      experience pain and functional impairment up to 3 and 6 months post treatment. Open reduction
      and internal fixation using volar plates is one popular mode of treatment. It is relatively
      widely available and allows almost immediate post operative mobilisation and rehabilitation.

      One theory which could explain the delay in functional recovery is the persistence of the
      intra-articular haematoma. The evacuation of this haematoma may be partly responsible for the
      satisfactory results published by authors who perform wrist arthroscopy assisted distal
      radius fixation.

      In our literature review, it is not routine to evacuate this haematoma during conventional
      volar plating of the distal radius. As such, we aim to study if the evacuation of the
      haematoma in conjunction with volar plating confers functional benefits in the short term,
      particularly at 3 months post surgery.
