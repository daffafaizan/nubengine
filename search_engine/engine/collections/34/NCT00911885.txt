      who meet diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome. The efficacy of the two dietary change
      interventions will be compared in a randomized controlled trial, with 120 patients per group.
      The two approaches are 1) the American Heart Association (AHA) Dietary Guidelines; and 2) a
      simple dietary change condition that focuses on increasing fiber. Patients in both conditions
      will receive intensive dietary instruction for 3 months, followed by a 9 month maintenance
      phase. Both conditions will receive dietary instructions via individual and group sessions
      led by registered dietitians. Assessments, including diet, anthropometrics, blood pressure,
      fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood lipids, insulin, inflammatory
      markers, medication use, depression, quality of life, and physical activity will be conducted
      at baseline and at 6-, and 12-months after randomization. A 3-month post-intensive
      intervention assessment will measure short-term changes in body weight, diet, and metabolic
      syndrome indicators.
