      standard of care (no warming).

      Prospective participants will be invited by letter and provided with a information booklet
      explaining the study and their rights. Informed consent will be taken in writing.

      Patients will be randomised using a protocol created by the Trusts Clinical Investigations
      Research Unit who will use an Internet based randomisation system.

      The researcher will not be blinded as it is not logistically feasible. The statistician
      analysing the results will be blinded to which group receives warming.

      Study data will be collected manually on a standardised data collection sheet.

      All enrolled patients will have their temperatures measured at specified times and will be
      observed for shivering. Data collection required to measure the primary outcomes will be
      complete by time of discharge from the recovery room. Data collection for secondary outcomes
      will be prospective and retrospective and will occur from time of anaesthesia through to one
      month after the procedure.

      All patients will receive routine post-operative care.

      To ensure any late complications are not missed we will interview the patients by phone one
      month after the date of their procedure.
