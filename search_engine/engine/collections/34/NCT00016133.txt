        -  Determine safety and immunogenicity of adjuvant autologous tumor cell vaccine in
           patients with completely resected stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the colon.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage (II
      vs III).

      Beginning 28-35 days after total surgical resection, patients receive adjuvant autologous
      tumor cell vaccine intradermally once weekly for 3 vaccinations. The first 2 vaccinations
      also contain BCG. Patients with stage II disease receive a fourth vaccination 6 months after
      surgical resection.

      Beginning 10-17 days after the third vaccination, patients with stage III disease receive
      adjuvant leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil IV on days 1-5. Chemotherapy continues every
      28-35 days for a total of 6 courses. These patients also receive a fourth vaccination 1 month
      after the completion of chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed at 90 days and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
