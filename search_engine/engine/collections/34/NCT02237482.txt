      approaches are described to address the bone defects in acetabular revision surgery. Several
      authors have reported inferior results when uncemented Titanium alloys and older porous
      coated designs are used in acetabular revisions with significant bone loss. Cemented fixation
      of the revision cup with impaction bone grafting (BIG), introduced more than three decades
      ago has today a thorough documentation. The Tantalum designs, with inherent properties such
      as high volumetric porosity, low modulus of elasticity and high friction against the bone,
      have been suggested to improve the fixation of the acetabular component. Several authors have
      been reporting promising short- and medium-term results using the TM designs in acetabular
      revisions with large periacetabular bone defects. Proximal migration measured with
      radiostereometry (RSA) has been suggested to predict risk for late aseptic loosening in hip
      prosthesis surgery. This study was primarily to compare the proximal migration of the
      tantalum design with a cemented cup used in conjunction with bone allografting in cases with
      major bone loss. A group of patients with good periacetabular bone stock are included to
      analyse the differences between the tantalum and titanium design. RSA is used to accurately
      measure migration and rotation of the revision cups.
