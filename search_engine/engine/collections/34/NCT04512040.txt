      for people with Alzheimer's disease and their Caregivers. Participants with Alzheimer's
      disease and chronic pain (n=15) and their Caregivers (n=15) will all participate in teleyoga
      classes. Yoga classes will be given weekly for 12 weeks. At the end of treatment,
      participants will provide feedback by completing a satisfaction questionnaire.
