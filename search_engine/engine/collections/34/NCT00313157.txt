      100 mg o.d., verapamil 240 mg o.d., diltiazem 360 mg o.d. and carvedilol 25 mg o.d. in
      reducing ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. A total of 60 patients will be included,
      with a minimum of 20 women.Patients will receive each of the drug regimens in a random
      sequence. Each regimen will be administered for 3 weeks, ensuring that steady-state drug
      concentration will be attained and to provide an adequate washout of the previous treatment.
      Following each regimen, exercise ECG and Holter registration will be performed and patients
      will undergo laboratory evaluation and complete QoL-forms. They will then be started on the
      next randomly assigned treatment regimen, until the entire sequence of treatment schedules is
      completed.
