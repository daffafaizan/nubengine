      I. To demonstrate that topical ketoconazole, an anti-androgen, palliates EGFR
      inhibitor-induced rash within a group of racially diverse cancer patients.

      II. To explore the role of ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing to identify other targets that
      might be used at a later date for rash palliation.

      III. To evaluate toxicities associated with topical ketoconazole.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants apply ketoconazole topically twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Participants apply placebo topically BID on days 1-28.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 1 week.
