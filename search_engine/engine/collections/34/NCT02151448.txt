      dendritic cell (alpha-DC1) vaccines (patients' autologous alpha-DC1s loaded with autologous
      tumor material), combined with a systemic chemokine modulation regimen [CKM; intravenous
      rintatolimod (TLR3 ligand, a derivative of Poly-I:C) + intravenous interferon-alfa + oral
      celecoxib] as adjuvant therapy, after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), in patients with peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM),
      including but not limited to malignant peritoneal mesothelioma and peritoneal carcinomatosis
      (PC) of appendiceal and colorectal origin.

      All patients judged to have peritoneal surface malignancy and considered able to be
      cytoreduced to Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) Completeness of Cytoreduction (CC) score of 1 or
      less will undergo CRS + HIPEC. Postoperative immunotherapy will start at least 4 weeks after
      CRS + HIPEC.

      Immunotherapy regimen will include four cycles of intranodal (3M cells) and intradermal (3M
      cells) αDC1 vaccines. Each booster αDC1 vaccine dose (treatment cycles 2-4) will be followed
      by 4-days of systemic CKM, starting the day after vaccination (IFNα [dose-escalation: 5-20
      MU/m2], intravenous [IV], once a day for 4 days; rintatolimod [short-half-life TLR3 ligand]
      200 mg intravenous [IV], on Wednesday and Friday only of the CKM regimen; and celecoxib 200
      mg, orally, twice a day for 4 days). In order to avoid overlap between experimental
      immunotherapy and potential adjuvant chemotherapy (which can be clinically indicated as a
      part of standard care in the subset of patients), the experimental treatments will be
      interrupted after cycles 1 and 2, to allow adjuvant chemotherapy that is done for each
      patient's clinical care, and is not a part of this research study. Whenever clinically
      indicated as a part of standard care, adjuvant chemotherapy may start at least 5 days after
      completion of the 2nd cycle of immunotherapy (first booster vaccine plus the first CKM). The
      3rd cycle of immunotherapy may start at least 5 days after the completion of chemotherapy.
