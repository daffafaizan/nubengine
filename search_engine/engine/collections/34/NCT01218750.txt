      disease should be combined too. VEGF is involved in pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema
      and recently anti-VEGF agents such as bevacizumab have been shown to be beneficial in the
      treatment of this retinal disorder. However, endogenous VEGF is required for visual function.
      Growing body evidence indicates that VEGF acts also on nonvascular cells, it plays survival
      role on Muller cells and photoreceptors. Therefore anti-VEGF therapies should be administered
      with caution and not persistent. Photocoagulation in nonperfused areas eliminate increased
      production of VEGF, proliferation of RPE and increased production of PEDF in surrounded
      impact laser area. Vitrectomy with ILM peeling reliefs traction on the macula, improve
      oxygenation of the macula leading to decreased vascular permeability with subsequent
      resolution or decrease in DME. Removed ILM contains a part of the Müller cell endfeet and the
      horizontal gliosis. It is likely that the proliferation of GFAP-stained gliofibrils, observed
      in microdamaged Müller cells, preserves the blood-retinal barrier, reinforces architectural
      cohesion, and opposes the installation of the edema. Therefore, we made hypothesis that
      combined triple therapy was effective for decreasing macular thickness and improvement of
      vision for eyes with diffuse diabetic macular edema.

      It is important for the surgeon to determine the factors that might influence surgical
      outcome so that patients are chosen for the procedure that they can get benefit from.
      Therefore, we evaluated the possible preoperative and intraoperative factors that might
      influence surgical outcomes
