      It can be treated sufficiently until motor complications with fluctuations of mobility and
      dyskinesia develop. The quality of life is relentlessly deteriorating with longer disease
      duration once the complications of conservative oral therapy develop. Continuous dopaminergic
      stimulation using Levodopa/Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG) improves the motor complications
      of Parkinson's disease and preliminary data suggest that also the quality of life is
      improved. Primary Objective is to assess the effect of LCIG on Health Related Quality of Life
      (HRQL) of patients according to selection criteria from German guidelines and compare
      improvement in HRQL between patients continuing to LCIG treatment and patients staying on
      oral treatment, despite being eligible according to these guidelines. In addition, current
      selection criteria recommended by the national guideline will be documented at baseline.
