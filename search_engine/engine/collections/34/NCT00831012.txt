      risk of dengue virus infection. Dengue viruses cause dengue fever, as well as the more severe
      dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome, and dengue virus infection is the leading cause of
      hospitalization and death in children in several tropical Asian countries. This study will
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated dengue virus called
      rDEN3delta30/31-7164.

      This study will consist of two groups, with Group 1 enrolling first. Group 1 participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive either 10^3 PFU of rDEN3delta30/31-7164 or placebo
      subcutaneously in their deltoid. Participants will be monitored at the clinic for 30 minutes
      after receiving the immunization to monitor for adverse effects. After that, participants
      will be asked to return to the clinic approximately every other day for the next 16 days, and
      then on Day 21, 28, 42, and 180. At each visit participants will have physical and clinical
      exams, vital signs, measures, blood drawn, and will be asked about any adverse events they
      may have experience. Female participants will be given a pregnancy test. In addition,
      participants will be asked to measure their temperature 3 times a day and record it in a
      temperature diary for the first 16 days after immunization.

      If less than 90% of the participants in Group 1 seroconvert to DEN3 then Group 2A will be
      enrolled. Group 2A will follow the same procedures as Group 1, but will receive a 10^5 PFU
      dose of rDEN3delta30/31-7164.

      If more than 90% of the participants in Group 1 seroconvert to DEN3 then Group 2B will be
      enrolled. Group 2A will follow the same procedures as Group 1, but will receive a 10^1 PFU
      dose of rDEN3delta30/31-7164.
