      perioperative circulatory function, resulting in a series of pathophysiological changes. BNP
      is of high sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of cardiac function. SVV and CVP are
      dynamic and static indices to predict fluid responsiveness. TTE is a good indicator of volume
      and cardiac function.Thus, we conducted the trial to assess the perioperative circulatory
      function in patients undergoing LPC. We hypothesized that long term pneumoperitoneum and
      steep trendelenburg in LPC for bladder cancer would increase perioperative blood volume and
      influence cardiac function.
