    
      This is a Phase 3 multiple site, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to
      evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of rhThrombin and bovine thrombin in patients
      undergoing spinal surgery, hepatic resection, peripheral arterial bypass surgery, or
      arteriovenous graft formation for hemodialysis access.

      After establishing eligibility, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      rhThrombin (1000 U/mL) or bovine thrombin (1000 U/mL). During a surgical procedure, study
      participants will be treated with blinded study drug (rhThrombin or bovine thrombin) in
      combination with an absorbable gelatin sponge at appropriate bleeding evaluation site(s) and
      time to hemostasis (TTH) will be assessed for up to 10 minutes. Bleeding appropriate for TTH
      evaluation is defined as mild to moderate bleeding, either on its own or remaining after
      brisk bleeding has been controlled by standard surgical modalities. Blinded study drug may
      also be used at additional appropriate bleeding sites. Study participants will have follow-up
      visits at about 2 days and 1 month after surgery. Approximately 400 to 600 patients will
      participate in the study. The final sample size will be determined based on blinded interim
      results.
