      during whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) had benefits in preservation of memory for patients,
      and the use of concurrent TMZ in radiotherapy for patients with brain metastases benefited
      for treating outcome.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects on neurocognitive function of
      whole-brain radiotherapy with/without TMZ concurrent chemotherapy or avoidance of hippocampus
      for patients of brain metastases, as well as the feasibility and risk of avoidance of
      hippocampus during whole-brain radiotherapy.
