        -  Assess the value of autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation versus high dose
           cytarabine (Ara-C) performed after a common induction and consolidation course in
           patients with poor prognosis myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myelogenous
           leukemia secondary to MDS.

        -  Compare the disease free survival and overall survival of patients who reached complete
           recovery according to the presence of an HLA-identical donor.

        -  Monitor cytogenetic and clonal remission after intensive antileukemic therapy including
           stem cell transplantation.

        -  Monitor residual disease and the hematopoietic clonal status of autologous peripheral
           blood stem cells mobilized after one consolidation course.

        -  Assess recovery time of granulocyte and platelet counts following each treatment step.

      OUTLINE: Induction treatment with idarubicin on days 1,3,5; Ara-C from days 1 through 10;
      etoposide on days 1 through 5. On day 28 there will be assessment of responses. If there is
      at least partial response, the cycle will repeat the induction course for another 28 days.
      There is peripheral blood stem cell collection and cryopreservation following family
      HLA-typing. If there is no HLA match, then those who remained in remission after these
      consolidation courses will be randomized to either peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      or HiDAC treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 80 patients will be entered per year.
