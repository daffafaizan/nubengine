      detection of possible spontaneous initiations of inspiration during apnea test in patients
      with suspected brain death. The study could contribute to the opening of new areas in the
      clinical use of the electrical impedance device. An additional aim is to observe the collapse
      and the reopening by recruitment manoeuvers of different pulmonary regions.
