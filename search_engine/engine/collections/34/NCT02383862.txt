      yet undertreated symptoms in clinical practice. Using the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome
      Measurement Information System) Profile Scales as a measure of SPADE symptoms, this study
      will determine the effectiveness of providing patient symptom scores to clinicians, identify
      barriers and facilitators to the clinical use of such scores, and evaluate the psychometric
      properties of the PROMIS Profile Scales in a primary care population.
