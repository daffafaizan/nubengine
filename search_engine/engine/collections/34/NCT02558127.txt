    
      Primary objective:

      Determine the presence of genetic variants (mutations and / or polymorphisms) of the CFTR
      gene in patients with asthma with or without bronchial mucus hypersecretion.

      Secondary objectives:

      To identify genetic variants (mutations and / or polymorphisms) of the most common CFTR gene
      in the asthmatic population. -To define the inflammatory phenotype of asthma with bronchial
      mucus hypersecretion. -To compare the severity, control, quality of life and frequency of
      exacerbations of asthma patients with or without bronchial mucus hypersecretion
