      hydrochloride (QHCl) decreases orexigenic hormone levels, and reduces hunger sensations.
      Contradictory, in vitro studies on human gastric and duodenal tissue showed that DB exposure
      increased motilin and octanoylated ghrelin levels. DB stimulated somatostatin (SST) release,
      which is an inhibiting paracrine hormone. We hypothesized that the reduction in hunger
      ratings and hormone levels is stronger after intragastric compared to intraduodenal
      administration, and that these differences are mediated by differential SST release. Fourteen
      healthy female volunteers participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study.
      After an overnight fast, DB (1 µmol/kg), QHCl (10 µmol/kg) or placebo were given intragastric
      or intraduodenal via a feeding tube. Blood samples were taken at regular time points to
      obtain the hormonal release. Hunger was rated at the same points on a 100 mm visual analog
      scale (VAS). Ad libitum milkshake intake was assessed at the end of the experiment and taste
      was scored on a VAS.
