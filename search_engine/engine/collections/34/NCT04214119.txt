      Esophagus, esophageal carcinoma (both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma). Esophageal
      and gastric cytology will be collected via sponge capsule. Candidate genes will be tested
      with DNA isolated from these samples in order to identify optimal biomarkers to differentiate
      between Barrett's esophagus and esophageal/gastric cancer versus normal esophageal/gastric
      tissue.
