      cancer cases and 15% of all cancer-related deaths in the world.Lymph node metastasis is a
      multifactorial event. Among patients with a preoperative axillary ultrasound, almost 40% of
      patients are pathologically proved to be free from axillary metastasis.The purpose of this
      study is to develop a nomogram to evaluate the probability of axillary metastasis as a tool
      to support clinical decision-making.
