           optional LTE period

        2. The LTE period will remain blinded but will no longer have a placebo arm:

             -  Subjects will remain on their originally assigned treatment arm unless they were on
                placebo

             -  Subjects initially randomized to placebo arm will be automatically re-randomized
                into one of the existing active arms at Day 169 (24 weeks)
