      Primary

        -  Compare the changes in urine levels of a stable marker of oxidative stress
           (F_2-isoprostanes) in healthy young women who undergo exercise training during 4
           menstrual cycles vs no exercise.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the changes in other metabolic factors that explain the association between
           physical activity and breast cancer, including:

      Estrogen metabolism (estrone, estradiol, estriol, 2-OHE_1, 2-OHE_2, 2-MeOHE_1, 2-MeOHE_2,
      4-OHE_1, 4-OHE_2 [as well as ratios of these metabolites], insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1
      (as well as IGF-binding proteins-1, -2, and -3, insulin, glucose, body composition (including
      body mass index, lean mass, and body fat [DEXA scan]).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Participants are stratified according to
      baseline body fat percentage and age (18 to 24 years vs 25 to 30 years). Participants are
      randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants exercise for 30 minutes 5 times a week. The intensity of exercise is
           increased every 4 weeks. The exercise regimen continues for up to 4 menstrual cycles.

        -  Arm II: Participants are observed for 4 menstrual cycles. Participants in both arms
           undergo 24-hour collection of urine on days 7, 8, and 9 of menstrual cycles 1 and 6.
           F_2-isoprostanes are measured via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
           Estrogens are also measured by GC/MS and include E_1, E_2, E_3, 2-OHE_1, 2-OHE_2,
           4-OHE_1, 4-OHE_2, 2-MeE_1, 2-MeE_2, 4-MeE_1, 4-MeE_2, and 16OHE_1.

      Participants undergo blood collection, body mass measurement by dual-energy x-ray
      absorptiometry, and a fitness assessment twice during the 6-month study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 participants will be accrued.
