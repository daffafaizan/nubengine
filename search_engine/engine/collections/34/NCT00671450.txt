      injury (MTBI), from the population of the VAPAHCS PTSD Center and Clinics. These volunteers
      will be scheduled for an eye screening developed for a concurrent project to assess visual
      dysfunction (accommodation/vergence insufficiency, pursuit/saccade deficits, etc.) in
      patients diagnosed with MTBI and seen at the Palo Alto Polytrauma Network Site clinic. The
      MTBI patients have unexpectedly high rates of binocular dysfunction, although their visual
      acuities and visual fields are normal/near normal. The MTBI diagnosis is associated with a
      combat blast event in some 90% of cases. Th majority of this population has also been
      diagnosed with PTSD. PTSD is known to cause some visual symptoms, thus it is necessary for us
      to determine if the visual dysfunctions in the MTBI are related to their PTSD diagnosis or
      not. The volunteer participants will be scheduled for an eye screening and consented prior to
      the screening. Inclusion criteria include diagnosis of PTSD, aged 19 to 39, and willingness
      to participate. Exclusion criteria is primarily history of TBI. The visual screen includes
      assessments of visual acuity, visual field, self-reported visual function (i.e., light
      sensitivity, eye fatigue, reading difficulty), and measures of accommodative function,
      vergence, pursuit and saccades. The data collected will be compared to the data from the
      ongoing study of visual dysfunction in patients diagnosed with MTBI.
