    
      The objectives of this extension study are to provide ongoing long-term treatment with
      ASTX727 for subjects who were benefitting from ASTX727 treatment in a previous
      Astex-sponsored clinical study (parent study); to obtain long-term safety information; and to
      obtain survival information.

      Subjects will attend clinic visits on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle to undergo study procedures
      and to be given ASTX727 tablets for Days 1-5 of that dose cycle. Subjects should continue to
      receive the same ASTX727 dose and regimen they were receiving in the last cycle of the parent
      study in which they were originally enrolled. Subsequent treatment delays and/or dose
      reductions are at the discretion of the investigator as guided by the dose adjustment
      guidelines of the parent study protocol.
