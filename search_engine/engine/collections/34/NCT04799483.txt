    
      Intramural NIAID sponsored several phase I-II studies of cell transfers during the 1990's,
      including gene-modified cells, in identical twins discordant for HIV infection. These studies
      were both novel in the field of alternative treatment strategies for HIV infection and served
      as early studies in the developing field of clinical gene therapy. The current protocol
      represents an umbrella protocol in which these early trials have been consolidated for
      purposes of long-term safety monitoring and long-term follow-up of gene-modified cell
      persistence. Cell recipients as well as donors enrolled in Intramural NIAID twin gene
      marking, gene therapy and cell transfer studies have been eligible for study participation.
      Participants are monitored for safety per a uniform standardized schedule. No gene therapy,
      cell transfers or other investigational therapeutic interventions occur under the auspices of
      this protocol.
