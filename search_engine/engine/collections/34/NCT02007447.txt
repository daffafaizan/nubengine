      Oxytocin has been described to improve those skills and studies suggest that administration
      can reduce repetitive behaviors as well as enhance social interaction and communication
      deficits.

      This study is design to evaluate the influence of oxytocin in some aspects of Autism Spectrum
      Disorder (ASD), such as, repetitive and stereotyped behavior, social skills, quality of life
      and disruptive behaviors.

      Instruments:

        1. Evaluation of social skills: Matson Evaluation of Social Skills (MESSY): consisting of
           62 items divided into six factors that assess social skills such as appropriate social
           skills, assertiveness inadequate, impulsivity, self-confidence, jealousy withdraw, and
           other items that do not fit another classification.

        2. Evaluation of repetitive behavior: Repetitive Behavior Scale (RBS): Consists of 43 items
           divided into six subscales: stereotyped behavior, self-harm behavior, compulsive
           behavior, ritualistic behavior, behavior monotonous and restricted behavior. This scale
           is able to measure the presence and severity of repetitive behaviors as common in
           individuals on the autism spectrum.

        3. Evaluation disruptive behavior: Vineland, just the part that assess disruptive behavior

        4. Multidimensional Student's Life Satisfaction Scale (MSLSS)
