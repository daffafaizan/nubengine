      incidence of it, and the number of new cases will account for more than 40% of the world
      total . The disease involved population maybe more than 4 million in the world. More than
      2700-3000 new nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients will be diagnosed in SUN YAT-SEN university
      cancer center every year. It is most common in 40-50 years old adults and has been a top ten
      (10th) malignant tumor in Chinese male which threaten human health and social economy.

      Chemotherapy is the standard treatment of the advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Several other
      phase II study also confirmed the effectiveness of paclitaxel and carboplatin （TC） regimen in
      advanced NPC, so it maybe a simple right choice.

      Increasing expression of VEGF in serum associated with poor prognosis in metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Agents that selectively target VEGF-A and its receptors have shown
      significant antitumor effects in xenograft models of nasopharyngeal. Studies demonstrated
      that bevacizumab（AVASTIN） administration with chemotherapy or chemoradiation is feasible in
      patients with nasopharyngeal cancer. Bevacizumab can be safely combined with a range of
      cytotoxic and other anticancer agents including TC regimen.

      Evidence indicated a potential possibility that the TC+AVASTIN regimen may be superior than
      TC regimen.
