      effectiveness of once-weekly PEMF therapy in the promotion of muscle maintenance following
      ACL reconstruction surgery. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      therapy with an active PEMF device or an identical inactive Sham device, in addition to the
      standard rehabilitation regimen.
