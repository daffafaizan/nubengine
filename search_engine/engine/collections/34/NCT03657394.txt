      oxygen delivery to the neonatal brain. Almost all infants with severe HIE and 30-50% infants
      with moderate HIE either die or develop significant developmental delay, cerebral palsy or
      other disabilities.The incidence of HIE is 1-3 per 1,000 term births in developed countries
      and 15-20 times higher in developing countries (Worldwide, 0.5 to 1 million infants develop
      HIE each year). Therapeutic hypothermia is the only proven therapy for infants with HIE. Even
      after receiving therapeutic hypothermia, one-half of all infants with moderate and severe HIE
      die or develop neurological and functional impairment. Therapeutic hypothermia is not widely
      available and ineffective in developing nations.There is an urgent need for a new therapy for
      neonates with HIE, which can complement hypothermia and be readily available in developing
      nations. Stem cell transplantation is a potential therapy for infants with HIE. Umbilical
      cord blood is a rich source of stem cells. Umbilical cord milking (UCM) may have similar
      effect as autologous umbilical cord blood cell transplantation.

      The investigators hypothesized that UCM will reduce the number of infants developing moderate
      to severe HIE or death in neonates who are depressed at birth compared to immediate cord
      clamping (ICC). This will be a cluster crossover randomized controlled trial. Each hospital
      will be randomly assigned to use either ICC or UCM for any infant who is depressed at birth
      and needing resuscitation over a period of 6 months. Then the site will change to the other
      method for an additional 6 months.
