    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure and compare the rate of fat processed, defined as the volume of fat processed per
      unit time associated with the use of three aforementioned adipose tissue processing
      techniques.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure total fat grafting time: time from initiation of fat harvesting to the end of
      fat injection.

      II. To measure volume of fat processed: volume of fat obtained after fat processing.

      III. To measure total operation room (OR) time: time from patient entry into the OR (or when
      the patient barcode is read on entering the OR) to the time at which the patient leaves the
      OR.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I (REVOLVE TM): Patients undergo AFG reconstructive surgery comprising washing and low
      velocity spinning using a commercially available system that washes the lipoaspirate with
      lactated Ringer's solution separates non-fat material from the fat with gentle centrifugal
      force and suction.

      ARM II (CYTORI PUREGRAT TM): Patients undergo AFG reconstructive surgery comprising gravity
      filtration using a commercially available system in which the lipoaspirate is rinsed with
      lactated Ringer's solution (RL) and the non-fat material is filtered through mesh.

      ARM III (COLEMAN TECHNIQUE): Patients undergo AFG reconstructive surgery comprising standard
      centrifugation at 3200 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 3 minutes with the resulting oil and
      aqueous layers discarded.
