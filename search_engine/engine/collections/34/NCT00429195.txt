    
      521 free-living subjects with the metabolic syndrome received one of four dietary treatments
      for 12 weeks: (1) High-fat (38% energy) SFA-rich diet; (2) High-fat (38% energy), MUFA-rich
      diet; (3) Isocaloric low-fat (28% energy), high-complex carbohydrate diet and (4) Isocaloric
      low-fat (28% energy), high-complex carbohydrate diet, with 1 g/d LC n-3 PUFA. A 3-day weighed
      food intake assessed dietary compliance pre-, mid- and post- intervention. An IVGTT,
      lipoprotein analysis, cytokine, adhesion molecule, coagulation factor and isoprostane levels
      were determined pre- and post-intervention. DNA, adipose and skeletal muscle biopsies, and
      PBMC were isolated to characterise nutrient sensitive molecular markers of insulin
      sensitivity.
