      agents for control. As part of cardiovascular independent risk factors, microvascular
      endothelial function will be evaluated directly by laser Doppler flowmetry. Blood samples
      will be also collected and circulating markers of endothelial function (VW factor,
      E-selectin, VCAM, ICAM, circulating DNA), inflammation (CRP, IL-1β, IL-8, TNFα, IL-10),
      platelet activation (procoagulant microparticles, thrombin generation, fibin monomer) will be
      measured. A complete clinical and functional cardiovascular status will be documented in
      every participant.
