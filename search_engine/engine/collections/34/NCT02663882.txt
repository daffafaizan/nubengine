      behavior in adult smokers who are not motivated to quit smoking.

      This pilot study will have a between-subjects design. All participants will be asked to
      complete two study appointments. First, they will complete a baseline appointment where they
      will review consent procedures. Participants who complete the consent forms will then be
      asked to fill out measures of demographics, smoking, and self-control. Smoking will be
      confirmed using expired breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels taken using a CO monitor. At that
      appointment participants will be randomly assigned to complete one of two self-control tasks:
      a task that is related to smoking (e.g., giving instructions to delay smoking when they have
      a craving) or a task that is not related to smoking (e.g., participants will be instructed to
      try to maintain the best posture possible (e.g., sit up straight, walk with good posture) as
      much as possible throughout each day Random assignment will be done using a random number
      generator and 50% of participants will be assigned to the smoking task while the other 50%
      will be assigned to the non-smoking task. Study staff will received standardized instructions
      to read to each participant about the task that they are assigned to practice during the
      week. Participants will be asked to practice their assigned self-control task every day for a
      week and to complete a brief series of questions about the effort and time spent practicing
      the task that day along with the number of cigarettes they smoked that day. After one week,
      participants will return for the second study appointment where they will report on their
      effort and time spent practicing the self-control tasks and complete additional measures of
      smoking and self-control.
