      searched to select women with at least 1 year of infertility, a regular cycle (variation 21 -
      35 days), whose partner had normal sperm according to World Health Organization (WHO)
      criteria (n = 304).

      After exclusion of 83 (27,3%) patients with a previous laparoscopic diagnosis of
      endometriosis before referral to our centre, 221 (72,7%) infertile women were included in our
      study.
