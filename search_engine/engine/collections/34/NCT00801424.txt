      measures including heating sheets, warming of fluids, and insulation of limbs and head or to
      additional insufflation of humidified carbon dioxide (approx. 36-37ÂºC, approx. 80-100%
      relative humidity) via a humidifier with a heated tube (Fisher&Paykel) connected to a gas
      diffuser (Cardia Innovation AB) that is able to create a local atmosphere of 100% carbon
      dioxide (humidified) in the wound cavity.

      Wound temperatures will be measured every 10 minutes with an infra-red camera positioned
      approximately 1m above the wound with a camera support. Wound areas and wound edges of stored
      images will be delineated with a soft ware program. Peritoneal samples (3x3x1mm) will be
      taken at start of the operation, after 30 minutes and before closure of the abdomen. The
      samples will immediately be stored in RNA-later solution, and deep frozen for later analysis
      of epithelial (peritoneal) and endothelial function/tissue damage.
