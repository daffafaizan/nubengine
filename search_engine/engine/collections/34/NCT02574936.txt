      active infection, patients who did not accept the procedure and patients under age of 18.
      After excision of the sinüs volume was measured using a beaker. A flap extending across the
      cut (Karydakis) was prepared in medial edge of the wound, 1 cm deep and 2 to 3 cm to be
      towards the interior. Prepared flap was shifted to the medial and sutured to presacral fascia
      with vicryl 2/0. To reduce the volume of the dead space formed in the lateral, 5 mm skin was
      excised along the incision in the flap side. Skin was approximated with sutures in the form
      of intermittent, using 2/0 poliprolen. No drain used. All patients were discharged on
      postoperative day 1. Sutures were removed 2 weeks later. All patients for at least 6 months
      were followed for wound drainage, seroma and hematoma formation, separation of skin and and
      recurrence.
