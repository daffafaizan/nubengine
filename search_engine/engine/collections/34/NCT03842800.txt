      emotional influences that may alter how cognition occurs. Understanding these motivational
      and cognitive interactions will help better assess mechanisms that underlie the cognitive and
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

      To better understand the effect of emotion on cognitions, this study will examine the effect
      of reward processing on working memory in patients with schizophrenia. To this end, this will
      be a two-pronged approach.

      The first prong, is to understand the neural mechanisms of incentivized spatial working
      memory processes. fMRI will be used and a paradigm will be employed that combines reward
      processing and working memory to understand how patients with schizophrenia recruit neural
      systems in response to rewarded working memory.

      To further understand this, this study will compare the neural effects in patients with
      schizophrenia with patients with depression, another group of psychiatric patients who also
      suffer from cognitive and motivational deficits. Both of these groups suffer from cognitive
      and motivational deficits, yet the treatments and disease presentations differ.

      It is hypothesized that the ways in which cognitive and motivational processes interact in
      the brain will have some similarities, but also differences, that distinguish the two
      psychiatric illnesses. As part of this aim, a group of typical, healthy adults subjects will
      be recruited as a control. A subset of healthy participants that passed the medical and
      psychiatric screen will be invited to participate in the ketamine portion of the study which
      will be completed during the MRI session.
