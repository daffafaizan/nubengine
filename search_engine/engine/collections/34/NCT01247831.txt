    
      Ocular Rigidity (corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor) is measured with the
      Ocular Response Analyzer (Reichert) before and 4 weeks after SLT (Q-switched 532 nm frequency
      doubled neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet laser with a spot size of 400 µm and a 3-ns pulse
      duration). The trabecular meshwork is treated with 100 spots over 360° and an energy of 0,8
      mJ.

      The purpose is to examine if selective laser trabeculoplasty changes ocular rigidity.
