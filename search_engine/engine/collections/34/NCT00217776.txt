      To date, no data provide information on the effects of middle school based interventions for
      pre-teens with asthma or the advantages of an approach that recognizes the importance of peer
      influence on pre-teen's asthma behavior. Interventions to reach low income minority
      populations are particularly needed.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      If only one primary outcome is to be specified, it would be asthma morbidity, as evident in
      asthma symptoms. Data to assess outcomes will be collected at baseline, and 12 and 24 months
      post program through parent interviews and student surveys.

      Additional primary outcomes listed in the protocol include: Asthma related quality of life,
      disease management behavior and academic performance.

      Secondary outcomes include: peer support, school attendance, physical activity, health care
      use, and smoking behavior.
