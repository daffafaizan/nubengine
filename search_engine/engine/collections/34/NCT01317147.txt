      disorders were studied prospectively. Blood samples for SRI plasma levels were drawn
      immediately after dose for pharmacokinetic studies (PK) preoperatively. Maximum concentration
      (CMAX), time to CMAX (TMAX), and Area Under Concentration/Time curve (AUC) were determined.
      PK studies were repeated at one, six, and twelve months post-operatively. PK data were
      corrected for dose at each study time point. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale- Atypical Depression Symptom Version was used to quantify depressive
      symptoms.
