      importance to lung health. Exercise and standardized chest physiotherapy are accepted airway
      clearance techniques in cystic fibrosis. Different airway clearance techniques are available,
      but there is no evidence that one technique or a combination is superior. Oscillatory
      positive expiratory pressure with the Flutter® is a widely used airway clearance technique in
      the European countries and has been shown to favourably alter sputum viscoelasticity in
      cystic fibrosis.

      This randomized crossover study is designed to assess the acute effects of combined cycling
      exercise and Flutter® therapy on sputum viscoelasticity (primary outcome measure) and gas
      diffusion in adults with cystic fibrosis.
