    
      Aim of the study is to support older adults to define a personal health behavior (to enhance
      physical activity, to improve food habits), to check and optimize this intention regarding
      self-efficacy and volitional competencies, such as action and coping planning, disability
      management to adopt and maintain their behavior successfully.

      Research questions:

        -  What is the pathway from health information/intention to behavioural change
           (motivational and volitional processes)?

        -  Which are the crucial social-cognitive variables in educating/coaching adults with low
           health literacy in daily self-management?

        -  Which other resources (e.g. social support) should be targeted in interventions to
           empower people in health behaviour change and maintenance?
