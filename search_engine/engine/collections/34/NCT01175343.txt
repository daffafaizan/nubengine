      I. To assess the antitumor activity of RO4929097 in recurrent and / or metastatic epithelial
      ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer by progression free
      survival rate at the end of 4 cycles.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of RO4929097 through secondary endpoints including:
      overall response rate and CA125 response rate (GCIC criteria).

      II. To assess the safety of single agent RO4929097 in advanced platinum resistant ovarian,
      fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers.

      III. To explore expression of Notch biomarkers in advanced platinum resistant ovarian,
      fallopian, and primary peritoneal cancers.

      IV. To explore the impact of RO49097 on ascitic fluid circulating tumor cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and
      15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected for correlative studies. Ascitic fluid may also
      be collected.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every month for at least 1 year.
