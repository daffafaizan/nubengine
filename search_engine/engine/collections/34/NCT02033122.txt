    
      This is a randomized, controlled and single-blind trial whose intervention will be an aerobic
      training. Fifty -eight patients with moderate or severe persistent asthma will be recruited
      at a university hospital and randomly assigned in two groups: control (CG) or training (TG)
      .The study will be performed between two medical visits with intervals of six months and
      during this period the same medication dosage will be maintained. Patients in CG will perform
      (an educational program + breathing exercise; n=28) and TG patients will perform (an
      educational program+breathing exercises+aerobic training; n=30).The sessions will be
      conducted twice a week, for 3 months. Before and after the intervention, all patients will be
      evaluated by bronchial hyperresponsiveness, serum cytokines levels, total immunoglobulin E,
      induced sputum, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), asthma clinical control (daily
      symptoms dairy, exacerbations and asthma control questionnaire - ACQ), health related quality
      of life (HRQoL); asthma quality of life questionnaire-(AQLQ), pulmonary function and
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing. All the patients will be evaluated by specific
      immunoglobulin E (atopy) through (skin prick test or Phadiatop).
