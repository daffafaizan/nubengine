      neutropenia (FN) risk and has helped maintain dose intensity and dose density when treating
      breast cancer with chemotherapy. This is crucial as survival outcomes are significantly
      impaired if dose intensity are reduced. National and international guidelines recommend the
      use of G-CSF as primary prophylaxis with most commonly used breast cancer chemotherapy
      regimens. Filgrastim (FIL) as a G-CSF that has been in use since the early 90s. Pegfilgrastim
      (PEG) is a long-acting, pegylated version of FIL that requires only one injection per
      chemotherapy cycle instead of daily FIL injections for 5 to 10 days per cycle. PEG and FIL
      both come at the potential cost of bone pain, the most common side effect. G-CSF related bone
      pain is often severe, leading to refusal or cancellation of G-CSF and early discontinuation
      of chemotherapy. We propose to perform a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized
      clinical trial to compare bone pain experienced by patients receiving either PEG or 5-day-FIL
      with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.
