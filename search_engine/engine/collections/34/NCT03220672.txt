      the reproductive to the non-reproductive period is induced by a decrease in sex hormone
      production in the ovaries. Climacteric-stage oestrogen deficiency produces genital and
      urinary tract atrophy, which may be related to symptoms such as urinary frequency, urinary
      urgency, nocturia incontinence, and recurrent urinary tract infection. Urinary incontinence
      seems to appear due to a combination of factors such as pelvic floor weakness and tearing,
      denervation and fascial tears as well as both loss of motor units and altered activation
      patterns. However, physiotherapy can treat weakness and altered motor control in order to
      compensate for other factors. In fact, physiotherapy is considered the treatment of first
      choice.

      Besides evidence defending physiotherapy as first line conservative therapy in incontinence
      due to influence of strength and motor control in this pathology and its prevalence in
      perimenopause women, little is known about its effects in this population. Hence, the aim of
      this study is to evaluate the short and long term effectiveness of a tailored assessment and
      educational intervention on motor control of the pelvic floor muscle in menopausal and
      peri-menopausal women.
