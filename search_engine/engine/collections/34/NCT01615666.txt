      Alzheimer's disease is blurred. In order to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease, the
      investigators must be able to mark its preclinical stage, before brain damage becomes
      irreversible. There is a substantial body of research dealing with predictive markers of
      Alzheimer's disease in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite these
      advances, however, researchers have not had enough evidence to recommend specific techniques
      that mark preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This new functional MRI (fMRI) index may fill this
      gap.

      Participants will have two visits, one for memory testing and neurological examination, and
      one for an MRI scan. Each visit will take approximately 1Â½ hours. For volunteers who wish to
      do so, all study procedures may be completed in a single visit. Participants with MCI will be
      followed annually.

      The investigators are currently enrolling healthy volunteers, as well as individuals with MCI
      (memory loss that does not significantly affect normal daily activities), Alzheimer's
      disease, and frontotemporal dementia (includes primary progressive aphasia).
