      hearing impairment and possible mechanisms. Subjects with hearing impairment will be
      enrolled. Inclusion criteria were 50 to 79 years old with symmetric sensorineural hearing
      loss, subjective sensorineural tinnitus, and all frequencies differed of ears less than 15
      dB. Exclusion conditions were patients with abnormal liver and kidney function, normal
      hearing, severe and very severe hearing loss, no tinnitus or non-subjective sensorineural
      tinnitus, moderate or more cognitive impairment, patients unable to understand the details of
      this study or patients unable to co-examine, history of alcohol or drug abuse, history of
      high ambient noise exposure, bone tone air gap of pure tone hearing threshold greater than 10
      dB, and audiogram 4 kHz air conduction threshold greater than 8 kHz, 20 dB airway threshold,
      hearing impairment before age 30, and inability to understand the details of this study.
      Participants will randomly divide into experimental or control group supplemented with
      Hericium Erinaceus (430 mg/kg/day) or placebo, respectively for eight months by a
      prospective, randomized, double-blind approach. Basic characteristics will be evaluated at
      baseline by questionnaire. The status of hearing, and CBC, GOT, GPT, BUN, Creatinine, NGF and
      BDNF expressions in blood will be examined at baseline, 4th month and 8th month.
