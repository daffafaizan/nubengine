      systematic record of Doppler flow on arterial axes of the aorta and right and left lower
      limbs. The investigators will analyze a posteriori Doppler flow of patients by classifying
      them using the 3 classifications. The patient will have no constraints related to this study
      since the recordings are currently performed in clinical routine.
