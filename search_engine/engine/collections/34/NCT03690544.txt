      RAS in males and females between 18 and 70 years old.

      Subjects will be recruited from the clinical practice of the Department of Dermatology or
      Division of Rheumatology at Mayo Clinic Florida. Fifteen males and females with RAS will be
      enrolled.

      The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a 16 week treatment phase and an 8
      week posttreatment observational follow-up phase.

      The screening phase will consist of: obtaining informed consent, demographic information,
      medical history, inclusion and exclusion criteria, prior and concomitant medication use,
      adverse events; collecting vital signs and weight; performing complete physical examination
      and limited physical examination; obtaining hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis,
      pregnancy test and providing contraception education.

      During the 16-week treatment phase, all subjects receive apremilast.

      All subjects who complete the active treatment phase are to enter the 8-week posttreatment
      observational follow-up phase.
