      with advanced head and neck cancers.There were no significant differences in survival between
      the two groups, but disease free survival was prolonged in the maintenance arm and not in the
      induction arm. Time to and frequency of distant metastases as the first site of relapse were
      significantly better for those on the maintenance arm. Many trials, designed several years
      ago, delivered single agent chemotherapy and were not particularly intensive. Most clinical
      trials were dealing with a heterogenous group of head and neck cancer patients. We felt that
      a better choice of adjuvant chemotherapy on cancers should include: (1) localized cancers
      with high metastatic potential following effective local treatment; (2) effective
      chemotherapy available; (3) chemotherapy should be intensive and effective enough to avoid
      the development of drug resistance. Of course, NPC had long been regarded as one of the most
      suitable head and neck cancers that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy due to its unique
      high response rate to chemotherapy and high metastatic potential after radiotherapy for
      localized, advanced staged disease.

      If radiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy can improve the treatment results of standard
      radiotherapy by increasing the survival rate, decreasing the metastatic rate and local
      recurrence rate, then many NPC patients may benefit.

      Therefore, we propose this phase III study of radiotherapy with or without adjuvant PFL
      chemotherapy in advanced stage NPC patients.
