      may be given by peers, who have experienced the same.

      In this study voluntary participants with recently diagnosed breast cancer were randomly
      allocated to intervention (N=130) or control (N=130) group. The intervention group received,
      in addition to usual care, peer support via telephone 1-5 times according to their own
      preference. The control group received usual care only. Peer support was given by volunteered
      breast cancer survivors who were educated for giving peer support.
