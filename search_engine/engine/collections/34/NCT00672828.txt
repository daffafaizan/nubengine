        -  Compare rates of participation in fecal occult blood testing and endoscopic screening
           (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) among African-Americans who receive an interactive
           computer intervention (ICI) versus a non-tailored colorectal cancer screening brochure.

        -  Examine mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness as depicted in the
           conceptual model.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Participants are stratified according to site, age (â‰¤ 65 years old vs > 65 years old) and
      gender. Participants are randomized to one of two arms.

        -  Arm I (non-tailored colorectal cancer screening brochure): Participants undergo a
           baseline interview via telephone and receive a colorectal cancer screening brochure in
           the clinic prior to visit with healthcare provider. Participants then undergo telephone
           interviews at 1 week, 6 months, and 15 months.

        -  Arm II (interactive computer intervention [ICI]): Participants undergo a baseline
           interview via telephone and complete an ICI in the clinic prior to visit with healthcare
           provider. Participants then undergo telephone interviews at 1 week, 6 months, and 15
           months.
