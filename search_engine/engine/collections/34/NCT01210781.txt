      disease and other indications. A common target for stimulation is the subthalamic nucleus
      (STN). Nevertheless, there is no agreement on the mechanisms how DBS leads to clinical
      improvement.

      The project aims to describe the variability of target coordinates in the patient group and
      to relate it to clinical outcome as documented in standardized questionaires.
