    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the rate of relapse, defined as recurrence of underlying disease or
      progression of underlying disease, at 1 year in patients who receive haploidentical
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) after reduced intensity conditioning and post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate safety including development of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) and
      death at 100 days post-transplant, as well as other treatment related toxicities including
      chronic GVHD, engraftment rate, non-relapse mortality, progression free survival (PFS) at one
      year, and overall survival (OS) at one year, as compared with historical controls.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlative studies will include chimerism analysis by molecular analysis and evaluation
      of immune reconstitution by cytomegalovirus (CMV) dextramer analysis using flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2
      and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo total body
      irradiation (TBI) on days -1 and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days.
