      repetitive behaviors (BFRB's), but there is limited empirical research on its efficacy. Our
      first project (Falkenstein et al., 2016) developed a 12-session manual for ComB and a method
      for evaluating therapist adherence to the model that can be used reliably and provided
      encouraging (uncontrolled) data on the effects of ComB through 3-month follow-up.

      The proposed project extends the earlier work in two main ways: (a) using random assignment
      to ComB vs. comparison condition to test whether ComB works better than the passage of time +
      demand characteristics of being in a TTM study alone; and (b) gathering initial evidence on
      how ComB works.

      Treatment will be conducted at two sites -- Washington, DC (American University and the
      Behavior Therapy Center of Greater Washington) and Chicago (University of Chicago).
      Participants in the Minimal Attention Control condition will receive ComB therapy after the
      post-treatment [week 12] assessment is conducted. Uncontrolled follow-up data will be
      collected through 3 (MAC condition) or 6 (immediate ComB condition) months after the end of
      ComB treatment.
