      I. To evaluate the tolerability and toxicity associated with two different dose regimens of
      pioglitazone administered orally as a cytoprotective agent against radiation-induced brain
      injury.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on glycemic levels and hemoglobin A1c values when
      pioglitazone is used as a cytoprotective agent concurrent with radiotherapy in normoglycemic
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo fractionated external beam radiotherapy, 3-D conformal
      radiotherapy, or intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Patients receive oral pioglitazone
      hydrochloride once daily before for 1 week prior to brain irradiation, during and and
      continuing for 6 months after completion of radiation radiotherapy. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed periodically.
