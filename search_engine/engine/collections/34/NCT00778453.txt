      therapy (mCIT) vs. bilateral isokinematic training (BIT) vs. traditional or therapist-based
      training (TR) on movement reorganization, motor performance, functional ability, and quality
      of life (QoL) immediately and six months later after treatment delivered at hospitals.
      Movement reorganization will be evaluated by kinematic instrument. Motor performance,
      functional ability, and QoL will be assessed using clinical assessment tools. By the same
      token, we also investigate the relative effects of these two approaches delivered at home.
      The second purpose is to study whether home-based mCIT is efficacious in various aspects of
      outcomes described above immediately and six months later following treatment, compared to
      home-based TR, and hospital-based mCIT and TR.We also study the same question regarding
      home-based BIT efficacy. The third purpose is to establish predictive models to predict
      functional and QoL outcomes immediately and six months later following mCIT and BIT.
