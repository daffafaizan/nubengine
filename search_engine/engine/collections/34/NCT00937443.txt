      not often sufficient. Although cell based therapy is gaining publicity in the treatment of
      coronary artery disease and heart failure. Determining how endothelial progenitor cells are
      recruited, proliferate, and home to injured tissue is an important area of investigation.
      Equally important is determining factors which improve EPC stimulation and efficiency such as
      realistic levels of exercise and the modulation of various cardioreparative factors (VEGF,
      NRG-1, and SDF-1) within heart failure patients. Since the endogenous repair mechanism is
      down regulated in heart failure patients such efforts may uncover ways to tip the balance in
      heart failure back to normal reparative maintenance.
