        -  Compare the sensitivity and specificity of primary screening strategies for the
           detection of cervical intraepithelial or invasive neoplasia.

        -  Compare the positive and negative predictive values of these strategies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the reason for the
      visit (general gynecological screening vs colposcopy referral).

        -  Stratum 1 (general gynecological screening): Patients undergo Pap smear, visual
           inspection aided by acetic acid (VIA), a colposcopy, and finally a visual inspection
           aided by toluidine blue (VIT) followed by an acetic acid wash. A biopsy may be performed
           at this initial visit. Within 2-3 weeks, patients are notified of results.

        -  Stratum 2 (colposcopy referral): Patients undergo Pap smear, VIA, colposcopy, VIT, and
           possible biopsy as in stratum 1. During the same visit, patients receive histologic
           evaluation and treatment with See-and-Treat loop electrosurgical excision procedure
           and/or endocervical curettage.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600-1,000 patients (300-500 per stratum) will be accrued for
      this study.
