      I. To determine the 4 month survival and complete remission (CR) rates of tosedostat in
      combination with either cytarabine or decitabine in untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and tolerability of tosedostat in combination with either cytarabine or
      decitabine.

      II. To determine the treatment related mortality defined as death within the first 30 days of
      beginning treatment.

      III. To estimate rates of disease-free survival (DFS) and the 1 year overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive tosedostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-35 and cytarabine
      intravenously (IV) on days 1-5.

      ARM II: Patients receive tosedostat PO QD on days 1-35 and decitabine IV on days 1-5.

      If the patient develops a significant increase in their circulating or bone marrow blast
      count, the subsequent cycle may be started as early as day 21 of the current cycle. In both
      arms, treatment repeats every 35 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving CR or partial CR (pCR) may receive 2
      additional courses of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
