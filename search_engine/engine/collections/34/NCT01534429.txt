      the absence of recurrence or meshoma, laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy has
      emerged as an effective surgical treatment of postherniorrhaphy inguinal pain. Methods: This
      prospective pilot study evaluated the neurophysiological and clinical effects of laparoscopic
      retroperitoneal triple neurectomy. Ten consecutive adult with chronic postherniorrhaphy
      inguinal pain and unilateral predominantly neuropathic inguinodynia underwent three
      comprehensive quantitative sensory testing assessments (preoperative, immediate
      postoperative, and late postoperative). Pain severity, health-related function, and sleep
      quality were assessed over the course of a 6-month follow-up period.
