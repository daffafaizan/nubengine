      world. Individuals living with this may be at higher risk of developing co-morbidities, such
      as cancers, heart problems or diabetes, and higher mortality rates are reported in this
      group. Furthermore, overweight and obesity can also impact on a person's psychological
      wellbeing, such as their self-efficacy, self-esteem and body image as well as have a negative
      effect on their overall quality of life (QoL). Therefore, a pilot randomised controlled trial
      (RCT) is proposed to investigate the additional benefit of a psychological intervention
      alongside treatment as usual (TAU) in a weight management service. Patients routinely
      attending an outpatient clinic will be randomised into TAU with or without additional
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) group based-input.
