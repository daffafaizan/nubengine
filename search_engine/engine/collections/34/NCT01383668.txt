      thiomalate) plus sirolimus. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To describe the adverse event profile
      associated with this treatment combination. II. To preliminarily evaluate the response rate,
      time to progression, progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
      this treatment combination. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate tumor biomarkers of protein
      kinase C (PKCι) and mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling activity as predictors of
      response to ATM/sirolimus therapy. II. To evaluate the use of surrogate biomarkers of PKCι
      and mTOR inhibition in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to monitor response to
      ATM/sirolimus therapy. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive sirolimus
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and gold sodium thiomalate intramuscularly (IM) on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3
      months.
