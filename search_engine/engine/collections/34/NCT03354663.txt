      safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath SE catheter for the treatment of PAF against a
      performance goal. One hundred fifty six (156) subjects will be enrolled at up to 35
      investigational sites in the US, Europe, and Australia. Only sites that enroll at least one
      subject will be part of the analysis population. No center may contribute more than 20% of
      the total number of enrollments without sponsor pre-approval to exceed this proportion and at
      least 50% of subjects must be from the United States.
