      is needed to develop and optimize innovations in neonatal care, specifically technologies
      that are low cost, operator-independent, and highly efficient. The purpose of this study is
      to produce information and data regarding the performance of two existing multiparameter
      continuous physiological monitoring devices developed by device developers, EarlySense and
      Sonica. The clinical trial is intended to provide evidence to establish whether these
      investigational devices can reliably and accurately measure vital signs in neonates (when
      compared to verified reference devices) and to assess the feasibility, usability and
      acceptability of these devices for use in neonates in a LRS in Africa.
