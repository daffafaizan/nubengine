      drug and also tries to define the safest dose of the investigational drug to use for further
      studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved venetoclax for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Based on laboratory data where it was found that BPDCN cells die after treatment with
      Venetoclax, the investigators believe that this drug will be effective in treating patients
      with BPDCN.
