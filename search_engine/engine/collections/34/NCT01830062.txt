    
      A total of 60 patients, from a single center, who meet all of the study inclusion criteria
      and none of the study exclusion criteria will be prospectively enrolled in this study.
      Qualifying patients will be referred to the study site for clinically indicated, non-emergent
      cardiac catheterization with NIRS evaluation, either proceeded or followed by coronary artery
      calcium score (CACS) evaluation.

      Qualifying patients that are referred directly to cardiac catheterization with NIRS
      assessment secondary to symptoms or abnormal functional test will be sent for cardiac CACS
      assessment following the catheterization before discharge from the hospital. In this group,
      patients who require ad hoc PCI upon initial angiography will be excluded to avoid artifacts
      on CACS. In patients who are referred for a clinically indicated cardiac catheterization with
      IVUS evaluation within 3 months after MDCT with CACS, NIRS of at least two (2) major
      epicardial vessels will be completed prior to any (if necessary) coronary revascularization.
