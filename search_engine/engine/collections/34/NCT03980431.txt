    
      FBY is a new PET tracer derived from tyrosine, with the carboxyl group replaced by boron
      trifluoride, and is transferred across cell membrane through LAT-1. LAT-1 is a sodium
      independent amino acid transporter and is highly expressed in tumor cells. Considering the
      significant role in cancer development as well as in nutrient delivery, FBY could be a
      promising PET tracer to reflect altered metabolism in tumors.

      This study aim to observe the safety of FBY, and investigate the diagnostic value of FBY in
      the patient with suspected brain tumors. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria are
      included in clinical trials after fully communicating the condition, explaining the benefits
      and risks of clinical trials, clarifying the patient's willingness to include the clinical
      trial, and signing informed consent. The cohort number, FBY administrative dose, imaging
      protocols are decided based on the investigators' preliminary data. The diagnosis and
      post-examination treatment are based on the recommended guideline, combined with the
      subject's own situation for standardized diagnosis and treatment.
