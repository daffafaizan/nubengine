      study in previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer aimed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the monoclonal antibody, CT-011, administered at
      3mg/kg in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 or mFOLFOX6) compared with treatment
      by FOLFOX alone. Approximately 168 patients are planned to be enrolled to this study.
