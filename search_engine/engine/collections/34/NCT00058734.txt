      individuals. The dendritic cells are normal cells in the blood that boost immune responses.
      In HIV uninfected people, dendritic cells have been found to strongly activate the types of
      immune responses that may be important in controlling HIV.

      HIV infected and HIV uninfected individuals in this study will receive one shot of dendritic
      cells alone followed by three monthly shots of dendritic cells plus vaccine. We will monitor
      the immune responses to the peptide vaccine during this time period. After completing the
      vaccinations, HIV infected patients will stop their HIV medications and their immune status
      (CD4 count) and viral load will be monitored closely over 12 weeks.
