      ventilation with 6 ml/kg TV to ventilation with 10 ml/kg TV in patients undergoing elective
      cardiac surgery. Study ventilator settings were applied immediately after induction of
      anesthesia and continued throughout surgery and the subsequent Intensive Care Unit stay. The
      primary endpoint of the study was time to extubation. Secondary endpoints included the
      proportion of patients extubated at 6 hours, indices of lung mechanics and gas exchange as
      well as patient clinical outcomes.
