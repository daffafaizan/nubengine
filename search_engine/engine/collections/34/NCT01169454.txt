    
      Patients diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who require intracranial pressure (ICP)
      management through cerebral spinal fluid (CRF) drainage will be eligible for this study.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two currently accepted methods of ICP
      management. The first is ICP monitoring with intermittent CSF drainage and the second is
      through continuous CSF drainage at set pressure thresholds.
