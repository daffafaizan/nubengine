      untreated psychosis (DUP) among persons with first episode psychosis (FEP). The DUP of mental
      health patients with FEP who sought services at a public outpatient or an inpatient facility
      was assessed for a 15 month period prior to the campaign launch. This serves as the baseline
      or historical control. The DUP will continue to be assessed for another 3 years. The
      hypothesis being tested is that there will be a significant decrease in DUP between baseline,
      one-year, two-year and three-year follow-ups. This study is being carried out with Latinos in
      Los Angeles County because as a group, particularly among Spanish-speaking immigrants,
      Latinos are at high risk for prolonged DUP.
