      people who have depression and have not responded to several treatments (treatment-resistant
      depression).

      This study will look at the efficacy and safety of TAK-653 in participants with
      treatment-resistant depression who take TAK-653 in addition to standard care.

      The study will enroll approximately 90 patients. Participants who meet the study entry
      criteria will be assessed for response to ketamine by administering 2 intravenous (IV)
      infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg given over 40 minutes; maximum dose 40 mg/day) on Day -5
      (±1) and Day -1 (±1). To determine response to ketamine, the Day -5 predose Montgomery Åsberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (before the first ketamine infusion) will be
      compared with the MADRS total score predose on Day 1 (24 hours after the second ketamine
      infusion on Day -1). Two cohorts (ketamine responders and ketamine nonresponders) of
      participants will be enrolled in parallel into the study.

      Participants will then be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the
      two treatment groups - which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-653

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study. This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate
      in this study is 78 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone on Day 78 after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
