      on antimicrobial susceptibility test.Using success or failure of eradication as a dependent
      variable, analyze the influential factors by logistic regression.And then the statistically
      significant influencing factors like gastric mucosal pathology are obtained.We build a
      predictive model of the outcome of Hp eradication therapy based on significant influencing
      factors. The difference with p<0.05 is statistically significant.
