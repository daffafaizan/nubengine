      and studies showed that IOP reaches peak levels after steep Trendelenberg position on an
      average of 13 mmHg higher than preanesthesia induction values. Major determinants of IOP are
      aqueous humor flow, choroidal blood volume, central venous pressure and extra ocular muscle
      tone. During the robotic surgery there are two theories explaining the increase of IOP,
      first, gravitational forces increase central venous pressure which in turn affect orbital
      venous pressure and increase IOP. Second, intraperitoneal carbon dioxide causes increased
      choroidal blood volume which may result in IOP increase. One study reported that low end
      tidal carbon dioxide was a significant predictor of the IOP increase. Continuous absorption
      of carbon dioxide from peritoneum and increased pressure on diaphragm results in lower
      delivered tidal volumes and subsequently increased arterial carbon dioxide levels leading to
      increased choroidal blood flow and increased IOP.

      Hassen GW et al measured anterior chamber depth in 2 patients with glaucoma and compared the
      anterior chamber depth (ACD) with the intraocular pressure measured by tonometer. They
      concluded that bedside ultrasound could be useful in evaluating patient with suspected
      increased IOP, who are unable to open their eyes. It can also be used for serial examination
      and follow-up of treatment success. They also mentioned that, it is necessary to conduct a
      prospective study with a larger sample size, to evaluate if there is agreement between
      measurements using a tonometer and measurements of the ACD using ultrasound. In addition, it
      is essential to determine the cut off normal ACD for evaluation of IOP.
