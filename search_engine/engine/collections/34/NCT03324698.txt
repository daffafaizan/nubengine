      Information Technology Inc., Shanghai, China), was established to collect clinical data of CP
      patients who were admitted to our centers. Data befor CP Database established were
      retrospectively collected according to the electronic medical record system and complemented
      through telephone, letter, and e-mail inquiries. Data were prospectively collected since CP
