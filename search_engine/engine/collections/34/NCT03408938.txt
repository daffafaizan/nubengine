      pulse oximeterplethysmogram represents a volume change and the arterial line blood pressure
      tracing represents a pressure change, it has been demonstrated that cyclical shifts in the
      plethysmogram reflect similar cyclic changes in the blood pressure tracing and that these
      changes reflect changes in the intravascular volume status of patients.Plethysmography
      Variability Index (PVI) is a measure of the dynamic changes in the perfusion index (PI) that
      occur during the respiratory cycle . PVI = ﴾PI Max - PI Min﴿ ÷ PI Maxx 100 %.

      PVI has the potential to provide useful information concerning changes in the balance between
      intrathoracic airway pressure and intravascular fluid volume. Trending of PVI may be useful
      in monitoring surgical patients, both intraoperatively and postoperatively, for appropriate
      hydration states. For example, a rising PVI may indicate developing hypovolemia and gives an
      alarm for the need of appropriate fluid and or blood products transfusion supported by the
      patient hemoglobin level.

      Continuous Hb monitoring may allow a more rapid detection of clinically significant blood
      loss, and has the potential to significantly improve perioperative transfusion practices, may
      enable a more rapid assessment of a patient's condition and more appropriate blood management
      and even perhaps reduce needless transfusions.
