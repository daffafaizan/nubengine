      with or without abiraterone acetate for men with high-risk, localized prostate cancer.

      Abiraterone acetate with prednisone and enzalutamide are currently FDA-approved for use in
      the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, however they
      are investigational for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Abiraterone acetate works
      by decreasing the production of male sex hormones, which cause prostate cancer growth.
      Enzalutamide works by blocking the effects of male sex hormones, which cause prostate cancer
      growth.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of
      enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate as neoadjuvant therapy for high risk prostate cancer
      undergoing prostatectomy but each drug has been approved for the treatment of more advanced
      prostate cancer.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms. Randomization means that the
      participant is put into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither participant
      nor the research doctor will choose what group participants are randomized to.

      The names of the study medications involved in this study are:

        -  Enzalutamide

        -  Abiraterone Acetate

        -  Prednisone

        -  Leuprolide Acetate
