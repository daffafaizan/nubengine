      to return regardless of their participation at T2/T3 or current medication/psychiatric status
      using an intent-to-treat model. The follow-up study will conduct one additional timepoint
      with participants who enrolled in the main study.

      In the Follow-up Study of the Main Study ABC-CT cohort, the investigators will re-administer
      the biomarker and clinical batteries 2-5 years after original study enrollment. This will
      allow the investigators to:

        1. Assess long-term stability of the markers, extending the analyses of reliability and
           consistency from the first phase of the consortium.

        2. Perform a more robust assessment of sensitivity to change, taking advantage of a longer
           developmental window in which participants are expected to exhibit greater clinical
           progression.

        3. Evaluate the longitudinal predictive value of the biomarkers by examining the
           association of their baseline values with later measures of social function.
