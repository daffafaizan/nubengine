      symptom of dysphagia. Treatments for esophageal cancer are commonly multimodal, incorporating
      polychemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. These treatments frequently cause or exacerbate
      poor nutritional status. Recent literature has proved that malnutrition is associated with
      longer hospital stays, reduced responses to and increased complications from therapies,
      increased costs, worse quality of life and lower survival rate. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the effectiveness of an intensive nutritional consultation and exercise program
      on nutritional status and outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiation for esophageal
      cancer.
