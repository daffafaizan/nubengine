      loss counseling would lead to a greater loss of fat mass and a greater improvement in
      cardiometabolic risk factors that standard (lower caloric expenditure) cardiac rehabilitation
      exercise plus counseling.

      The study population consists of overweight (BMI >27) patients with established coronary
      heart disease. The exercise and counseling program was of 4 months duration with extended
      follow up at 1 year.
