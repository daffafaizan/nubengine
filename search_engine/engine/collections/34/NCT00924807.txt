      (an anti-androgen) are hormonal agents which are commonly used to reduce testosterone blood
      level for prostate cancer treatment. Intensity modulated external beam radiotherapy is a
      standard treatment for localized prostate cancer. Previous studies have shown that combining
      hormonal therapy and radiation is more effective than radiation alone. Unfortunately,
      significant percentages (50-75%) of patients still relapse. Sorafenib reduces the growth of
      cancer cells and has proven effective in the treatment of solid tumors including kidney and
      liver cancer. This drug is approved by the FDA for treatment kidney and liver cancer. The
      study investigators believe that adding sorafenib to standard treatment, comprising hormonal
      therapy and radiation, might be more effective then standard hormonal therapy.
