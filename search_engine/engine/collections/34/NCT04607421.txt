      combination with chemotherapy, can improve clinical outcomes relative to current standard
      of-care chemotherapy in participants with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. Since
      encorafenib has not previously been combined with chemotherapy, the tolerability and PK of EC
      in combination with mFOLFOX6 and in combination with FOLFIRI will be evaluated in separate
      cohorts in the safety lead-in portion of the trial in order to identify which chemotherapy
      combination is to be used in the Phase 3 portion of the study.
