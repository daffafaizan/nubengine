      Caesarean section is an important clinical problem. Known mechanisms underlying PONV are
      based on prolonged fasting, hypotension due to concomitant sympatholysis during anesthesia,
      bradycardia due to increased vagal tone, visceral stimulation during surgery and intrathecal
      administered opioids. However, the identification of patients exposed to this problem and
      appropriate perioperative preparation is of key importance. An analysis of risk factors for
      postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing elective cesarean section under
      spinal anesthesia is of major clinical importance. The aim of this study is a comparison of
      the effectiveness of oral carbohydrate loading strategy as compared with standard
      pre-operative fasting in patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal
      anesthesia on the incidence and severity of PONV and biochemical parameters indicating
      ketosis.
