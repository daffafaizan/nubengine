    
      This protocol is designed to screen patients with either diagnosed or undiagnosed conditions,
      and provides for determining eligibility for approved protocols within the Gene Therapy and
      Therapeutics Branch (GTTB), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. The
      purpose of the protocol is to allow evaluation of patients who do not meet the requirements
      for other screening protocols, such as the screening protocol for Sjogren's syndrome
      patients.

      Each subject will be evaluated to determine whether they are suitable candidates for
      inclusion in any protocols in the GTTB. The screening evaluation will include past and
      current medical history, and an appropriate physical examination. Further routine diagnostic
      tests may also be performed to determine eligibility for approved studies. The tests and
      procedures are of minimal risk. When the screening has been completed, subjects will be
      informed of the options available at the time for participation in available, approved
      research protocols.
