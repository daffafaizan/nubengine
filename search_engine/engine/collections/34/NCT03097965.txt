      with exercise and lifestyle modification education (DIET) or a similar program with a meal
      replacement formula and targeted nutraceuticals (PROG) in generally healthy, overweight
      subjects, forty to fifty subjects with two or more cardiometabolic risk factors, aged 18 to
      69 will be randomized into different arms, 13-week intervention trial. To evaluate safety and
      tolerability, questionnaires were collected weekly. Additionally, baseline, week 9 and 13
      fasting blood samples will be drawn for blood counts, metabolic profiles, plasma lipids, and
      additional cardiovascular risk factors. Vitals signs, weight and body composition were
      monitored weekly.
