      tidal volume and prevent gastric insufflation in pediatric patients.

      The children under 5 years old are randomly assigned to muscle relaxation group and
      non-relaxation group. Stratum was constructed based on age and randomization scheme was
      performed separately within each stratum. Block randomization was done to ensure balance of
      the age groups.

      For muscle relaxation group, routine anesthesia induction is performed with muscle relaxant
      and mask ventilation is started by pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation. Gastric
      auscultation and abdominal ultrasonography are performed simultaneously during mask
      ventilation to detect inflow of air. Initial inspiratory airway pressure is 10 cmH2O and
      increased gradually by 2 cmH2O until gastric insufflation is detected by either of two
      methods. Tracheal intubation is done after detection of gas.

      For non-relaxation group, mask ventilation is performed in a same manner, without muscle
      relaxant. After detection of gas by any of the two methods, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg is
      administered and tracheal intubation is performed.

      Tidal volume and oxygen saturation are recorded during study period.
