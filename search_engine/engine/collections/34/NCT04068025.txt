      Model (IMB) on urinary incontinence and quality of life in men with overactive bladder.

      This is a single-center, parallel-group, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial.

      This study was conducted between February 2018 and February 2019, with a total of 60 male
      patients admitted to the urology clinic of a training and research hospital. Patients over
      the age of 18, male, and with overactive bladder were included in the study.

      Participants were randomized into two equal groups: the intervention group (n=30) and control
      group (n=30). Structured bladder training with the IMB model was applied to the intervention
      group. This model was not applied to the control group. The primary outcome was the mean
      score change over the severity of incontinence measured by the International Consultation on
      Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF). The other outcomes were measured by the
      Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7 (IIQ-7), and
      Urinary Incontinence Information Rating scores. All outcome measures were evaluated before
      and 6 months after the training. Bladder training with IMB model was found to be effective at
      ameliorating urinary incontinence and improving quality of life in patients with an
      overactive bladder.
