      beta adrenergic block, for cocaine dependence in humans. A total of 12 subjects were enrolled
      in this double blind, placebo controlled outpatient study. After baseline measures are
      obtained, three experimental sessions were held at least 2 days apart. Subjects were
      administered a single low (100 mg) or high dose of labetalol (200mg) or placebo on each of 3
      experimental sessions. The labetalol doses were given in ascending order and the placebo
      treatment were randomly inserted into the sequence. A single dose of smoked cocaine (0.4
      mg/kg) was administered 2 hrs after labetalol or placebo treatment. During the sessions,
      several subjective, behavioral and physiological measures were obtained.
