      prophylactically for the prevention of, and as a treatment for, acute gout flares.
      RDEA594-126 is an open-label study designed to assess the potential effect of multiple doses
      of naproxen and indomethacin on the single-dose PK of lesinurad, and to assess the potential
      effect of multiple doses of lesinurad on the multiple-dose PK of naproxen and indomethacin.
