      social, and cognitive deficits from mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury who
      underwent SPECT brain imaging as part of their evaluation and treatment with hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy in my practice over the last two decades. The purpose of the study is to see
      if the functional imaging is consistent with the clinical and cognitive testing.
