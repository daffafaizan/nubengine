      I. To develop a secure, web-based program for family outreach in Clinical Cancer Genetics
      (CCG).

      II. The long-term goals of this program are expected to include, but are not limited to the
      following:

      IIa. To enable families with inherited cancer susceptibility and/or at increased familial
      risk of cancer to provide personal and family history of neoplasia through a convenient and
      self-directed program.

      IIb. To enable communication of possible inherited cancer susceptibility with and among
      family members through the web-based portal.

      IIc. To facilitate genetic testing, screening and prevention strategies in those at risk.

      IId. Establish high-risk cohort for optional participation in research and clinical trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients communicate with at-risk family members to share genetic test results and other
      relevant information, as well as to learn more about their disease via family outreach
      program website. At risk family members are then contacted by a study coordinator or genetic
      counselor for further follow-up. At-risk relatives receive resources to facilitate
      understanding of their at-risk status and to facilitate predictive testing.
