      increased activity of mTOR pathway, thus making mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus) a promising
      candidate in treatment and prevention of PJS. The efficacy of sirolimus (rapamycin) on PJS
      has been demonstrated in mouse model, but no clinical trials have been reported. Our study
      was designed as a prospective non-randomized open label single arm clinical trial to examine
      its efficacy and safety.
