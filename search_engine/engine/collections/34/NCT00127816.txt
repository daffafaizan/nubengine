      prostate implants: post-operative edema, prostate contour delineation, and dose calculation
      method. It is hypothesized that a pragmatic edema model can minimize the first uncertainty,
      co-registered CT + MR images the second, and an improved dose calculation algorithm the
      third.

      Detailed objectives are to:

        -  measure and model the effects of edema on dosimetry;

        -  evaluate CT + MR image registration methods;

        -  compare dosimetry for CT alone vs. CT + MRI using the contemporary TG-43 dose
           calculation method;

        -  set up a Monte Carlo code that makes full use of the information in CT + MR images to
           perform implant dose calculations;

        -  compare prostate dosimetry for the Monte Carlo vs. the simpler TG-43 method;

        -  develop an analytical post-implant dose calculation algorithm for routine clinical use
           (Monte Carlo is too slow on a single-CPU brachytherapy planning computer); and finally

        -  assess the performance of the new algorithm.

      Of the estimated 250,000 new cases of prostate cancer in North America in 2004, most are
      early stage disease as a consequence of PSA testing. Permanent prostate implant therapy is a
      major option for this group, as long-term clinical studies indicate a cure rate equal to
      surgery and external beam radiotherapy, but with fewer complications. By dealing with
      dosimetric inaccuracies, a proven treatment can reach its full potential.
