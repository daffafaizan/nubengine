      energy and systematic inflammation. In our randomized and controlled clinical trial, patients
      will be divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group. Patients in
      the experimental group will be provided nutritional supplements in addition to usual diet
      every day for three months and patients in the controlled group with usual diet. According to
      the changes of patients' body composition, anthropometrics, inflammatory markers, lung
      function, respiratory muscle function, exercise capacity, degree of dyspnea and health
      related quality of life(HRQL) after interventionï¼Œthe nutritional status and inflammation
      status are assessed, which contributes to the prediction of prognosis. The nutritional
      supplements is a kind of oral liquid composed of proteins, omega-3 fatty acids, carbohydrate,
      vitamins, which provides about 260 kcal energy per 200ml. The patients from the
      interventional group need drink the nutritional supplements according to the estimated energy
      intake and a record should be made everyday. The patients will be followed up regularly by
      the researcher.
