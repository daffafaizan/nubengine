      of every six Veterans seen in primary care report unhealthy alcohol use. Based on substantial
      evidence from randomized controlled trials and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,
      VA/DoD clinical guidelines stipulate that all Veterans screening positive for unhealthy
      alcohol use should receive evidence-based alcohol care in primary care, including brief
      counseling interventions (BI) and additional treatment (e.g., pharmacotherapy) for those with
      alcohol use disorders (AUD). The VA was a pioneer in implementing alcohol screening and BI in
      primary care, yet substantial implementation gaps remain. In order to improve the quality and
      fidelity of alcohol-related care, the current research proposes to use an evidence-based
      implementation strategy, practice facilitation, at one VA to pilot test whether practice
      facilitation has the potential to improve quality of primary care-based alcohol-related care.

      The project will first conduct qualitative interviews assessing Veteran and clinical
      stakeholders to understand barriers and facilitators to high-quality alcohol care. Results
      from qualitative interviews will be used to refine and hone the practice facilitation
      intervention. Clinical stakeholders will then be recruited to participate in focus groups in
      order to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the proposed practice facilitation
      intervention prior to testing it. Last, a pilot test of the practice facilitation
      intervention will be conducted within one VA primary care clinic to understand whether
      practice facilitation improves the quality of primary care-based alcohol-related care.
