      dose (BED), as muscle invasive bladder cancer has been shown to be dose-sensitive.

        -  Level 1: 57.6 Gray (Gy) (20 x 2.88 Gy, 5 fractions/week, 4 weeks); BED: 61 Gy.

        -  Level 2: 60 Gy (20 x 3.00 Gy, 5 fractions/week, 4 weeks); BED: 64 Gy

        -  Level 3: 62.4 Gy (20 x 3.12Gy, 5 fractions/week, 4 weeks); BED: 67 Gy. Fiducials will be
           implanted at the edges of the postoperative bed during the second transurethral
           resection of the bladder to improve visualization of the gross tumor volume (GTV) during
           external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and consequently improve treatment delivery accuracy.
           In order to further improve the treatment accuracy, 5 planning Computed Tomographies and
           plans, with different bladder fillings will be made upfront in our study. During
           treatment the plan corresponding best with bladder filling at time of EBRT will be
           selected and delivered.
