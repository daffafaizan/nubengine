      Hospital will be asked to provide a urine sample for a screening toxicology test on the day
      of surgery. Patients will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire with questions pertaining
      to their drug use history. The remaining aspects of perioperative care, including the general
      anesthetic technique, will be standardized for all patients and will not differ from the
      standard of care. The anesthesia faculty, resident, or CRNA will identify patients and obtain
      consent and ask the patient to fill out the questionnaire. This prospective study is intended
      to enroll about 300 cocaine positive and negative patients over a 2 year period.

      Blood samples will be collected for analysis of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) pre- and
      postoperatively.
