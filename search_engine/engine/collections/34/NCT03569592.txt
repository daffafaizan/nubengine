      exiting incarceration, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and both populations
      simultaneously. This contribution is important because this evidence has applications for
      correctional facilities and HIV clinical practice throughout the United States. The
      contributions of the proposed pilot study are: to provide evidence on the effectiveness of a
      targeted intervention on these two high-risk groups, generate exploratory data on predictors
      of overdose risk specific to HIV status and recent incarceration, and provide context about
      overdose risk and responses to witnessed overdoses in the first month after release.

      In this study, incarcerated PLWHA in the Philadelphia Department of Prisons will be offered
      overdose training while incarcerated and naloxone (Narcan) at release. Study participants
      will be given a pre-test on overdose knowledge and attitudes and receive the overdose
      prevention intervention. Those who are still incarcerated one month later will receive a
      post-test on overdose knowledge and attitudes. Approximately one month after study
      participants are released from jail, they will be given a one-month follow-up survey that
      assesses: overdose knowledge and attitudes (post-test 2), information on personal or
      witnessed overdoses since release, health and post-incarceration related information, and
      characteristics of drug use since release. Approximately 20 study participants will
      participate in a semi-structured interview 4-6 weeks after their release on their experiences
      with the overdose prevention intervention.
