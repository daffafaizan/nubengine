    
      Background:

      - Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can
      mediate the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with highdose
      aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting

      preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

      - Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 axis,
      facilitates the activity of anti-tumor lymphocytes in the tumor micro environment.
      Pembrolizumab administration can result in objective tumor responses in patients with

      metastatic melanoma and is approved for use by the FDA for the treatment of these patients.

        -  Administered TIL express low levels of PD-1, though PD-1 can be re-expressed on TIL in
           vivo following TIL administration

        -  In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD1 antibody enhances the
           anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Determine in a prospective randomized trial whether the addition of pembrolizumab to the
           standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, TIL, and high-dose IL-2 can improve
           complete response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma who have received prior
           anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (Cohort 1)

        -  Determine the complete response rate to the standard non-myeloablative conditioning
           regimen, TIL, and high-dose IL-2 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with
           metastatic melanoma who have not received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (Cohort 2)

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 16 and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma

        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL

        -  No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin administration

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

      Design:

        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected for TIL

        -  Patients will be assigned one of 2 cohorts: (1)

             -  patients who are refractory to prior anti PD-1/PD-L1

             -  patients who have not received prior anti PD-1/PD-L1

        -  After TIL growth is established:

             -  Patients assigned to Cohort 1 will be randomized to either receive or not receive
                pembrolizumab in combination with the standard non-myeloablative conditioning
                regimen, TIL and high dose IL-2

             -  All patients assigned to Cohort 2 will receive the standard nonmyeloablative
                conditioning regimen, TIL, and high-dose IL-2ACT in combination with pembrolizumab.

        -  For those patients receiving pembrolizumab- Pembrolizumab will be administered
           immediately prior to TIL administration and continue for an additional three cycles
           following the cell infusion.

        -  Up to 170 patients may be enrolled over 3-4 years.
