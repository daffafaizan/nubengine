    
      In the Cirrhosis Medical Home, a care coordinator, supported by an interdisciplinary clinical
      team, will deliver a personalized intervention guided by a set of innovative tools: (i)
      patient-centered care protocols, (ii) a mobile office, (iii) care coordination support
      software, and (iv) dynamic feedback measures.

      The overall goal is to improve quality of life of patients discharged from the hospital with
      cirrhosis and to reduce acute health care utilization for patients with cirrhosis.

      Additionally, up to 40 caregivers will be enrolled in the trial.
