      severe sepsis, indicated as lowered cardiac index or echocardiographically documented cardiac
      dysfunction. Myocardial dysfunction occurs in greater than 50% of patients with severe sepsis
      and septic shock. In this context, B-type natriuretic peptid (BNP) from ventricular myocytes
      may serve as a surrogate biomarker for the evaluation and quantification of myocardial
      dysfunction. Biologically active BNP is cleaved into inactive NT-proBNP, which is supposed to
      be a better marker of myocardial dysfunction and prognosis in patients with severe sepsis and
      septic shock. However, severity of illness dependent association of myocardial dysfunction,
      especially left ventricular diastolic function, dosage of norepinephrine, NT-proBNP and
      biomarker plasma concentrations has not been systematically investigated in
      postoperative/posttraumatic patients in septic shock or volume-deficiency/hemorrhagic shock.
      Moreover, data regarding NT-proBNP plasma concentrations and renal function in
      postoperative/posttraumatic patients are sparse. Therefore, this prospective observational
      study will enroll n= 200 postoperative/posttraumatic patients to monitor longitudinally
      NT-proBNP, biomarkers, and cell surface markers on leukocytes to find out whether there is a
      discriminating pattern of myocardial dysfunction, NT-proBNP and biomarkers in patients with
      non-septic or septic shock, respectively, and with beneficial or harmful outcome.
