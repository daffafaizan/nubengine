    
      To determine the optimal schedule for three-dimensional verification imaging and necessary
      re-planning of patients undergoing IMPT for a rapidly changing tumor (small cell lung
      cancer).

        -  To determine the rate of cardiac toxicities from IMPT in patients with small cell lung
           cancer compared with historical controls receiving photon-based treatment.

        -  To determine the rate of pneumonitis and esophagitis from IMPT and compare with
           historical controls receiving photon based treatment.
