      studies at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) designed to determine the safety of treating
      liver metastases with SBRT. These studies have shown that SBRT can be delivered safely to the
      majority of patients with liver metastases. The treated tumour was controlled (shrank or
      remained the same size) in 74% of patients at one year following treatment. The median
      survival of patients was 16 months (i.e.half of patients survived longer and half shorter
      than 16 months). This survival rate is better than that expected in patients whose tumours
      grew bigger even though they were treated with chemotherapy. Supportive care only (no
      treatment other than care to make you feel better) in these patients is associated with a
      median survival rate of 6-12 months. We expect that the benefits of SBRT in this study will
      be similar to those observed in our initial studies.
