      reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap. A greater understanding
      of the procedure's impact on the perfusion of the abdominal skin can be valuable in
      predicting areas susceptible to necrosis.

      Methods: Microcirculatory changes were monitored in the abdominal skin of 20 consecutive
      patients undergoing breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator
      flap. Quantitative mapping was performed with laser Doppler perfusion imaging at seven set
      intervals. Measurements were taken and recorded within four standardized zones covering the
      skin between the xiphoid process and the upper incisional boundary of the flap (zone 1-4;
      cranial to caudal).
