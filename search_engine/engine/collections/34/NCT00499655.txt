      I. Comparison of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving erlotinib + celecoxib
      vs. erlotinib + placebo for advanced NSCLC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Objective tumor response rate as defined by RECIST Criteria for subjects receiving
      erlotinib/celecoxib treatment arms.

      II. Categorize the change in e-cadherin expression from baseline to week 8 in a subset of
      subjects.

      III. Evaluation of overall survival (OS). IV. Measurement of COX-2, EGFR by
      immunohistochemistry and EGFR amplification by FISH, and EGFR mutation status to correlate
      with clinical response.

      V. Measurement of change in urinary PGE-M and correlation with response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily and oral placebo twice daily
      on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily and oral celecoxib twice
      daily on days 1-28.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
