      I. To determine the effects of a 6-month progressive combined training (PCT) program on
      metabolic dysregulation (MetD) in centrally obese latina breast cancer survivors (LBCS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether improved physical fitness and health-related measures from a 6-month
      PCT program are associated with reductions in MetD in centrally obese LBCS.

      II. To determine whether MetD status and physical fitness can be maintained following a
      6-month follow-up period and to establish predictors of exercise behavior in LBCS.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I (PROGRESSIVE COMBINED TRAINING [PCT]): Patients undergo supervised exercise sessions
      comprising of aerobic exercise (AE) over 30 minutes and resistance exercise (RE) over 25
      minutes 3 days per week for 24 weeks. Patients are encouraged to complete AE at home over 20
      minutes 1 day per week. Patients receive a Polar heart rate monitor to monitor heart rate
      during the AE sessions.

      GROUP II (PROGRESSIVE AEROBIC TRAINING [PAT]): Patients undergo supervised exercise sessions
      comprising of AE over 45-60 minutes 3 days per week for 24 weeks. Patients are encouraged to
      complete AE at home over 20 minutes 1 day per week. Patients receive a Polar heart rate
      monitor to monitor heart rate during the AE sessions.

      GROUP III (USUAL CARE): Patients undergo usual care. Beginning 24 weeks, patients may undergo
      supervised exercise sessions comprising of AE and RE as in Group I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 37 and 49 weeks.
