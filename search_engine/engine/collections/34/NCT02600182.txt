      Pressure (BiPAP) in patients undergoing heart surgery of valve replacement and coronary
      artery bypass graft on the variables clinics, cardiorespiratory and physical functional.These
      individuals were randomized to compose the control group (GC) and the BiPAP group (GBiPAP).
      The routine physical therapy was performed in both groups and in the BiPAPG two daily
      sessions of 20 minutes were applied with positive expiratory pressure of 10cmH2O and
      inspiratory of 15cmH2O. To verify the effect of this intervention, before and after the
      protocol patients underwent the following evaluations: the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the
      heart rate variability, the manovacuometry, and cirtometry in the axillary line, umbilical
      line and the xiphoid appendix.
