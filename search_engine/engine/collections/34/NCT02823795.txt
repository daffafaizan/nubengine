      activation coach two days post-discharge. The patients will thereafter get motivational
      interviewing sessions by the same patient activation coach with the the goal that the
      patients are motivated to the knowledge, skills and confidence needed to manage the four main
      activity areas: 1) medication management; 2) adhere to care plan/ follow-up visits according
      to the discharge plan; 3) recognize indications (symptoms/signs) that the condition is
      worsening and how to respond; and 4) contact and manage relations/encounters with health care
      providers. Patients in control group will receive standard care, i.e. discharge and follow-up
      as in normal procedures. The investigators will use a randomization in permuted blocks of 10
      intervention patients and 10 control patients included. To test the hypothesis that the
      re-hospitalizations rate is 15 % lower in the intervention group compared to the control
      group 242 patients (121 per group) are needed for power of 80% with the level of significance
      set to 5 % using two-sided chi-square.
