    
      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study to determine the effect of
      leucovorin in preventing or reducing Folotyn-related Grade 2 or higher oral mucositis in
      patients with hematological malignancies including PTCL and CTCL.

      Patients with hematological malignancies, including PTCL and CTCL, will be enrolled based on
      meeting all protocol eligibility criteria. The primary endpoint will be evaluated in the
      first 7-week treatment cycle. For patients who respond to study treatment, the Investigator
      can treat patients for a total of 6 cycles. Approximately 37 patients will be enrolled.
      Safety, as assessed by reported SAEs, will continue to be monitored during the optional
      treatment period. Efficacy will be followed to the extent that it is evaluated according to
      the Institution's standard of care. No formal analysis of efficacy will be made.
