      mitoxantrone and dexamethasone. The combination will given over a 28 day cycle. In addition
      each patient will receive Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis with
      Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/Sulfa) or equivalent agent. On day 4 the physician has the
      option of starting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), granulocyte macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), or pegylated GCSF.

      All patients who receive at least one dose of the drug will be evaluated for toxicity.
      Patients will be treated with the agent for at least 2 cycles to be considered eligible for
      evaluation of response. The chemotherapy dosing will continue until there is evidence of
      disease progression, a second recurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 8 courses
      of therapy.
