      a Vehicle to resolve DSD (RESERVE- DSD). The investigators will randomize 256 subjects, newly
      admitted to post acute care, to intervention (RESERVE-DSD) or control (usual care).
      Intervention subjects will receive 30-minute sessions of tailored cognitively stimulating
      recreational activities for up to 30 days. The investigators hypothesize that subjects who
      receive RESERVE-DSD will have: decreased severity and duration of delirium; greater gains in
      attention, orientation, memory, abstract thinking, and executive functioning; and greater
      gains in physical function compared to subjects with DSD who receive usual care. The
      investigators will also evaluate potential moderators of intervention efficacy (lifetime of
      complex mental activities and APOE status). The secondary aim is to describe the costs
      associated with RESERVE-DSD.
