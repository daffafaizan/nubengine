      and higher morbidity and mortality in the first year after stroke onset than those patients
      without stroke. Some therapeutic methods have shown to be effective for PSD, including
      antidepressants, non-drug interventions, and combination therapies. However, pharmacological
      agents not only show unwanted side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and
      dizziness, but also produce high risk of hemorrhagic complications and stroke. Therefore, in
      addition to antidepressants treating PSD, non-drug interventions have been proposed to treat
      PSD. Until now, there are various physical techniques, including transcranial magnetic
      stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial
      ultrasonic stimulation, etc. Previous studies have shown that transcranial alternating
      current stimulation (tACS) is commonly used to relieve pain, and has also been used to treat
      conditions such as transient tic disorder and cluster headaches. In the brain, there are
      specific opioid receptors which are not independent, and they work together with the electro
      analgesic system. Patients treated for chronic pain had lower levels of endorphins in their
      cerebrospinal fluid. Theoretically, using tACS can alleviate pain was caused by electrical
      stimulation to activate the brain's pain system (anti-nociceptive system), led to the
      beta-endorphin, serotonin and norepinephrine release.

      Therefore, the study is expected to verify the effect of Transcranial Alternating Current
      Stimulation on patients with PSD in China and preliminarily explore the variations of gamma
      and beta-oscillations and cognitive function for the intervention of PSD utilized by it.
