      people with intellectual disability and ABI. In the experimental group of people with
      intellectual disability the improvements were significant compared to the control group in
      the dimensions of role limitations due to physical problems (Z = -2.41, p = .016), role
      limitations due to emotional problems (Z = - 1.99; p = .046), social function (Z = -3.35; p =
      .001) and the accumulated scores of the mental component (Z = -2.66; p = .008). On the other
      hand, the ABI experimental group obtained significant improvements in vitality after the
      intervention (Z = -2.20, p = .028), not finding statistically significant improvements
      compared to the control group.

      With respect to the number of roles internalized, both the experimental group with
      intellectual disability and the one presenting ABI experienced a marginally significant
      increase in the number of roles that participants wanted to develop in the future after
      taking part in the program.

      Both in people with intellectual disability, ABI and students, the program improved the
      involvement in meaningful activities through the inclusion of new occupations, modification
      of previous habits or the transformation of solitary activities into social participation
      activities. In addition, the participants increased their awareness of those factors that
      influenced their participation in meaningful activities. This meant becoming aware of aspects
      related to volition, habituation, personal abilities and the environment.
