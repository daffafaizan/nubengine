    
      1. To demonstrate that SPECT/CT (99mTc EC DG) is not inferior to PET/CT (18F FDG PET/CT)
           for sensitivity or specificity measures when image interpretation of primary and
           metastatic lesions are compared against a truth standard in patients with a high
           likelihood of lung cancer.

        2. To expand the patient safety experience using 99mTc EC DG.
