    
      With the investigation of spontaneous sensations (SPS) according to the protocol of Michael
      and al (2011) the investigators study how patients can listen to their internal sensations
      located in other body part than the painful member in order to construct a representation of
      the body and maintain it in active consciousness. A group of controls will be included to
      understand if there is a global modification in the perception of SPS witch may be linked to
      the pathology.
