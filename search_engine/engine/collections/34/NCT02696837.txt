      repair using PIRS (Percutaneous Internal Ring Suturing) method will be randomly assigned into
      four groups.

      Gr 1: Endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxant, Gr 2: Endotracheal Intubation without
      muscle relaxant, Gr 3: Proseal Laryngeal Mask Airway without muscle relaxant, Gr 4: Proseal
      Laryngeal Mask Airway with subparalytic does muscle relaxant.

      Apart from standard monitorization, all patients' intragastric pressures will also be
      monitored. Patients' age at presentation, gender, time of surgery, time of anesthesia,
      intragastric pressure, intraabdominal pressure, intraoperative findings and complications
      will be noted and compared between groups.
