      analysis of body composition and lipoprotein level and structure among patients with graded
      levels of renal failure in comparison to control subjects. To study the relationship between
      HDL cholesterol and both body composition and insulin resistance measured as homeostatic
      model assessment (HOMA) among a cohort of non diabetic non-proteinuric patients with advanced
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared to non diabetic subjects having normal kidney function.
      Renal patients chosen will be with advanced CKD stage 3, Stage 4, and stage 5 - which is end
      stage renal failure (ESRD) and on hemodialysis. Fasting blood will be taken for the
      evaluation of baseline lipid and renal function, and blood glucose level to make sure that
      there is no recent evidence of diabetes. Body compositions will be measured with 2
      established methods: DEXA and whole body bio-impedance spectroscopy (BIS). Fat mass and
      analysis will be estimated so as to provide a relationship between adiposity, insulin
      resistance, residual renal function and HDL levels and structure.
