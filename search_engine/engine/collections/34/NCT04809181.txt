      continuously improved, relpase is still the leading cause of death after allo-HSCT.
      Monitoring of micro residual disease (MRD) after allogeneic HSCT provides a risk
      stratification of relpase risk in patients after transplantation.There is an urgent need to
      find an effective intervention plan for patients with MRD positive after transplantation, in
      order to reduce the risk of relapse after transplantation and improve long-term survival.The
      combination of demethylated drugs with venetoclax has shown promising results in clinical
      trials in AML patients who cannot tolerate induction chemotherapy.In patients with
      MRD-positive patients after AML/MDS allo-HSCT, azacytidine combined with venetoclax may be
      effective in eliminating small residual diseases, reducing the risk of relapse, and
      ultimately improving long-term survival.The primary purpose of this study was to explore an
      effective protocol to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with MRD positive after
      allo-HSCT for AML/MDS.
