      important factor in treatment failure. The identification of hemodynamic factors that
      influence treatment success could predict outcome. Published studies show that the
      hemodynamic environment of aneurysms changes after treatment, and there is limited
      retrospective evidence that the degree of change affects treatment success. However, previous
      hemodynamic calculations did not have access to patient-specific measurements of blood flow,
      which substantially reduced their accuracy. In addition, no prospective studies of the
      predictive value of post-treatment aneurysm hemodynamics have been done.

      Methods: Prospectively test new aneurysm patients for hemodynamic predictors of treatment
      outcome based upon the hypothesis long-term aneurysm treatment outcome can be prospectively
      predicted by measuring the immediate hemodynamic effects of aneurysm treatment with novel
      patient-specific modeling techniques. Task 1: In a new cohort of patients undergoing aneurysm
      treatment, the investigators will again use Doppler guidewire measurements to create
      patient-specific hemodynamic models of treatment effects. By prospectively applying the
      knowledge of crucial hemodynamic changes the investigators will use immediate post-treatment
      hemodynamics to predict long-term treatment outcome.
