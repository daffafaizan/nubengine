      GSK Biologicals' trivalent investigational MMR vaccine (referred to as INV_MMR vaccine,
      throughout this document) and compare its immunogenicity to the US standard of care
      comparator vaccine (M-M-R II, Merck and Co., Inc., referred to as COM_MMR throughout this
      document) in children during their second year of life. The INV_MMR vaccine will be given as
      one of three consistency lots manufactured to target potencies designated as INV_MMR_L1,
      INV_MMR_L2 and INV_MMR_L3. The COM_MMR vaccine will be given as one of two lots designated
      COM_MMR_L1 and COM_MMR_L2 and will be analysed as pooled lots within the study. The MMR
      vaccine will be co-administered with Varivax (VV), Havrix (HAV) and (in the US sub-cohort
      only) Prevnar 13 (PCV-13) which are routinely administered to children of this age in the US.
