      3,000 volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have the exclusion criteria will
      be randomized:

        -  2,250 volunteers who will be vaccinated with the EpiVacCorona vaccine, twice
           intramuscularly at a dose of 0.5 ml;

        -  750 volunteers who will be vaccinated with a placebo, twice intramuscularly at a dose of
           0.5 ml.

      If volunteers drop out of the study, they will not be replaced. All volunteers will be
      followed up by an investigator physician for 6 months following the first vaccination in
      order to identify possible late adverse events. In case the volunteer has any late reactions,
      he/she will be invited to the clinic to correct his/her condition.
