      subjects. The study is designed to gather the efficacy, safety and tolerability data in
      Japanese children 7 through 18 years of age that would support approval of MEDI3250 in Japan.

      For children age 7 years through 18 years, the recommended dosage schedule for intranasal
      administration is 0.2 mL (0.1 mL per nostril). For children age 7 years through 8 years not
      previously vaccinated against seasonal influenza, a second dose should be given after an
      interval of at least 4 weeks.

      For the efficacy endpoint, data will be gathered on the incidence of laboratory-confirmed
      influenza-like illness in the two treatment arms. Laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness
      would include cases of influenza diagnosed using culture-confirmation and/or PCR-based
      methods.

      For the safety and tolerability endpoint, data will be gathered on solicited symptoms, AEs
      and SAEs.

      Subject will be randomized 2:1 to receive MEDI3250 or placebo.
