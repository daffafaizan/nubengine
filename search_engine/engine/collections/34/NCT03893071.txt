    
      This is an open-label extension study of intravenous HP-β-CD (administered as Trappsol®
      Cyclo(TM)) in patients with NPC-1 to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy by providing
      continued access to treatment following completion of study CTD-TCNPC-101. Patients will
      receive medication at their home or local site under the supervision of a home nurse
      professional or at the parent site under the supervision of the site principal investigator.
      Patients will visit the parent site for safety and efficacy evaluations after receiving
      treatment for 3 months in the extension protocol.

      Thereafter, visits to the parent site will be every 6 months until cessation. The study will
      continue until Trappsol® Cyclo (TM) becomes commercially available or study/site/patient
      discontinuation. All patients who complete study CTD-TCNCP-101 and pass the screening
      criteria will be eligible for this study. The study will be directed from parent site in the
      US. Vital signs, AEs Adverse Events (AEs) and concomitant meds will be recorded by the home
      nurse professional or deputy at the local site and reported immediately to the parent site
      for entry into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and reporting to the sponsor.

      For logistical reasons home infusions will be permitted as long as AEs, infusion details and
      concomitants medications are reported directly to the parent site by an authorised deputy
      according to local guidelines. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) consisting of an independent
      advisor, the medical monitor, and the principal investigator will be established to review
      AEs and laboratory data throughout the study.
