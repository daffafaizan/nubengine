    
      This protocol is designed to allow inpatient and outpatient evaluation of adults with a
      variety of

      endocrine disorders for purposes of research and physician education in our accredited
      internal medicine endocrinology training programs. Participants will receive clinical care
      per standard of practice for their condition. Data collected from standard clinical practice
      will be retained for future research. The research-directed evaluations may include
      collection and retention for future use of blood, feces, saliva, or urine samples or
      evaluation of tissue that was routinely collected for clinical care. In some patients with
      endocrine disorders, laboratory or radiological studies will be performed to confirm a
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient, using standard approaches in current
      clinical practice. In some cases, the patient will receive medical, radiation or surgical
      treatment for their disorder.
