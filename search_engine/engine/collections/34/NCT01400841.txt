    
      Aortic Regurgitation, (also known as Aortic Insufficiency; AI), is the failure of the aortic
      valve to close completely during diastole which causes blood to flow from the aorta back into
      the left ventricle. Aortic Regurgitation (AR) is a frequent cause of both disability and
      death due to congestive heart failure, primarily in individuals forty or older, but can also
      occur in younger populations.

      Traditionally management of aortic regurgitation has been by aortic valve replacement,
      however, as has been observed in patients who have had mitral valve repair, the option of
      maintaining ones native aortic valve versus a replacement, either bioprosthetic or
      mechanical, can have added multiple benefits. The advantage of repair is the avoidance of
      prosthetic valve-related complications with bioprosthetic valves over 10-15 years or the need
      for anticoagulation with mechanical valves and the related problems of this therapy.
      Therefore, potentially aortic valve repair is a good option for patients with AR or AI.
