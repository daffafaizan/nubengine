      azilsartan medoxomil in participants with essential hypertension. This study will assess the
      safety and effectiveness of azilsartan medoxomil prescribed as a monotherapy or taken
      concomitantly with other anti-hypertension therapies in real-world clinical practice
      settings.

      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. The data will be prospectively
      collected, at the centers from medical files and recorded into electronic case report forms
      (e-CRFs). All the participants will be assigned to a single observational cohort:

        -  Participants With Essential Hypertension

      The multi-center study will be conducted in South Korea. Data collection will be based on
      routinely scheduled and emergency visits over the surveillance period, scheduled at Visit 1
      (Baseline), Visit 2 (6 Weeks), Visit 3 (3 Months or more less than 6 Months) and Visit 4 (6
      Months or more [Month 9]). The overall duration of the study will be approximately 6 years.
      All participants will be followed up for 9 months after drug administration.
