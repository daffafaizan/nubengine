    
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary estimate of
      antitumor activity of SGN-CD123A. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:

        1. Part A is the dose-escalation portion of the trial, designed to identify the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) of SGN-CD123A

        2. Part B is the dose-expansion portion of the trial, designed to evaluate SGN-CD123A in
           patients with differing CD123 expression levels

      Dose-escalation in Part A will be conducted using a 3+3 study design. Patients with
      CD123-detectable AML will be enrolled in cohorts at escalating doses of study drug and will
      receive up to 2 induction cycles of SGN-CD123A treatment at an assigned dose level in 3-week
      cycles.

      After completion of dose-escalation, patients will be enrolled in Part B of the study.
      Patients enrolled in Part B will receive up to 2 induction cycles of SGN-CD123A treatment at
      a dose level and frequency determined by results in Part A.

      For both Part A and Part B, a third induction cycle may be permitted with the approval of the
      study medical monitor. If a patient achieves a complete remission or complete remission with
      incomplete hematologic recovery, optional post-remission cycles of SGN-CD123A may be
      administered.
