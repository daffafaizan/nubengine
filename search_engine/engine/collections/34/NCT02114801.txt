      increase in effectiveness in the control of biofilm by caregivers and patients.There is a
      paucity of studies evaluating the effectiveness of the electric toothbrush compared to manual
      toothbrush specifically in patients with cerebral palsy.Only one study used the electric
      toothbrush in patients with cerebral palsy and demonstrated superiority of the electric
      toothbrush over the manual. However, the study investigated the effect of various cleaning
      strategies on symptoms of gingival inflammation, not specifically focusing on the comparison
      of the efficiency of removal of biofilm from the manual toothbrush and electric toothbrush.
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the electric brush
      on and off the removal of dental plaque in subjects with cerebral palsy compared to manual
      toothbrush. The secondary objective was to characterize the study as socioeconomic
      population.
