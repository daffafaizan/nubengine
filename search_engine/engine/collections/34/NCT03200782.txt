      clinically asymptomatic but also life-threatening. The exact mechanisms leading to
      postprandial hypoglycemia are not fully understood and therapeutic options are limited and
      often accompanied with reduced life-quality and weight gain.

      In this study, prospective, randomly selected and double-blinded treatment is performed to
      investigate the effect on postprandial hypoglycemia. A total of 12 subjects participate in
      the study. After a screening date, three study dates will be performed. Participation in the
      study usually takes two weeks, but can also be extended to three weeks in individual cases.
      The University Hospital Basel will be the only test center in this study.

      In order to check whether the increase in blood glucose after food intake and subsequent
      excessive reaction of the body followed by hypoglycaemia patients receive either anakinra as
      a subcutaneous injection 3h or empagliflozin as a tablet 2 h before a liquid standardized
      test meal. On one study day only subcutaneous and oral placebo control will be used.

      At the beginning of each study date as well as at the time of the test meal several blood
      samples will be taken to evaluate blood glucose and blood glucose-influencing parameters
      (insulin / C-peptide, intestinal hormones, inflammatory parameters such as C-reactive
      protein, IL1beta and IL1-receptor agonist as well as macrophage and t-lymphocyte
      subpopulations) will be controlled. Questionnaires for dumping symptoms (Dumping Rating
      scale, Sigstad Score) and hypoglycemia testing with mini-mental test, stanford sleepiness
      scale and Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Scale will be performed repetitively.
