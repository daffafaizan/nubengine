      insulin treatment were feasible and led to less serious diabetic complications. 102 patients
      with type 1 diabetes mellitus were randomiz (October 1982 to March 1984) to intensified
      conventional treatment (ICT; n=48) or standard treatment (ST; n=54). The randomized SDIS
      study lasted for 7.5 years, whereas 96 patients were fully evaluated. Thereafter patients
      were assigned to their regular clinical visits.

      In the present study, 96 patients from the SDIS study were asked to participate in current
      study and to investigate their skin microcirculation, in which 72 patients agreed (ICT; n=35
      vs. ST; n=37). Also, nineteen healthy subjects participated as controls for the method of
      iontophoresis, with no intention to be followed-up. Exclusions criteria were; any history or
      ongoing ischemic foot ulcer or peripheral artery disease or osteoartropathy. The
      iontophoresis investigation took place 5.5 years Â± 2 months, after the primary randomization
      ceased (7.5 years). All participants (except the control subjects) were then followed-up
      until first time hospitalization for ischemic foot ulcer or until 31 december 2011.
