      pulmonary hypertension and may occur in anywhere from 5-20% of sarcoidosis patients. Inhaled
      treprostinil has shown clinical improvements in exercise capacity after 12 weeks of therapy
      in patients with WHO Group 1 pulmonary hypertension. More recently, there has been interest
      in using inhaled PAH-specific therapies for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension
      associated with interstitial lung disease.

      The investigators believe that those patients with pulmonary hypertension in the setting of
      sarcoidosis-associated interstitial lung disease are a unique population which may
      potentially benefit from inhaled, targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy (inhaled
      treprostinil) while minimizing the adverse effects associated with systemic pulmonary
      vasodilators. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled treprostinil in
      subjects with sarcoidosis-associated interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension.
