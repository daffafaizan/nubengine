      program that explained the purpose and methodology of this study. After getting informed
      consent from patients, demographic data including age, sex, medical history (including
      comorbidities and risk factors), current medicine, lifestyle habits, height (cm), and weight
      (kg) were recorded, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height
      squared (kilograms per square meter, kg/m2). The included subjects need to perform
      transthoracic echocardiography or provide an echocardiographic examination within one month.
      CAD diagnosis was determined based on the results of the coronary angiography, using stenosis
      50% cutoffs considered have coronary diseases or not.

      Consecutive patients of both sexes with coronary angiography from outpatient or inpatient
      departments of Fuwai Hospital were recruited into the study. The inclusion criteria were
      Chinese, aged 35 to 75 years with CAD verified by coronary angiography, and able to give
      informed written consent. The subjects were excluded if they had New York Heart Association
      Class III-IV degree with ejection fraction < 45%, severe pulmonary disease, significant
      psychiatric disease, or history of pharyngeal surgery for OSA or current use of CPAP
      treatment for OSA. They were also excluded if they declined to participate or were unable to
      provide informed consent.
