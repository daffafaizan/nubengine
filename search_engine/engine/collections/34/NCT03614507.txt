      after written informed consent will be obtained from the patients' parents or legally
      authorized representatives. Patients will be randomized either in the "FreeO2" group for
      automatic oxygen flow titration or in the "manual" group for Oxygen therapy with manual flow
      titration. The SpO2 will be recorded continuously in both groups of the study using the
      FreeO2 device throughout the duration of hospitalization; In the group "FreeO2 ", the device
      will record the data continuously and allow the automation of oxygen titration - in the group
      "Manual", the device will only be used to monitor SpO2 and heart rate.
