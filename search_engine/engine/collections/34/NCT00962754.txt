      status. Some disadvantages of recording fluid intake and output are that it is time-consuming
      and complex. If it would give reliable and accurate information about the fluid volume status
      there would be a good reason for all this effort. In the few researches that have
      investigated this subject a low correlation has been found between the fluid balance and the
      weight changes of an adult patient. Own experience gives reasons to doubt about the
      reliability of the fluid balance in children, not rarely there is a discrepancy between the
      fluid balance and the weight measurement. We are interested in the relevance of recording
      fluid balance in neonates.
