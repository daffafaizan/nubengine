      I. To determine whether positron emission tomography (PET) using the new imaging agent
      18F-clofarabine can be used for imaging cancer, and whether interventions that activate the
      immune system can change the biodistribution of 18F-clofarabine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 18F-clofarabine intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan at baseline and
      2-4 weeks after completion of immunotherapy.
