    
      Randomized, controlled, national, multicenter, prospective study to compare systematic
      rituximab infusions (conventional therapy) to rituximab infusion based on rate of ANCA and
      CD19 lymphocytes in patients with systemic ANCA-associated vasculitis, in remission (achieved
      with an induction treatment combining corticosteroids and an immunosuppressant after the
      first flare of the disease (new diagnosis) or after a relapse. Patients will be stratified by
      first flare (66% of the patients) or relapse (33% of the patients). Patients complying with
      the inclusion criteria may be included when they are in remission from their vasculitis.
      Patients will be included at the time of remission and then randomized. They will receive
      maintenance treatment by 1)2 rituximab infusions mg at D1, D15 then every 6 months until
      month 18 (i.e. a total of 5 infusions), at the dose of 500 mg. 2) 1 rituximab infusion at the
      dose of 500 mg at D0 then ANCA status and CD19+ lymphocyte count will be monitored every 3
      months, and patients will receive new 500 mg rituximab infusions either if CD19 are > to
      0/mm3, or if ANCA are positive again or if ANCA titer significantly raises. After the 18
      month length of maintenance phase, i.e. after stopping immunosuppressive maintenance therapy,
      patients will be followed for an additional 10 month period. Patients with granulomatosis
      with polyangiitis will be prescribed cotrimoxazole 160/800 tid (for 2 additional years).
