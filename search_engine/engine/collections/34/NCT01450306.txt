      improve or accelerate extinction learning. We will randomly assign people with snake phobia
      to receive DCS or placebo, and then provide all participants with exposure therapy. We will
      examine whether people receiving DCS and vs. placebo show different brain reactions to
      symptom provocation before and after exposure therapy.
