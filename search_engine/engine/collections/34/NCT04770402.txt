      of life (QOL) and ability to perform daily activities through reduced Chemotherapy-Induced
      Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms. CIPN debilitates and erodes QOL by preventing
      individuals from pursuing their normal activities of daily living.

      The features of CIPN, including physical, social/family, emotional, functional, and specific
      CIPN symptoms, will be measured with the validated FACT-GOG-NTX. This project brings
      necessary attention and scientific inquiry to supportive cancer care, which is sometimes
      de-prioritized behind disease treatment. The potential for nonpharmacologic acupuncture to
      reduce CIPN and other symptoms with minimal side effects has beneficial implications for
      disease treatment. Patients with controlled symptoms are better able to tolerate
      life-prolonging treatment and avoid chemotherapy dose reductions which result from neurotoxic
      side effects of chemotherapy.

      Subjects who consent and are determined to be eligible will be randomized to receive either
      acupuncture treatment or standard of care treatment for their CIPN. Subjects'
      socio-demographics, medical history, opioid and concomitant medication intake information
      will be collected. Subjects who are randomized to the acupuncture treatment arm will receive
      12 sessions of acupuncture over approximately 10 weeks. Subjects randomized to standard of
      care will continue with standard of care therapy per their physician for treatment of their
      CIPN. All subjects will complete questionnaires at Baseline, mid-point, and endpoint.
      Responses to questionnaires will then be analyzed towards answering the study's objectives.
