    
      SRT3025 is being developed for the treatment of metabolic diseases. This study is the first
      administration of SRT3025 in humans and seeks to establish the initial safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SRT3025 (and any metabolites, if analyzed) before
      proceeding to future Phase 1 studies or Phase 2 patient studies.

      This protocol details a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, dose
      escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of SRT3025 in healthy
      male subjects. The study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1A, 6 Cohorts of subjects
      will receive single escalating doses of SRT3025. In Part 1B, an additional one to two cohorts
      may be enrolled to investigate the effect of a moderate fat/calorie meal on single dose PK
      endpoints. In Part 2A, up to three cohorts may be enrolled to receive 14-day repeat doses of
      SRT3025 chosen from the Part 1A safety, tolerability, and PK data. In Part 2B, one to two
      additional cohorts may receive 14-day repeat doses of SRT3025 in combination with a moderate
      fat/calorie meal.
