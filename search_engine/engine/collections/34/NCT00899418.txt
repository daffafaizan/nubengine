      Primary

        -  Assess the effect of known variant polymorphisms (with functionally important
           associations) of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene on outcome (time to
           progression) in patients with breast cancer treated with bevacizumab on clinical trial
           ECOG-2100.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the effect of known variant polymorphisms (with functionally important
           associations) of the VEGF receptor-2 (KDR) gene on outcome (time to progression) in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the effect of known variant polymorphisms of these genes on efficacy (objective
           response rate and survival) in these patients.

        -  Assess the effect of known variant polymorphisms of these genes on toxicity outcome in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the effect of VEGF polymorphisms on VEGF expression by immunohistochemical
           staining (a known prognostic marker).

        -  Assess the effect of KDR polymorphisms on KDR expression by immunohistochemical
           staining.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue and genomic DNA samples from paraffin-embedded primary tumor are examined using
      standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment-length polymorphisms,
      immunohistochemistry, allele-specific PCR, and/or Taqman-based assays. Vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor-2 (KDR) expression and polymorphisms are assessed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 specimens will be accrued for this study.
