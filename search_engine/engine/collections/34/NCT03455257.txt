      designated for specific household expenditures such as food and family health and education
      typically show significant program benefits. In particular, several programs have shown
      positive impacts on use of health care resources, nutrition status and self-reported health,
      along with significant improvements in the motor and cognitive development of young children.

      Guinea-Bissau is currently the 11th poorest country and is thus an appropriate target for a
      cash transfer program. This project will pilot test the effect of a 2 year cash transfer
      program aiming to improve family food consumption patterns, family health and schooling, with
      resulting benefits for childhood growth and cognition. Family-wide assessment will be
      conducted to examine the impact in all family members. Baseline and 3 follow up assessments
      will be completed.
