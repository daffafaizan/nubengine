      and how ketamine may therapeutically impact brain function. This research may provide
      important insights into the mechanism of ketamine response, thus, potentially increasing the
      likelihood of successful treatment interventions and decrease the number of ineffective
      treatments and/or risk for serious side effects.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

      Utilizing novel dynamic sliding-window functional MR spectroscopy (fMRS) and liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS), we aim to evaluate the relationship between GABA and
      glutamate (central-baseline to peak and peripheral-baseline to 24 hours) levels with a change
      in depression symptoms (baseline to 24 hours), after a single infusion of intravenous (IV)
      ketamine, in subjects with treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
