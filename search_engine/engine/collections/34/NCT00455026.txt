      recruited. They will be randomised to receive remifentanil effect-site target 0, 2 or 4
      ng/ml. Then anaesthesia will be induced with propofol. Loss of the eyelash reflex, response
      to command and response to electrical stimulation will be measured. The raw EEG will be
      recorded and analysed off-line using our new method and also for BIS values. Anaesthesia will
      then proceed according to the needs of the patient and the surgery.
