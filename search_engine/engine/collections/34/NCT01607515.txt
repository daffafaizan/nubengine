      invasive method for CI measurement. An alternating current of max 400ÂµA and 45 kHz is
      conducted through the body. The way of the smallest resistance is the blood in the aorta. The
      impedance changes with the pulsatile blood flow. Out of the Impedance change there can be
      calculated the CI.
