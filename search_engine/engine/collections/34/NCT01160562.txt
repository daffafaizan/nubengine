      candidates confer only partial short-lived protection at best. An understanding of the
      mechanisms by which humans acquire malaria immunity through repeated P. falciparum infections
      may aid the development of a malaria vaccine. This pilor study is designed to initiate the
      epidemiological groundwork for a future prospective cohort study of acquired malaria immunity
      in Kalifabougou, Mali, a rural village of approximately 5 000 individuals who are exposed to
      seasonal P. falciparum transmission each year from July through December. This study will
      estimate the age-stratified point prevalence of P. falciparum infection before the malaria
      season and at the peak of the 6-month malaria season, and it will estimate the age-stratified
      incidence of symptomatic p. falciparum infection during the 6-month malaria season. The
      spatial distribution of asymptomatic P. falciparum infections and incident malaria cases
      within the village of Kalifabougou will be determined by merging the prevalence and incidence
      data with census and Global Positioning System (GPS) data.
