      cognitive functioning (e.g., processing speed, attention, executive functioning). This study
      is an effectiveness trial investigating a cognitive remediation intervention (Goal Management
      Training, or GMT) that has been shown to improve the cognitive impairment observed in other
      populations (e.g., older adults). The present study will investigate the impact of GMT in
      adults experiencing PTSD (including frontline healthcare workers suffering from PTSD related
      to the COVID-19 pandemic) and its associated cognitive impairment. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions - GMT, or a wait list condition (in
      which GMT will be postponed for approximately 21 weeks). Due to the pandemic, this study will
      be conducted primarily online (i.e., online assessments and treatment, with optional fMRI
      scans - functional magnetic resonance imaging). Once all assessments are complete,
      participants in the wait list condition will be able to begin GMT thelmselves.
