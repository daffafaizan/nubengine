      prevalent amongst a group of patients on high dose opiates for chronic pain.

      Aims

        1. To define the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in a group of patients on oral
           morphine for chronic pain.

        2. To determine the prevalence of respiratory failure in this cohort of patients. Patients
           on long term opiates (>6 months) from an outpatient pain clinic population on long
           acting morphine formulations > 40 mg/day, Oxycontin 30 mg/day, and Methadone > 20 mg/day
           were prospectively recruited. Home polysomnograms were done on them. During their
           clinical review they have spirometry, arterial blood gases, psychomotor vigilance tests
           done on them.
