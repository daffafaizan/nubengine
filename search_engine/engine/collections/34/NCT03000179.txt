    
      Primary Objectives

        -  To describe any antitumor activity of avelumab monotherapy, as measured by the response
           rate in patients with advanced or metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

        -  To describe the safety profile of avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced or
           metastatic small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response of
           avelumab monotherapy in patients with advanced small intestinal adenocarcinoma.

        -  To evaluate the association of tumor PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, MSI status, lymphocytic
           infiltration, and somatic mutation burden with response.
