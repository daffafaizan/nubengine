    
      The eligible study participants with unclear biliary lesions referred for an ERCP to the
      Sahlgrenska Univeristy Hospital endoscopy unit will be subjected to ERCP with/without brush
      cytology followed by EUS with/without FNA.

      The results of ERCP and EUS will be compared to the pathology report of surgical specimens in
      resected patients or to clinical follow up at 12 months post-EUS in non-resected patients.
