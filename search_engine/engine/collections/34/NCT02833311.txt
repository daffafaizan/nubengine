      pilot study is to evaluate whether goal setting, self-monitoring, and barrier management
      using a computer tablet can increase physical activity behavior, improve nutritional habits,
      and promote health-related quality of life in people with disabling neuromusculoskeletal
      conditions. Our hypothesis is that, in comparison to the standard care contact control group,
      participants in both the tablet group and the paper and pencil group will yield significant
      improvements in healthy behaviors,with the tablet group yielding significantly larger
      increases.
