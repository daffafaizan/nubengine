      "oxytocin") and control group (sprayed with saline but told as "saline"). After 10 min,
      participants were invited to the resting-state, text viewing task in fMRI scanner.

      In resting state session, participants with their eyes open and were instructed to attend to
      a black fixation cross centrally presented on a grey projection screen for 8 min (240TR).

      The Text viewing task employed a mixed block and even-related fMRI design. Participants were
      asked to judge whether they could understand the stimuli or not by a button press
      (1=understand; 2=not understand). Three kinds of stimuli were presented in separate block
      including "oxytocin-function", "oxytocin-knowledge", "robot" related stimuli, each category
      contained 20 sentences. In each block, the sentence (within one category) was presented
      pseudo-randomized from 5s to 9s (with mean duration of 7s), then followed by a jittered time
      interval (interval time = sentence duration - response time; if participants made response
      within 5s, the sentence would not disappear until its duration reached 5s). There were two
      sessions with six blocks per session, and there were 5 sentences (trials) per block. The
      order of blocks and sentences were designed to present in pseudo-random order and were
      applied to all participants.
