    
      The present project is a substudy of the DEDICATE Trial (ID: NCT03112980). It is a randomized
      intervention study taking place at the Kerckhoff-Klink Bad Nauheim Germany (Campus Justus
      Liebig University Giessen) involving 100 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (TAVI
      vs. SAVR) with a focus on cognitive outcome. A detailed assessment of psychological and
      health-related functions will be performed before intervention, during hospitalization and 3
      months after intervention. During hospitalization, the occurrence and progression of delirium
      will be assessed with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Other
      cognitive data will be collected before and 3 months after surgery with a selected and
      comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, including the evaluation of attention, word
      fluency, executive functions and various functional areas of memory. In addition, parameters
      of health-related QOL will be collected before and 3 months after the intervention using the
      SF-36, and information on anxiety and depression will be collected using the Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression Scale (HADS). A few days after the intervention, magnetic resonance images of
      the brain will be acquired to assess cerebral infarction.
