      superior right atrium section of the heart with a pacemaker for 30 seconds just prior to
      starting the heart and lung bypass machine. The stimulation is done to see how sensitive the
      heart is to developing atrial fibrillation. This test result will be documented. The
      procedure will only take 60 seconds out of the entire operation. It does not involve taking
      any samples of tissue or blood. Following this step, if the heart demonstrates atrial
      fibrillation for at least 30 seconds then the participant will then be randomized to either
      receive the prophylactic drug treatment using Amiodarone or to no prophylactic drug
      administration. The participant has a 50% chance of receiving the FDA approved study drug
      Amiodarone. The study arms consist of prophylactic drug administration with Amiodarone, No
      prophylactic drug administration, or no atrial fibrillation reaction after stimulation with
      the pacemaker. The remainder of the surgical procedure will not be affected, and will follow
      routine surgical practice.
