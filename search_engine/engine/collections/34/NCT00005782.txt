      the techniques of stem cell transplantation continue to improve, leading to less morbidity
      and mortality. However, the availability of a matched donor still remains one of the main
      obstacles. Given the inherited nature of this disease, many HLA-matched siblings of patients
      with sickle cell disease have sickle cell trait. Therefore, patients with sickle cell trait
      presumably have been used as donors for patients with sickle cell disease. However, there are
      no published data on whether special manipulations are required for the maintenance and
      storage of stem cells collected from patients with sickle cell trait. The effects of
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced stem cell mobilization in these
      patients are also not known. Also, due to the potential of HbS gellation in red cells, the
      freezing of stem cells derived from individuals with sickle cell trait may require a more
      stringent red cell removal than is normally performed. We would like to evaluate these issues
      using volunteers with sickle cell trait prior to beginning our own transplant protocol for
      sickle cell disease.
