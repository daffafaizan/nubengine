      participating centers will be collected to develop an AI algorithm to detect COVID-19
      pneumonia. This will be tested on external hold out datasets from different centers using
      SARS-CoV-2 by Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Assay as
      ground truth.
