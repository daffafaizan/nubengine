      contains a daily checklist for ventilation targets and reference tables listing targeted
      tidal volumes and end expiratory pressure-fraction of inspired oxygen titration. We will
      recruit mechanically ventilated patients who meet PARDS criteria. After a one-month
      implementation period, we will collect patient data over the subsequent 18 months, and
      compare them with the corresponding data in the 24 months prior to the implementation. The
      primary outcome is PARDS mortality, defined as number of deaths out of PARDS cases. Secondary
      outcomes are feasibility of ventilation bundle implementation, ventilator (VFD) and intensive
      care unit (IFD) free days and PICU mortality (number of deaths out of PICU admissions).
