      (D&I) is the lack of knowledge about how to sustain mental health prevention and treatment
      services for which there is substantial evidence of impact. Most D&I studies focus on
      adoption and initial implementation, with few studies (<20) rigorously exploring sustainment.
      The sustainment of services has been described as "one of the greatest, yet least understood,
      challenges in the field of implementation science." The gap in knowledge is even greater for
      low-resource contexts, as few studies have focused on these settings. This project aims to
      address this gap by developing and testing sustainment strategies for an evidenced-based
      youth suicide prevention program in a low-resource, American Indian (AI) contexts.
