    
      Young adults with substance use disorder (SUD) commonly experience co-occurring emotional
      distress in the form of affective/emotional disorders (i.e. anxiety, depressive, and related
      disorders) and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs). Based on the conceptualization
      of emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic treatment target, the current study utilizes
      the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) to target core
      psychopathological processes related to emotion dysregulation that underlie SITBs and
      emotional disorder pathology. Given its transdiagnostic format, the UP has the potential to
      address comorbidity among the emotional disorders (and other functionally similar problems
      such as SUDs) simultaneously and more comprehensively than single-diagnosis treatments.

      Patients seeking services or currently engaged in care at an existing comprehensive
      outpatient program for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders (the MGH
      Addiction Recovery Management Service) are eligible for this study. Participants will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive either UP + TAU or TAU alone. The adjunctive UP intervention
      consists of 16 twice-weekly group sessions (delivered over an 8-week period) designed to
      deliver transdiagnostic, emotion-focused CBT strategies.
