      the periodontium as a consequence of excessive occlusal forces or hyper-occlusion. Previous
      studies suggested accelerated periodontal destruction around teeth with occlusal trauma and
      increased mobility, however, the evidence is lacking. Recent animal studies found that
      occlusal trauma increased osteoclastic activity and alveolar bone loss. One possible
      mechanism suggested for the progression of periodontal destruction with occlusal trauma is
      that tooth mobility creates a subgingival environment conducive to overgrowth by periodontal
      pathogens. However, the association of occlusal trauma and subgingival microbiota was not
      evaluated in previous studies. Therefore, present study aimed to evaluate subgingival dental
      plaque components and compare with healthy individuals and periodontitis patients without
      occlusal trauma.
