      cardiovascular effects of MA and by determining the occurrence of adverse reactions during
      treatment with atomoxetine and placebo. We will evaluate atomoxetine (0 and 40 mg, BID) and
      MA doses (0 and 30 mg, IV).

      Participants will be randomized to atomoxetine or matched placebo for 6 days. Study drug will
      be administered once daily at 40 mg/day on the first two study days, twice daily for days
      3-5, & once on day 6. After discharge from the first component, and at least a 2-week washout
      period, participants will be re-admitted to the UCLA GCRC and switched to the opposite study
      medication for an additional 6 days.

      Methamphetamine/saline will be administered non-contingently on component I day 13, and
      component II day 7, over 1 min using a syringe pump activated by the study physician or nurse
      practitioner in order to assess safety and tolerability of atomoxetine. During drug
      administration sessions, heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored frequently. A code
      team will respond if required. Vital signs must remain within values specified under Stopping
      Criteria for initiation of MA administration. The physician or nurse practitioner will
      administer the MA/placebo and will be available in-house on pager for at least 4 h after each
      infusion. In addition, heart rate and blood pressure will be assessed three times daily
      throughout the inpatient portion of the protocol.
