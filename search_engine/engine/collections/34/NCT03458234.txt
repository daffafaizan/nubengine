      intra-urethral radiotransponder placed temporarily during each of the 5 radiotherapy
      treatments. The study aims to improve the risk-benefit ratio of therapy for early prostate
      cancer and potentially lessen symptom burden over time while also accessing early efficacy,
      late toxicity, and overall quality of life post-treatment. Patients will be followed for 24
      months (2 years) with follow-up appointments at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
