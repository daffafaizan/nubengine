      December 2013. There is no licensed specific therapy for the disease, which has a
      case-fatality rate of approximately 50-70%. Although anecdotal clinical data, recent studies
      in animal models, and in vitro screening suggest that treatment of EVD patients with
      anti-viral agents, immune modifying agents, and/or convalescent blood products may be
      effective, they have not been evaluated in clinical trials. This multi-arm clinical trial
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple regimens, both as mono-therapy and
      combination therapy. Provision of these regimens, if found effective and safe, would have a
      major impact on the current and future epidemics by providing effective treatment options.

      As described for previous adaptive trials, a randomization probability for each of the
      treatment regimens is created based on 14-day mortality, and is used for weighting
      randomization of subsequently enrolled participants. Participants will continually be
      preferentially assigned to regimens with better initial performance. New agents can be added
      or existing agents removed as the trial evolves.
