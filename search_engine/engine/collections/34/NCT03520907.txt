      technique in inguinal hernia repair surgery. However, this block provides limited analgesia
      during and after surgery, and the patients feel pain when walking. The transversalis fascia
      plane block (TFPB) is a recently developed technique and several case reports presented its
      efficacy for inguinal repair surgery in adult patients. It may block not only ilioinguinal
      and iliohypogastric nerves but also splanchnic nerves, which is conveyed via the
      thoracolumbar fascia. Therefore, we compare the effect of the TFPB and II/IH B on
      postoperative pain and walking form.
