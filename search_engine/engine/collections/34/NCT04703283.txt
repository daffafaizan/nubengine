      smartphone-based multi-component lifestyle medicine intervention for reducing insomnia
      symptoms in the Chinese population. Prior to all study procedures, eligible participants will
      be required to complete an online informed consent (with telephone support). Assuming an
      alpha error of 5%, a beta error rate of 20%, and a between-group effect size of 0.77 for the
      Insomnia Severity Scale (Ip et al., 2020), the final sample is 28 for both groups. With an
      estimation of 20% withdrawal, 70 eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either
      the smartphone-based multi-component lifestyle medicine intervention (LM group) or the
      waitlist control group (WL group) in a ratio of 1:1.
