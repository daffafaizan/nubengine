      adjuvant QS21 induces an antibody response against GM2 and cells expressing GM2 in disease
      free patients at high risk for recurrence of breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: GM2-KLH vaccine plus QS21 is administered subcutaneously to sites on the upper arm
      and upper leg at weekly intervals for 4 weeks. Two additional vaccines are administered at
      weeks 12 and 24. Patients are followed every 3 months after the sixth vaccination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
