      15 min after intrathecal injection. An near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensor (INVOSTM
      5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was attached to the
      patient's gastrocnemius muscle. A tourniquet (A.T.S Â® 3000 Automatic Tourniquet System;
      Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IL, USA) was applied to the thigh and inflated to a pressure value 50
      mmHg over the patient's baseline systolic blood pressure in the leg and maintained for 5 min.
      After a 5-min ischemic period, the tourniquet was rapidly deflated to 0 mmHg. The tissue
      oxygen saturation (StO2) data was continuously recorded during the VOT procedure. After
      confirmation of spinal anesthesia using cold sensitivity, the VOT procedure was repeated in
      the same manner as mentioned above. The occlusion slope and recovery slope were calculated
      based on the measured StO2 data. The occlusion slope was defined as the descending slope of
      StO2 value until it reached the minimum value. The recovery slope was calculated from the
      deflation of the tourniquet until the recovery of StO2 to the maximum value.
