      this Phase III study. The trial duration for each subject is about 6 months, with
      administration occurring once weekly. A Safety Follow-up Visit occurring 30 days from the
      date of final treatment with the Investigational Product will also occur. Each subject
      provides at least one pair of primary target wounds, with one wound from each pair being
      treated with B-VEC and the other wound with placebo. In addition to the primary target wound
      pair(s), additional wounds (secondary wounds) may be selected to be treated with B-VEC.
      Throughout the study, participants will complete questionnaires, have images captured of
      their study wounds, undergo physical exams, have vital signs and safety labs monitored.
