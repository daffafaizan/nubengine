      (PA) in Chinese patients with hypertension, we will conduct a case detection of PA in Chinese
      hypertensive patients from 10 centers of China (including Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai,
      Guangzhou, et al.); furthermore, a case confirmation of PA (captopril challenge test and
      saline infusion test) will be performed if the result of case detection is positive. This
      study will be completed in two years.
