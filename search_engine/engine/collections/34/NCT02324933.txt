      population which typically has both higher pain scores and more complications related to
      analgesics than opioid na√Øve patients. Currently, there is no standardized system for
      determining an adequate pain control regimen for a patient post-operatively. At this
      institution, pain medications are dosed per physician preference. The most widely-discussed
      method for calculating tolerance to opioids relies on converting a patient's daily opioid
      consumption to a morphine equivalent dose and basing a pain regimen upon that number. This
      method does not account for variability of response to different medications or dosing forms
      however. It would be advantageous to have a method of dosing opioid pain medications in this
      population that is both safe and effective.
