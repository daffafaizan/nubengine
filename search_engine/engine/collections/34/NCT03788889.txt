    
      The primary objective of this study is to compare phenobarbital and ketamine adjunctive
      therapies to lorazepam-based therapy in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

      It is hypothesized that the use of an alternative agent, either phenobarbital or ketamine,
      when used as an adjunct to symptom-triggered lorazepam therapy will significantly reduce the
      rate of intensive care unit admissions and thereby reduce the total cost associated with
      hospital admission for treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

      Enrolled patients will be admitted to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where they will be
      monitored with continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac telemetry. They will remain hospitalized
      while undergoing study-guided therapy in addition to supportive care for acute alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome. Patients will undergo standard of care therapy with lorazepam
      symptom-triggered therapy regardless of study participation.
