      (Madison, WI, USA) in preterm neonates admitted to a level III NICU from April 2018 to August
      2019. The primary study aim was to assess changes in RrSO2 with continuous renal NIRS
      monitoring to detect AKI during the first 7 days of age.

      The INVOS 5100 C (Somanetics, Troy, MI, USA) four channel NIRS monitors were used to measure
      RrSO2 (measured at the right or left flank) and Cerebral regional Somatic tissue Oxygenation
      (CrSO2; measured at the forehead) for all neonates. At each measurement site, for skin
      protection, subjects had a transparent Mepitel (with Safetac Technology, Norcross, GA)
      adhesive dressing placed with the adhesive neonatal NIRS sensor (INVOS OxyAlert NIRSensor,
      Covidien) adhered over the Mepitel dressing. Neither cerebral or kidney sensors were placed
      with ultrasound guidance. Tissue oxygenation was recorded every 3 seconds until 7 days of
      age, and the sensor was changed one time when the patient reached three to four days of age
      per the company's recommendation. There were no restrictions on positioning or handling of
      neonates; nurses re-positioned neonates every 3-6 hours per unit protocol to prevent skin
      pressure injuries. Researchers, staff, and parents were blinded to RrSO2 values.
