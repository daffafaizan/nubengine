      suffered. The prevalence is continuing to escalate with the increasingly elderly population.
      The risk of fragility fractures in elder over age 50 is approximately 50% in women and 20% in
      men.

      Current first-line medical therapy is bisphosphonates which alendronate is one of the most
      widely used. However, expenditure on medicines is one of the major problem of inadequate
      access to treatment. Generally, insurances and health care providers prefer physicians to
      prescribe generic instead of brand drug, due to its lower costs. However, clinical
      information on bone mineral density (BMD), fracture reduction and side effects with new
      generic alendronate is limited.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new generic
      alendronate (Bonmax®) comparing to brand alendronate (Fosamax®). The efficacy of generic
      alendronate will be determined by measuring the percent changes of bone mineral densities at
      lumbar spine and total hip after 1 year of treatment and then comparing to those changes in
      the brand alendronate group.
