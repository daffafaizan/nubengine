      sirolimus-eluting stent (CYPHERTM, Cordis, Warren, NJ, USA), paclitaxel-eluting stent
      (TAXUSTM, BostonScientific, Natick, MA, USA), and zotarolimus-eluting stent
      (Endeavor,Medtronic,Minneapolis, MN, USA) over bare metal stents (BMS) in reducing neointimal
      hyperplasia, late luminal loss, and angiographic restenosis leading to decreased target
      lesion revascularization.1-4 In addition, Among patients with off-label indications, the use
      of DESs reduced a rate of repeat revascularization without increasing the risk of death or
      myocardial infarction, as compared with bare-metal stents.5 But, compared with on-label use,
      off-label use of DESs is associated with a higher rate of adverse outcomes such as death,
      myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization. Furthermore, stent thrombosis (ST)
      occurred predominantly in patients who underwent off-label DES implantation.6 It is known
      that the risk of adverse cardiac events and ST after DES implantation is related to stent
      length.7 Cilostazol is a potent phosphodiesterase III inhibitor preventing the hydrolysis of
      cAMP in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cell. The novel mechanism of action of
      cilostazol reduces the number of circulating, partially activated, or preconditioned
      platelets, by reducing the surface expression of adhesive molecules in endothelial cells
      interacting with circulating platelets. The agent also directly inhibits platelet aggregation
      induced by a variety of stimuli, including arachidonic acid, ADP, collagen, thrombin, and
      high shear stress.8 In current guidelines, a 12-month duration of dual antiplatelet therapy
      with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended after DES implantation.9 But, recent
      meta-analyses showed a potential benefit of cilostazol in addition to dual antiplatelet
      therapy in reducing angiographic restenosis and improved clinical outcomes after BMS or DES
      implantation.10, 11 Actually, additional cilostazol to dual antiplatelet therapy showed
      reduced restenosis and late loss in patients with long coronary lesion and diabetes with
      multivessel coronary artery disease and it also showed beneficial effect on stent thrombosis
      after DES implantation.12-14 Although most studies showed no difference in bleeding according
      to additional cilostazol to dual antiplatelet therapy, the rate of early cessation of
      cilostazol due to adverse effect including headache, palpitation, skin rash and hepatic
      dysfunction was about 15%.12-14 Because of relatively higher side effect rate and no
      definitive duration of addition cilostazol use, we expect that cilostazol with short duration
      can be easily accepted to patient. Although almost studies about cilostazol after stent
      implantation used a 6- month duration of cilostazol, one study showed that use of cilostazol
      for 3 months after percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty reduced restenosis
      and revascularization, as compared with use of aspirin.15 So, we expect a 3-month use of
      additional cilostazol to dual antiplatelet therapy can reduce the adverse outcome and ST
      after stent implantation without increasing early cessation of cilostazol.

      The BioMatrixTM stent system (Biosensors Interventional Technologies Pte., Ltd, Singapore)
      consist of a stainless steel, quadrature-link design, balloon expandable S-StentTM, and a
      polylactic acid (PLA) polymer and BiolimusA9Â® coating mounted on a low-profile delivery
      catheter.16, 17 It is expected that abluminal biodegradable coating of BioMatrixTM stent can
      lead to more targeted drug release, reduced systemic exposure and early BMS-like endothelial
      coverage.18 The first-in-man, randomized controlled SEALTH I trial demonstrate higher
      efficacy of BioMatrixTM stent by showing lower late lumen loss and in-stent restenosis as
      compared with BMS, S-stent at 6-month follow-up.19 In LEADERS trial, BioMatrixTM stent showed
      similar efficacy and safety as compared with sirolimus-eluting stent in patients with chronic
      stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndromes.20 But significantly lower
      uncovered and malapposed struts was detected by optical coherence tomography study.21 This
      means more complete coverage of struts and we can expect lower late ST after BioMatrixTM
      stent implantation.
