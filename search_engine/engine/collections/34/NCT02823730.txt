      the incidence of major adverse cardiac events among a series of patients receiving the
      Synergy drug-eluting stent with bioabsorbable polymer to historical controls who have
      received the Promus Premier drug-eluting stent with durable polymer. The investigators
      hypothesize that the long-term incidence (each year following implantation, up to 4 years) of
      major adverse cardiovascular events, after propensity matching for stent type, will be
      similar between Synergy and Xience V.
