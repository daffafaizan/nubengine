    
      The investigators will study 50 consecutive patients diagnosed with CTEPH as well as 50
      patients diagnosed with acute PE in whom CTEPH was ruled out 2 years after the PE diagnosis
      by sequential echocardiography. The cases and controls will be matched based on the
      right-to-left ventrilcle diameter ratio.

      Three experienced thorax radiologists with specific expertise on acute PE and CTEPH will
      blindly assess the index CTPAs of the study population. In addition to the binominal
      judgement whether CTEPH signs are already present (or not), the presence of the following
      items will be scored by all 3 readers independently:

        -  Webs or bands

        -  Residual thrombus attached to the vascular wall

        -  Complete occlusion /retraction

        -  Mosaic perfusion

        -  Pulmonary infarct

        -  Parenchymal bands

        -  Bronchial arteries

        -  Right atrial (RA) dilatation

        -  Right ventricle (RV) dilatation

        -  Flattening of the septum

        -  Right ventricle (RV) hypertrophy

        -  Dilated truncus pulmonalis

        -  Cardiac signs of pulmonary hypertension (PH)
