    
      24 MCI or Alzheimer's Disease patients will be recruited and randomised; 12 of them will
      receive extra virgin olive oil "coratina" (EVOO-C); 12 of them will receive biophenol low
      dose olive oil (ROO). Each patient will consume a total amount of 10 mg olive oil in a year
      (12 months). Clinical assessement will be based on:

        -  neurological examination (T0, T6, T12);

        -  cardiological examination (T0, T12): a supra-aortic vessels and brachial artery
           ecocolordoppler will be performed;

        -  ophthalmological evaluation (T0, T12): a optic coherence tomography will be performed;

        -  neuropsychological assessment (T0, T12);

        -  nutritional assessement(T0, T3, T6, T9, T12).

      Each subject will perform:

        -  brain MRI (T0, T12);

        -  Beta Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (T0, T12) A lumbar puncture will be ruled as
           well (T0) and markers of neurodegeneration (Beta-amyloid 1 - 42, total tau protein,
           fosfo-tau, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurofilament (NFL) will be
           quantified); Renal, hepatic and nutritional status will be assessed 3 times in 12 months
           (T0, T6, T12).
