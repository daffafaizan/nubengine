      (affects up to 25% of patients) and negatively affects graft and patient outcome. The
      subtotal parathyroidectomy is the standard treatment, although currently has been replaced by
      the calcimimetic cinacalcet. Several studies guarantee that cinacalcet is effective in
      controlling hypercalcemia derived of persistent HPT after renal transplantation. However,
      maintenance treatment is need because hypercalcemia increases quickly after treatment is
      stopped. This fact makes increase a lot the cost of transplantation in these patients.

      The hypothesis of this study is that subtotal parathyroidectomy by minimally invasive surgery
      is superior to cinacalcet for treatment of persistent secondary HPT post renal transplant,
      with minimal morbidity and significantly reduces the cost of treatment after transplantation.
