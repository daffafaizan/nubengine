    
      In this study each participant will undergo 4 imaging sessions (one training session and 3
      study sessions) where participants will be asked to use the optical feedback display to
      regulate breathing patterns.

      The training session and each study session will proceed as follows:

        -  The patient receives standard treatment including any pre-treatment Cone Beam CT (CBCT)
           imaging.

        -  The patient is allowed to get up off the treatment couch and relax whilst the sensor
           device is turned on.

        -  The patient is set-up again.

        -  The patient is asked to free-breathe (i.e. breathe normally) and the surface motion is
           recorded using the optical sensor. The first 30 seconds are used to generate the
           reference surface used throughout the rest of the process. A 4D CBCT scan is acquired
           during free-breathing to assess tumour motion.

        -  The patient is then asked to control their breathing using the feedback displays and
           data is recorded for ~1:30 minutes in each case.

        -  A 4D CBCT scan will be acquired during controlled breathing with the traffic light
           feedback visualization scheme to assess tumour motion.
