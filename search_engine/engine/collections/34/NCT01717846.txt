      (RA) patient's cells. To date, no studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of
      Orencia on apoptosis in RA patients.

      Primary: To determine the effect of Abatacept in the apoptosis of T cells, B cells and
      antigen presenting cells (APC) in RA patients at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.

      Secondary: To evaluate the association between the changes in apoptosis to changes in disease
      activity measures (DAS28/ESR) over 6 months of treatment with subcutaneous injection of
      abatacept.
