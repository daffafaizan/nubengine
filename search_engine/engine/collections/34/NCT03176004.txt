    
      Approximately 600 youths between the ages of 11 and 14 and their parents will be assessed.
      Adolescents will be evaluated at baseline using event-related potentials, self-report, and
      interview-based measures. The error-related negativity will be evaluated immediately (it
      takes less than 5 minutes to process and score a single subjects' error-related negativity ),
      and adolescents with good error-related negativity data (~90%, based on scorable
      error-related negativity data) will be randomly assigned to either an 8-week (i.e., 16
      session) adaptive attention bias modification (N=180) or control condition (N=180) or a
      waitlist condition (N=180) group. Each session lasts 20 minutes, and participants will be
      asked to complete two 20-minute sessions per week. Participants will be assessed immediately
      at post, using the same measures from the baseline assessment. All participants will complete
      a 2-year follow-up lab visit using the same measures from the baseline assessment.
