    
      The study aims to investigate the acceptability, feasibility and limited efficacy of a
      discrete, easily accessed (mobile phone, tablet or computer) self-help intervention to
      support people to access cervical screening independently.

      The study will use a wait-list control design, with participants randomly allocated to
      receive access to the intervention immediately or after a six-week wait.

      The intervention will be in the form of a web app and will contain a range of
      psychoeducational material and practice exercises following a cognitive-behavioural and
      compassion-focused approach to understanding and coping with trauma, building self-compassion
      and increasing confidence in ability to attend and complete a screening.
