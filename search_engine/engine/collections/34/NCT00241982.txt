    
      A proof of concept, dose-escalating trial to study the safety of a single, intravenous
      administration of long-circulating liposomal prednisolone disodium phosphate in patients with
      active rheumatoid arthritis.

      Secondary goals: To compare the therapeutic effect of this intervention with that of a single
      intramuscular administration of 120 mg methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol, Pharmacia). The
      latter is commonly used in the clinics as bridging therapy. To assess the effect of these
      interventions at the synovial tissue level.

      On the longer term, the goal of liposomal corticosteroids is to achieve an increased
      efficacy/safety ratio compared to standard treatment with free corticosteroids.
