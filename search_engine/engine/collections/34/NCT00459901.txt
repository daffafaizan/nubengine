      year. Forty to fifty thousand people eventually will develop metastatic colorectal cancer and
      40,000 people die annually because of advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. Cancer
      patients prefer oral therapy over intravenous therapy as palliative treatment if efficacy
      regarding response rate and response duration is not compromised. Therefore, development of a
      completely oral combination therapy that approximates or improves upon the clinical outcomes
      attained by the reference triple drug therapies should be a research priority. Compared with
      intravenous 5-fluourouracil/leucovorin as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal
      cancer, oral capecitabine has demonstrated similar survival outcomes (approximately 12-13
      months), response rates (15-20%), and response durations (4-5 months) in two
      multi-institutional international randomized phase III trials. Erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva)
      is an orally available inhibitor of human EGFR tyrosine kinase. The epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers including colorectal cancer.
      The principal goal of anticancer treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib
      is to restore normal cellular growth by interrupting EGFR mediated cell proliferation and
      malignant The hypothesis of this phase II trial is that the unique mechanisms of action and
      non-overlapping toxicity profiles of capecitabine (Xeloda) and erlotinib will allow these
      drugs to be combined into a safe and tolerable regimen with better activity regarding
      response, response duration, and median survival than capecitabine alone in patients with
      previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer.
