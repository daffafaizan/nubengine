      or vomiting, and to stimulate appetite, especially in cancer patients. Both cannabinoids
      receptor 1(CB1) and cannabinoids receptor 2 (CB2) were highly expressed in cultured prostate
      cancer cells compared to normal prostate cell lines. CBD inhibits tumor growth in xenograft
      model.

      Clinicians have been challenged to improve the treatment of biochemically recurrent (BCR)
      prostate cancer in which prostatic specific antigen (PSA) rises without radiological or
      clinical progression years after localized treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiation
      therapy) with or without hormonal treatment. Approximately 50-90% of men with high-risk
      prostate cancer will experience a BCR. Based on the abovementioned preclinical observations
      of CBD's effect on prostate cancer and its safety data in two non-cancer populations, a phase
      I study of CBD in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer will be conducted.
