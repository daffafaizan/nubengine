      aspirin, the investigators plan to measure: i. maximum platelet aggregation to adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP) by Light Transmission Aggregometry (LTAmax), as a marker of on-clopidogrel
      treatment platelet reactivity ii. Malondialdehyde (MDA), as oxidative stress marker,
      Mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c and b-amyloid. blood levels.
