      Favipiravir and Hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for moderate and severe cases with
      COVID -19. Favipiravir which is a new type of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor
      has activity against influenza virus, and Hydroxychloroquine, an analogue of chloroquine, has
      a clinical safety profile better than that of chloroquine and allows higher daily dose,
      Chloroquine is a widely used antimalarial that was found to be a potential broad-spectrum
      antiviral.

      There is an urgent need to explore therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 in order to face the
      pandemic. The selected combination was based on limited evidence clinically and in vitro on
      the efficacy of the Favipiravir and Hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2. The two medications
      were listed in many guidelines as treatment options and ongoing trials assessing their
      efficacy and safety. Thus, the investigators want to prove the effectiveness of the
      combination as therapy.
