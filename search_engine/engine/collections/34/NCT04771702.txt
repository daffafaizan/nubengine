    
      Elective low-back surgery patients will be induced for general intubation anesthesia with
      propofol and remifentanil.

      After induction a 20 min period of stable propofol infusion only will be established before
      start of surgery. The patients will be monitored for exhaled propofol, plasma propofol (blood
      samples), continous frontal EEG, Bispectral Index (BIS), skin conductance, estimated
      (computer based) concentrations of plasma and effect site propofol, and skin conductance.

      After start of surgery (with ongoing propofol and restart of remifentanil TCI) the monitoring
      will continue in order to explore these relationships further.
