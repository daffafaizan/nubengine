    
      Study design: Multicenter observational cohort study, 5 tertiary teaching hospital emergency
      departments in Korea

      Study period: July 2018 to December 2023 (66 months)

      Study population: Traumatic brain injury patients aged over 18.

      Cases will be consecutive adult patients with EMS-treated traumatic brain injury and
      transport to the 5 emergency departments of participating hospitals within 72 hours after the
      trauma and confirmed cerebral hemorrhage or diffuse axial injury by radiological examination.
      A prospective traumatic brain injury patient cohort will be developed and all survived
      traumatic brain injury cases will be followed at 1-month and 6-month after ED discharge by
      telephone.

      During the study period, the investigators aim to recruit a total 1,200 cases (600 cases
      between July 2018 and June 2020, 600 cases between March 2021 and June 2023).

      Data collection: Following data will be collected

      Clinical data: Basic demographic and clinical outcomes will be retrieved from medical
      records.

      Survey data: Comorbidity, symptom, result of neurologic examination, socioeconomic status
      (occupation, income etc) data will be collected.

      Blood samples: The investigators aim to develop nutritional and metabolic biomarkers of
      traumatic brain injury. The investigators also plan to further develop traumatic brain injury
      biomarkers using proteomics.

      Follow-ups: All survived traumatic brain injury cases will be followed-up at 1-month and
      6-month after ED discharge and their survival, disability, and quality of life outcomes will
      be collected by telephone.

      Ethics Statements: All 5 hospitals participating in the study were IRB approved(Seoul
      National University Hospital(IRB No: 1806-078-951), SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center(IRB No:
