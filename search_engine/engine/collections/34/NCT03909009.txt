    
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study in
      two-arm parallel-group design. Twenty participants will be randomized into 2 groups.
      Randomization will be performed using computer-generated block randomization with 1:1
      allocation between the active rTMS group (Group 1) and the sham-control group (Group 2).
      Group 1 will receive high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (10hz-HF-rTMS)-A total 14 sessions of HF-rTMS, 10 sessions daily (5 days/week, 2 weeks) and 4
      sessions weekly (1 day/week, 4 weeks). Group 2 will receive sham stimulation-A total 14
      sessions of sham-rTMS, 10 sessions daily (5 days/week, 2 weeks) and 4 sessions weekly (1
      day/week, 4 weeks).All patients will be evaluated with pain severity (VAS-10mm),stiffness
      severity (VAS-10mm), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS),
      Hospital Depression Anxiety Scale (HADS), Addenbrook Cognitive Examination-revised version
      (ACE-R).Patients will be questioned for the safety of treatment. Available drug therapies
      will be continued in both groups. Patients and clinical raters will be blinded to treatment.
      All patients will be reviewed by the investigator in terms of rTMS treatment safety and motor
      threshold determination before each treatment session and observed for possible side effects
      after treatment. All side effects will be recorded. Magnetic stimulation will be applied
      using Neurosoft-Neuro MS/D with a figure-of-eight-shaped coil. rTMS therapy will be applied
      under the guide of neuronavigation with the following parameters: target-left DLPFC, with the
      %90 of the RMT, 10 Hz stimulation for 5 seconds intervals (on) with 25 seconds inter-train
      intervals (off), 15 minutes, 1500 pulses.
