      self-testing device to test whether the wetness is caused by amniotic fluid leakage or
      urinary incontinence. Clinical evaluation will be performed to all pregnant women using
      standard clinical tests. The results of the standard clinical tests will be compared to the
      women's reading of the self-testing device results. Sensitivity and specificity of the device
      evaluation will be calculated.
