      Primary

        -  To assess the response rate of sorafenib tosylate in combination with erlotinib
           hydrochloride in patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer refractory to 1
           or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the response duration in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the disease control rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To analyze biomarkers, including evaluation of EGFR expression, mutational analysis of
           EGFR and K-ras, and immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR downstream pathway
           (phospho-EGFR, phospho-AKT, phospho-Erk, phospho-STAT3).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily and oral sorafenib tosylate twice
      daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Tissue samples are analyzed at the nucleic acid level for EGFR mutation (exon 18-21) and
      K-ras mutation (exon 2), DNA mutations via PCR, presence of EGFR protein by IHC, and
      downstream effectors of EGFR activation by IHC.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
