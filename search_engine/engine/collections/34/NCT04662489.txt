      still remains suboptimal. Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins with radiofrequency
      ablation or cryoablation is the standard therapy when antiarrhythmic drugs or electrical
      cardioversion is not successful. However, recurrence after catheter ablation worsens in
      persistent and permanent atrial fibrillation patients. Recently, rotational activity
      electrogram patterns of self-sustained electrical activity found in the atria have been
      proposed as the responsible mechanism for the maintenance of atrial fibrillation. The
      investigators devised a controlled, multicentric, prospective, not blinded, and randomized
      clinical trial with the aim of comparing pulmonary vein catheter ablation versus radial
      ablation of sites exhibiting rotational activity in patients with persistent atrial
      fibrillation. Radial ablation consists of the ablation of the rotational activity sites and
      an additional ablation line connecting the rotation site with the circumferential ablation
      line of the pulmonary veins.
