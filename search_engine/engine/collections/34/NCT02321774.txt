      for individuals to better recognized their level of stress in any given situation on a
      continuous basis. A major focus of many of these wearable sensors is being able to accurately
      analyze and track heart rate variability (HRV), which is indicative of primarily
      parasympathetic/vagal tone and emotional state.3 However there is a need to validate the
      reliability of this measured response and understand any inter-individual variability.

      The present study will take advantage of virtual reality scenarios to expose healthy
      volunteers to controlled stressful situations during monitoring with several standardized
      lab-based non-invasive physiological sensors as well as a novel wrist band sensor device to
      track individual response to stress.
