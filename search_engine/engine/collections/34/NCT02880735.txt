      pattern whose prevalence is 1/8000 inhabitants and is the most common muscular dystrophy in
      adults. It is multisystem disease and is characterized by myotonia, progressive muscle loss
      and a wide spectrum of manifestations.

      Myotonic dystrophy type 1 causes a high impact on health and quality of life of patients as
      functional impairment can reach the incapacity and total dependence in basic activities of
      daily living. As in most neuromuscular diseases, progressive muscle weakness at some point in
      the evolution affects the respiratory muscles. However, in some patients with myotonic
      dystrophy type 1 it has been observed that muscle weakness does not explain ventilatory
      failure, and is believed to be due to a primary reduction in the central ventilatory response
      to hypercapnia present in this disease.

      Non Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (NIV) is a long-term treatment that provides ventilatory
      assistance through an interface that does not invade the airway and currently can be provided
      to patients in the home environment; It is a resource that has shown to improve the quality
      of life, daytime gas exchange and survival in patients with neuromuscular diseases, even when
      used only during sleep. It is not clear the mechanism by which NIV during daytime sleep
      improves gas exchange in patients with neuromuscular diseases, even in advanced stages where
      breathing muscles effectors are severely affected.

      It has been proposed that NIV used during sleep can improve the sensitivity of the
      respiratory center to carbon dioxide but this has not been demonstrated in patients with Type
      1 Myotonic Dystrophy, to answer this question, it is proposed to compare the central
      ventilatory response to chemical stimuli after a period of NIV in patients with Type 1
      Myotonic Dystrophy.
