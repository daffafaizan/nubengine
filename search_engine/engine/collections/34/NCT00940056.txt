    
      This is a randomized open controlled single centre study that involves 60 patients (men and
      women) over the age of 50 years with longstanding persistent AF of more than one year
      duration and in the absence of other severe cardiopulmonary disease. One of the participating
      investigators informs the patient, both verbally and in writing, about the study and what
      participation in the study involves. The patient will be given time to ask questions and to
      consider study participation and can be enrolled in the study after signing and dating
      written Informed Consent. Study duration per patient is 12 months.

      After inclusion, the patient will be divided into one of two groups, treatment group or
      control group, according to block wise randomization. The patient will be asked to complete
      two health related questionnaires SF 36 and SCL and a transthoracic echocardiography will be
      conducted together with an exercise test.

      The patients will thereafter be assessed according to randomisation. Irrespective of group,
      the patients will be rescheduled for a visit within two months for totally endoscopic
      ablation and Reveal implantation or just Reveal implantation (control group). All patients
      will then be assessed during follow-ups after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
