        1. Clinical evaluation: To investigate if patients treated with enhanced recovery have a
           shorter hospital stay and less morbidity than the patients treated conventionally. Other
           clinical questions witch might be answered in this study are clinical surgical stress
           response (insulin resistent), amount of analgetics used and time to normal activity.

        2. Evaluation of quality of life: Instruments used in this sudy to evaluate quality of life
           are 15 D and qualitative interview.

        3. Economic evaluation: Cost-utility analysis of the clinical studies

        4. Compare patients who received a fast track program with dedicated fast track- and stoma
           nurse specialist and special focus on counselling and stoma education, compared with
           patients receiving existing current practice of stoma-education in a traditional care
           pathway, could reduce the length of hospital stay, readmission and stoma related
           complications

        5. Further we will tray to generate additional insights into the impact of counselling when
           groups of patients are otherwise equal in terms of fast-track criteria. We are therefore
           continuing the enrolling of our colorectal patients in which both study arms contain the
           same ERAS items; the arms will only differ in terms of perioperative information and
           guidance as well as follow-up by dedicated nurses.
