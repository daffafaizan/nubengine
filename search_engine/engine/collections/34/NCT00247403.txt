      initial effort to potentiate the therapeutic effect of single dose stereotactic radiosurgery
      by combining a radiation sensitizing agent, 2DG, with radiosurgery in the treatment of
      intracranial metastases. Our preclinical studies indicate the degree of cancer cell
      radiosensitization using 2DG increases with increasing radiation dose. We therefore are
      interested to use 2DG with radiosurgery, since this technique allows for delivery of a large
      single dose of radiation.

      This trial seeks to determine the maximum tolerable one time dose of 2DG that can be
      delivered to subjects receiving stereotactic radiosurgery. We will also measure the
      physiologic effects of 2DG on glucose and reactive oxygen species metabolism.
