      preservation but it requires appropriate wash-in phase. The current wash-in protocols for
      sevoflurane are complicated and time consuming. The investigators propose a new 1-1-8
      sevoflurane wash-in protocol which is more simple and predictable.

      The objective of this study is to identify time to achieve alveolar concentration of
      sevoflurane at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5% with 1-1-8 wash-in protocol.

      All patients will receive iv propofol 2 mg/kg as induction agent and succinyl choline 1.5
      mg/kg for intubation. Then the ventilation will be controlled to achieve end-tidal CO2 30-35
      mmHg with O2:N2O or O2:air 1:1 L/min with sevoflurane 8%. Time to achieve alveolar
      concentration of sevoflurane at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5% will be recorded and analyzed.
      After that, the concentration of sevoflurane and anesthetic technique will be adjusted to
      requirement of anesthesiologist.
