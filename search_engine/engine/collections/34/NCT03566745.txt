      three children affected by idiopathic infantile nystagmus (IIN) and foveal hypoplasia, which
      follow an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of AhR gene. in this study we will:

        1. To determine whether the disease phenotype is the consequence of a decrease in or
           absence of AHR-induced AHH activity. To this end, basal and ligand-mediated AHH enzyme
           activity will be compared in heterozygotic and homozygotic family members versus healthy
           volunteers.

        2. To examine steady state protein levels of the AHR protein in cells of homo- and
           heterozygotic patients versus those of healthy volunteers. If no mutant protein is
           detected, we will determine the effect of the mutation on mRNA stability.

        3. To analyze steady state levels of related partner proteins (such as ANRT) and proteins
           levels of transcriptional targets (AHH) in heterozygotic and homozygotic family members
           versus healthy volunteers.

        4. To investigate the ability of the mutant allele to induce transcriptional activation in
           an engineered yeast test system. We will use a yeast strain engineered to contain human
           AHR and AHR nuclear translocator together with a reporter gene to investigate whether
           the mutation interferes with transcription activation.
