      healthy subjects and a MAD phase (Part B) which enrolled 2 cohorts of healthy subjects. Two
      additional cohorts A6 and A7, were added following dose escalation analysis.

      The planned optional Part C was to include a multiple-dose cohort of 25 subjects with
      suspected NASH and liver fibrosis (Cohort C1). However, Part C of the study was not performed
      as per Sponsor's decision.
