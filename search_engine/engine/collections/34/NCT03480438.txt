      cells resulting in T-cell activation and a cytotoxic T-cell response against CD19 expressing
      cells. In Phase II-III clinical trials 43-69 % of the patients treated with blinatumomab in
      relapsed/refractory ALL with poor prognostic features, achieved a complete hematologic
      remission and around 80 % of these obtained a molecular remission as well. Blinatumomab thus
      has demonstrated significant antileukemic activity in relapsed/refractory adult ALL. The
      ultimate goal for optimised management of adult ALL is to integrate targeted compounds with
      known single-drug activity into first-line treatment.
