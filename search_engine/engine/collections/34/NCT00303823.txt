      I. Assess the effect of green tea extract (Polyphenon E®) in patients with human
      papillomavirus (HPV) expression and low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1) in a
      pre- and post-treatment setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the toxicity of green tea extract vs placebo among patients with CIN 1.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the utility of karyometry as an intermediate endpoint biomarker for cervical
      chemoprevention studies.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral green tea extract (Polyphenon E®) once daily for 16 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 16 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 weeks.
