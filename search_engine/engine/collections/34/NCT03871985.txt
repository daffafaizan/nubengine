      ventilation. Many studies have shown that the accumulation of subglottic secretions above the
      endotracheal cuff plays an important role in the pathogenesis of VAP. Subglottic secretion
      drainage (SSD) has been shown to be associated with a lower incidence of VAP in previous
      meta-analyses. Most studies in past reported that in the group of patients in whom
      endotracheal tube (ETT) was used and subglottic secretion drainage was applied compared to
      the group without subglottic secretion drainage.Very few studies compared two different
      methods of SSD,such as subglottic secretion lavage combined with aspiration or pure
      aspiration.The tubes need frequent cleaning as they often get blocked, especially the
      draining duct. This may be the reason why they are not commonly applied. However,subglottic
      secretion lavage combined with aspiration can reduce the incidence of tube blockage.So The
      purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of intermittent subglottic secretion
      lavage combined with aspiration preventing ventilator associated pneumonia in patients with
      severe neurological disease.
