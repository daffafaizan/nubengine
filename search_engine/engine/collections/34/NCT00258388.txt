      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy, in terms of prostate-specific antigen response, of docetaxel and
           prednisone with or without OGX-011 in patients with hormone-refractory locally recurrent
           or metastatic prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the objective response rate and duration in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a loading dose of OGX-011 IV over 2 hours on days -7, -5, and
           -3. Patients then receive OGX-011 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15, docetaxel IV
           over 1 hour on day 1, and oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
           every 3 weeks for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral prednisone twice
           daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 10 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
