      coronary artery diseases (CAD). However, several limitations made these facial risk factors
      hard to be utilized in clinical practice, including 1) low prevalence in CAD patients, 2)
      lack of specific definition, 3) poor reproducibility in artificial recognition.

      Thus, we designed a case-control study to explore new, common and well-defined facial
      characteristics associated with CAD and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of appearence
      factors in CAD. We will recuit 1150 patients with at least one coronary lesion stenosis ≥50%
      according to coronary angiography or coronary computer tomography (CAD group) and 1150
      patients without coronary lesion stenosis≥ 50% (No CAD group) judged by coronary angiography
      or coronary computer tomography. We will collect patients' baseline information and facial
      images. One hand, we will explore the facial factors associated with CAD by comparing the
      exposure rates of different facial factors in CAD group and No CAD group based on artificial
      intelligence technology. On the other hand, we will build a CAD risk model based on facial
      factors, and evaluate the diagnostic effect of the model.
