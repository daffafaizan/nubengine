      with stage III or IV ovarian epithelial, tubal, or peritoneal adenocarcinoma treated with
      OvaRex monoclonal antibody B43.13 OR placebo following complete clinical response to primary
      therapy. II. Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess the immune
      response of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients undergo a laparotomy and platinum based
      chemotherapy prior to randomization. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I:
      Patients receive OvaRex monoclonal antibody B43.13 IV on day 0. Treatment continues at 4, 8,
      20, 32, 44, and 56 weeks, and then every 3 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive placebo IV on day 0. Placebo administration
      continues on the same schedule as in arm I. Patients presenting with relapse are provided
      with second line chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at the beginning of the study,
      after 2 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
