    
      Children with dynamic clubfoot recurrence after initial Ponseti treatment who underwent TATT
      between 2014 and 2017 are considered for this study. Exclusion criteria are neurological
      disease, split transfer of the tendon, additional bone or joint invasive surgery, and initial
      treatment abroad.

      Gait analysis, including the Oxford foot model, will be conducted, and the kinematic and
      kinetic data of the lower extremity will be compared with a group of age-matched healthy
      children. To comprise a control group for the purpose of collecting gait analysis data of
      healthy children, employees of our hospital are asked to allow their children to participate
      in this study.

      Patients will undergo gait analysis, including video recordings with a Vicon motion capture
      system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) with kinetic data collected from three AMTI force plates (Advanced
      Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA). Placement of markers will be a combination of
      Cleveland (lower extremity), PlugInGait (upper body), and Oxford Foot (movement within the
      foot) models.
