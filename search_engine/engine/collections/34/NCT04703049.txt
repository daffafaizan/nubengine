      elective procedure, ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and non-STEMI were
      prospectively included. Before the procedure, we calculated WBV using the formula [(0.12 ×
      hematocrit) + (0.17 × (total protein - 2.07)]. We defined CIN as the absolute (≥0.5 mg/dl) or
      relative increase (≥25%) in serum creatinine 48-72 h after exposure to a contrast agent
      compared with baseline serum creatinine values.
