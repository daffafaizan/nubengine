      of bodily self-awareness which hinder the recovery process. Mind-body researchers have
      examined alternative therapeutic approaches to eliminating these factors. This study will
      compare a standardized therapeutic message to body-oriented therapy which involves a
      combination of hands-on bodywork and verbal therapy focused on somatic and emotional
      awareness.
