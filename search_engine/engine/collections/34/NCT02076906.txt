    
      Magnetic Resonance (MR)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an innovative
      technique that allows for non-invasive thermal ablation of tissue. Advantages over
      conventional local tumor control such as surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency are that
      MR-HIFU is completely non-invasive, non-ionizing, and enables ablation of large tumor volumes
      with avoidance of adjacent tissue injury. This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of MR-HIFU ablative therapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with refractory or
      relapsed solid tumors that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone.
      Patients â‰¤ 30 years of age with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with measurable target
      lesions that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone are eligible.
      Tolerability will be defined during the 14 days following MR-HIFU ablation. Patients will
      continue to be followed for tumor response and secondary outcomes for up to one year post
      ablation treatment.
