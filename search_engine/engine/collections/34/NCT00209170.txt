    
      To determine the psychobehavioral and neurohormonal mechanisms of effective treatment, the
      investigator will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients
      with major depression, who will receive either: (i) computer-based cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) program entitled "Beating the Blues" + placebo, or (ii) computer-based
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program entitled "Beating the Blues" + the SSRI
      antidepressant escitalopram. The investigator will assess (a) glycemic control (levels of
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)), in relation to (b) adherence (keeping scheduled return
      appointments, diet, exercise, and glucose monitoring), (c) depressive symptoms
      (neurocognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms determined by self- and observer-rated scales),
      and (d) the four pathways of neurometabolic function.

      Study visits will occur once a month for 6 months. Should patients report severe
      environmental stressors (such as marital conflict, loss of family member or job, being
      exposed to trauma), patients will be offered an intensification of their contact with study
      personnel, e.g. weekly contact by phone or "in-person" visits to see study personnel at the
      Grady Diabetes Clinic.
