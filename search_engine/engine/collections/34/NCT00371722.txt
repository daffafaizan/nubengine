      antibiotics, the disease process is still quite ubiquitous in many patient populations. The
      incidence of appendicitis in women over 20 and under 50 years of age is significant. The
      annual incidence of appendicitis in women aged 17 to 64 years of age is 1.9 per 1000. In the
      population aged 15 to 19 years of age, the risk of developing appendicitis is 1 in 99 in each
      year of this 4-year period. Diagnosing appendicitis in pregnancy poses a great challenge for
      the obstetrician because the appendix is displaced during pregnancy, nausea is common in
      pregnancy, direct abdominal signs are variable as well. The incidence of proven appendicitis
      approximates 1 in 1500 deliveries. Maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity are increased
      when appendicitis is associated with pregnancy, and the risks rise significantly if
      perforation and peritonitis occur. Fetal loss, which is between 10 and 20% in most reports,
      is mainly due to preterm labor or intrauterine death, particularly when perforation occurs.
      There are three main reasons to perform an incidental appendectomy (at the time of cesarean
      section): To reduce future mortality and morbidity from appendicitis in women of childbearing
      age; to eliminate undiagnosed incidental pathology in the appendix; and to eliminate the
      appendix from diagnostic consideration when the patient presents with abdominal or pelvic
      complaints. There will be 100 subjects taking part in the study. Standard post operative care
      will be administered with the only difference in the two groups being the operative procedure
      (appendectomy or no appendectomy).
