      screened and the informed consent was signed. After hysteroscopy, the collagen/umbilical cord
      mesenchymal stem cell was spread on a foley catheter, and placed in the uterine cavity, and 5
      ml of saline was filled into the balloon. B-ultrasound confirmed that the stent was attached
      to the uterine wall. The balloon was removed in situ after 1 week. We mainly compare the
      endometrial thickness before and 6 months after surgery.
