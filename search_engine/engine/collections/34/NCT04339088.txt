      for monitoring. The high-intensity ultrasound beam is focused on the vein through a
      magnifying glass. As thermal energy is delivered, the thermocoagulation property of
      ultrasound energy affects the vein wall, causing shrinking and collapsing of the target vein.
      Thus creating a fibrotic seal and occluding the vessel. The treated vein is immediately
      closed after the procedure, and its diameter will continuously reduce over time, becoming a
      fibrotic chord. The treatment along the vein is steered automatically via a touch screen
      monitor. In-beam linear ultrasound probe allows visualisation of the vein in real-time and
      insures optimal accuracy. The study involves prospective data collection of 30 patients that
      will be undergoing HIFU as choice of treatment for their varicose veins / CVI. Questionnaires
      will be conducted at 5 timepoints - baseline before procedure, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
      and 12 months. Subjects will be seen at outpatient clinic post-procedure. Besides
      questionnaires, physical examination and duplex ultrasound scan will be conducted at 2 weeks,
      3 months, 6 months and 12 months to ensure occlusion of treated vein.
