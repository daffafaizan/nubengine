      months following surgery. The primary outcome was change in physical function from baseline
      to 1-year following surgery in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the Veterans-Rand
      (VR-12) Survey. Preoperative measures were: (1) general demographics (patient age, sex,
      height, weight, body mass index (BMI); (2) treatments tried before surgery; (3) health habits
      (tobacco use, alcohol use); (4) pre-existing medical conditions (Charlson score); (5)
      physical exam findings (knee range of motion, knee laxity); (7) lab tests (hemoglobin); and
      (7) radiographic measures (severity of osteoarthritis on standing x-rays). Secondary outcomes
      included Physical Score (PS) of the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System
      Global Survey (PROMIS-10), knee function (Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS), safety
      (reoperations, readmissions, emergency visits, and infection) and measures of patient
      experience (Clinician Group and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and
      Systems).
