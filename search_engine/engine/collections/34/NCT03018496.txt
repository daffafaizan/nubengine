      or quickly a person can run/cycle/swim and also in how well their blood vessels work.
      Additionally a person's metabolic fitness decreases; this is how well the body copes with
      nutrition and is why, for example, older people have a higher risk of diseases like type 2
      diabetes. Previous studies have shown that as people become less fit, they are at increased
      risk of suffering a complication whilst undergoing surgery. It has also been shown that
      measuring how fit someone is, is better at predicting the risk of a surgical complication
      than purely using a person's age alone. Lots of research has shown that exercise can
      potentially reverse some of the age-related declines in fitness, however most has used long
      sessions of continuous exercise over a long period of time. High-intensity interval training
      (HIT), whereby people cycle on an exercise bike very hard for a minute, followed by a short
      rest, repeated over the course of 15 minutes can rapidly improve a person's fitness. However
      not everyone will be able to, or indeed want to participate in exercise this strenuous;
      therefore this research seeks to explore whether other options, such as dietary supplements
      can improve aspects of fitness

      This study intends to examine the effect of giving a dietary supplement on the way a person's
      body handles the glucose (from carbohydrates/ sugars) in a meal. Previous work has shown that
      taking a beta-hydroxy beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) supplement may improve may improve a
      patient's response to glucose, however the evidence is not clear. HMB is a commercially
      available nutritional supplement providing a compound that the body produces each time
      protein is consumed, and is most commonly used by bodybuilders to help gain muscle.
