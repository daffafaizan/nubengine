      target desmosomal proteins to produce intraepithelial, and mucocutaneous blisters. It is
      potentially fatal and the average mortality of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) was 75% before the
      introduction of corticosteroids in the early 1950s.

      Traditionally, treatment of pemphigus included high dose systemic corticosteroids with or
      without adjuvant immunosuppressants. However; the prolonged use of high dose steroids carries
      significant side effects. A recent randomized trial has proved the efficacy of Rituximab, a
      monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody against B-lymphocytes, as an efficacious therapy for pemphigus.
      Furthermore, early use of rituximab was associated with associated with better clinical
      outcomes. Moreover, combination treatment of rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG)
      has shown to be effective for refractory pemphigus cases and can potentially induce long-term
      complete remission and lower risks infectious complications.

      Cost effectiveness is an important issue and while combination of IVIG and rituximab has been
      advocated, the cost of such treatment is substantial and whether it poses any benefit over
      rituximab alone, or with other more conventional immunosuppressive agents, has not been
      established. Both treatment approaches have been previously published in high impact
      journals.

      In this study, investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early use of
      rituximab with or without IVIG in patients with moderate to severe pemphigus using protocols
      that were similar to those previously published. Apart from complete remission and adverse
      effects, investigators will also aim to measure the impact of health care economics and in
      doing so, assess the cost and benefits of both treatment arms.
