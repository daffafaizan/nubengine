      (PTNS) for Overactive Bladder study. After signing the informed consent and completing the
      screening visit, eligible candidates will be asked to (1) stop any OAB medications (including
      but not limited to anti-muscarinic medication or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) as well as
      stabilize dosage and frequency of any concomitant medications for 3 weeks, if applicable, and
      then (2) complete a daily Patient Voiding Diary for 7 days .

      Subjects will then return to the office for baseline review. If all screening and baseline
      criteria are met, the subject will be enrolled, randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the
      "control group" or the "investigational group" and scheduled for implant with the StimRouter
      device.

      After approximately 3 weeks for healing post-implant, study participants will be programmed
      according to their randomization assignment. All subjects will be instructed to apply
      stimulation at least 3 days/week for at least 30 minutes/day (i.e., the minimum protocol
      requirements for device use) for 6 months and to apply stimulation when they anticipate OAB
      events. Patient Voiding Diaries will be completed by the participants for 7 days prior to
      each follow-up visit and provided to the office at each follow-up visit. Follow-up visits
      will occur at Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 5 and Month 6. Each follow-up visit will
      include the review of subject voiding diaries and the completion of other subject
      questionnaires for measuring OAB and quality of life assessments. Final follow-up evaluations
      for all subjects will occur at Month 6.
