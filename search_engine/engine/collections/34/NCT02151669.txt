      smokers from 35 to 70 years without history of lung disease. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to control or intervention group (1:1).

      Study variables: We measure socio-demographic, clinical, anthropometry and spirometry data.
      Food consumption will be evaluated by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ),
      energy expenditure in physical activity by the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity questionnaire
      and adherence to Mediterranean Diet by a 14-item questionnaire.

      Intervention: Nutritional intervention conducted by a dietitian who designs a nutrition
      program to enhance the traditional Mediterranean diet pattern using new technology as an
      educational tool in primary care: DIET blog. Participants will be referred to a single annual
      visit and one group session per year for two years.

      Analysis: All analyses will be based on intention-to-treat. The results will be considered
      clinically relevant when it detects a difference in lung function (decreased FEV1) >10-12
      ml/year. A p-value of <0.05 will defined statistical significance.
