      perform three shuttle walk tests on three consecutive days (see below). While performing
      those tests, the patient's prescribed oxygen flow rate is applicated either through the
      conventional nasal cannula (CNC) or the Oxymizer.On the first day, patients perform an
      incremental shuttle walk test to determine maximum walking speed using a conventional nasal
      cannula.

      On two consecutive days, patients will perform two endurance shuttle walk tests at 85% of the
      maximum incremental shuttle walk test speed. Supplemental oxygen will be provided via nasal
      cannula at the prescribed oxygen flow rate. Patients will be randomly assigned to perform one
      test with the Oxymizer and the other one with a conventional nasal cannula.
