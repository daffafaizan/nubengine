        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of bavituximab administered as multiple
           intravenous (IV) infusions to patients co-infected with HCV and HIV

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile and viral kinetics after multiple
           intravenous infusions of bavituximab to patients infected with HCV and HIV

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum effective dose (MED) of
           bavituximab administered as multiple infusions to patients infected with chronic HCV
           infection and HIV
