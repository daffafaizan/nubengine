    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity of EGFRvIII peptide vaccine with sargramostim (GM-CSF) or keyhole
           limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as adjuvant in patients with EGFRvIII-expressing cancer.

        -  Determine the preexisting antibody and T-cell responses to EGFRvIII in these patients.

        -  Determine the antibody and T-cell responses to EGFRvIII peptide after immunization with
           this vaccine with GM-CSF or KLH as adjuvant.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a vaccine containing EGFRvIII peptide admixed with sargramostim
           (GM-CSF) intradermally monthly.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a vaccine containing EGFRvIII peptide admixed with keyhole
           limpet hemocyanin subcutaneously monthly.

      Treatment in both arms continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients (12 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
