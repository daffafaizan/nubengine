    
      The EASE Clinical Trial a prospective, multi-center, single-arm (open-label), non-randomized,
      clinical trial of the safety and effectiveness of endometrial ablation with the Minitouch
      System versus the FDA identified objective performance criteria (OPC) for global endometrial
      ablation (GEA) devices. The goal of the trial is to support reasonable safety and
      effectiveness of the investigational product compared to currently FDA-approved GEA devices.

      Only eligible participants will undergo the Minitouch procedure. Post-treatment follow-up
      occurs approximately 24-hours post-procedure (via phone call) and in-person office visits
      occur 2-weeks, 3, 6 and 12-months post-procedure. Additional longer term follow-ups occur
      (via phone call or in-person office visits) 24 and 36-months post-procedure. The expected
      length of participation is approximately 37 months (inclusive of one month for screening and
      36-months of post-procedure follow-up).
