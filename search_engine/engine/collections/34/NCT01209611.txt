      expansion has won wide attention in recent years as it promotes skin regeneration with
      perfectly matched tissue. However, some patients with poor skin regenerative ability would
      suffer from skin flap over-thinned and even necrosis under the continuous stretching by
      silicone expander. Although, on some occasions, decelerating the expander inflation process
      could reduce the incidence of necrosis, this prolonged therapy circle is to be accompanied
      with increased complications, including infection and expander rupture, as well as the
      increased economic expenses by the longer hospitalization. This study is to observe the
      effects of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation on accelerating skin
      regeneration and promoting tissue expansion process.

      Patients aged between 18 to 60 years old who appear with deteriorated expanded skin will be
      enrolled and randomized into two groups, named as the experimental group and the control
      group. Patients from the experimental group will have a bone marrow aspiration and
      intradermal mononuclear cells transplantation. On the other side, Patients from the control
      group will have saline injection.
