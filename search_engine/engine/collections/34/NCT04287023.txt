      cardiovascular warm-up activities, stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, functional,
      gait and balance training, recreational games and ended with relaxation exercises. In
      addition, the group protocol will follow the exact same pattern, except for 5-10 minute
      breaks for informal socialization between participants, at the beginning of the session,
      mid-session and at the end of the session.

      Also, both groups will have access to external cues, which will be applied during a variety
      of tasks and environmental situations, like gait initiation and termination, heel strike and
      push-off, sideways and backwards stepping, walking while dual tasking, and walking over
      various surfaces and long distances.

      All patients will be evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the physical therapy
      program. The evaluation includes the 6-minute walking test and the 10-meter walking test.
      Gait speed for each participant will be calculated as the ratio between the walked distance
      and the time unit, and it was measured in meters/seconds.
