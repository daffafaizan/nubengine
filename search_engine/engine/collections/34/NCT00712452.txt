      chemotherapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (Group 1), breast cancer (Group 2) or Hodgkin
      disease (Group 3)to evaluate the clinical and biological markers of ovarian reserve. The
      follow-up will last 24 months for each patients with a visit before treatment, and at 3
      months, 6 months, one year and two years after treatment.

      During this period, we will collect pre and post treatment clinical data,and biological data
      and ultrasonographic data such as antral follicle count which is a marker of ovarian follicle
      reserve.These data were not observed in current practice.
