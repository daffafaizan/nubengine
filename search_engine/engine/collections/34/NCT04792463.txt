    
      BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein-1), is a deubiquitinating enzyme with a ubiquitin
      carboxy-terminal hydrolase function that has been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene
      with a role in cell proliferation and growth inhibition. Recently germline mutations in BAP1
      have been identified by our group and others in families with hereditary cancers. However,
      the clinical spectrum of cancers in patients with germline BAP1 is still not clear. The
      association of germline BAP1 mutations with increased risks for uveal melanoma (UM),
      mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma (CM), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and BAP1-inactivated
      melanocytic tumors is fairly well established. However, several other cancers have been
      reported in these patients and their family members including cholangiocarcinoma,
      hepatocellular carcinoma, meningioma, basal cell carcinoma and other internal malignancies.
      Identification of the clinical phenotype of BAP1-TPDS is important for proper counseling and
      management of patients.
