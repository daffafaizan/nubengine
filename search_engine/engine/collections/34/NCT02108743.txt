      limitation, and exercise dyspnea. While not all patients with iPAH demonstrate airway
      involvement, those who demonstrate dynamic hyperinflation (DH), defined as a variable and
      temporary increase in end-expiratory lung volume, report increased dyspnea with exertion on
      maximal testing. There is a continued need for adjuvant therapy in iPAH, and bronchodilators
      have the potential to ameliorate dyspnea during exercise, which could lead to improved
      quality of life in this disabling condition. This study will investigate the presence of
      airway involvement in this population as measured by dynamic hyperinflation, and if there is
      any improvement in function with the use of inhaled albuterol.
