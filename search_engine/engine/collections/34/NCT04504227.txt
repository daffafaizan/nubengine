      (BRUE) are a significant driver of pediatric health care expenditure since the mechanism for
      their swallow dysfunction is incompletely understood and therefore frequently goes
      unrecognized and untreated. We hypothesize that infants with oropharyngeal dysphagia and BRUE
      have measurable differences in swallowing physiology to explain their symptoms of cyanotic
      choking spells, that these differences can be quantified using pharyngeal high resolution
      impedance-manometry compared to videofluoroscopic swallow study results, and that this
      swallowing dysfunction can be safely corrected with a change of formula viscosity. Through
      this research project, we will systematically investigate the effects of thickened feedings
      on swallow function in infants with dysphagia and BRUE and perform detailed physiology
      studies on pharyngeal and esophageal motility as critical mediators of improved outcomes.
