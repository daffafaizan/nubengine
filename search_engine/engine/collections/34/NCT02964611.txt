      Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration
      (FTLD), which includes Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS) and
      Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD - behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, progressive
      non-fluent aphasia and semantic dementia), and the effect of these changes on the patients'
      relationship with their caregivers. In addition, the study aims to provide a greater clarity
      in the neuroanatomical correlates of social cognition in patients with FTLD, PD and AD.
