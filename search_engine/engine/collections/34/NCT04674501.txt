      heart. Cardiotoxicity may occur in some patients several years after radiotherapy due to the
      late effect of radiation. Considering that cardiotoxicity is often lethal, screening and
      preventing radiation-induced cardiotoxicity is crucial in patients receiving thoracic
      irradiation.

      Patients in this cohort will undergo cardiac evaluation before and after thoracic
      irradiation. The dose-volume parameters for each cardiac substructures will be estimated
      using artificial intelligence-based auto-segmentation of the heart in CT images. Dose-volume
      parameters that predict cardiotoxicity will be analyzed. Among the patients who developed
      cardiotoxicity, blood sampling will be performed to establish cardiomyocytes derived from
      induced pluripotent stem cells, which will be used for identifying the mechanisms of
      radiation-induced cardiotoxicity and therapeutic targets.
