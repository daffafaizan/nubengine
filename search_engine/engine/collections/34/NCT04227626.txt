    
      Our envisioned end product is an in-patient automated closed-loop control system for PG
      regulation in the ICU as well as on the general hospital wards. In order to qualify the
      system for the broad spectrum of challenges it will face in the inpatient setting, this study
      will test the ability of the new integrated configuration of the system (the GlucoSTAT) to
      control PG in subjects with extremes of insulin sensitivity. The first goal of this study is
      to test the safety and efficacy of the control system in insulin sensitive subjects with type
      1 diabetes. The second goal of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the control
      system in subjects with type 2 diabetes and substantial insulin resistance (TDD > 0.75
      u/kg/day, with up to 3 subjects with a TDD > 2 u/kg/day).
