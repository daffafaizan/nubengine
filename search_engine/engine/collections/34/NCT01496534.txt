    
      This is a phase Ib study of dovitinib given in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin or
      carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will utilize standard 3+3 dose
      escalation rules to define the recommended phase II dose. Dose escalation will proceed
      independently in the two cohorts (cisplatin cohort: gemcitabine + cisplatin + dovitinib;
      carboplatin cohort: gemcitabine + carboplatin + dovitinib). Patients will receive treatment
      for up to 6 cycles, in the absence of toxicity, until disease progression

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the recommended phase II dose of dovitinib given in combination with gemcitabine
      plus cisplatin or carboplatin.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the response rate to treatment as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
           Tumors (RECIST)

        -  To determine the toxicity of treatment at per the Common Terminology for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE v4)

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of dovitinib in combination with gemcitabine plus
           cisplatin or carboplatin.
