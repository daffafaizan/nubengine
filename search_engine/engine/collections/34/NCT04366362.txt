      reconstruction is customized based on each patient's special characteristics. Preoperative
      and intraoperative evaluation of the native ACL (both anteromedial and posterolateral
      bundles), knee anatomy and function, level of activity and generalised ligamentous laxity are
      assessed. Femoral and tibial tunnels should be placed in their anatomical location accounting
      for both the native ACL insertion site and bony landmarks. Two groups will be created, one
      with patients undergoing ACL reconstruction based on a surgeon's experience and one based on
      a more individualised approach according to the particular characteristics of each patient
      separately. In addition, patients in the second group will undergo ACL reconstruction with
      the use of Computer Assisted System (Navigation).

      Preoperatively and postoperatively, the patients will be assessed with the KT2000 system, the
      KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome), the Tegner- Lysholm Knee scoring system and
      the IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee). Additionally, all patient will be
      examined for their knee function with the use of a 3D gait analysis system.

      The follow-up examination will take place 6 and 12 months after the surgery.
