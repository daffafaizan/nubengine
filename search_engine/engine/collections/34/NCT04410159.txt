      After consent is taken, all groups will be briefed regarding the study protocol separately.

        -  Group A will be briefed on the correct procedures of gargling with Betadine®. The
           participants will be instructed to take 10ml of povidone-iodine (PVP-I), tilt their
           heads backward and gargle for 30 seconds, three times per day for 7 days

        -  Group B will be briefed on the correct technique of gargling with Listerine®. The
           participants will be instructed to take 20ml of essential oils, tilt their heads
           backward and gargle for 30 seconds, three times per day for 7 days

        -  Group C will be briefed on the correct technique of gargling with hydrogen peroxide. The
           participants will be instructed to take 10ml of hydrogen peroxide, tilt their heads
           backward and gargle for 30 seconds, three times per day for 7 days

        -  Group D will be briefed about the involvement in this study. They will be managed
           according to the standard protocol of the hospital with no additional intervention.

      Monitoring

        1. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs will be taken on day 4, 6 of intervention, and
           day 12 post-intervention. The swabs will be subjected to detection of SARS-CoV-2 by
           real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt RT-PCR).

        2. Patients will be given a chart for them to record their gargling practice and symptoms
           (if any) during the intervention period ( 7 days)

        3. Clinical data collection sheet will be provided to attending clinicians. The required
           information includes demographic data, daily vital signs, serial absolute lymphocytic
           count, LDH, chest radiograph, and symptoms. Clinical monitoring will be done until day
           14 of the intervention.
