      impairment, including in its nascent stages, during a putatively prodromal or clinical high
      risk period. These cognitive deficits have proven relatively refractory to pharmacologic
      strategies, though the deficits can be improved with cognitive remediation programs in
      schizophrenia. The cognitive gains can then generalize to functional improvement,
      particularly early in the course of illness (i.e. first episode psychosis). Although
      processing speed deficits are also prevalent in young people identified as at clinical high
      risk for psychosis (i.e. "psychosis risk syndrome"), and related to their concurrent impaired
      function and predictive of later psychosis (onset of which occurs in 20-25% of clinical high
      risk cohorts), little research has focused on how to remediate these deficits in clinical
      high risk patients. Remediating core cognitive deficits in clinical high risk patients could
      plausibly address present functional impairment in these young people and moderate illness
      progression. The investigators propose to conduct a double-blind randomized trial in 105
      clinical high risk patients to examine a focal processing speed training program versus an
      active control in terms of improvement in processing speed and social function, and reduction
      in prodromal symptom severity.
