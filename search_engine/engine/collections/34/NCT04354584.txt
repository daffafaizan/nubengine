      currently unknown, but may be related to a distinct local immune response within the lung. In
      the present study, we will examine the cellular and humoral pulmonary immune response in
      mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 by examining immune cell
      profiles, cytokine patterns, and the complement pathway in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and
      relate it to the concomitant systemic inflammatory response. We will examine the patients on
      day 1-3 and 7-9 after ICU admission.
