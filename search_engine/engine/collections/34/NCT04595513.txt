    
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is caused by genetic mutation in TSC1 or TSC2, resulting in
      dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Age at time of
      seizure onset in TSC infants has been linked to long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in this
      high-risk population. TAVT-18 is a novel formulation of sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor. This
      will be the first study to truly evaluate a targeted, disease-modifying drug therapy for
      preventing or delaying seizure onset in TSC using a rational, mechanism-based therapeutic
      approach.
