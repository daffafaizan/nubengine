    
      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to determine if pre-operative transversus
      abdominis plane (TAP) blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic post-operatively
      affect post-operative narcotic usage as compared to a placebo TAP block.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect post-operative pain scores as compared to a placebo TAP block.

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect anti-emetic usage as compared to a placebo TAP block.

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect time to ambulation post-operatively as compared to a placebo TAP
           block.

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect time to first bowel movement as compared to a placebo TAP block.

        -  To determine if pre-operative TAP blocks with continued infusion of local anesthetic
           post-operatively affect patient-reported quality of life as compared to a placebo TAP
           block.
