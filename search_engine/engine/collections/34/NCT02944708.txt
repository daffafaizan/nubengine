    
      This is a phase 3 randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of maintenance
      chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic chemotherapy and how it should be delivered.
      Participants will be randomized to 3 arms. Arm 1 (control group), participants will receive
      only conventional chemotherapy; arm 2 (experimental group), participants will receive up to 6
      cycles of maintenance chemotherapy after conventional chemotherapy; arm 3 (experimental
      group), after conventional chemotherapy, participants will receive maintenance chemotherapy
      until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. Participants in all 3 arms will receive
      similar conventional chemotherapy. Four to eight cycles of conventional chemotherapy with
      platinum-based regimen is preferred. Maintenance chemotherapy should use one of the regimens:
      S1 (40mg, twice a day for 14 days, every 3 weeks), capecitabine (1000mg/m^2, twice a day for
      14 days, every 3 weeks) or Tegafur-uracil (100mg/m^2, q8h, for 14 days, every 3 weeks). The
      response of treatment will be evaluated according to RECIST criteria. Adverse events will be
      documented according to CTCAE v4.03.
