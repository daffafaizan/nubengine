    
      To examine the treatment of coronary de-novo stenosis with a sirolimus coated balloon versus
      a paclitaxel coated balloon. Prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blind, 70 patients.
      Experimental intervention: Predilatation of coronary de-novo stenosis followed by a sirolimus
      coated SeQuent®SCB balloon (sirolimus 4.0 μg/mm²). Control intervention: Predilatation of
      coronary de-novo stenosis followed by a SeQuent®Please or SeQuent®Please Neo balloon
      (paclitaxel 3.0 μg/mm²). Follow-up per patient: 30 days telephone call; 6 months angiographic
      + 12 months. clinical follow up

      Key inclusion criteria: > 18 years of age, Clinical evidence of stable or unstable angina or
      a positive functional study, Patients with significant coronary de-novo stenosis (≥ 70%
      diameter stenosis or intermediate ≥ 50% to <70% diameter stenosis with positive functional
      test or symptom of ischemia), Successful lesion preparation (no flow-limiting dissection or a
      residual stenosis > 30%).

      Key exclusion criteria: Acute myocardial infarction within the past 72 hours (STEMI or
      NSTEMI), Intolerance and / or allergy to Sirolimus, Intolerance or allergy to Paclitaxel
      and/or the delivery matrix (main ingredient: iopromide), Patients with an ejection fraction
      of < 30 %, Reference vessel diameter (RVD) < 2.5 mm, Contraindication for whichever necessary
      accompanying medication.

      Primary efficacy endpoint: late lumen loss in-segment at 6 months. Key secondary endpoints:
      Procedural Success: < 30% final diameter stenosis, no flow-limiting dissection (type C or
      higher), TIMI III flow, and the absence of in-hospital MACE. MACE: cardiac death, target
      vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization
      in-hospital at 6 and at 12 months Individual clinical endpoints at 6 and at 12 months:
      cardiac death, target lesion myocardial infarction, clinically driven target lesion
      revascularization, (stenosis ≥ 50% at follow-up angiography)
