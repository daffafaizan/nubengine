      intestinal calcium absorption. Up to 25 postmenopausal women will participate in this study.
      The primary study outcome is the change in intestinal calcium absorption following omeprazole
      therapy 40 mg daily for 30 days. The secondary outcomes include the change in urine
      n-telopeptide.

      We will interview women and review their medical records to determine eligibility. Eligible
      subjects will undergo three calcium absorption studies. The first 2 studies will determine
      the monthly variation in calcium absorption, while the 3rd study will occur after taking 40
      mg of omeprazole daily for 30 days. Women will present to the research unit in the early
      morning and receive an oral and intravenous calcium tracer with breakfast. Over the next 24
      hours, we will collect all urine for measurement of its calcium content. During the first
      stay, we will measure each subject's gastric pH by collecting gastric fluid from a temporary
      nasogastric tube. In consenting subjects we will collect one tube of blood, isolate its DNA.
