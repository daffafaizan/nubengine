      costs of care did not bring better outcomes, vice versa. However, as the rising spending of
      health care, the health care providers, insurance payers, governments, and consumers begin to
      pursue the higher quality of cares with lowest costs. In surgical experiences, improving the
      process of care succeeded to improve the quality of care and reduce the costs.

      In patients with acute ST-Segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), A Door-to-Balloon
      (D2B) time of less than 90 minutes has been established as the gold standard for primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was associated with lower in-hospital
      mortality.9 Only less literatures discussed the costs and the quality of care in acute STEMI,
      and whether improving processes of care associated with lower costs was still controversial.
      The Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration (PHQID) in United State improved the
      processes of care but had not a significant effect on cost. Another single hospital
      experience in Indiana, USA, showed that the reducing D2B time in STEMI decreased the
      insurance payments as well as the total hospital costs. However, this study design was
      before-and-after intervention analysis, did not actually measure the impact of D2B time.
      Besides, the payment system in this study was prospective payment, not fee-for-service
      payment in Taiwan.

      In this study, we tried to determined whether the less D2B time led to costs savings
      benefited insurance payer and better outcomes to patients.
