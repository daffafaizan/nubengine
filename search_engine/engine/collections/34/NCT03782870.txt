      (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), which also includes microscopic polyangiitis and
      eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome). GPA is characterized
      by granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affecting small- to
      medium-sized blood vessels and the presence of ANCA directed to specific antigens,
      particularly proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA). The destructive
      inflammatory processes of GPA have a predilection for the upper and lower airways and the
      kidneys, but any organs can be affected. An increased incidence of various cardiovascular
      events has been demonstrated among GPA patients. Cardiac involvement is also an independent
      predictor of mortality in GPA patients. In this prospective cohort study, consecutive GPA
      patients who are hospitalized in the Department of Family Medicine, Internal and Metabolic
      Diseases at the Medical University of Warsaw in Poland are included. All patients are
      diagnosed with GPA according to current guidelines. Patients are entered into the study at
      the time point when a new diagnosis of GPA was established and received initial treatment at
      our centre. Data collection included a full interim medical history, physical examination,
      laboratory studies and review of adverse events. Additionally, in all patients an
      echocardiography is performed.
