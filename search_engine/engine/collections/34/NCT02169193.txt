      occurs in intubated critically ill patients, and plays a major role in the pathogenesis of
      ventilator-associated pneumonia Quantitative pepsin measurement in tracheal aspirates would
      be useful in diagnosing microaspiration of gastric contents in intubated critically ill
      patients Technetium 99m labelled enteral feeding is the gold standard for the diagnosis of
      microaspiration. We hypothesized that tracheal pepsin measurement is a good diagnosis marker
      of microaspiration compared to the gold standard
