      population. Studies have shown that delay of surgical resection for 3-4 weeks after diagnosis
      is acceptable. Overall survival for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      are poor with the current treatment modalities available. Previously untreated, locally
      advanced (AJCC 8th edition stage III-IVa) HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      patients who are candidates for surgical resection, as deemed by the multidisciplinary team
      will be included in this trial. Patients with histories of autoimmune disease or with current
      or previous histories of immune modulating agents will be excluded from participation.
      Relatlimab will be given IV at a dose of 160 mg IV on D1 (and on D28 if surgery is postponed
      at the discretion of the investigator). Nivolumab will be given IV at a dose of 480 mg on D1
      (and on D28 if surgery is postponed at the discretion of the investigator) when given alone
      or with relatlimab. Nivolumab will be given at dose of 3mg/kgIV every 2 weeks on D1 and D14
      (and on D28 if the operating room time is not yet available, and the 4 week CT scan
      demonstrates at least stable disease ) when given with Ipilimumab. Ipilimumab will be given
      at a dose of 1 mg/kg IV once only on D1. Patients will undergo biopsy and CT scan prior to
      treatment initiation. 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) after, patient will undergo surgical resection. CT
      scan will be repeated prior to surgery (from 1-72 hours prior to surgery). The patients will
      be monitored from time of biopsy until 6 months postoperatively.
