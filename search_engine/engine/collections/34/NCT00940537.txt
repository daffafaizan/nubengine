      the liver fat measurements on subjects by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV). This
      study assesses the modified MRS sequence, using both breath holds and free breathing. The
      HTGC levels are measured twice in the same individuals on two independent events separated by
      10 minutes. Subjects are then given a high fat, high carbohydrate meal of Pizza Hut pizza,
      Pepsi, and Oreo cookies. Two hours after eating the meal, the subjects return to the scanner
      and repeat all MRS scans.
