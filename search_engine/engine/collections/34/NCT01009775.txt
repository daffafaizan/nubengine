    
      All subjects will receive YM155 and docetaxel given in a 21-day cycle. The docetaxel dose
      will be established based on the findings of the lead-in portion of the study (Part 1). Once
      the docetaxel dose is established, Part 2 enrollment will begin.

      Part 1:

      Part 1 is a lead-in stage that will confirm if YM155 can be safely administered in
      combination with docetaxel at a specified dose.

      Part 2:

      Subjects enrolled in Part 2 will receive YM155 and docetaxel at the dose established during
      Part 1.
