    
      Part 1 (non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation)

      Part 1 will consist of up to 3 cohorts of 6 patients each and will evaluate multiple
      ascending dose levels of ACE-083 administered bilaterally once every 3 weeks for up to 5
      doses in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Patients in each cohort will be enrolled in a
      4-week screening period before beginning treatment.

      Part 2 (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled) Prior to the initiation of Part 2, a
      review of safety and efficacy data from Part 1 will be conducted by the SRT to determine the
      recommended dose level (maximum 250 mg/muscle). A total of up to 40 new patients may be
      enrolled and randomized (1:1 randomization) to receive either ACE 083 (n=20) or placebo
      (n=20) bilaterally by injection into both TA muscles once every 3 weeks for up to 17 doses.

      Study duration for Parts 1 and 2 for each patient will be approximately 24 weeks, including a
      4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow-up period after the
      last dose.

      Study duration for Part 2 will be 15 months, including 4-week screening, 6 months double
      blind placebo-controlled , 6 months open-label and 8 week follow-up.
