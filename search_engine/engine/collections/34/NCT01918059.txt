      repair of traumatic lid lacerations with three different approaches to skin closure:
      absorbable sutures (surgical gut suture), non-absorbable sutures (polypropylene suture), and
      tissue adhesive (octyl-2-cyanoacrylate). The population will include patients presenting to
      Memorial Hermann Hospital requiring repair of traumatic lid lacerations. The study will
      include partial thickness, full-thickness, and margin-involving lacerations where first
      standard layered tarsal and marginal suture repair will be performed if necessary, and then
      the patient will be randomized to superficial skin closure with either polypropylene suture
      closure, surgical gut suture closure, or tissue adhesive closure. Subjects will be followed
      in an outpatient setting at 1 week and 1 month post-repair at which time standardized
      photographs will be taken and later assessed using two standardized appearance assessment
      tools: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Hollander Wound Evaluation Score (HWES).
