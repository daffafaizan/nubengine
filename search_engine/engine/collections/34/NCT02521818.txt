      and, hence, abnormal glucose metabolism. In fact, abnormalities in the brain's uptake of
      glucose can be observed on PET imaging in advance of clinical symptoms. In patients with
      established dementia due to AD, the severity of cognitive impairment is strongly correlated
      with the decrease in glucose uptake. Ketone bodies, the products of fat metabolism, can serve
      as a "backup" fuel when glucose is unavailable. Ketone body metabolism appears to bypass the
      metabolic processes that are abnormal in AD and may provide better nourishment for neurons.
      As a result, ketone body metabolism may slow cognitive decline or even improve cognition in
      patients with AD.

      Participants will be 60 people, age 60 or older, with MCI or mild probable AD and without
      significant cardiovascular disease. They will be required to obtain the consent of their
      primary care physicians for their participation. Each patient will have a study partner who
      is cognitively healthy, lives with the participant, and can help him/her adhere to the diet.
      A research dietitian will teach participants and partners the new diet and monitor
      participants' adherence with food logs, in-person assessments, and urine ketone testing.
      After an initial baseline visit, participants will complete four in-person assessments during
      which adherence to the diet will be assessed and neurocognitive tests will be administered.
      It is hypothesized that the MAD will be feasible and well tolerated by seniors with MCI and
      AD. It is further hypothesized that adherence to the MAD will be associated with a greater
      increase (or less decline) in cognitive test scores than the placebo diet, particularly for
      those participants who do not carry an ApoE Îµ4 allele.
