      clavicle fractures and obtain ultrasound data from the fractured bones and the contralateral
      intact bone (as control) at each clinical visit. Ultrasound will be compared to radiographs.
      Completion of this aim will validate the concept and correlate clinical healing with
      ultrasound findings. For the ultrasound method, investigators will use ultrasound energy to
      produce a secondary mechanical vibration in bone that can be used to characterize the
      integrity of the bone. (This is in contrast with conventional sonography where ultrasound
      echoes are used to image the tissue.) The proposed method is based on the use of Ultrasound
      Radiation Force (URF) to excite the bone. URF is a "pushing" force exerted by ultrasound on
      an object. This force can be static, transient (pulse), or harmonic. Harmonic URF can be
      generated by modulating the amplitude of the ultrasound beam at a desired frequency. This
      force initiates bone vibration, where the frequency and amplitude of such vibrations depend
      on bone geometry and elastic properties. Hence, any fracture (or fracture repair) will alter
      the vibration pattern, thus enabling us to monitor fracture and fracture healing by analyzing
      such patterns.
