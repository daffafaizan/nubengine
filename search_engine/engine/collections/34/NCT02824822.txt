      of SUDEP have an underlying genetic cardiovascular disorder. The investigators are seeking
      patients with epilepsy who have a high risk of SUDEP identified by using a risk scoring tool
      called SUDEP-7 and/or have blood-relatives with a history of epilepsy, seizure, cardiac
      arrest, sudden death, drowning/near-drowning, syncope or heart rhythm disorder. The
      investigators may also include blood-relatives of patients with epilepsy and invite them to
      participate by providing a blood sample and/or buccal cells (from a swab or saliva) for
      genetic testing.
