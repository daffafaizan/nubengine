      ABIRATERONE plus PREDNISONE plus Leuprolide (300 patients - Group 1) or the ABIRATERONE plus
      PREDNISONE plus Triptorelin (300 patients - Group 2) to treat Prostate Cancer patients and
      will try to look for the relationship between the ABIRATERONE ACETATE TABLET therapeutic
      efficacy and the drug target CYP17 SNP Genotyping, and the relationship between the
      ABIRATERONE ACETATE TABLET therapeutic safety and the drug target CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9,
      CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP17 and SULT2A1 SNP Genotyping.

      According to ABIRATERONE ACETATE TABLET Labeling Directions, the ABIRATERONE drug target
      CYP17 should be effectiveness-associated; and the ABIRATERONE drug target CYP1A2, CYP2C8,
      CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP17 and SULT2A1 should also be risk-associated. The
      investigators hope to discover the CYP17 SNP Genotypes which may be effectiveness-associated,
      and the CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP17 and SULT2A1 SNP Genotypes
      which may be risk-associated.

        -  1) Detect drug target whole gene precision sequence of everyone patient for all 600
           recruited double blind prostate cancer patients.

        -  2) Mutually compare everyone patient drug target whole gene precision sequence for total
           600 recruited double blind prostate cancer patients.

        -  3) Calculate drug target gene SNPs in all 600 recruited double blind prostate cancer
           patients.

        -  4) Correlate everyone patient drug target gene SNP to everyone patient drug efficacy.

        -  5) Correlate everyone patient drug target gene SNP to everyone patient drug safety.

        -  6) Mutually compare the usual approach group SNPs (Group -1 -- 300 double blind random
           group separated prostate cancer patients) with the study approach group SNPs (Group - 2
           -- 300 double blind random group separated prostate cancer patients).

        -  7) Confirm the relationship between drug target gene SNPs and drug efficacy.

        -  8) Confirm the relationship between drug target gene SNPs and drug safety.
