      following participants forward in time), randomized (like the flip of a coin), multi-center
      study in adult participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Participants will be
      treated with 0.1 percent concentration of tacrolimus ointment which will be applied twice
      daily for 4 weeks or until 1 week after the affected areas defined for treatment at baseline
      are completely cleared, whichever is first. The study will consist of 6 visits: pre-study
      (optional), Baseline or Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 (end-of-treatment). The ointment should be
      applied at least 2 hours before or at least 30 minutes after bathing, showering, shaving, use
      of sauna, or heavy exercise (i.e. causes sweating). On study visit days, the ointment should
      be applied at least 2 hours before the visit. Efficacy evaluation will be done at all
      subsequent study visits in participants receiving study drug for at least 3 consecutive days
      (minimum of 5 applications) while the participants who will receive at least 1 application of
      the study drug, will be evaluated for safety. Primary efficacy evaluation will be based on
      the Physician's Global Evaluation of Clinical Response (PhGECR). Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
