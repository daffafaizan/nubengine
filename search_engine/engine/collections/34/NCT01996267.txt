      potential synergistic cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab and anthracyclines has led to the
      development of non-anthracycline containing regimens, which have shown high pathologic
      complete response rates. Anthracyclines remain very active in HER2 positive breast cancer,
      however, and increasing evidence now supports safe combination of trastuzumab and epirubicin.
      Therefore, the addition of epirubicin to a non-anthracycline containing regimen may further
      improve outcome for patients with HER2 positive breast cancer.

      Several reports confirmed benefit of dual HER2 blockade by adding pertuzumab to a trastuzumab
      containing neoadjuvant regimen. The results of the combined treatment in the Neosphere study,
      however, are similar to what we found in a phase II trial using a weekly paclitaxel,
      trastuzumab, carboplatin combination with pCR rates of approximately 44%. Adding pertuzumab
      to this regimen is likely to also increase the high pCR rate and to add substantial benefit
      to patients.
