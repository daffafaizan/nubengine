        -  Tribological assessment. The investigators will measure the wear of the explants using:
           1) 'out of roundness'; and 2) Coordinate measuring. Semi-quantitative assessment of
           damage to the explants will also be conducted

        -  Histological assessment. Tissue sent in formalin may determine the biomarker of
           diagnosis of metal ion synovitis where applicable

        -  Metal ion measurement in body fluids where applicable (in patients with metal implants)

        -  Diamond Light Source (this was approved in the 1st amendment). The tests will involve
           subjecting formalin fixed tissue to the high energy electron beam of the Diamond Light
           Source

        -  Destructive testing of the implant is allowed by the patient (after all non-destructive
           tests have been performed)

        -  Protein analysis of fluid and tissue if provided

        -  Titanium levels from blood samples if provided

        -  Gene expression testing to assess and understand mechanism of inflammation where
           applicable
