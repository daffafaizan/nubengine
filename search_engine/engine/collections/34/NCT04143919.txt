      assessment. If the NYHA score is ≥ II, the serum NT-proBNP concentration will be determined
      on-site on the same day. If the serum NT proBNP concentration is ≥ 125 pg/mL, the subject
      will be referred to a country specific central echocardiography laboratory for a
      transthoracic echocardiogram to measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and
      relevant structural heart disease.
