      cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), which is chemotherapy given before
      surgical removal of the tumor, both prior to and as early as possible during the course of
      treatment. The efficacy and practicality of conventional imaging approaches in the NAC
      setting varies and identifies the need for alternate functional imaging strategies. Diffuse
      optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) is an experimental imaging method that allows patients
      to be followed before and during treatment with a cost-effective, bedside, handheld scanning
      probe. DOSI is a non-invasive technology developed at the University of California, Irvine
      Beckman Laser Institute. Studies will be performed at seven clinical sites on approximately
      200 suspected breast cancer patients, of which 150 are expected to undergo neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (NAC).

      As a primary aim, the investigators will evaluate whether DOSI can predict NAC pathologic
      complete response (pCR), which is defined as no tumor cell left in the resected tissue at
      surgery) by the mid-point of the therapy regimen. As non-invasive DOSI is obtained rapidly
      with no risk/discomfort, this experimental imaging modality could be used as an indicator of
      pathologic response which has been an established indicator of long-term survival. The
      investigators long-term goal is to provide oncologists with a relatively simple, risk-free
      bedside tool that can be used to help inform medical decisions on chemotherapy regimen,
      duration, and timing of surgery, thereby maximizing therapeutic response and minimizing
      unnecessary toxicity.
