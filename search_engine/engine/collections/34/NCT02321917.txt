      The investigators would like to investigate a new composition of their MECC system in
      patients receiving coronary artery bypass surgery. Normally, the MECC system induces
      complement system activation and coagulation cascade, which could have a negative impact on
      postoperative outcome. A tubing system containing heparin (rheoparin) could contribute to a
      better biocompatibility in terms of a diminished activation of inflammatory reactions and a
      reduction of cerebral embolic load, which is a regular issue during extracorporeal
      circulation due to formation of solid and gaseous microemboli in the tubing system.

      Objective

      The aim is to investigate biocompatibility (coagulation, inflammation) and influence on
      cerebral embolic load of the rheoparin-coated MECC system and to compare the results with the
      current MECC system containing a rheoparin-free tubing system.

      Methods

      Patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery are randomized to receive extracorporeal
      circulation using the MECC system with or without rheoparin coating. All procedures are
      performed according to the institutional standards.
