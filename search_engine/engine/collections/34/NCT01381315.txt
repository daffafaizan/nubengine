      injected into the sub-dermal subareolar aspect of the affected breast.

      On the day of surgery, if the radioactive SLN cannot be located using the gamma probe prior
      to incision, lymphazurin or methylene blue dye will be used in the breast in the subareolar
      plexus at the discretion of the surgeon for assistance in identifying the sentinel nodes.
      This contingency, expected to occur < 3% of the time, will be used since locating the SLN for
      staging is of greater importance than the study. If radioactive isotope is sufficient to
      identify the sentinel node draining from the breast, then the blue dye will be injected
      dermally in the upper inner arm along the bicipital groove of the ipsilateral arm in order to
      locate the draining lymphatics from the arm. No more than 5cc of blue dye will be injected in
      any of the above mentioned scenarios. The site of all injections (radioactivity and/or blue
      dye) will be recorded.
