      great interest over decades in clinical neurosurgery research. Dehydration therapy is a
      common clinical method to decrease intracranial pressure. This study aims to investigate the
      inner mechanism during different dehydration therapies such as mannitol injection and
      hypertonic saline. The investigators used a self-made near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
      instrument to monitor the physiological changes noninvasively including oxyhemoglobin
      ([HbO2]), deoxy-hemoglobin ([Hb]), the derived change in blood volume ([tHb]) and water
      concentration on the forehead of brain edema patients. Then the investigators compared the
      changes process of multiple physiological parameters during different dehydration therapies.
