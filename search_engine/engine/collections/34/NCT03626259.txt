      administration of losartan / amlodipine in fixed combination versus losartan on hemodynamic
      parameters and arterial stiffness in patients with arterial hypertension grade 1 and 2. For
      this purpose the investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized trial, each group will
      be compose by 14 male and female patients, 40-65 years old, with hypertension, neither with
      diabetes nor being under triple pharmacological therapy. Randomization will determine who
      will receive the intervention during an 8- week trial (losartan/amlodipine in fixed
      combination capsule, 100mg/5mg 1 time daily or losartan capsule 100mg 1 time daily). The
      clinical findings and laboratory tests include a metabolic profile and biosafety, which will
      be at baseline and by the 8th week . Body weight, body fat, body mass index (BMI) and blood
      pressure will be determined during the initial and final visit, in addition to hemodynamics
      parameters of arterial stiffness like cardiac output, central aortic pressure (CAP), pulse
      wave velocity (PWV) and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) by an oscillometric monitoring
      system via Mobil-O -GraphÂ® 24. Adverse events and adherence to treatment will be documented.
      Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon exact test. It is considered with
      significance at p<0.05.
