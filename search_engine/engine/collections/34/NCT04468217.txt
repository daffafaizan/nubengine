    
      This analytical and non-interventional study will evaluate the performance of a new workflow
      for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from samples of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal,
      buccal, nasal and saliva mucosa using as transport medium the propietary AAA-Safe solution,
      in 150 volunteers in two different locations. The first sampling location will be held in a
      private clinic, where healthcare professionals will be enrolled. The second sampling location
      will be held at an essential services company, where samples will be taken by employees who
      voluntarily want to participate in the study.

      All volunteers will be informed of all aspects of this protocol and must sign an informed
      consent before there participation. All the information associated with the samples requested
      will be duly anonymized in order to protect the identity of the volunteers.

      The extracted samples will be processed and analyzed to obtain the detection limit of the
      diagnostic flow by implementing the developed solution and to establish the clinical
      performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the technique.
