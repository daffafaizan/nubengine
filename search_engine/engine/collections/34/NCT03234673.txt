      efficacy, early response and safety (Kandaswamy et al., 2013).

      Fractionated lasers represent a new modality for skin resurfacing based on the theory of
      fractional photothermolysis introduced by Manstein et al (2004). These lasers were shown to
      be efficient in treating facial photo aging changes as well as scars, and have an improved
      safety and recovery profile compared with traditional CO2 laser resurfacing. Fractionated
      lasers do not ablate the entire epidermis and thereafter leave intact skin between coagulated
      necrotic columns. This characteristic facilitates the skin healing process (Bogdan et al.,
      2010)
