      metabolic activity of BAT, as assessed with a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET)-CT scan

      This is an observational, prospective design with invasive measurements. The investigators
      will include 16 healthy lean male volunteers (aged 18-30 years, BMI 19-25 kg/m2) The
      volunteers will be recruited by advertisement in local paper and internet (via social media),
      covering the direct surroundings of our clinic (Amsterdam) and by advertisement at the
      medical faculty of the Academic Medical Center (AMC).

      The included subjects will visit the AMC hospital on 3 occasions. During visit 1 the
      investigators will obtain the Informed consent after oral and written information about the
      study. The investigators will obtain a medical history, vital signs and laboratory
      measurements.

      During visit 2 the investigators will measure body weight and the investigators will perform
      an energy expenditure measurement after 40 minutes of bed rest. The investigators will
      regularly measure temperature by a tympanic thermometer. The subjects will receive
      intravenous administration of the radioactive pharmacon 18F-FDG, 60 minutes after the
      administration of the 18F-FDG, and 18F-FDG PET-CT scan will be performed. After the 18F-FDG
      PET CT scans, the investigators will measure insulin sensitivity by performing an oral
      glucose tolerance test.

      After this visit, subjects will start using bromocriptine (1,25mg/day during the first week
      and 2,50mg/day during the second week) in the evening.

      Visit 3(2 weeks after visit 2) will be exactly the same as visit 2. In the three days before
      visit 2 and 3, subjects will record their eating behaviour.
