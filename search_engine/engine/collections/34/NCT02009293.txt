    
      Rationale: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease of
      unknown cause with a median survival of 3-5 years. No curative treatment exists, though in
      2011 Pirfenidone was approved for the treatment of IPF as it appeared to slow down the
      decline in lung function. In patients with IPF, the most common symptoms are cough and
      breathlessness. Cough is not only a major distressing and disabling symptom but also an
      independent predictor of disease progression and death in IPF. Recent preliminary data
      suggest a possible effect of Pirfenidone on cough.

      Objective: In this study we want to objectively measure the effect of Pirfenidone on cough in
      patients with IPF that are treated with Pirfenidone in daily practice .

      Study design: This is a prospective, observational, international multicenter study.

      Intervention: Objective 24-hour cough frequency will be recorded using the Leicester Cough
      Monitor (LCM), a validated ambulatory cough monitoring system, prior to starting with
      Pirfenidone treatment. The cough recording will be repeated at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks during
      treatment with Pirfenidone. At the days of cough recording, patients will be asked to fill in
      questionnaires related to cough and to quality of life. Patient will be treated according to
      normal clinical practice at their Physician's discretion.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is change in cough frequency measured
      by the Leicester cough monitor at week 12 compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints look at
      the relationships between cough, change in cough, quality of life and clinical parameters.
