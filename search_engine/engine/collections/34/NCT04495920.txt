    
      At least twelve test subjects (aged 18-65 years), with healthy skin will be used in this
      study, and will use the test product on one arm, and have the other arm untreated as the
      negative control. The test sites on both forearms will be inoculated with suspensions
      containing Staphylococcus au re us (A TCC #653 8), immediately after the 30 minute product
      drying time, and at approximately 2 hours and 4 hours following test material applications.
      The test sites will be sampled using the cup scrub procedure approximately 20 minutes
      following each inoculation. The log 10 microbial recoveries of treated versus untreated sites
      will be the basis for assessing the residual antimicrobial effectiveness of the test product.
