    
      This is an open-label, Phase I study of intravitreally administered 0.5mg ranibizumab in
      diabetic subjects presenting initially with dense cataract and proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy induced rubeosis. Ten subjects will be enrolled at a single center over a 10
      month period. Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months in the treatment phase and
      will have safety follow-ups at Months 18 and 24. Eligibility for study entry will be
      determined by the principal investigator.

      Consented, enrolled subjects will receive multiple open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5
      mg ranibizumab administered every month for 3 doses (loading dose on Day 0 and at Months 1
      and 2) followed by as needed re-treatment based on specified criteria for the remainder of
      the study period. Subjects can receive a maximum of eight injections of ranibizumab during
      the study. All subjects will undergo cataract surgery after the first ranibizumab injection.
      Only one eye will be designated as the study eye for the duration of the study to receive the
      ranibizumab injections.

      All subjects will be evaluated with best corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
      (ETDRS) visual acuity, intraocular pressure measurement, ophthalmological examination, slit
      lamp photography, gonioscopy, fundus photography, fundus fluorescein angiography and Optical
      Coherence Tomography (OCT). An ultrasound will be done as needed. Best corrected ETDRS visual
      acuity and intraocular pressure measurements will be performed on both eyes.
