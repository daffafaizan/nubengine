      parasympathetic activity and increases sympathetic activity. These imbalance of autonomic
      nervous system can be measured by heart rate variability. Propofol and dexmedetomidine, which
      are used for sedation during spinal anesthesia, also affect autonomic nervous system but the
      exact effects are not well known. Moreoever, the effect of spinal anesthesia combined with
      sedation agent on autonomic nervous system has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study
      is measuring the effects of propofol or dexmedetomidine on autonomic nervous system in spinal
      anesthesia. The current study is prospective randomized pilot study. Patients are assigned to
      propofol group and dexmedetomidine group. Using electrocardiaogram analysis, the change of
      autonomic nervous system will be measured from preoperative to end of surgery.
