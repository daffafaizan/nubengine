      heparin and protamine in cardiac surgeries with CPB regarding blood loss and transfusion
      requirements during the first 24 post-operative (PO) hours.

      Secondarily, the investigators compared continuous infusion of small doses of protamine
      (25mg/hour) and placebo during the first 6 PO hours to neutralize heparin rebound effect. The
      investigators measured KTTP and fibrinogen levels during the first 24 PO hours and also the
      difference in blood loss and transfusion requirements between the groups.

      The study included patients from 18 to 75 years-old submitted to Cardiac surgeries with
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass.
