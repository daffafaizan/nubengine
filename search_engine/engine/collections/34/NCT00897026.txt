      Primary

        -  To identify biomarkers that can be used to individually tailor the use of adjuvant
           dose-dense therapy in women with stage II or IIIA breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To identify groups of patients who have a poor prognosis despite adjuvant chemotherapy
           and who should be prospectively targeted for new approaches to adjuvant treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue samples are collected from patients. Tissue samples are analyzed by
      immunohistochemistry (Ki67, CK5/6, EGFR, ER) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
