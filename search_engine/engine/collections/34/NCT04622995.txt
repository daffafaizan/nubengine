    
      Scotland is experiencing a 'public health emergency' of escalating drug-related deaths (DRD)
      in which benzodiazepine (BZD) are increasingly implicated, often in combination with other
      substances (National Records of Scotland, 2019; Scottish Government, 2019).

      In 2008 BZD were implicated in 26% (n=149) of DRD and were exclusively prescribable drugs
      such as diazepam, although the source is not known. By 2018 BZD and BZD-type drugs were
      implicated in 67% (792) of DRD, predominately substances not available on prescription in the
      UK such as etizolam and alprazolam (Xanax). We refer to these as illicit BZD.

      People who use illicit BZD, of unknown constituents and potency, can inadvertently or
      deliberately consume megadoses of BZD many times in excess of safe therapeutic doses, often
      with alcohol and other drugs, which combine to increase the risk of harm and death. (EMCDDA,
      2018; Johnson, Barnsdale, & McAuley, 2016) Rights, Respect and Recovery, the current drug and
      alcohol strategy, expressed Scottish Government concern regarding the increased prevalence
      and potency of BZD-type drugs (Scottish Government, 2018).

      People presenting to addiction services for initial assessment frequently report illicit BZD
      use in the month prior to assessment, an average of 2,561 (29%) per year in the past five
      years for which data are available. (Information Services Division, 2020) The prevalence of
      illicit BZD use is known to be higher among people with other substance use disorders,
      especially problematic opiate and/or alcohol dependence. (Chen et al., 2011) A systematic
      review identified a high prevalence (typically >40%) among people on Opiate Replacement
      Therapy (ORT) (Votaw, Geyer, Rieselbach, & Mchugh, 2019).

      The picture of BZD prescribing among people on ORT is complex and evolving. Previous work
      shows that BZD prescribing among ORT patients is associated with increased harms including
      mortality, but conversely protective factors such as increased engagement in care (Bakker &
      Streel, 2017; Cornish, Macleod, Strang, Vickerman, & Hickman, 2010; Macleod et al., 2019;
      McCowan, Kidd, & Fahey, 2009; Park et al., 2020). Scottish addiction specialists have
      confirmed that some addiction services are exploring maintenance prescribing to reduce the
      risks associated with illicit BZD use among ORT patients. However clinical guidance does not
      currently provide a framework for this. Evidence of patient safety and other outcomes from
      BZD prescribing in the context of ORT is sparse and conflicting. A 2018 Cochrane review
      concluded "it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding pharmacological
      interventions to facilitate BZD discontinuation in chronic BZD users" (Baandrup et al.,
      2018). Recent UK public health alerts have highlighted the need for caution and additional
      monitoring when co-prescribing BZD and ORT, and the need for improved harm reduction advice
      regarding the risk of illicit BZD (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 2020;
      Public Health England;, 2020). Addiction clinicians have indicated there has been
      disagreement among certifying pathologists regarding the role of benzodiazepines in DRD.

      There is a need to understand patterns of, and outcomes from, BZD prescribing among ORT
      patients in Scotland to inform safe and effective clinical practice, address problematic BZD
      use in the content of poly-drug use, and reduce the risk of harms including mortality among
      people who use drugs (PWUD).
