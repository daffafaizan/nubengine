      gastric emptying after pancreaticoduodenectomy and improves postoperative quality of
      life(QOL)compared with preserving pylorus-ring. Delayed gastric emptying after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy are important to affect the postoperative course and QOL. However,
      there is no report that demonstrates the postoperative course between resecting pylorus-ring
      and preserving pylorus-ring. We conducted a prospective randomized trial on 130 patients who
      underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy comparing resecting pylorus-ring and preserving
      pylorus-ring.

      The primary endpoint was defined as the decrease of delayed gastric emptying. The secondary
      endpoints were QOL, mortality and morbidity, including pancreatic fistula, intra-abdominal
      hemorrhage, and intra-abdominal abscess. Patients were recruited into this study before
      surgery, on the basis of whether pancreatic head resection was anticipated at Wakayama
      Medical University Hospital(WMUH) for pancreatic head and periampullary disease, and
      appropriate informed consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria was 1) patients with severe
      complications which were possible to prolong hospital stay, 2) patients who were diagnosed
      inadequacy for this study by a physician, 3) patients with a previous gastric resection, and
      4) patients without an informed consent.
