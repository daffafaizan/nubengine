      specific and markedly differ from those observed in other disorders..

      Until present time the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is mainly aimed at reducing the
      production and intestinal absorption of ammonia by antibiotics and non-absorbable
      disaccharides, although the available data indicate a low success rate of these strategies.

      Beneficial effects of branched chain amino acids supplementation (BCAA) may be more
      pronounced in patients with marked depression of BCAA and/or low Branched chain amino
      acids/Aromatic amino acids (BCAA/AAA) ratio in extracellular fluid.

      It also may be suggested that the beneficial effect of long term intake of BCAA on hepatic
      encephalopathy demonstrated in clinical studies is related to improved muscle mass and
      nutritional status.

      The current recommendation only includes oral BCAA to patients with liver disease who are
      intolerant to standard protein intake.

      The rationale for this limitation is based on the fact that in the mentioned randomized
      trials, hepatic encephalopathy was not part of the inclusion criteria. Additionally, the
      positive effect was difficult to interpret as it was observed on compound end points, which
      combine survival, hospitalization, and cirrhosis complications. From these results, it is not
      possible to ascertain the role of BCAA in hepatic encephalopathy, which patients benefit and
      to what extent .

      For this reason, the investigators designed this study to assess effectiveness of BCAA in
      improving clinical, nutritional and laboratory status of these patients.
