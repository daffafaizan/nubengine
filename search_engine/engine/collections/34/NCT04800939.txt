      acupressure groups. To the acupressure group (n = 30), an average of 10 minutes will be
      applied to the Shen Men, the 7th acupoint (HT7) of the heart meridian located between the
      ulna and pisiform bones, on the radial side of the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon, and the
      Sanyinjia points on the splenic meridian (SP6) located on the inner side of the lower leg,
      four fingers above the ankle and behind the tibia. In the placebo acupressure group (n = 30),
      the points 1.5 cm away from the HT7 and SP6 points (four points in total) will be applied for
      an average of 10 minutes. The primary outcome of the research is the effect of acupressure on
      the sleep quality of nurses. The secondary outcome of the study is to determine the effect of
      acupressure on daytime sleepiness. The outcomes will be collected before and four weeks after
      the acupressure and placebo acupressure administration.
