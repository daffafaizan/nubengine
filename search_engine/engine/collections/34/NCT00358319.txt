      During Phase I subjects will receive one cycle of Karenitecin alone (cycle 1 days 1-5) and
      then combination therapy with VPA + Karenitecin (cycle 2 days 1-7)followed by oral VPA in
      divided doses for 5 days and Karenitecin starting the third day (days 3-7) every 3 weeks.
      After 2 cycles of treatment there will be the first efficacy evaluation or restaging of the
      disease.

      Dose escalations will continue until unacceptable dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs, then
      dose escalation will be stopped and the previous dose level will be explored. In each dose
      level, participants will undergo pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling to determine blood levels. The
      melanoma skin lesions will also be biopsied to measure the effect of the combination therapy.

      All patients enrolled in the Phase II will be treated with VPA and Karenitecin using the
      dosing schedule determined to be the MTD in Phase I. In the absence of disease progression
      and if there is continued safety and tolerability, treatment may continue in consecutive 3
      week cycles.
