      which improves coronary and cerebral blood flow, activates metabolic processes in the central
      nervous system, restores impaired consciousness, promotes regression of neurological symptoms
      and improvement of cognitive functions of the brain. It has a quick awakening effect in
      post-anesthetic depression of consciousness. The positive effect of Cytoflavin® on cognitive
      function has been previously shown in patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy and acute
      stroke, as well as in a population of patients during cardiac surgery in cardiopulmonary
      bypass and working heart. The present study aims to evaluate the opportunity of prevention of
      postoperative cognitive decline by administration of Cytoflavin® at a sequential regimen,
      starting from intravenous infusions and followed by oral intake during 1 month.

      Study objectives:

        1. To study the efficacy of Cytoflavin® administered in elderly patients age for the
           prevention of cognitive decline after major surgery.

        2. To study the safety and tolerability of Cytoflavin® in elderly patients for after major
           surgery.
