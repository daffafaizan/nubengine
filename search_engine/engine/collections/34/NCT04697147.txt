      Grenadian parent and infant relationship specialists who provided home-based interventions as
      part of the Saving Brains Grenada project.

      The environmental enrichment intervention is a brain-based program that teaches parents about
      brain development in young infants and skills for building a strong social-emotional
      connection that stimulates brain development and maximizes neurocognitive function. A
      detailed intervention manual was developed and used as a guide for the intervention
      specialists. Neurocognitive outcomes in the intervention and control group were assessed pre
      and post intervention by a separate and blinded assessment team.
