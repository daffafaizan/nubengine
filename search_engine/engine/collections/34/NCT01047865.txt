    
      To identify the factors associated with recurrence of diabetes in subjects who received a
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) or pancreas transplant. The study will see if there are
      changes in the participant's blood that will help the investigator know whether diabetes has
      returned after the transplant.

      SPK patients will be retrospectively analyzed to determine frequency, levels and time course
      of autoantibody recurrence and predictive value of autoantibodies for recurrence of the
      disease.

      This study will prospectively follow our existing and our new pancreas transplant recipients
      to monitor autoantibody levels, monitor and phenotype autoreactive T cells in peripheral
      blood. This will happen monthly for 24 months.

      This study will assess the presence or absence of insulitis in the transplanted pancreas from
      biopsies performed in recipients with consistent recurrence of multiple autoantibodies.

      It will also monitor and phenotype autoreactive T cells from the pancreatic infiltrate
      obtained by pancreatic transplant biopsies.
