    
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with subarachnoid
      cysticercosis of the basal cisterns or the Sylvian fissure, comparing in two parallel arms
      the efficacy of the standard of care anti-parasitic regime (30 days of ABZ at 15 mg/k/d, up
      to 1200 mg/k/d) with a combined regime using similar doses of ABZ and adding PZQ at 50 mg/k/d
      for the initial 15 days of anti-parasitic treatment. The study and interim analysis plan are
      designed to allow direct, concrete efficacy comparison in this deadly type of NCC while
      minimizing the risks of disease progression in the standard of care arm.

      In short, this is a parallel group study with a dichotomous primary outcome variable. The
      main analysis will compare the proportions of patients obtaining the primary outcome at 6
      months, using a Chi-square test in a bivariate analysis. A similar analysis will be used for
      the proportions of patients with a good clinical outcome, and the proportions of patients in
      whom lesion resolution sustains when assessed at month 12. A Student T test analysis will be
      used to compare for reduction in parasite volume and non-parametric Mann-Whitney test will be
      alternatively applied for non-normally distributed data. A non-parametric Spearman's Rho test
      will be used to assess the correlation between the proportions of cyst mass reduction with
      the decrease in antigen levels in each study group. A Chi-square test in a bivariate analysis
      will evaluate the association between negative antigen levels at 6 months versus the complete
      disappearance of cyst mass.
