      system, accelerates HIV disease progression, slows initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      and decreases adherence. Thus, the development of effective alcohol treatments for this
      clinical population is particularly important. The investigators are proposing to investigate
      the effectiveness of ondansetron pharmacotherapy for the treatment of hazardous alcohol use
      and alcohol abuse/dependence among HIV-infected patients. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist,
      will be studied for several reasons: 1) evidence of effectiveness in persons who want to
      cut-down or reduce their drinking and who are not abstinent at medication initiation; 2)
      moderate-to-strong effects among early onset problem drinkers, a characteristic that is over
      represented in our clinic patients; 3) a very mild side-effect profile, making it an ideal
      pharmacotherapy candidate in patients who are often receiving multiple other medications with
      significant side-effects; and 4) its primary indication is for treatment of nausea, a common
      side-effect of antiretroviral (ARV) medications.

      The proposed study is a placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of ondansetron for the
      treatment of hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorders among HIV-infected patients
      recruited from the Baltimore/Washington area. Participants will be genotyped for a functional
      polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene. They will be randomized to one of three
      treatment groups: placebo, low dose ondansetron (0.2 mg bid) and moderate dose ondansetron
      (0.8 mg bid). All subjects will undergo 16 weeks of pharmacotherapy in combination with
      medication management, and will be followed for 3 and 6 months after medication has ended.
