      of hypercalcemia of familial primary hyperparathyroidism. The study population will include
      patients with primary hyperparathyroidism caused by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 or
      type 2A. This is a prospective unblinded pilot study, where each patient will serve as
      his/her own control. It will include 6 one-week-long admissions, over a 1 year period. Main
      measurements will be tests of hyperparathyroidism such as parathyroid hormone and serum
      calcium as well as tests of nonparathyroid tumors. The latter tests may include hormones
      released by the tumors and images of the tumors.
