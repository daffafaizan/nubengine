      of gestation. The couples will be followed by validated specific questionnaires, such as
      Couple Satisfaction Index (CSI), Isreali Sexual Behavior Inventory (ISBI), Pelvic Floor
      Distress Inventory (PFDI)and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) assessing the couple's
      satisfaction of their marriage, intimacy in their relationship, their sexual behavior and
      pelvic floor function. After delivery, the parameters of the parturition will be recorded,
      and the couples will be interviewed 6 months following delivery. Apart from questionnaires,
      sample of the participated women will be assessed by ultrasound examination of the pelvic
      floor, demonstrating the continuity of pelvic floor muscles and their function.
