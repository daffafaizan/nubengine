      Following the success of a pilot study, implementation of the full scale WBDR is underway.
      The goals are to enroll at least 200 HTCs from more than 50 countries, and at least 10,000
      people with hemophilia, during the first five years, aiming for representation of patients
      from around the world and from all levels of access to care. Minimal criteria for
      participation of HTCs include access to reliable internet, human resources for data entry and
      commitment to long-term enrolment and follow-up of patients. The WBDR database is being
      developed through a collaboration between the WFH, Karolinska Institute and Health Solutions.

      By combining data from countries around the world, the WBDR will provide a large amount of
      real world data, on which researchers can address important scientific and clinical issues.
      The World Bleeding Disorders Registry (WBDR) is intended to fill existing gaps in knowledge
      by collecting real world data on the patient clinical experience around the globe.
