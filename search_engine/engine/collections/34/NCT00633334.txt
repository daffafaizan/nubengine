      lymph nodes and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with early or late stage
      gastrointestinal cancers. These samples will be evaluated in a variety of immunological
      assays to better understand the immune response to these two cancers. The second goal of this
      proposal is to evaluate using novel proteomic, cellomic, and genomic techniques the serum and
      peripheral blood lymphocytes of these patients for protein, cellular changes and genetic
      markers that correlate with the presence of cancer. The information gathered from these
      studies will directly enhance our ability to design, conduct and monitor novel
      immunotherapeutic protocols for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal cancer.
