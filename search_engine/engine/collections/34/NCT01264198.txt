      developed countries with a prevalence rate of 20-30 % of adults. About 10-25% of these
      individuals are estimated to meet the current diagnostic criteria for Non Alcoholic
      Steatohepatitis (NASH) and some may progress to Cirrhosis and liver failure. NAFLD is now
      recognized as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Recent data shows that
      NAFLD might also predict the tendency to develop diabetes mellitus and coronary artery
      disease. The drug of choice for NAFLD is yet to be found. The recommended treatment of NAFLD
      includes weight reduction and Physical Activity (PA), but the data of the effect of
      Resistance Training (RT) PA on NAFLD is scant.

      Aim of the study: To evaluate the effect of RT on clinical and metabolic parameters in
      patients with NAFLD. Study design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Patients will be randomly
      allocated to 2 arms (intervention and control). The intervention arm will perform RT, whereas
      control arm will be advised to perform home stretching. Medical examination will be performed
      at week 0 (baseline) and at week 13 using uniform protocols.
