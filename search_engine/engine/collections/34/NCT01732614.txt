      enhanced expression of heat shock proteins in the retina. To test clinical efficacy of
      sub-visible retinal therapy using ms-range exposures of visible lasers one needs first to
      establish proper titration methods necessary to assure on one hand the lack of tissue damage,
      and on the other hand sufficient hyperthermia to elicit cellular response.
