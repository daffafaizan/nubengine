      increasing antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-related complications, and healthcare costs, the
      investigators wish to determine whether prophylactic post-operative antibiotic ointment is
      truly necessary. After all, existing dermatology literature currently recommends against the
      routine use of antibiotic ointment after various surgical procedures (e.g. Mohs surgery). The
      investigators aim to perform a prospective randomized control trial at the University of
      California, San Francisco. The investigators aim to recruit a total of 400 oculoplastics
      patients undergoing eyelid surgery or surgery involving peri-orbital incisions from 2017
      through 2019.
