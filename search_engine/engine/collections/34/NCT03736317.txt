      circuits associated with drug dependence. Previous studies showed increased functional
      activity within the limbic neural circuit (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral
      striatum) in the presence of a salient cue and decreased activity in the executive control
      circuit (e.g. dorsal prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum). TMS was used to reverse the
      activities of these two circuits, by using continuous TBS and intermittent TBS, respectively.
      In this study, vmPFC cTBS was conducted to modulating the limbic circuit, while left dlPFC
      iTBS was conducted to modulating the executive control circuit. Combined treatment of vmPFC
      cTBS and left dlPFC iTBS was conducted to modulating two circuits simultaneously. Focused on
      evaluating the efficacy of the interventions and investigate the mechanisms,
      neuropsychological tests, biochemical tests, and electroencephalography will be used to
      investigate the neurobiological mechanism of the methamphetamine use disorder, craving, and
      relapse. The study will be very helpful to develop evidence-based rTMS protocols for
      methamphetamine-dependent patients in clinical practice and decrease harm for both the
      patients and their families.
