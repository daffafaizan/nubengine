      sleep which have been shown to be accompanied by multiple oxygen desaturations followed by
      short recovery intervals until rising PaCO2 causes sleep disruption/rescue arousal. In the
      postoperative and conscious sedation arena, these patterns can deteriorate from a stable
      pattern to a severely unstable pattern which may go unrecognized and lead to an adverse event
      (respiratory/cardiac arrest; death).

      Anesthesia and the higher consumption of analgesics produce a profound reduction in
      pharyngeal tone, a dampening of both chemoreceptor sensitivity and arousal/rescue response.
      Thus the first 48 hours post operatively presents a vulnerable period. Respiratory
      disturbances are more prominent - respiratory arrest and hypopnea being the main adverse
      occurrences during this period.

      An algorithm has been developed that monitors saturation and indicates repetitive reductions
      in airflow through the upper airway and into the lungs. Presence of this pattern in the
      procedural sedation patient population has not been tested for its prevalence. This study
      will monitor patients during surgery to determine if this pattern occurs in this hospital
      setting.
