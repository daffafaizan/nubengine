      resource for studies looking at molecular predictors of biliary tract cancer. The development
      of fluid based biomarkers will enable early diagnosis in at-risk individuals with a
      recognized risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, as well as provide surveillance mechanisms for
      screening populations where biliary tract cancer has a high incidence.
