      approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee, Khon Kaen University (HE581287).

      The investigators will review all eligible medical records at Srinagarind Hospital and Queen
      Sirikit Heart Center of the Northeast, Khon Kaen University during January 2013 and December
      2014. The extracted data consist of patient's clinical data and all risk factors in the OHIR
      score. The investigators will apply the OHIR scoring to the data to assess its performance.
      The investigators will use the same criteria for a prolonged ICU stay as in the previous
      study, i.e. a stay longer that the median.
