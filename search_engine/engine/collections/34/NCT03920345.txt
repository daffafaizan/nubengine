      60-80% of the general population in their lifetime and is associated with substantial
      healthcare costs. The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) complex is one of the major sources of CLBP,
      accounting for around 10-33% of the total number of CLBP cases. The SIJ complex consists of
      the joint capsule, synovia, various muscles and ligamentous structures overlying the join and
      neuronal structures that innervate the SIJ. Current interventional and surgical treatment
      options for SIJ complex mediated CLBP include intraarticular and periarticular injection of
      the joint, SIJ fusion and radio frequency ablation (RFA) of the neuronal structures
      innervating the SIJ. The described interventional procedures are simple procedures and
      provides quick pain relief, but the effect is short-lived. In addition, SIJ fusion is an
      invasive surgical procedure that should be reserved for refractory intractable pain of the
      SIJ1.

      New endoscopic electrothermic ablation of the SIJ capsula, synovial and neuronal structures
      have been utilized in the treatment of facetogenic CLBP in a few number of clinical reports
      with favorable results, but to our knowledge, the efficacy of this technique when applied to
      SIJ-associated CLBP has not been reported. In this study, the investigators will utilize
      endoscopy for the precise microsurgical and ablation (ESIJ) of the potential pain generators
      associated with the SIJ and evaluate the clinical efficacy of this new technique.
