    
      This is an open-labelled, randomized and multi-centre clinical trial in subjects with RT-PCR
      confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild-to-moderate symptoms, and who are currently admitted
      to the hospital for diagnosis of COVID-19. The study has two arms: hospital standard COVID-19
      care (Control group) and hospital standard COVID-19 care + Isoquercetin (Isoquercetin group).
      The recruited subjects will be placed into either group by an electronic randomization
      process. Patients in the Isoquercetin group will receive a daily dose of 1000 mg Isoquercetin
      as 4 x 250 mg Isoquercetin capsules as add-on therapy in addition to the hospital standard
      COVID-19 care. The Isoquercetin treatment will continue for 28 days.
