      Urogynecological Rehabilitation Unit of University Hospital, Physical Medicine and
      Rehabilitation Department between September 2020 and November 2021. The local ethics
      committee approve the study (approval no: 60116787-020/37878). Patients are informed about
      the purpose and contents of the study and all women give written consent to participate.

      By using a random number generator, all patients which included the study were randomized
      into two groups as follows: The Group 1 received BT program alone, the Group 2 received BT
      plus MS.

      Group 1: Bladder Training (BT) - Control group All women were informed about BT for 30
      minutes. Then it was given as a written brochure to be implemented as a home program.

      BT, consisting of four stages, did not contain any pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training
      programs in two groups.

      Group 2: BT plus MS Patients are told to sit on the chair with a magnetic coil below the
      chair. When a volume conductor is inserted by this magnetic ﬁeld, an eddy current ﬂow is
      generated. This eddy current stimulates nerve or muscle of the pelvic ﬂoor. To apply MS, the
      device was set to generate its maximum stimuli, with a stimulation pulse width of 200 μs and
      a stimulation repetition cycle of 10 Hz in accordance with the literature (10,13-15). When
      setting the device at each treatment session, patients were interviewed so that they received
      stimuli at the maximum stimulation intensity (maximum tolerable stimulation intensity) (10).
      MS was applied two days a week, 20 minutes a day, a total of 12 sessions for 6 weeks. MS
      sessions were performed by other physician.
