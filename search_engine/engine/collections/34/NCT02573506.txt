    
      This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of split-course chemoradiotherapy(CCRT) in
      locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      Patients receive four cycles of weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(25mg/㎡), each of 1
      day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 51 Gy/17 fractions and
      15-18 Gy/5-6 fractions administered in the first and second courses, respectively, with about
      one-month break. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, which is calculated from
      the start of RT to the first identification of disease progression or death. Progression-free
      survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicities will be graded
      according to CTCAE V.4.0.
