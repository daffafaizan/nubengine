      The dialysis units are located in the north of Portugal (two units) and in the Autonomous
      Region of the Azores (one unit). The study started after approval by the institution ethics
      committee.

      Study Setting and Population The study was carried out in dialysis units the north of
      Portugal, identified as Control Group (CG), and on an island in the Autonomous Region of the
      Azores, identified as Intervention Group (IG).

      Data Collection and Instrument All data were collected from January to June 2018. Information
      concerning the sample demographic characteristics (age, gender, education, employment,
      marital status) and clinical characteristics (ESRD etiology, dialysis vintage, previous AVFs,
      AVF duration, information on care with the AVF) was collected with a questionnaire designed
      by the authors.

      Information concerning self-care behaviors with the AVF was collected from the Scale of
      Assessment of Self-Care Behaviors with Arteriovenous Fistula in Hemodialysis (ASBHD-AVF) (8).
      This scale has 16 items in two subscales: subscale 1 - Management of Signs and Symptoms (6
      items) and subscale 2 - Prevention of Complications (10 items). Responses to each item are
      based on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Higher scores show patients' higher frequency of
      self-care with the AVF. The ASBHD-AVF scale has been applied to Portuguese patients with
      Cronbach's alpha of 0.797, 0.797 and 0.722 for the global scale and sub-scales 1 and 2,
      respectively.

      Memory problems were assessed by the Six-Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT), Portuguese
      version (9).
