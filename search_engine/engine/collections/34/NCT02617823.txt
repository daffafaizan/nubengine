    
      Pregnant women requesting epidural analgesia will be randomized to either left lateral or
      semi-recumbent position for 30 minutes after the first epidural bolus-injection.

      After 30 minutes, the clinical effect of the analgesia will be evaluated by an
      anesthesiologist if available or by a midwife if the anesthesiologist is unavailable. The
      study-period is concluded thereafter and further positioning is optional.

      Maternal and fetal wellbeing are continuously being monitored during the study period and
      complications/interventions registered. APGAR and CTG results during the intervention will be
      registered and evaluated at a later stage.
