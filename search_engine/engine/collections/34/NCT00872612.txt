      disease is most prevalent in young adults. To set the final diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the
      following parameters need to be present:

        1. A clinical and radiological suspicion of sarcoidosis stage I/II.

        2. A tissue diagnosis of disease-specific non-caseating granulomas.

        3. Exclusion of possible alternative diagnoses as lung cancer or tuberculosis.

      Nowadays, a bronchoscopy with lung biopsies is advised to set a tissue diagnosis of
      sarcoidosis. However, these biopsies are only diagnostic in 70% of the procedures and they
      are associated with a 3% risk of coughing up blood and a 4% risk of a lung collapse.

      Since recently, a new diagnostic procedure has come available. This procedure,
      endo-sonography, makes it possible to biopsy lymph nodes in the chest under direct
      visualization and has a diagnostic accuracy of 85%. The associated risk of complications
      appears to be small (<1%)

      We consider the current standard for the diagnostics of sarcoidosis to be outdated,
      considering the clinical availability of endo-sonography. We expect that endo-sonography is
      more frequent diagnostic for a tissue diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

      Also we hypothesize that this technique is safer and more preferred by patients.
