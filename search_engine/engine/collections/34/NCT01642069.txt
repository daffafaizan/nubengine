      Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Cryopreserved
      mRNA Study Population Description: Samples from AAML0531 Sampling Method: Non-Probability
      Sample

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether NUP98/JARID1A expression is a recurrent translocation in
      NUP98-rearranged cases in pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL).

      II. To screen the Children Oncology Group (COG) samples for genetic aberrations in pediatric
      AMKL.

      OUTLINE:

      Cryopreserved specimens are analyzed for NUP98 fusion to NSD1, JARID1A, and TOP1,
      myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearrangements, and other gene expression
      profiling by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and karyotyping or
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Results are then compared with each patient's
      outcome data.
