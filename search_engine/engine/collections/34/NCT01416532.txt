      represents a major challenge. For this purpose, a lot of risk prediction models that take
      demographic and clinical characteristics into account have been developed. Although
      Framingham risk score (FRS) is most widely used among multiplr risk prediction models, it has
      some limitation for prediction of CVD especially in young adult and women. Recently, coronary
      artery calcium score (CACS) has known to be powerful screening method for CVD, however, it
      cannot detect the noncalcified coronary plaques (NCP), so it does not represent the entire
      spectrum of atherosclerotic plaques and it also cannot evaluate the degree of stenosis. On
      the contrary, Coronary CT angiography (CCTA)can provide detailed coronary artery anatomy and
      plaque imaging about the location, burden and characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque per
      se, which might give additional insight to stratify the risk of future cardiac events and
      therapy.

      In this study, we will evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of subclinical coronary
      atherosclerosis on CCTA in asymptomatic population. And we will investiage the follow up data
      for major cardiac adverse event such as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction,
      unstable angina and revascularization. Therefore, we will finally evaluate the prognostic
      value of CCTA for risk stratification in asymptomatic adults in comparsion with conventional
      risk stratification such as FRS and CACS.
