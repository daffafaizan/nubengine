      polarization can improve verbal fluency in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This
      study is designed to extend those findings in a double blind trial. Objective: To see whether
      surface anodal DC polarization can improve verbal fluency and a global measure of behavior in
      FTD patients. Design: We propose to treat 20 FTD patients anodal and sham DC polarization in
      a double blind, crossover trial. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures are verbal
      fluency and the score on the Neuropsychiatric Index, a commonly used scale for behavioral
      problems in dementia. Secondary outcomes will include a modified behavioral scale,
      administered every 12 hours during the study, a standard neurobehavioral rating scale, some
      experimental tests of dominant frontal lobe function and a control task that we do not expect
      to be affected.
