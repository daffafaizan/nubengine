      (Gy) during one week preoperatively will be examined. The patients will be divided into three
      groups with ten patients in each group. One control group without no treatment/study product,
      one group receiving a test product of 45 g of oat bran and freezing medium only, and one
      group having a probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL 19 (1010 CFU/g), freezed
      dried blueberry husks (13 g) and oat bran (22 g), corresponding to 8 g fibre per day in each
      of the two treated groups. The patients will consume the test product once a day 1 week
      before and during radiotherapy (2 weeks in total). Mucosal biopsies for microflora analysis
      and blood samples for analysis of SCFAs and cytokines will be collected at inclusion as well
      as faecal samples. After radiation therapy, at surgery, blood samples, faecal samples and
      mucosal biopsies are collected. Fresh faecal samples, blood samples and mucosal biopsies are
      stored at -80Â°C until analysis.
