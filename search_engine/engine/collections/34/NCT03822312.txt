      this study device for this indication.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved DBT-TOBI as a diagnostic
      scan for this disease.

      The DBT-TOBI scan system is designed to deliver low power laser lights through a person's
      body tissue and collect data about the light that is transmitted through. In this study, the
      DBT-TOBI will be used to scan the breast. The data that can be collected through the scan is
      the total hemoglobin concentration and hemoglobin oxygen saturation. Hemoglobin is the
      protein found in red blood cells that is responsible for carrying oxygen to the various
      tissues in the body. These two data types are thought to provide insight into the response of
      the breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment response. The researchers are looking
      to find if these scans will help show changes in the hemoglobin levels, thus showing how the
      cancer is reacting to treatment. The study is focused on 2 types of breast cancer called
      triple negative breast cancer and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2).
