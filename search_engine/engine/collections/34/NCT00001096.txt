      immunologic responses. Required parts of the immune response may include: humoral antibodies,
      which broadly neutralize non-syncytium-inducing strains of HIV-1; T cell help provided by
      both CD4 and CD8 positive subsets; and a class I-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte response.
      Other effector responses, such as the generation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity,
      cytokines, chemokines, or other antiviral factors may also be critical in mounting protective
      immunity. Given the lack of a surrogate immunologic marker, the most practical approach for
      possible efficacy trials would be to evaluate a candidate vaccine that elicits as many of
      these responses as possible.

      Volunteers in each of 5 groups receive vaccine or placebo by intramuscular injection at
      Months 0, 1, and 6. All patients receive one of two doses of QS-21 along with vaccine or
      placebo and some groups receive alum as follows:

      Group 1: low-dose MN rsgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 (13 volunteers). Group 2: high-dose MN
      rsgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 (13 volunteers). Group 3: AIDSVAX B/E (injection contains each of
      the two vaccine components, HIV-1 MN rgp120 and A244 rgp120/HIV-1) plus QS-21 plus alum (13
      volunteers).

      Group 4: high-dose MN rgp120/HIV-1 plus QS-21 plus alum (13 volunteers). Group 5: placebo
      plus QS-21 (8 volunteers). Volunteers will be closely monitored after each immunization and
      followed for a minimum of 12 months after the initial immunization.
