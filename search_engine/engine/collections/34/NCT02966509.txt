    
      VAPAHCS proposes to implement and evaluate several critical elements to be in alignment with
      the VHA's Strategic Goal and priority areas for FY2013. The Engagement of Patients with
      Advanced Cancer project is an innovative program that will strengthen provider-patient
      relationship and facilitate whole person care about matters important to Veterans with cancer
      and important to support network and family. The project is intended to help establish Goals
      of Care Plan with appropriate documentation, develop, deploy, and evaluate a model of care
      for persons with cancer that is intended to improve clinical outcomes and experience of care
      for individuals with advanced cancer who have advanced cancer (stages III, IV or recurrent
      disease). The intervention provides patients with lay health coaches who assist patients and
      their families in discussing goals of care and engage in shared-decision making. The goal of
      the project is to demonstrate that there is improved patient experiences, outcomes, and that
      the program helps to reduce utilization of health care resources at the end of life.
