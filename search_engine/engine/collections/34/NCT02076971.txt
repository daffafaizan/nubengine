        -  To evaluate Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific immune response measured by QuantiFeron®.

        -  To evaluate overall immune response measured by ImmuKnow®.

        -  To study the course of QuantiFeron® and ImmuKnow®over the follow-up period.

        -  To correlate levels of ImmuKnow® and QuantiFeron®.

        -  To evaluate the relationship between levels and doses of immunosuppressants and their
           relationship to degree of overall immunosuppression (ImmuKnow®).

        -  To evaluate the relationship between infections, immunological complications and degree
           of overall immunosuppression (ImmuKnow®).
