      studies, including primary sensory cortex, insula, and anterior cingulate gyrus. However, it
      is few informations about the functional status of these areas. Besides, the reason of the
      individual variability about the developement of neuropathic pain remains unknown. It is lack
      of satisfactory explanation about why some people developed neuropathic pain in certain
      diseased situation (for example, type 2 diabetes), while others do not.

      We hypothesis that patients with neuropathic pain has abnormal cortical excitability and
      plasticity in certain brain area. Therefore developed neuropathic pain certain diseased
      condition while others not. Therefore, we will use multimodal electrophysiology tools,such as
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and contact heat evoke
      potential to monitor the cortical excitability and plasticity non-invasively.
