      an adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy on health outcomes in deconditioned older
      men. Specifically, we will conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the
      hypothesis that supplementation with testosterone improves rehabilitation outcomes in
      deconditioned older men. We will use objective validated measures (i.e., FIM, muscle
      strength) to assess health outcomes.

      We will begin enrolling subjects within three months of receipt of funding, and study 60
      subjects (30 in each group) within 24 months. All subjects will undergo follow-up evaluation
      6 and 12 months after completion of inpatient rehabilitation and cessation of testosterone
      supplementation. Therefore, this project will be completed within 3 years. Our short term
      goal (within 3 years) is to delineate the safety and efficacy of testosterone supplementation
      on rehabilitation outcomes in deconditioned older men. Our long range goal is to determine
      whether other hormones (e.g., combined testosterone and growth hormone) are helpful as an
      adjunct to traditional rehabilitation therapy in the care of older men
