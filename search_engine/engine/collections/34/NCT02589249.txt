    
      This interventional study is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo and dose-response
      controlled clinical trial (in 3 parallel groups) of male and female subjects without active
      osteoarthritis of the knee to be recruited at a single investigational center in the U.S. A
      two-week placebo lead-in period will precede the study to enhance statistical power.
      One-hundred and five (105) overweight, apparently healthy subjects, pre-screened using health
      history questionnaires, vital signs, blood work and a standardized lower extremity exercise
      performance test will be randomized to one of three groups for 84 days: placebo, AyuFlex1
      (500 mg/d) or AyuFlex2 (1000 mg/d). AyuFlex is an organic, non-GMO, over-the-counter joint
      health product derived from the edible fruits of Terminalia chebula.
