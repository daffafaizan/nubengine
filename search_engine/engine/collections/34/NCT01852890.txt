      chemoradiation. The ascorbate is infused during external beam radiation therapy treatment.

      For patients eligible for this trial, standard treatment for their cancer includes radiation
      therapy combined with weekly gemcitabine (a chemotherapy).

      Participants will:

        -  receive high doses of intravenous (IV) ascorbate during their daily radiation therapy
           treatments. Radiation treatments are given once a day, Monday through Friday.

        -  have routine doctor's visits and be asked about any side effects they are experiencing.

      This is a phase 1 study that will evaluate the side effects of adding ascorbate to standard
      therapy. The dose given to a participant will be determined by how well other participants
      have tolerated ascorbate.
