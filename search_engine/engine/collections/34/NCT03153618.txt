      Tool Engine ("VALIDATE") system as a means to improve the affordability and ease, while
      maintaining the validity and feasibility, of collecting, assessing, and acting on
      Comprehensive Health History data.

      Virtual Agents (VAs) are fully autonomous and embodied software agents that use both verbal
      (e.g. speech) and non-verbal modalities (e.g., gaze, gesturing) to simulate a
      clinician-patient encounter. These agents have already successfully shown advantages to
      patients for: entering family history data on their own, facilitating medication adherence,
      providing behavioral health information, serving as clinical interviewers, promoting
      breastfeeding, and educating about and motivating exercise and weight loss. The VALIDATE
      system has been developed to be a fully automated alternative to the currently extremely
      labor-intensive process of collecting and transcribing CHH data. VALIDATE will be evaluated
      for its capability to significantly diminish clinician time and cost to collect, review,
      analyze, and document accurate and complete certain CHH data directly from patients at home
      using their own personal desktop computers. VALIDATE will also be evaluated for its
      capability to identify valid clinical action, e.g. referral indications for familial cancer
      assessment based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/National Society
      of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) and National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN) Guidelines.
