      alternatives such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT is an ideal approach to
      minimize radiation exposure to the normal liver while maximizing the dose to the tumor.
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the combined use of intra-arterial chemotherapy and
      particulate arterial embolization. This technique is typically used to make unresectable
      liver lesions amenable to resection, for palliation in cases of extra-hepatic spread or
      recurrence, or for symptomatic relief. The combination of intraarterial chemotherapy with
      vessel embolization makes logical sense since primary and secondary liver tumors derive up to
      95% of their blood supply from the hepatic artery, while the normal liver gains the majority
      of its blood supply from the portal system. Thus, using transarterial chemoembolization it is
      possible to achieve high intratumor drug concentrations followed by local ischemia, allowing
      uninvolved liver to be spared. This study is to determine that these standard of care
      therapies combined to improve the quality of life for the patient population.
