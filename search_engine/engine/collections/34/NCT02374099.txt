    
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, two-arm study assessing the efficacy and safety of the
      combination of fulvestrant with CC-486 in subjects with ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer
      who have progressed after prior AI.

      Approximately 92 participants will be enrolled and assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to one of
      two treatment arms:

        -  Arm A: CC-486 300 mg and fulvestrant 500 mg: 46 subjects

        -  Arm B: Fulvestrant 500 mg: 46 subjects Each cycle will be 28 days. CC-486 will be
           administered orally at a dose of 300 mg daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle.
           Fulvestrant will be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection at a dose of 500 mg on
           days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles.

      Safety will be evaluated by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) after a total of
      approximately 32 subjects have completed at least 1 treatment cycle.
