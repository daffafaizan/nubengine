      times during controlled ovarian stimulation.Apoptotic index of granulosa cells were examined
      by quantitative real time PCR techniques for BAX/BCL-2 expression.Oocyte maturation and
      fertilization rate output parameters are examined by competent embryologists after ovum pick
      up while GDF9 and BMP15 levels were examined by quantitative real time PCR techniques for
      GDF9 and BMP15 mRNA expression
