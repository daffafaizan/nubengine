      bone marrow donation: either a vaccine against hepatitis (the hepatitis A vaccine), or a
      vaccine against pneumonia (Prevnar). You will then get both of these vaccines following your
      transplant. By studying how much these vaccines may improve your immune system, we hope to
      better understand the effects of the BMT with Cyclophosphamide on the immune cells.

      Prevnar is a pneumococcal vaccine (pneumococcus is a bacteria that can cause pneumonia and
      other infections). It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      prevention of infections in children. It is not usually given to adults. Hepatitis A vaccine
      is approved by the FDA for the prevention of hepatitis A (a liver infection) in children and
      adults.

      The vaccines are not approved for bone marrow donors or for vaccinating adults after BMT
      (using these vaccines in this research is investigational). The FDA is allowing the use of
      these vaccines in this research study.

      Certain people getting BMT followed by Cyclophosphamide may join, if their donors might also
      join. Your bone marrow donor must take part in this study, in order for you to continue on
      this study
