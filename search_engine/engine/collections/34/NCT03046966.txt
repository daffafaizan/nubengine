      "live" tracheal intubations in the critical care setting. The current one to two days of
      airway management training as a part of resuscitation training (such as Pediatric Advanced
      Life Support (PALS) or Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) is not sufficient to provide safe
      intubation skills.

      This study will develop and implement tracheal intubation training using concepts of
      deliberate practice modeled after Ericsson. The concepts include focused training on a
      specific task, immediate feedback, time for problem solving and evaluation, and opportunities
      for repeated performance using a manikin. This proposal is an attempt to develop such a
      training model. Video recordings of live intubations will be reviewed and evaluated. The data
      between the two groups will be compared to see if there is improved intubation skills of live
      patients.
