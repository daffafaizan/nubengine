      randomized, double-blind, active-controlled. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) (experimental vaccine)
      manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd in subjects aged over 3 years. In phase I, 60
      volunteers received single dose QIV (15µg/0.5ml). In phase III, 2320 volunteers were assigned
      to receive single dose QIV (15µg/0.5ml) or two commercial trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs)
      (15µg/0.5ml) in a ratio of 2:1:1. The commercial TIVs were also manufactured by Sinovac
      Biotech Co., Ltd.
