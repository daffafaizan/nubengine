      enrolled at Northwestern University Transplant clinic at the time of kidney biopsy. At our
      clinic, protocol biopsy may be performed at 3 months, 12 months , 24 months or any other time
      the doctor feels necessary post transplant in all kidney recipients. Kidney transplant
      recipients may also go under "for cause" biopsy procedure at any time point before/after or
      in between these protocol biopsy time points. Such causes of biopsy include increase in serum
      creatinine level, decrease in urine output, and/or pain at graft site.

      Full blood tube set, urine sample for proteomics and flow cytometry of urinary sediment, and
      an extra core kidney biopsy tissue for gene expression profiling will be collected from
      subjects at the time of any biopsies obtained during the study course. These specimen samples
      will be sent to Rules-Based Medicine (RBM) for proteomic analysis. Whole genome expression
      profiling will be done using Affymetrix GeneChips at The Scripps Research Institute.

      We estimate that we will find at least 50 subjects with diagnostic CAN/IFTA histology (Banff
      1-2) between the 3 months and 12 months post transplant protocol biopsies based on a 50%
      incidence in the literature and our own experience. We also estimate that there will be 10%
      (10 subjects) incidence of clinical rejection by the end of 12 months identified initially by
      an acute rise in the serum creatinine and confirmed by a biopsy. Lastly, we estimate a 10%
      (10 subjects) incidence of subclinical acute rejection with stable renal function detected by
      the protocol kidney biopsies.
