      profile of the natural cycle, in which the peak is reached around the time of implantation.
      With this non-invasive trial investigators wish to further explore the early luteal phase
      profiles of progesterone and hCG in order to optimize current luteal phase support policies
      in IVF and hopefully increase ongoing pregnancy rates.

      Stimulation, monitoring, and oocyte pick-up will be performed according to the standard
      procedure of the clinic. On the day of trigger with 5.000 IU hCG a blood sample will be drawn
      prior to triggering for subsequent analysis. Moreover, all ovarian follicles on each side
      equal to or above 11 mm will be registered. Oocyte pick-up and timing of the trigger bolus
      will be performed according to the standard procedures of the unit.

      A total 10 blood samples will be drawn during this trial - please see "blood sampling". Blood
      samples will be collected on the following days for subsequent analysis of LH, E2, hCG and
      progesterone.

      All embryos will be cryo-preserved for transfer in subsequent frozen/thaw embryo transfer
      cycles.

      Primary endpoint Serum concentrations of progesterone, LH, E2, and hCG during early luteal
      phase.

      Secondary endpoints The correlation between follicles â‰¥ 11 mm and progesterone in early
      luteal phase

      Data are analyzed using SPSS version 20 software. All tests are two tailed, and P<0.05 is
      considered statistically significant. Continuous variables are presented as mean +/- SD and
      are tested by student's t-test. Categorical data are expressed as numbers and compared using
      the Chi-square test.
