      known as taboo thoughts e.g. fear of being a pedophile) and mental rituals have shown to
      respond less well to treatment. Thus, there is room for further innovation. The primary
      objective of this pilot study is to investigate if an internet-based cognitive therapy (I-CT)
      is feasible and effective in reducing the frequency and distress of aggressive obsessions.
      The study will also investigate if I-CT is associated with any significant side effects.
      Another objective of this study is to get a power estimate of the treatment effects for a
      subsequent randomized controlled study (RCT). This will be done by using an open pilot study
      with repeated measurements.
