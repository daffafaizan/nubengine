      chronic inflammation. The inhibition of prostanoid synthesis by NSAIDs forms the basis of
      their therapeutic as well as side effects. NSAIDs directly inhibit cyclooxygenase [COX],
      which leads to reduction of prostaglandin synthesis but also to gastric erosions, inhibition
      of platelet aggregation and nephrotoxicity. The identification of the two isoforms of COX
      lead to the hypothesis that COX-2 is responsible for the production of prostaglandins
      following tissue injury, while COX-1 is involved in normal homeostasis. This hypothesis is
      primarily based on the results of animal studies and chronic inflammatory conditions such as
      arthritis. Recent results in the oral surgery model of acute inflammation suggest that COX-2
      is present in the oral mucosa and may contribute to prostanoid production during acute
      inflammation rather than require induction in response to the injury. The proposed study aims
      to evaluate the time course of COX-1 and COX-2 in acute inflammation by evaluating levels of
      mRNA at baseline prior to surgery, at the completion of surgery, and at one, two and three
      hours following surgery.
