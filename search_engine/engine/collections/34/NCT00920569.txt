      volume and cardiac output in patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The study uses
      an external monitor, laptop computer, clamp on flowsensors and ultrasound dilution technology
      to measure blood flow. Measurements are made by injecting 0.5 - 1 ml/kg of sterile isotonic
      saline into the patient's extracorporeal circuit. The subject will be monitored throughout
      the measurements. The measurements will be coordinated with the regular care of the
      extracorporeal circuit.
