        -  Compare the effect of adjuvant hepatic intra-arterial iodine I 131 lipiodol vs
           observation in terms of rate of recurrence and overall survival of patients with
           curatively resected hepatocellular carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Within 4-6 weeks after prior resection, patients receive adjuvant hepatic
           intra-arterial iodine I 131 lipiodol once.

        -  Arm II: After prior resection, patients undergo observation. Patients are followed
           monthly for 1 year and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
