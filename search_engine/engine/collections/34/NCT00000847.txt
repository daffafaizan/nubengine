      humoral and cellular response against several antigens. vCP205 expresses proteins from two
      strains of HIV (MN and LAI). rgp120/HIV-1SF2 expresses proteins from a different strain of
      HIV. This study will help to show how the immune system responds to proteins from more than
      one strain of virus.

      Six groups of 25 volunteers each are randomized to receive simultaneous or sequential doses
      of ALVAC-HIV vCP205 and SF2 rgp120 or control vaccines (ALVAC-RG rabies glycoprotein vCP65 or
      BIOCINE Placebo Vaccine 2). In each group, 21 volunteers receive vaccine and 4 receive
      control vaccines. Volunteers are stratified by lower or higher risk sexual behavior.
      Immunizations are given to three groups at months 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12, and to the other
      three groups at months 0, 1, 6, 9, and 12. Volunteers are followed for 24 months.
