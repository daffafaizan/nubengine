      the efficacy of pulsed ultrasound in the treatment of vitiligo on the face or trunk. Face is
      included in this study because vitiliginous lesions on the face has a better treatment
      response and causes more psychological distress on the patients than vitiligo affecting other
      body areas. Thirty adult subjects with vitiligo affecting the face or trunk symmetrically
      will be recruited. After randomization, subjects will be administrated their ulrasound
      treatment twice a week for 24 weeks. Their original topical treatment and/or phototherapy
      will be continued. During follow-up visits, digital photographs will be taken for evaluating
      the extent of residual depigmentation. In vivo harmonic microscopy and three skin biopsy
      specimens will be performed at the indicated time points on the depigmented, repigmented
      areas and surrounding normal skin.
