    
      Patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (n=53) and a matched healthy control group
      (n=53) underwent blinded ultrasonography imaging of the sciatic, tibial and median nerves.
      Matching was performed according to patient body mass index (BMI), sex and age. CSAs of the
      nerves were recorded, and the associations between pain intensity (measured with a visual
      analog scale [VAS]), the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) pain
      scale, diabetes mellitus duration, BMI, HbA1c and blood glucose levels were evaluated.
