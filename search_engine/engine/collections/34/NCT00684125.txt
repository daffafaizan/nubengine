      surgery is higher than after other cardiac surgical procedures. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of prolonged mediastinal drainage using small, soft
      silastic drains (Blake drain, Ethicon USA) versus conventional mediastinal drainage using
      large chest tubes. Patients undergoing aortic and / or valvular surgery will be randomized in
      two groups. In group A, mediastinal drainage will be accomplished using a 28F or 32F chest
      tube in the anterior mediastinum and a 19F Blake drain located in the posterior pericardial
      cavity. In group B, mediastinal drainage will be accomplished using two 28F or 32F chest
      tubes located in the anterior mediastinum. In both groups, conventional chest tubes will be
      removed on the first postoperative day, while patients in the group A will have prolonged
      drainage using the Blake drain until output is less than 50 ml over 24 hour. Patients will be
      followed during their postoperative course for occurrence of significant pericardial effusion
      as detected on routine echocardiogram and late cardiac tamponade requiring reintervention.
