      treatments of the dental diseases. Thus they are used to perform dental prostheses,
      pre-orthodontic analysis or in the context of dysfunction of the manducatory apparatus.

      Many children affecting with genetic disease need prosthetic rehabilitation. However, none
      commercial articulators are adaptable to children. Consequently little dental prosthetic are
      taken before adolescence, or even adulthood.

      The aim of this study is to measure some oral and maxillofacial physiological parameters,
      with a view to creating a modular prototype articulator from young children to adolescents by
      3D printing.

      On average, 30 children per week visit the dental department of Reims CHU for dental
      screening or orthodontic diagnosis. From this cohort, an epidemiological study will be
      carried out. It will concern different physiological parameters of the face and the oral
      cavity necessary to make a prototype articulator.

      Ideally, the creation of a modular articulator to monitor the growth of a child would remove
      a number of diagnostic locks, therapeutic and technical.
