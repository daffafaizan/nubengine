      evaluate the efficacy and safety of mFOLFOXIRI as neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone for EMVI+
      LARC in contrast to standard chemoradiotherapy. Patients of LARC with EMVI+ evaluated by
      pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are enrolled in this trial. All patients will be
      randomized divided into two groups.

      Experimental group will receive 3 cycles of mFOLFOXIRI, followed to be performed MRI to
      assess clinical response. If the tumor response is good enough (partial response or complete
      response), the patient will receive another 3 cycles of mFOLFOXIRI then surgery. On the
      contrary, if the tumor shows poor response (stable disease or progressive disease) or with
      mesorectal fascia-positive or ycT4a/b after re-evaluation, radiotherapy will be performed
      combined with capecitabine before operation. Control group will receive standard capecitabine
      based chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients with mesorectal fascia-positive or ycT4a/b after re-evaluation would receive
      radiation before surgery, whereas responders would have immediate total mesorectal excision
      (TME). All patients will receive 4 cycles of XELOX as adjuvant chemotherapy after TME.
