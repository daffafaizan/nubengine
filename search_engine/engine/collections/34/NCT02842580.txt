      bevacizumab given on the first 3 metastatic lines in a randomised phase II trial evaluating a
      "descending" strategy of immediate optimisation by 4 cycles of FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab and 4
      cycles of FOLFIRI-bevacizumab, followed by maintenance treatment with 5FU-bevacizumab until
      progression (re-introduction of induction in case of progression) and evaluate an "ascending"
      strategy with 5FU-bevacizumab immediately followed, at progression, by the introduction of
      irinotecan, then oxaliplatin, with maintenance of blocking of angiogenesis by bevacizumab.
