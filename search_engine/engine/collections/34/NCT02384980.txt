      peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and ischemic pain during walking (intermittent
      claudication) by using a new Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) system. The
      investigators hypothesize that combining the FES and walking one hour/day (FES+Walk) will
      significantly reduce pain during walking, improve locomotion, and enhance quality of life
      when compared to walking one hour/day (Walk) alone after 8 weeks of intervention.
