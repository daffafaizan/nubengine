      1 year, in order to promote empowering behaviors in directors and front line supervisors in
      SC, and to test its impact at two years on workers scores of structural empowerment, in
      comparison with another SC from the same University Hospital Center (CHU).

      The secondary objective is to assess the effect of the intervention on psychological
      empowerment.

      To answer to the main objective, quantitative data will be collected three times during the
      project: Before the implementation, directly after the intervention, and 1 year after the end
      of the intervention, or 2 years after the beginning. To improve our understanding of what
      happened during the intervention, a systematic ethnographic report will be done by the
      investigators and the facilitators engaged in the intervention.

      Quantitative data collection will occur during the occupational health visit that is required
      to be done every two years considering French legislation. For the need of the study, visits
      will be done every years, and scheduled to match with the beginning and the end of the
      intervention.

      Quantitative data consist in (1) self-reported questionnaires, (2) standardized assessment by
      medical practitioner during the visit, (3) institutional indicators routinely collected by
      the SC.
