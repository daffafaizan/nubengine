      increased mortality and some psychiatric disorders. Regular participation in a
      medium-intensity exercise regimen may help people sleep better. This study will assess the
      effectiveness of a regular exercise program on improving sleep in older adults with moderate
      difficulty sleeping.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions. One group will partake in a
      moderate-intensity physical activity training regimen. The other group will act as a
      non-exercise attention-control comparison group. Each group will undergo its assigned
      treatment for 12 months. Sleep quantity and quality will be measured objectively using
      in-home polysomnography. Subjective sleep quality and health-related quality of life measures
      will be evaluated with questionnaires. All measurements will be performed at the beginning of
      the study, Month 6, and Month 12.
