      generally healthy, adult moist snuff users who will be randomly assigned to the order in
      which they will use two moist snuff study products (comparator product, test product).
      Enrolled subjects will use one of each of the study products exclusively for approximately
      one week (seven days +1/-2 day) prior to a test visit, with a different product used each
      week over a two-week period. During each test visit, subjects will use study product ad
      libitum during a 6-hour period. Expectoration will be collected from the subjects during each
      product use. The used study product will be collected after use. Blood samples will be
      collected at each test visit, prior to study product use, for determination of plasma
      cotinine levels.
