      in Europe and in the United States. The prevalence of moderate or severe AS was found to be
      age-dependent rising from 0.02% in patients aged 18-44 years to 2.8% in patients aged â‰¥ 75
      years. Among patients at prohibitive surgical risk, TAVR has become the treatment of
      choice.The safety and efficacy of TAVR compared with medical management and SAVR has been
      demonstrated in clinical trials.The composite of the rate of all-cause death or stroke was
      27% and 37% in TAVR patients after 1 and 2 years, respectively.Even though parts of the
      strokes occur during the peri-procedural period, the patients remain at risk of stroke
      throughout the first months after the procedure.

      EARTH-TAVR is a diagnostic multicenter study performing in association with the GALILEO trial
      (NCT02556203), which is investigating cerebral embolization with MRI and neurocognitive
      testing in patients undergoing TAVR, who are treated with anticoagulation (Rivaroxaban/ASS)
      or DAPT (Clopidogrel/ASS). GALILEO is a global multicenter, open-label, randomized,
      event-driven, active-controlled study comparing a rivaroxaban-based antithrombotic strategy
      to an antiplatelet-based strategy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to
      optimize clinical outcomes.

      Investigators aim to investigate peri-interventional and delayed cerebral embolization in the
      early period (3 months) after TAVR and to analyze associations between neurocognitive
      parameters and cerebral embolization patterns in patients on different antithrombotic
      treatment regimes.
