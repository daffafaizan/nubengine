      anxiety disorder (GAD) using a validated functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm and functional
      connectivity analyses with a cohort of GAD patients and healthy subjects and generating
      feasibility and preliminary data regarding treatment-related effects of escitalopram on brain
      functional activation and Fc patterns in pediatric GAD. An additional goal is to identify
      biological markers in saliva and urine that will predict treatment response in pediatric
      subjects with GAD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that core dysfunction within
      the prefrontal-amygdala network, which the investigators and others have observed in GAD,
      will be normalized by successful treatment. The rationale underlying this hypothesis is that,
      despite the high prevalence of GAD, there is a need to understand its neurobiology and to
      identify biomarkers of treatment response and the mechanisms by which selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) putatively effect changes in the neurocircuitry of pediatric GAD.
