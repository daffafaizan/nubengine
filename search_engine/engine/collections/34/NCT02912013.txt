    
      The purpose of this post-marketing study is to determine the efficacy of the mÄ“ mini hair
      removal device and to compare the extent of hair removal with and without maintenance
      treatments.

      Healthy females, with dark hair in the treatment areas that desire to remove their hair will
      be enrolled. Subjects will be provided with the device and will be instructed as to the
      method of usage. The subjects will be expected to self-administer the treatment at the clinic
      in a "simulated home environment". Subjects will receive 7 "basic treatments" in weekly
      intervals and 3 additional maintenance treatments on 1 side in 1 month intervals
      ("Maintenance" vs "No maintenance" side). In the second phase of the study subjects that
      consented to and completed the first phase will be offered the option to continue with 9
      additional maintenance treatments in 1 month intervals.

      Follow ups will be conducted at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the last basic treatment.

      Evaluations will include hair clearance, skin safety, tolerability of the procedure, and
      subject, satisfaction.
