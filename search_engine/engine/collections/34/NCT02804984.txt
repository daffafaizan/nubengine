      idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) on the basis of molecular defects
      found in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in order to validate the hypothesis whereby ICUS may
      be a precursor of MDS. To this end, high-throughput exon sequencing (using next-generation
      sequencing (NGS)) will be used to target the genes known to be mutated in MDS. This study is
      important for two reasons. Firstly, it will help to optimise the clinical monitoring of
      patients with molecular defects and considered to be at risk of progression. Secondly, it
      will provide a better understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying the
      progression of ICUS to MDS.
