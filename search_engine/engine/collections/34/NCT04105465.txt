      excision achieves excellent local control and remains the mainstay of treatment.

      Surgical excision depends on the extent of disease and may be in the form of wide local
      excision or radical vulvectomy. Lymphadenectomy in the form of bilateral groin node
      dissection (BGND) is performed for all central tumors with depth of invasion greater than 1
      mm, unless there is significant comorbidity contraindicating this, but is known to cause
      significant postoperative morbidity. Immediate postoperative complications include breakdown
      and lymphocyst formation in more than 50% of cases. The PlasmaJet is a novel device that
      produces a jet of pure argon plasma by heating pressurized argon gas. Energy from the argon
      plasma transfers to tissue as light, heat, and kinetic energy.

      Following ethical approval, a prospective, crossover, doubleblind, randomized, control trial
      to assess the PJ system, with the primary outcome being the possibility of reduction in wound
      breakdown and lymphocyst and lymphedema formation following BGND for vulvar cancer was
      opened.
