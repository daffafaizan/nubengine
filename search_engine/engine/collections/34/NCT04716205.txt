      that capacitate the person to move smoothly and safely. Although the flexibility of all the
      muscles of the body is essential for normal human function, the flexibility of hamstring
      muscle is much emphasized. Investigations suggest adequate flexibility of the Hamstring
      muscles is compulsory for a healthy lower back. Lack of hamstring muscles extensibility
      conditions a decrease of pelvic mobility. This invariably leads to biomechanical changes in
      the pressure distribution of the spine and consequent spinal disorders.

      This study will be a randomized control trial and will be conducted in health sciences
      collage in Bahawalpur. The study will be completed within the time duration of six months.
      Convenient sampling technique will be used to collect the data. The sample size of 48
      patients will be taken in this study to find the Effects of Mulligan's bent leg raise
      technique on hamstring flexibility and lumber spine mobility in healthy females. Patient will
      be divided into two groups. Static Stretching will be given to both group as a baseline
      treatment. (Group A will be treated with Mulligan's bent leg raise techniques and static
      stretching Group B will be treated with static stretching only. Participants will be assessed
      for hamstring tightness with Active Knee Extension Test (AKET) and readings will be noted and
      lumbar mobility will be assess using Modified Schober Test (MMST). Assessments will be done
      at baseline and post intervention on 5th and 10th day. Intervention will be given 5 days per
      week for two weeks. Data will be analyzed on SPSS 25.
