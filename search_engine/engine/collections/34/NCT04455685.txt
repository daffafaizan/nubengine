      symptoms and the population's knowledge about the premenstrual syndrome of women of
      reproductive age, and that correlate these data with the sociodemographic, socioeconomic and
      sociocultural conditions of these women .

      In the investigator's view, this study brings value not only to contribute to the
      understanding and demystification of PMS by society in general, but also for the
      professionals who assist these women. The data currently used in Brazil, and which are
      frequently used to guide public health policies, are mostly the result of research carried
      out in other countries, and which may not correspond to the national reality.

      The information generated with this study may help to rethink behaviors to improve the health
      and quality of life of these women, at this stage in which comprehensive attention to the
      health and needs of this population should be given, often providing contraceptive methods
      that offer, as a benefit relief of symptoms related to PMS. The data from this research may
      also offer tools for decision making related to the need for early and effective treatment of
      PMS, whose disorders are associated with both the decrease in the present and future quality
      of life for the woman, as well as all of her family life, social and professional.
