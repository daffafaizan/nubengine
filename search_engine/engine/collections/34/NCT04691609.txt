    
      In the face of the quickly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many
      health-care systems around the globe have modified their routine management of patients
      presenting with acute cardiovascular emergencies including patients with ACS.A unifying theme
      in the new management strategies is the adoption of new restrictive measures to meet the
      challenges of increased risk of infection of health-care workers; limited numbers of beds,
      shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), inadequate number of protected
      catheterization rooms; and the clinical overlap between ACS and COVID-19 infection in some of
      patients.

      In developing countries, with an already strained health system due to economic problems, the
      situation is more challenging and needs the formulation of efficient protocols that can
      accommodate several medical and socioeconomic challenges.

      Egypt, with an estimated population of 100 million, is facing exceptional challenges during
      the COVID-19 crisis. Because large scale use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for
      SARS-CoV-2 in a large population is a problem, the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in Egypt
      is unknown. Furthermore, the supply of PPE falls far short of demands with lack of
      professionally protected cardiac catheterization rooms. With progression of the pandemic in
      such a large population, care of COVID-19 patients is expected to rapidly overwhelm the
      supplies, beds, and staff available in Egyptian hospitals.

      The Cardiology Department in Assiut university hospital has revised the management protocols
      for ACS patients and implemented new management protocols both for patients with ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and Non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes
      (NSTE-ACS).
