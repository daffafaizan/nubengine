    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new combination of chondroitin sulfate
      and glucosamine sulfate administered once a day is superior to placebo in the treatment of
      patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis. Eligible patients will be randomized
      1:1 and the treatments will be administered for 24 weeks. Clinical efficacy at the end of
      treatment will be evaluated. Safety will be evaluated through adverse events recoding during
      the study period.
