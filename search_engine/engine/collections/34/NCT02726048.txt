    
      Up to 40 NIV patients who currently use a full face mask or a nasal mask will be recruited.
      They will be issued a Simplus (if they are existing full face users) or Eson (if they are
      existing nasal users) to use in-home for 2 weeks. This will consists of male and female
      participants who have been prescribed with NIV therapy for at least 3 months.
