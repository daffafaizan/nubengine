      transplanted group or control group. Patients in transplanted group received the stem cells
      treatment,Patients in control group received the standard treatment. After culture in vitro,
      umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells should go through safety evaluation which include
      culture and check of pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, mycoplasma, chlamydia, eumycete and
      viruses) of the cells medium and karyotype analysis of the mesenchymal stem cells. Only the
      safe cells were harvested and transplanted by multiple intramuscular injections into the
      impaired lower limbs. Follow-up index include: efficacy (pain,ulcer healing rate, lower limb
      amputation rate and ,ankle-brachial index,magnetic resonance angiography,electromyogram) and
      safety (infection of the injection site, fever, and tumour generation).
