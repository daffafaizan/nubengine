      The subjects in the intensive statin group will receive rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily.

      Subjects will visit at weeks 12 and 24 to identify medication adherence and clinical side
      effects.

      The primary endpoint of this study is a % change of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at 12
