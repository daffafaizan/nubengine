        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal oxaliplatin with or without
           intraperitoneal floxuridine and leucovorin calcium in patients with metastatic cancer
           confined to the peritoneal cavity.

        -  Determine dose limiting and nondose limiting toxicities and pharmacokinetics of these
           treatment regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of oxaliplatin.

      Patients receive intraperitoneal (IP) oxaliplatin over 1 hour on day 1 every 2 weeks for 2
      courses.

      Beginning at course 3, patients receive oxaliplatin with floxuridine and leucovorin calcium
      IP on day 1 and floxuridine and leucovorin calcium IP alone on days 2 and 3. Treatment
      repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with complete surgical resection of disease receive a total of 6 courses of
      combination chemotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
