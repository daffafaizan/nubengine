    
      Background: the exact prevalence of target organ damages in Korean hypertensives are unknown.

      Study Objective: to investigate the prevalence of target organ damages in Korean patients
      with incident hypertension.

      Study Design: prospective, multi-center and observational study

      Study Populaton: approximately 5000 consecutive patients with incident hypertension, who
      visited outpatients clinics and agreed to participate in the registry

      Primary outcome

        -  Subclinical organ damages

             1. left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiogram or echocardiography

             2. increased intima media thickness of carotid artery (> 0.9 mm) or plaque

             3. increased pulse wave velocity (> 12 m/s)

             4. low estimated glomerular filtration rate (< 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) or creatinine
                clearance (<60 ml/min)

        -  Established CV or renal disease

             1. cerebrovascular disease: ischemic stroke; cerebral stroke; transient ischemic
                attack

             2. Heart disease: myocardial infarction; angina; coronary revascularization; heart
                failure

             3. Renal disease: diabetic retinopathy; serum creatinine M > 133, W > 124 mmol/L;
                proteinuria > 300 mg/24 hr

             4. Peripheral artery disease

             5. Advanced retinopathy: hemorrhage or exudates, papilledema
