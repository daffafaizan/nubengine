    
      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively enroll children younger than 2 years of age
      who have undergone brain or spine MRI with 0.1 mmol/kg PROHANCE and to gather safety data as
      well as to collect MR images for a prospective blinded read to evaluate the efficacy of
      PROHANCE in terms of visualization and enhancing properties.

      The study will be conducted in 4-8 sites in the United States and Europe. It is estimated
      that 120 patients will be enrolled to provide 108 evaluable patients.

      Three radiologists unaffiliated with enrolling centers (blinded readers), blinded to the
      patient's identity and clinical profile will independently evaluate the MRI images. The
      efficacy analysis will be primarily based on the blinded reader evaluations.

      Imaging conditions will represent those in routine clinical practice, inclusive of pre and
      post-contrast images.
