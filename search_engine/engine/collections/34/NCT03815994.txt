      critically ill patients. It will be a randomised crossover clinical trial. Thirty-one
      patients will enrolled. Patients will be selected, randomly, to the intervention Protocol
      (decubitus position with the limbs raised and NMES) and control (decubitus position with the
      limbs raised without NMES).The patients will be allocated in Group 1 (intervention and
      control) or group 2 (control and intervention) with a wash-out period of 4 to 6 hours between
      them.

      The main outcome will be metabolic data. Linear mixed model will be used for analysis of
      dependent variables and estimated values of the mean of the differences of each effect.

      The results of this study will allow better understanding of the metabolic effects of NMES in
      patients critically ill.
