      septic shock patients with previous hypertension remains unknown. Our goal was to assess the
      effect of MAP titration to patients' usual level on microcirculation in septic shock patients
      with previous hypertension. We hypothesized that the increase in MAP from 65 mmHg to
      patients' usual level improved sublingual microcirculation.
