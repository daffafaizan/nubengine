      network care (8 clusters with an altered organisation of physiotherapeutic care) or usual
      care (8 clusters with unchanged organisation of physiotherapeutic care). Clusters are formed
      by all PD patients living in the communities connected to participating regional hospitals in
      the 16 clusters.

      The health care intervention in the experimental group has two elements: (a) an improved
      quality of referrals by neurologists; and (b) an improved quality of interventions by
      physiotherapists. Brief description Network Care: In each of the Network Care clusters, 5 to
      7 motivated therapists are selected to enroll in a regional ParkNet and consequently trained.
      Training is focused at correct use of the evidence-based guidelines for physiotherapy in PD
      (Keus et al, 2006). This training consists of a 5-day competence-oriented course, web-based
      continues education supported by seminars, and use of a PD specific electronic patient
      record. Neurologists are informed about indications for referral to physiotherapy. Improved
      communication between neurologist and ParkNet therapists is initiated and supported.

      Following implementation of the health care change, PD patients attending the neurological
      outpatient clinics of the individual hospitals within the clusters will be asked to
      participate. During a period of 6 months, PD patients will enrol in the study. Enrollees will
      be followed for 6 months to measure the use and quality of physiotherapy, patient health
      benefit and satisfaction, and costs.
