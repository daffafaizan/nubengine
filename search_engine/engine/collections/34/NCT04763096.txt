      Tacrorimus blood level is 3-10 ng/ml for 6 months prior to screening and during the
      maintenance therapy. It is recommended to check the blood concentration of tacrolimus at each
      visit and adjust the dose to achieve the blood concentration maintaining at 5~10ng/ml of
      study treatment. (The lowest blood levels shall be adjusted at the discretion of the
