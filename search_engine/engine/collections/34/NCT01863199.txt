      under-treated, while others over-treated. Under-treatment can lead to severe and irreversible
      disease progression and associated loss of vision. Over-treatment is expensive, uncomfortable
      and potentially increases the risk of complications. A self-monitoring device such as
      DigiSight can help subjects keep close control of their treatment, but alleviate the burden
      of in office monitoring visits. A decreased number of office visits in combination with the
      home self-monitoring may provide an effective alternative dosing regimen, allowing the
      physician and subject to closely track the disease progression and treatment effect without
      the demands of monthly or frequent visits to the office.
