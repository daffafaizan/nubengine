      costing about $600 billion a year in indirect and direct medical costs. Managing chronic pain
      is difficult, requiring an array of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches to address
      not only pain, but relevant and intertwined domains of life such as sleep, energy, and mood.
      One such non-pharmacologic therapy is yoga. Systematic reviews of yoga clinical trials have
      shown that yoga is effective in managing low back and neck pain. However, these studies
      utilized younger populations, and no studies have characterized the effects of yoga for pain
      in the elderly. Given the rapidly growing aged population, the growing popularity of yoga,
      and the high prevalence of pain conditions among elderly individuals, studies that examine
      the effect of yoga on acute and chronic pain in the elderly are warranted. Thus the purpose
      of this proposal is to perform a pilot study to assess the feasibility and efficacy of yoga
      for managing chronic pain in elderly adults. This study will characterize whether such an
      intervention is feasible, assess whether a gentle yoga intervention improves subjective
      symptoms of pain, and investigate whether this yoga interventions decreases use of as needed
      pain relievers among elderly adults. This pilot study will characterize these effects in a
      sample of 60 elderly adults in at the United Methodist Retirement community in Chelsea,
      Michigan. The results of this study will be immediately translatable to members of this
      community in the short term, and nationwide in the long term.
