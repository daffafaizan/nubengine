    
      This is a prospective randomised controlled trial to compare the benefits of Quixil vs.
      Tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss.

      Both medicines are used for the reduction of blood loss in major joint surgery; previous
      studies have shown each one to be effective and safe, but they have not been directly
      compared in this setting.

      We will compare the blood loss in each of 3 groups: tranexamic acid used, Quixil used, and
      control group (neither drug used). Blood loss is to be calculated from height, body weight
      and difference between pre and post-operation haematocrit.
