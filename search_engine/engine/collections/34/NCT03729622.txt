      The trial aims to investigate the effect of a diet low in FODMAPs on colonic morphology as
      well as in improving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

      This mechanistic information, along with the clinical data, will allow planning of larger,
      multi-centre studies of the low FODMAP diet in similar patients.

      HYPOTHESES

        -  Patients on a low FODMAP diet for 2 weeks will have a decreased fasting colonic volume
           measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compared to participants who have not
           started the diet.

        -  Patients with IBS are more likely to report a clinically important improvement in
           symptoms following the low FODMAP diet (immediate intervention) compared to those on
           their habitual diet (delayed intervention).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE • To compare the proportion of IBS patients reporting a clinically
      important improvement in symptoms following a low FODMAP diet for 2 weeks against IBS
      patients who are on their habitual diet.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

      • Determine the difference in fasting colonic volume of IBS patients receiving low FODMAP
      dietary intervention after 2 weeks compared to those on habitual diet.

      TRIAL DESIGN

      This will be a pilot single-blind, randomised, controlled trial (RCT). Since some activity
      will take place on the University of Nottingham this will be a multi-centre study.

      All participants will receive advice from a dietitian on the low FODMAP diet. They will be
      randomised to one of two parallel treatment arms:

        1. Low FODMAP dietary advice (immediate intervention)

        2. Habitual diet (control - delayed intervention )
