    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind and cross-over study designed to evaluate the
      potential of a probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus) to modulate the post prandial metabolic
      and inflammatory response of normale healthy individuals.

      After a wash out period during which volunteers will have to follow a diet devoid of all milk
      or milk-derived products, they will receive, in random order, either a daily dose of the
      probiotic, or a daily dose of acidified milk (control) for a total of three consecutive
      weeks. At the end of each of these period, they will be submitted to a day of investigation,
      during which their metabolic and inflammatory profile will be studied following the ingestion
      of a standard test meal. The potential for the probiotic to modulate the metabolic and
      inflammatory parameters will be evaluated.

      The test meal will provide 1004Kcal under the form of 45.4g proteins (17%), 69g total fatty
      acids (62%), and 52.6g glucids (21%) as previously published (Schwander et al, J Nut 2014).
