    
      This is an open label pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the
      combination of Vigil autologous tumor cell immunotherapy and durvalumab PD-L1 inhibitor in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic women's cancers, inclusive, but not limited to
      breast, ovarian, cervical, uterine, fallopian, primary peritoneal, and endometrial regardless
      of the number of prior therapies.

      This will be a 2-part study. The first part will be a safety run-in comprised of 2 cohorts
      that will use a 3 + 3 design to determine the Vigil dose in Part 2. Patients in Cohort 1 will
      receive a low dose of Vigil (1x10^6 cells/intradermal (ID) injection) in combination with
      durvalumab (1500 mg (if > 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. Patients in Cohort 2 will
      receive Vigil at 1x10^7 cells/ID injection and durvalumab (1500mg (if > 30 kg) IV over 60
      minutes) every 4 weeks. If needed, patients in Cohort -1 will receive Vigil at 1x10^5
      cells/ID injection and durvalumab (1500mg (if > 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4 weeks. The
      enrollment of the first two patients in each Cohort of Part 1 will be staggered by 2 weeks.
      In Part 2 of the study, patients meeting study eligibility criteria will receive Vigil at the
      dose determined in Part 1 and durvalumab (1500mg (if > 30 kg) IV over 60 minutes) every 4
      weeks. As of March 13, 2018, Part 2 of the study will not be initiated due to limited
      enrollment. Currently only patients who have Vigil immunotherapy available from Gradalis
      protocol CL-PTL-119 may be considered for the study.

      Radiological assessment of tumor response or alternative assessments of disease status should
      be performed at screening, Cycle 3 and every 2 cycle thereafter, and end of treatment (EOT)
      using RECIST 1.1 and investigator assessment as applicable. Tumor biopsy for correlative
      studies including but not limited to scoring of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) and PD-1
      / PD-L1 expression analysis should be obtained at tissue procurement and at Cycle 3, and
      optional biopsies thereafter if the patient has accessible tissue. Peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) for correlative studies should be obtained at pre-procurement if
      applicable, and prior to study regimen administration at Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 5 and EOT.
      Patient survival will be followed for 1 year after last dose of either Vigil or durvalumab.
