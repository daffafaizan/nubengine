      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of telephone-based cancer education with vs without counseling in
           younger participants.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the mechanisms by which education with counseling may impact cancer-relevant
           cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

        -  Identify teens who may be most and least likely to benefit from education with
           counseling.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, controlled, randomized study. Participants are stratified according
      to age (13-14 years vs 15 years vs 16 years vs 17 years vs 18-21 years), gender, race (white
      vs black vs other), and health status (chronic disease vs no chronic disease). Participants
      are randomized to 1 of 2 education arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants undergo cancer education sessions via telephone over 45 minutes once
           a week for 8 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Participants under cancer education sessions as in arm I and counseling
           techniques during the same telephone sessions.

      In both arms, participants receive an intervention kit by mail before the first telephone
      call. The intervention kit includes age-appropriate self-help materials.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 participants will be accrued for this study.
