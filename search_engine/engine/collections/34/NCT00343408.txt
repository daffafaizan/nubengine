        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of AZD2171 when administered with standard
           combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer or
           colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicities, and
           pharmacokinetic profile of this treatment regimen.

        -  Assess the antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in patients with measurable
           disease.

        -  Correlate the toxicity profile with pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of AZD2171. Patients are
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to disease.

        -  Group 1 (non-small cell lung cancer): Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on
           days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV on day 1. Patients also receive oral AZD2171 once daily
           beginning on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group 2 (colorectal cancer): Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin
           calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days
           1 and 2. Patients also receive oral AZD2171 once daily beginning on day 3. Treatment
           repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both groups, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AZD2171 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
