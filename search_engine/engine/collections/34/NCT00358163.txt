           combination with the highest safe dose of Vatalanib. Therefore, not all people will
           receive the same dose of the study drug.

        -  Small groups of people will be enrolled in steps on this trial. This first group will be
           given a certain dose of Paclitaxel and Vatalanib. If they have few or manageable side
           effects, the next small group of people enrolled will receive higher doses of the study
           drugs. This increase in doses will continue until the study doctors find the highest
           dose of the drugs that can be given without causing severe or unmanageable side effects.

        -  In this study, Vatalanib tablets are taken daily, and paclitaxel is given by three-hour
           intravenous infusion once every 21 days.
