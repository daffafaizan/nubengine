        -  Determine the toxicity of extended field radiotherapy with concurrent paclitaxel and
           cisplatin chemotherapy (as radiation sensitization) in patients with previously
           untreated carcinoma of the cervix metastatic to the para-aortic lymph nodes.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel when combined with cisplatin plus
           extended field radiotherapy in this patient population.

        -  Determine the effect of this treatment regimen on progression-free survival, overall
           survival, and site of recurrence (local vs distant) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of paclitaxel.

      Patients receive external beam radiotherapy (RT) to the para-aortic nodes and the pelvis
      daily for 5 weeks; RT must be completed within 8 weeks of its initiation. During or after
      external beam RT, intracavitary radiation is administered 1-5 times. Concurrently with
      external beam RT, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed immediately by
      cisplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter or until the time of recurrence or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
