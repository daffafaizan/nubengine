      approved for commercial release with the Multiple Point Pacing (MPP) feature were eligible to
      contribute to the Post-Approval Study (PAS) objectives. Products with MPP capabilities
      receiving appropriate license or regulatory approval during the conduct of the PAS were
      included and contributed to the PAS objectives upon commercial release. CRT is an established
      pacing therapy for patients with heart failure (HF). CRT provides atrial- synchronized
      biventricular (BiV) pacing using standard pacing technology combined with a special third
      lead that is implanted via the coronary sinus and positioned in a cardiac vein to sense
      and/or pace the left ventricle (LV). Following a sensed atrial contraction or atrial paced
      event, both ventricles are stimulated to synchronize their contraction. The MPP feature is
      designed to allow a second LV pace to occur in LV Only or BiV pace configurations. In the LV
      Only pace configuration, the LV paces occur simultaneously or sequentially (LV- LV), as
      applicable by product. When Bi-V pacing is enabled, the RV pace can be delivered either
      before or after the LV paces, with the order determined by the programmed Ventricular Pacing
      Configuration.

      The MPP PAS was a global, prospective, observational multi-center study. Patients implanted
      with an eligible CRT Quad system were enrolled and followed in the Product Surveillance
      Registry per the expected standard of care practices of their care provider.
