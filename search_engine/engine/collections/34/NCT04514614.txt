      forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Rheumatoid arthritis is an
      autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology and is characterized by chronic
      inflammation of the joint capsule's synovial membrane. This chronic inflammation ultimately
      destroys the underlying cartilage and bone. Activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) line
      the synovial membrane and are a prominent cell type responsible for inflammation and joint
      destruction. Osteoarthritis is characterized by degradation of joint cartilage. Studies
      demonstrate chondrocytes expressed FAP and that chondrocyte FAP expression was elevated in
      patients with osteoarthritis. Other researches identified FAP expression in synovial samples
      taken from both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients. However, FAP expression was
      greater in samples taken from refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients in comparison to
      end-stage osteoarthritis patients.68Ga-FAPI has been developed as a tumor-targeting agent as
      fibroblast activation protein is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and some
      inflammation, such as IgG4-related disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Recently the
      investigators have published an article of the application of 68Ga-FAPI in IgG4-related
      disease which showed it was more sensitive than FDG in detecting a certain type of
      inflammations. Thus this prospective study is going to investigate whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT
      may be superior for diagnosis, therapy response assessment and follow-up of arthritis than
      18F-FDG PET/CT.
