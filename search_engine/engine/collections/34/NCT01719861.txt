      escalation. Starting dose will be 25 to 75 mg. The desipramine dose will be escalated until
      the maximum dose of 450 mg is reached or a maximum safe dose per subject is established.

      Dose level may be adjusted (decreased) based on cardiac or general adverse effects.
      desipramine level will be tapered if the subject experience disease progression, unless
      physician judges immediate suspension is in the subjects best interest.

      Assessments will be conducted every 28 days, and will include ECGs, physicians and blood
      samples.

      One partial and/or complete response will be sufficient to consider a larger clinical trial.
