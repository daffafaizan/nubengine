      medium of the human embryo correlates with the quality and reproductive potential of embryos
      in ICSI cycles and, thus, to look for a new non invasive tool of assessing embryo quality
      beside morphological assessment. Determining a rapid, noninvasive method for the assessment
      of the developmental potential of embryos may be a great achievement
