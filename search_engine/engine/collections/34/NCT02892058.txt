    
      Chronologically, the development of a Flare-OA (osteoarthritis) tool will be addressed in the
      first part of the project (Part 1) and its psychometric validity was evaluated in the second
      part (Part 2).

      Part 1 of the project: The development of the Flare-OA tool will be conducted in several
      steps, and needs multiple proficiencies in qualitative research (health psychologist), in
      quantitative research (epidemiologist, psychometrician), in experience of the disease
      (patients), and in experience of care of the disease (health care professionals).

      Two approaches will be taken to define the construct of a flare in lower limb OA: A review of
      the literature, and the development of a conceptual framework informed by the results of the
      literature. To help define/conceptualize the construct "Flare in OA" a procedure will be
      implemented to identify (what are the key variables, or symptoms, that get worse) and clarify
      (how exactly these variables are described in the literature, by patients, and by clinicians.

      Participants :

        1. - Patients should be representative of the disease spectrum, i.e. of prevalent cases.
           They will be recruited in clinical settings and epidemiological sources.

        2. - Health care professionals (HCP) will include General Practitioners, Rheumatologists,
           Rehabilitation specialists, Orthopaedic surgeons, Nurse in general practice or
           orthopedic wards, Physiotherapists.
