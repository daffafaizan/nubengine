      anticipated) and a prospective part(7000 samples anticipated). In the retrospective part,
      investigators collected subjects with mammary images to design the deep learning method and
      construct a detective and diagnostic model for breast lesions. In the prospective part,
      investigators validate the accuracy of the constructed deep learning method, and established
      artificial intelligence system focusing on mammary diagnosis. Investigators will also explore
      the application pattern of the artificial intelligence system in clinical practice.
