    
      Hyperpolarized Xenon-129 MRI has been developed by a number of techniques for imaging the
      lung that provide information about various aspects of lung function and structure. The main
      objective of this pilot study is to test and optimize the imaging parameters for a future
      industry sponsored clinical trial. The goal of the future trial is to determine the
      concordance between hyperpolarized xenon-129 ventilation MR imaging and nuclear medicine
      ventilation imaging (Gold Standard). In this study we will test the imaging parameters and
      techniques. We will directly compare human ventilation lung images in subjects with COPD,
      using nuclear medicine ventilation imaging with Xenon-133 gas scintigraphy versus
      hyperpolarized xenon-129 gas MRI. Our hypothesis is that current Xe-133 scintigraphy, which
      uses a radioactive gas (Xe-133) and produces a projection image of the lungs with relatively
      poor resolution, will not be able to detect small lung ventilation obstructions, which can be
      detected using hyperpolarized Xe-129 gas MRI.
