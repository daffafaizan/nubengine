      called monocytes, which have been engineered to express a cytomegalovirus (CMV) protein.

      The monocyte vaccines are made from the patient's own cells, which are collected through a
      procedure called leukapheresis. During leukapheresis, the patient's blood is collected into a
      machine that removes white blood cells and then returns the remainder of the blood back to
      the individual. The leukapheresis procedure is not typically associated with any discomfort
      or pain. The white blood cells collected from leukapheresis are used to generate the
      patient's monocyte vaccine. After leukapheresis, patients receive standard radiation therapy
      combined with temozolomide for about 6 weeks, followed by one cycle of temozolomide for 21
      days. About 2 days later, patients will receive the first monocyte vaccine, followed by 2
      more monocyte vaccines every 4 weeks.
