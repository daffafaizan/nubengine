      in Europe and the USA. The FOLFIRINOX protocol has become the standard medical treatment for
      this pathology. However, FOLFIRINOX is the cause of severe toxicities dominated by
      leuko-neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, nausea-vomiting, anorexia, asthenia, weight
      loss and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Therefore, its indication is limited to patients in
      good general condition with a Performance Status of 0 or 1 (WHO classification). In practice,
      it is interrupted upon the occurrence of grade 3-4 toxicities, hematological and / or
      clinical, which very often causes deterioration in the performance status and quality of life
      of patients.

      To date, there is no prospective study assessing the qualitative and quantitative impact of
      FOLFIRINOX in real time on the daily life of patients with pancreatic cancer. Such monitoring
      would allow early identification of the deterioration or improvement in the health of these
      fragile patients while they are not hospitalized, and trigger proactive interventions when
      necessary, in order to avoid rapid deterioration of the patient leading to hospitalization
      and often to the interruption of a generally effective treatment.

      It is in this context that the study presented here proposes to monitor the rhythms, symptoms
      and body weight of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer during the month following the
      1st cycle of FOLFIRINOX in conventional administration using the platform. PiCADo mobile.
