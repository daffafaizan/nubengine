      Primary

        -  To evaluate and compare the treatment set-up accuracy of customized vs standard headrest
           in immobilizing patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

        -  To determine and compare patient comfort with the two immobilization techniques.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate radiation therapists' satisfaction with the two immobilization techniques.

        -  To examine and compare the cost effectiveness of the two immobilization techniques.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are immobilized using the standard thermoplastic four-point fixation
           mask and the standard headrest system. Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy as per standard of care.

        -  Arm II: Patients are immobilized using the standard thermoplastic four-point fixation
           mask and the customized headrest system. Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy as per standard of care.

      Patients score their comfort using the Visual Analogue Scale during the course of
      radiotherapy. Radiation therapists complete an evaluation questionnaire for each treatment
      planning and procedure.
