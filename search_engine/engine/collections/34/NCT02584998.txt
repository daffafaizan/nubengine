      and effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in the VA by developing, implementing
      and disseminating a pilot mailed-FIT screening outreach program that does not rely on having
      a clinical office visit. The investigators specifically address the need to identify and
      remediate potential failures to identify and offer screening to eligible Veterans through
      multilevel interventions. The investigators will also create electronic data linkages to, in
      future studies, enable evaluation of FIT performance characteristics and help close critical
      evidence gaps for optimizing screening among Veterans. As this is a pilot study, the focus is
      to assess feasibility of a population-based screening outreach approach through the
      development, implementation and dissemination of a mailed FIT outreach program in the
      Philadelphia VA Medical Center that does not rely on having an office visit.
