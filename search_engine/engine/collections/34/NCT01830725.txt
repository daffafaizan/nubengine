      (XO) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 2107A>G to the dose of allopurinol needed to reach
      a goal serum uric acid level of 6 mg/dL or less. This study had some limitations but suggests
      that specific SNPs could be related to dose of allopurinol needed to treat.

      Objective: To determine the relationship of multiple purine enzyme SNPs of genes encoding
      PRPS1, HPRT1, and XO to the dose of xanthine oxidase inhibitor needed to achieve a goal
      treatment uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL. Another primary outcome will be to determine
      relationship of two XO SNPs to hyperuricemia/gout. A secondary outcome will be to determine
      the frequency of these SNPs tested.

      Design: Patients will be consented for enrollment in either the gout/hyperuricemia group or a
      control group. Control group patients will have neither gout nor hyperuricemia. No patients
      will be enrolled if they are overproducers of uric acid. It is anticipated that 200 patients
      will be enrolled in each group for a total of 400 patients over the next 2 years.
