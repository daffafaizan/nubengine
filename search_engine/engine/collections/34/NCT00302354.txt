      moderated by the oral delivery system in which a longer delivery system may be safer than the
      immediate release one. OROS-MPH's pharmacokinetic profile uses an increasing delivery of MPH
      over the day (ascending pharmacokinetic curve). It was designed to replace IR-MPH TID
      treatment. Another new long-acting MPH formulation is the spheroidal oral drug absorption
      system (SODAS). SODAS-MPH consists of capsules with two types of beads in a 1 to 1 ratio.
      Evaluating whether different long acting formulations of MPH will differ in their rate of
      onset of MPH action (plasma level) is of high clinical, scientific and public health
      relevance. Since the rate of delivery of MPH is a key factor previously associated with
      detection and likeability of MPH.
