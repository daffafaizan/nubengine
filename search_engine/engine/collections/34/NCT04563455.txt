      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the current literature; it has been shown that grip endurance
      is associated with upper limb functions. However, there is no study investigating the
      relationship between grip endurance and quality of life in patients with RA. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate the relationship between grip endurance, disability of upper
      extremity, and quality of life in patients with RA.
