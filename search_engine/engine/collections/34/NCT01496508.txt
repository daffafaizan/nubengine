      ventilator settings, and arterial blood gases pre- or during mechanical ventilation.
      PaO2/FIO2 was calculated. After 2 hours ventilation, if PaO2/FIO2 <200, patients were given
      rescue surfactant therapy (Curosurf 200mg/kg). A subsequent dose (100mg/kg) was administered
      when PaO2/FIO2 <200 12 hours after the previous dose. Surfactant was administered with use of
      in-line catheters. Suctioning was performed 6 hours after surfactant administration, except
      for some patients needed suction soon, with use of an in-line suction catheter. Ventilation
      continued during the administration of surfactant and suctioning.
