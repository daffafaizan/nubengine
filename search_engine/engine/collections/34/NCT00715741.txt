      of the effect of intraoperative increased inspired oxygen used (FiO2>0.9 vs. FiO2 = 0.3) on
      non-invasive oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry, SpO2) and amount of required supplemental
      oxygen in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU); arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) after
      45 minutes in the PACU; room air SpO2 24 hours after surgery, and amount of supplemental
      oxygen required 24 hours after surgery. The purpose of the study is to determine whether
      absorption atelectasis induced by use of inspired oxygen concentrations in excess of 90%
      leads to a higher risk of hypoxemia, as evidenced by room air oxygen values and the need for
      supplemental oxygen. The objective of this study is to determine whether high inspired oxygen
      (>0.8), which has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of surgical site infection in patients
      undergoing colon surgery and other major surgical procedures has side effects that limit its
      use to prevent infection in lower risk operations.

      There are four groups of intraoperative ventilation management in this study. Fi02 0.3 plus
      PEEP, Fi02 0.3 without PEEP, Fi02 greater than 0.9 plus PEEP 3 to 5 cm of water, Fi02 greater
      than 0.9 without PEEP.
