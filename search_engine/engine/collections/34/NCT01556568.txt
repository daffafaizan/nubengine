      present study is to determine whether the ability of MEK162 to antagonize MEK activation in
      NS HCM patients, who usually have upstream mutations in the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway that lead
      to MEK activation, would be beneficial over a 6 month treatment period by causing hypertrophy
      regression. Such regression might result in cardiovascular clinical benefits with longer term
      treatment.

      The information gained from this study will be three fold:

        1. the safety/tolerability of treatment with MEK162 over 6 month in the NS HCM patient
           population

        2. the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MEK162 in the target patient population

        3. proof of the therapeutic concept that MEK inhibition will reduce cardiac hypertrophy in
           the target NS HCM patient population
