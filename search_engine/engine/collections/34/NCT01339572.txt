      autologous stem cell transplants. Unfortunately, there is still a 20-30% chance that
      inadequate numbers of stem cells will be collected, resulting in prolonged recovery of cell
      counts after transplantation and increased transfusion dependence. There is also a
      significant economic burden associated with remobilization and a risk that delays in
      collecting sufficient numbers of stem cells can result in an increased chance of disease
      recurrence prior to transplantation.
