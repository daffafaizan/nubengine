      response marker and lend support to mrTRG as a putative prognostic tool in the treatment
      pathway for rectal cancer patients. Even though this is a retrospective study, the
      investigators hope that pre-treatment apoptotic and proliferative scores will correlate to
      post treatment response and mrTRG scores. In doing so, the investigators can predict how
      patients will respond to treatment from initial diagnostic biopsies and foresee a patients
      individual treatment plan.
