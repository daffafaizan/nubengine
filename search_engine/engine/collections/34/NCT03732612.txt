      excised. The excised vessel is generally discarded as medical waste: however, for patients
      participating in the study, the excised tissue will be placed in saline and collected for
      research use.

      Tissue collected from individuals undergoing vascular surgery associated with peripheral
      arterial diseases, aneurysm and/or other manifestations of atherosclerosis, vascular tissue
      will be cultured ex vivo in the presence or absence of therapeutic agents, to determine if
      these attenuate the inflammation associated with the atherosclerotic phenotype. Furthermore,
      the protocol will also be carried out using vascular tissue from control patients, which have
      undergone vascular surgery that is not associated with vascular disease (e.g. knee
      replacement surgery, trauma, etc).
