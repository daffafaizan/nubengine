      arms:

        -  Topotecan

        -  Docetaxel

      For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (Topotecan) and 1 will receive
      treatment B (Docetaxel). The study is not blinded so both the patient and the doctor will
      know which treatment has been assigned.
