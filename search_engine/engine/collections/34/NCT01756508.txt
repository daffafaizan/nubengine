      upregulation with ischemic reperfusion injury, it is hypothesized that C5 cleavage is a key
      step in the pathogenesis of ischemic reperfusion injury following transplantation. It was
      further hypothesized that eculizumab, antibody that blocks C5 cleavage in humans will be an
      effective prophylactic agent to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury in high risk recipients.
      For testing this hypothesis, this study is a pilot prospective study to test the efficacy of
      eculizumab in preventing the development of reperfusion injury and contribute graft survival.
