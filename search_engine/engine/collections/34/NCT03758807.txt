      about interventions performed. A recent randomized clinical trial demonstrated that a
      10-minute manual therapy treatment (prone lumbar Posterior to Anterior mobilization (PA's)
      with a neuroplasticity vs. traditional biomechanical explanation) produced an immediate,
      significant improvement in straight leg raise (SLR) and pain for patients with chronic low
      back pain. However, there is a need to examine whether there is any carry over (48-96 hours)
      or if utilizing a home exercise program (HEP), aimed at increasing the various sensory
      process applied in the clinic, produces any carry over. This will be looked at in patients
      with who are provided different explanations about common back treatment techniques to see if
      there will be any change in pain rating or back and leg movement.
