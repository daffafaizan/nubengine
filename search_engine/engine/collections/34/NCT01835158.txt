      I. To determine if patients with renal cancer treated with cabozantinib
      (cabozantinib-s-malate) will have improved progression-free survival compared to patients
      treated with sunitinib (sunitinib malate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the response rate of patients with renal cancer treated with
      cabozantinib will be higher when compared with patients treated with sunitinib.

      II. To determine whether patients with renal cancer treated with cabozantinib will have an
      improved overall survival when compared with patients treated with sunitinib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether renal cancer patients with high MET expression by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) have improvement in progression-free survival compared to patients
      with low MET expression on both arms of this study.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive sunitinib malate PO QD for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
