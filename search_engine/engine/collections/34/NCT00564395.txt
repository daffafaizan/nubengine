      daily insulin injections. Mixing rapid-acting (detemir) and slow- acting insulins (aspart) in
      the same syringe would decrease the number of injections and may improve adherence

      This study hypothesized that slow-acting insulin detemir mixed with aspart would have
      equivalent effects on blood glucose versus giving them as separate injections in children
      with type 1 diabetes.

      Eighteen pediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes (11 males and 7 females) were recruited.
      However only 14 subjects completed this 20-day, randomized, crossover, and open-labeled
      study. The subjects were randomly assigned to either Study A (both insulin detemir and rapid
      acting insulin (RAI)) or Study B (either detemir or aspart) for the first 10 days. They were
      then crossed over for the last 10 days. Each subject underwent 72 h of continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) during the last 72 h, for both Study A and Study B.Data of 48 h from
      midnight of the 1st day to mid- night of the 3rd day of the 72-h (CGM) were used for analysis
      to ensure the same starting and ending times of monitoring for all subjects.Sustained glucose
      values over time were calculated as area under the curve (AUC), index of blood glucose
      control as M-value and glucose excursion as mean amplitude of glucose excursion (MAGE)
