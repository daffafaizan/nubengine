      Levonorgestrel is a form of progesterone, a female hormone involved in conception. It can be
      given as both a pill and an injection and is used for contraception and for the treatment of
      endometriosis. However, evidence suggests that St. John's wort may reduce the effectiveness
      of the contraceptive hormone levonorgestrel. This study will determine whether interactions
      between St. John's wort and levonorgestrel reduce the effectiveness of the hormone. This
      study will also determine whether a higher dose of levonorgestrel will override the effects
      of St. John's wort.

      All participants will receive a single dose of levonorgestrel between Days 9 and 12 of their
      first menstrual cycle after entering this study. Blood and urine collection will occur
      immediately after the levonorgestrel is given and every week until participants' next
      menstrual cycle to determine the levels of reproductive hormones in participants' bodies.

      At the beginning of participants' next menstrual cycle, they will be randomly assigned to one
      of four groups and receive either St. John's wort or placebo for 6 weeks. Group 1 will
      receive a placebo; Groups 2 and 3 will receive a standard dose of St. John's wort (900 mg per
      day); and Group 4 will receive an increased dose of St. John's wort (1500 mg per day). After
      6 weeks, Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive 150 mcg levonorgestrel; and Group 3 will receive 225
      mcg levonorgestrel. Blood and urine collection will occur immediately after levonorgestrel is
      given and every week until participants' next menstrual cycle.
