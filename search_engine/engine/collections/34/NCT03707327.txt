      the data collection will be started and performed in the teaching laboratory of the
      Physiotherapy course of the State University of Londrina.

      Initially, the demographic data of the sample (age, height, weight, limb and time of pain)
      and signature of the consent term will be collected.

      After this step, the participants should point to the Visual Analogue Scale (EVA) and the
      Patellofemoral Disorders Scale (AKPS). Before performing the cryotherapy technique, the basal
      skin temperature in the anterior region of the knee will be recorded by means of a
      thermographic camera, and the participants will be submitted to five sets of the sit and
      stand test in 30 ', with rest of one minute between them. They will then re-signal the EVA
      and the skin temperature will be retained by the camera. Finally, they will undergo the
      application of cryotherapy according to the category which has been "randomized".

      The two different intervention techniques will be:

        -  Ice pack group (CPG): where the participant will have a plastic bag containing 500 grams
           of crushed ice over the anterior region of the knee, and lie flat with the lower limb
           extended and supported on the ground for 20 minutes;

        -  Group Cryotherapy + Compression by Game ReadyÂ® (CCGR): where the participant will have
           the knee joint wrapped and compressed by the equipment where temperature, compression
           and time will be controlled, maximum compression, for 20 minutes by the equipment
           itself; lie in the same manner as for the other intervention.

      Immediately thereafter, the EVA will be applied and the skin surface temperature recorded in
      the knee region, as well as 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes thereafter.
