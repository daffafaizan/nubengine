      to normal skin or to progress to squamous cell carcinoma. Ingenol mebutate gel is a
      relatively new topical treatment option for AK in Greece.

      Taking into consideration the limited real-world evidence that is attributed to the recent
      advent of Picato in the Greek market, this non-interventional observational study aims
      primarily at assessing the characteristics of patients selected for this treatment, the
      effectiveness and tolerability of the treatment, patient satisfaction and the impact of the
      therapy on patients' HRQoL in standard clinical practice.The study will be carried out by
      approximately 30 physicians practicing in private or public hospitals and clinics in
      representative geographical regions of Greece.
