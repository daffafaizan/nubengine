    
      Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of everolimus
      (EVL) combined with low dose of Tacrolimus in comparison with Mycophenolate Sodium (MPS)
      combined with standard dose of Tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy for elderly recipients
      of kidney transplantation.

      Comparison between the two study arms of:

      Primary Objective:

      1. Composite efficacy failure demonstrated by graft loss and/or death with functional graft
      and/or GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate determined by EDTA-Cr51) < 50 ml/min at the end of
      first year after transplantation and every year until the fifth year.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Pharmacokinetic study of immunosuppressive drugs (Tacrolimus, Everolimus and
           Mycophenolate Sodium) in the study population at days 7, 30, 60, 67, 90 and 180
           post-transplant.

        2. Serious adverse events (as internationally defined by ICH-GCP) every year, for five
           years.

        3. Biopsy proven acute rejection rated every year, for five years.

        4. Identify which of the renal filtration markers existing today, Cystatin C or Serum
           Creatinine, is more adequate to monitor renal function in elderly transplant and to
           develop abbreviated equations for eGFR from day 7 on.

        5. Evaluation of other metabolic effects (bone density at month 12 post-transplant; vitamin
           D at months 2 and 12 post-transplant; and gonadal function at months 1 and 12
           post-transplant) and Quality of Life at months 1, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60
           post-transplant in the study population.

        6. Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) and Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by
           echocardiography at the end of the first year.
