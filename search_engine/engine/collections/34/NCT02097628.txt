      silicone-based single-use extraglottic airway device that forms a seal with the glottis for
      ventilation and with the hypopharynx for airway protection, and provides a gastric drainage
      port. The aim of the following perspective, randomized, blind trial study id to compare how
      the volume-controlled ventilation and pressure-controlled ventilation modes using the
      Laryngeal Mask Guardian affect the pulmonary mechanics, the gas exchange and the
      cardiovascular responses particularly in obese patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopy.
