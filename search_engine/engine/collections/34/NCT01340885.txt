      PD progresses. Attention deficits in PD patients with dementia strongly predict the
      impairment of their daily living activities.

      Previous studies have shown that atomoxetine improves PD executive dysfunction and
      rivastigmine improves attention deficits in PD patients with dementia without worsening the
      motor symptoms.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of atomoxetine and rivastigmine on attention
      and quality of life in PD patients without disabling cognitive impairment.
