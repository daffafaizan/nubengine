      some evidence that in cardiac surgery, sleep disturbance can lead to delayed recovery and
      mental status changes in the postoperative period. There are no similar reports of studies
      after thoracic surgery. We think that increased activity after surgery is beneficial for a
      rapid recovery and prevents blood clots, pneumonia and deconditioning. Without specific data
      this is difficult to prove.
