      analysis. In the standard footwear (SF) group, plantar orthoses, standard footwear and
      education on foot self-care were applied and in the orthopedic footwear (OF) group the same
      intervention was applied, but with orthopedic footwear.

      Both intervention groups were evaluated at two different time points, with the pre-test
      taking place at the beginning of the study (T0 - Baseline) and the post-test taking place 4
      months after the application of the treatment (T4). In the middle of the study, at two months
      (T2) a questionnaire was applied in order to understand the adherence and the perception of
      individuals about the intervention applied.

      The screening of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was made with the Michigan Neuropathy
      Screening Instrument (MNSI) and the description of the sample with an evaluation
      questionnaire.

      The FL was evaluated through the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), physical tests and
      the postural, static and dynamic barometric assessment. QoL was assessed with SF-36 and the
      adherence and satisfaction with a questionnaire created ad hoc.
