    
      This is a proof of concept study to evaluate the efficacy of nitazoxanide (600 mg BID) to
      treat hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19.

      The aim is to demonstrate a decrease in hospital related complications among patients who are
      hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 by treating them with nitazoxanide for 7 days on top of
      standard care compared to patients who receive standard care and placebo.

      Patients hospitalized with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to receive
      either nitazoxanide or placebo.
