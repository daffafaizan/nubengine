        -  Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a multi-level telehealth-based intervention for
           rural hospitals consisting of provider access to tumor board expertise that incorporates
           disease, patient and molecular tumor characteristics, together with patient access to a
           supportive care intervention to improve cancer care delivery.

        -  Evaluate the facilitators and barriers to future larger-scale dissemination and
           implementation of the multi-level intervention, designed to enhance quality rural cancer
           care delivery.
