      in the throat is very important for swallowing safely. Laryngotracheal anesthetic (LTA, or
      topical application of lidocaine anesthetic to larynx and trachea) is needed for a variety of
      in-office laryngology procedures, including examination of the air passage, or
      tracheobronchoscopy. This causes a temporary decrease in sensation that can affect swallow
      function and result in aspiration (passage of swallowed material into lungs instead of into
      esophagus and stomach). It is not known how long this effect lasts. It would be helpful to
      know this for counseling patients on when they can resume swallowing after a procedure. In
      general, most patients are advised to avoid eating/drinking for 90 minutes after their
      procedure to allow for sensation to return. To date, there has been no study characterizing
      the time required for return of aspiration-free swallow after LTA.
