      of urinary catheters. The Connected Catheter is fully internal, indwelling urinary prosthesis
      designed for improved bladder management in males with urinary retention disorders requiring
      catheterization. Each subject will use the Connected Catheter for up to 35-40 days. This
      includes five device exchange appointments. The appointments are spaced 7 days apart and at
      each appointment the catheter will be replaced with a new one. Additionally, weekly follow-up
      will occur for 14 days following the final appointment after the subject discontinues use of
      study device and reverts to his original catheter.
