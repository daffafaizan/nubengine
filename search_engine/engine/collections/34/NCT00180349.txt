      characteristics, device implantation-related adverse events and device programming at the
      time of hospital discharge. Patients were subsequently divided in two groups: patients who
      underwent VF induction at implantation or before hospital discharge(VF induction group); and
      patients who did not undergo VF induction (untested group).The patients were followed up at
      3-6 months and at12 months after the implantation. VF induction procedures were left to the
      investigator's discretion, but reasons for not performing a VF induction at implantation were
      recorded prospectively. ICD programming parameters for tachycardia or bradycardia were also
      left at the investigator's discretion.
