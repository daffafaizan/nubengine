      literature shows that antiretroviral regimens that do not include a nucleoside backbone of
      tenofovir resulted in less bone and kidney toxicity. Atazanavir dosing 200/100 mg qd
      represents a simplification strategy correlated with virologic efficacy and a reduction of
      parameters toxicity associated. Maraviroc is suggested as a possible drug associated to PI/r
      in dual therapies. Even in this case, the available evidence supports the choice of the
      dosage of 300 mg/day.
