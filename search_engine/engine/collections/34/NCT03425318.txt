      and children. It has a high mortality and there is no specific therapy. The mortality is high
      (approx. 40% in severe cases) and this has not changed in the last 20 years.

      Mechanical ventilation is the mainstay of management, and this assists the patient by
      increasing oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. Despite optimizing tidal volume,
      driving pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), patients with ARDS develop
      large areas of atelectasis and poor oxygenation. There are few additional ventilator
      approaches that have proven to be useful in preventing this type of injury.

      A major aim of ventilator support is recruitment of atelectatic (i.e. de-airated) lung, but
      while this is supported by excellent rational and laboratory data, the conventional clinical
      approaches have not been associated with a demonstrable improvement in patient outcome. Most
      atelectasis in ARDS occurs in the dorsal (dependant, lower-most) lung regions, and these are
      near the diaphragm.

      The main ways to recruit lung are to increase the airway distending pressure (but this
      over-expands and damages the already-aerated lung regions); or, to turn the patient into the
      prone position (but clinicians are reluctant to utilize this approach - despite evidence that
      it may increase survival).

      Continuous Negative Abdominal Pressure (CNAP) aims to selectively recruit basal atelectatic
      areas of lung, while enabling the patient to remain in the supine (usual) position.
