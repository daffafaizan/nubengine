      from Jan 2013 to December 2016 will be retrieved from the histopathology files by conducting
      a search through CoPath. The glass slides of all the neck dissections that fit the study
      criterion will be retrieved from the archives. The glass slides will be reviewed by the
      pathologist.

      At the time of review number of lymph nodes identified microscopically, presence or absence
      of metastasis and if the Lymph Nodes (LN) were palpable or not palpable will be documented.
      The data will be analyzed to see if the submission of extra fat yielded any additional
      positive lymph nodes or microscopic deposits. The cost analysis for additional slides will be
      also done.
