      I. To identify molecular indicators in malignant tissues from patients who were exceptional
      responders on clinical trials or standard systemic treatments using whole exome and/or
      targeted deep sequencing, as well as potentially other sequencing and other molecular
      characterization methods (if adequate tissue exists).

      II. To explore associations between the identified molecular indicators and the putative
      mechanism of action of the treatment received by the patient.

      III. To test the feasibility of identifying "exceptional responders", obtaining the relevant
      tumor and normal tissue and clinical data, and performing whole exome and/or targeted deep
      sequencing on these samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via whole exome sequencing and/or targeted
      next generation sequencing (NGS) assay deep sequencing. Cases for which sufficient nucleic
      acid amounts are available will undergo additional analyses including whole genome
      sequencing, messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) (mRNA)-sequencing, micro (miRNA) sequencing,
      promoter methylation analysis, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.
