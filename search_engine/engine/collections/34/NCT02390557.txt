        1. To work with persons with significant physical disabilities and serious and persistent
           mental illness to develop two new approaches to assess quality of care:

           Approach #1: We will survey enrollees about their experiences in One Care and their
           thoughts about the care they receive. This survey will also ask One Care enrollees about
           how they manage their care and what self-direction means to them. The survey will be
           called the Persons with Disabilities Quality Survey (PDQ-S), and it will be available in
           English and Spanish versions.

           Approach #2: Enrollees in One Care will provide information about their perceptions of
           care quality to a trained team of persons with disabilities who will report the
           information to One Care care teams. The goal of the activity is to support quality
           improvement in One Care through hearing the consumer's voice. This is called YES Health
           - Your Experience: Speak up for better health care.

        2. We want to test how providing consumer informed and consumer directed quality
           information to One Care providers affects One Care quality.

        3. We want to improve the ability of One Care enrollees to manage their own health care and
           to recognize and report quality problems
