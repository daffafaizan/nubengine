      intends to implant approximately 45 male and female subjects over 18 years old who have been
      diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). All subjects are
      required to meet eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening). The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety of the implantation and exchange of a Travoprost Intraocular Implant in
      subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Postoperatively, there are 6
      follow-up visits over a 12 month period.
