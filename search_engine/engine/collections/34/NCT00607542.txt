      adults and in children, there is very little data regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) or
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of baclofen in children. Therefore, pediatric guidelines,
      including dose ranges, dosing schedules, dose escalation strategies and anticipated side
      effects are extrapolated from adult data and require an assumption that safety and efficacy
      in children is comparable to that in adults. Furthermore, there is wide variability in dosing
      strategies among practitioners who treat children with cerebral palsy (CP) with respect to
      starting doses, maximum doses and rates of dose escalation.Establishment of safe and
      effective dosing strategies for children with CP requires an understanding of the PK and PD
      properties of baclofen in children and recognition of individual differences that may
      contribute to divergent clinical responses to baclofen among children with CP.
