    
      Study TAS-120-202 is an open-label, multinational, 3-arm Phase 2 study evaluating the
      efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of futibatinib in patients with FGFR
      aberrations. Eligible patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts based on
      diagnosis and FGFR gene aberration status.

      Patients will receive futibatinib at an oral dose of 20 mg once a day on a continuous 28-day
      cycle.

      The study will enroll approximately:

        -  Cohort A: 60 patients with locally advanced, advanced, or metastatic solid tumor
           harboring FGFR rearrangements other than primary brain tumor or iCCA;

        -  Cohort B: 35 patients with locally-advanced, advanced, or metastatic gastric cancer or
           gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) with FGFR2 amplification;

        -  Cohort C: 20 patients with myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms (MLN) with FGFR1 rearrangements
           Treatment in all cohorts will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
           or any other of the criteria for treatment discontinuation is met. For patients who
           discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, tumor assessments
           should be continued until radiologic disease progression is documented or until
           initiation of subsequent new anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first).

      Patients will be followed for survival every 12 weeks (Â±2 weeks) until survival events
      (deaths) have been reported for 75% of enrolled patients or the study is terminated early by
      the Sponsor.

      Additional cohorts may be added in the future in case of new emerging efficacy data
