      patients who will participate in two study periods of two-month duration with an insulin pump
      and a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device. During one of these periods, called HYBRID
      Period, the patient will use the AP model when at home, from dinner to wake-up time whereas
      the patient will self manage glucose control with insulin pump and CGM for the rest of the
      day. During the control period called OPEN Period, patient self management of diabetes by
      insulin pump and CGM will be done at all times. Overall, an increase of time spent in range
      when using artificial pancreas in the hybrid period should be observed with a reduction of
      both hypo and hyperglycemia episodes.
