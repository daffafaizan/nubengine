      for IPF and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). This double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, single and multiple oral dose study will be conducted in 3 parts. Part A
      will comprise a single-dose, sequential-group design in healthy subjects, incorporating a
      food-effect evaluation. Part B will consist of a multiple-dose, sequential-group design in
      healthy subjects. Part C will be a multiple-dose, sequential-group design in subjects with
      IPF.
