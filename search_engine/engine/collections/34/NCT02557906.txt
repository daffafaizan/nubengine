      there is limited prospective or high quality evidence on the outcomes of their use. The
      majority of studies on ADM are poor quality retrospective cohort studies with ill-defined,
      non-standardised outcome measures and heterogeneous patient populations. Recent systematic
      reviews have raised concerns of increased infection and seroma rates associated with ADM use
      which, if correct, may negate their reported advantages. Furthermore there is little high
      quality evidence to confirm the benefits associated with their use such as improved aesthetic
      outcomes.

      The POBRAD-M is a prospective, multicentre trial which will evaluate the early and late
      outcomes of immediate breast reconstruction using either an implant and ADM, autologous
      tissue or an alternative implant-based technique. All participants must have been deemed
      suitable at the outset for implant based reconstruction with an ADM irrespective of their
      final procedure choice. All participants will be followed up at 30 days, 3 months and 12
      months to record the incidence of complications (to include implant loss, infection, seroma,
      haematoma and skin necrosis). Additionally Patient Reported Outcomes measures using the
      BREAST-Q questionnaire will be determined at 30 days and 12 months, and aesthetic outcome
      will be determined by panel assessment of post-operative photographs at 12 months
      post-operatively.
