      greater than 8 weeks and up to and including their 18th birthday are enrolled. Patients were
      randomly assigned to one of two study groups: video + written fever specific discharge
      instructions and only written fever specific discharge instructions. Parents assigned to the
      video group watched the DVD in the emergency department (ED) and take it home along with the
      written instructions. At 72 hours both groups received a phone call asking whether they
      returned to the ED and the usefulness of discharge instructions (DVD and/or written).
      Critically ill children and those with chronic medical conditions were excluded. The primary
      outcome is a return ED visit for fever confirmed in our electronic medical record and
      questionnaire response. The secondary outcome is reported parental usefulness of the
      discharge instructions.
