      vitrectomy may be indicated for the management of advanced proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy. Early post-vitrectomy hemorrhage in diabetic patients is relatively common; it
      occurs in 29% -75% of patients in the first month after surgery. This may cause delayed
      visual rehabilitation and detection of surgical complications such as retinal break or
      detachment. Preliminary reports such as case series reported by Spaide RF, et al showed
      beneficial effect of bevacizumab in proliferative diabetic retinopathy complicated by
      vitreous hemorrhage.
