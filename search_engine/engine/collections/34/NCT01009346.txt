      recurrent/metastatic SCCHN. Patients with ECOG performance status 0-2, with no prior systemic
      therapy for recurrent/metastatic SCCHN were enrolled. The dose levels for RAD001 were 2.5mg,
      5mg or 10 mg administered oral daily, cetuximab 250mg/m2 weekly infusion, and cisplatin
      40mg/m2 days 1 and 8. Each cycle was 28 days. Safety monitoring plan was outlined in the
      protocol and study calendar at specific time points. Response was evaluated with CT/MRI and
      PET scans every 2 cycles. DLT criteria and MTD was defined.

      Dose escalation followed the conventional 3+3 design.
