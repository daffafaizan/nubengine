      injury, but only recently has it been extended, in the US, to children so affected. Numerous
      trials indicate that BWSTT does improve human gait patterns in adults. As children have more
      neuroplasticity than adults, we believe they should respond well to BWSTT.

      The BWSTT uses a counterweight harness system to unload the patient's body weight while he or
      she is on a treadmill. The patient's legs are manually moved by trained therapists through
      the human gait cycle while maintaining a correct upright posture. Functional and social
      re-integration outcome assessments are administered before and after each treatment period.

      The aim, this year, is to recruit five children who have been living with a spinal cord
      injury for at least 12 months. The 12-month timeframe was chosen to limit any gait
      improvement from spontaneous recovery as well as to ensure medical stability.

      The study will be conducted over a nine-week period. There are two three-week training
      sessions separated by a three-week rest period. The BWSTT therapy will be held twice daily
      for 30 minute sessions. The children and their families return home between the two training
      periods and are allowed to continue any conventional physiotherapy program they started prior
      to participating in the study. Outcomes will be re-evaluated during the second three-week
      training period.
