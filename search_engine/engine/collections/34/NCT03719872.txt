      perforation of a hollow viscous organ such as stomach or intestine. While definitively
      identified by computed tomography, this diagnostic test can be delayed. Presence of air
      beneath the diaphragm on an upright chest or abdominal radiograph can allow for faster
      diagnosis, but again can present limitations in terms of timing.

      Bedside clinician performed ultrasound has become standard practice in emergency medicine and
      critical care settings. Traditionally, air is not conducive to diagnostic ultrasound, but the
      artifacts it creates can be used to give clues about certain conditions. Recently this
      artifact has been proposed as a means to identify free peritoneal air. Several small studies
      have shown promise for the technique, but further investigation is warranted.

      In this study the investigators will generate a database of standardized abdominal ultrasound
      images in subjects undergoing laparoscopic surgery. During this surgery, the peritoneal
      cavity is intentionally insufflated with air. The majority of this is removed at the end of
      the case, but small volumes of air remain, as evidence by the presence of air on CT scan when
      performed shortly after surgery.

      The investigators will obtain a standardized set of images preoperatively and post
      operatively which will then be reviewed in a blinded fashion by three expert reviewers, one
      each from radiology, surgery and emergency medicine, with data analysis to determine
      sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for free air.
