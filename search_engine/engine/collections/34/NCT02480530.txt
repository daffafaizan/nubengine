    
      Patients with coronary artery disease and previous poor adherence to statin medications will
      be recruited at Philadelphia VA Medical Center. Enrolled participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of three arms:

        1. Control Group

        2. Individual Alarm device and feedback report

        3. Individual plus patient-selected Feedback Friend report

      Patients will be given a medication-monitoring device (Vitality GlowCaps) to monitor the
      statin medication that is being currently prescribed by their primary care physician. In
      first group, the control arm (Arm 1), the device reminders will be turned off but the device
      will continue recording adherence to the medications. In second group, reminder arm (Arm 2),
      the device will be programmed as an alarm that will be activated if the patient does not take
      the medication at the time set by the patient. In addition the patient will get a weekly
      report of his/her adherence. In the third group, patient-selected family/friend/or reciprocal
      peer feedback arm (Arm 3), in addition to the activation of the alarm function the device
      will be linked to a weekly report on adherence to medications. This report will be delivered
      to the patient and to the patient identified family/friend/ or reciprocal peer.
