      show that there is ongoing replication of latent virus in the blood and lymphoid tissues of
      some patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy who have had suppressed plasma HIV-1
      RNA levels for prolonged periods of time. This continued viral persistence and replication
      could eventually result in virologic failure and clinical progression as well as selection
      and transmission of resistant HIV-1. There is a need to identify, quantify, and determine
      significance of viral reservoirs in compartments other than blood. A5077 is designed to
      evaluate the relationship between viral load in blood and nonblood compartments and time to
      virologic failure in patients initiating or changing potent antiretroviral therapy.

      Patients contribute samples of blood at study entry (prior to changing or initiating potent
      antiretroviral therapy), Week 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter until Week 96, and (if
      applicable) within 30 days of confirmed virologic failure. Samples of saliva and either
      genital secretions or lymphoid tissue, or both, are collected at study entry (prior to
      changing or initiating potent antiretroviral therapy), Weeks 16, 48, and 96, and within 30
      days of confirmed virologic failure. Clinical assessments and medication updates are done at
      study visits. Blood samples are tested for HIV-1 genotypic resistance studies, HIV-1 proviral
      DNA studies, and HIV-1 quantitation. If total blood volumes exceed safe limits, blood samples
      will not be drawn for A5077 but the A5077 protocol team will request access to plasma and
      PBMC samples from any coenrolled study if applicable.
