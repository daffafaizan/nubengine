      25 cmH2O is recommended to prevent cuff over- (> 30 cmH2O) and underinflation (< 20 cmH2O),
      identified as risk factors for tracheal ischemic damage and for oropharyngeal
      microaspirations, respectively. Intermittent measurements with intermittent adjustments of
      Pcuff is the widely used strategy but, between measurements, over- and underinflation
      episodes could occur. Devices allowing a continuous control of Pcuff are therefore appealing.
      As microaspiration is the most relevant mechanism for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),
      the use of such devices may decrease the incidence of VAP for instance. To the knowledge of
      the investigators, the continuous control of Pcuff with a simple mechanical device, the
      Tracoe Smart CuffmanagerTM, has never been assessed. The investigators hypothesize that the
      Tracoe Smart CuffmanagerTM would allow a reduction of the incidence of underinflation
      episodes, as compared with the intermittent strategy of Pcuff control. As secondary
      objectives, the investigators aim to assess the impact of the use of the Tracoe Smart
      CuffmanagerTM on the incidence of overinflation episodes and on the incidence of early
      ventilator-associated pneumonia. A homogenous population will be studied for this purpose:
      patients admitted with severe acute brain damage.
