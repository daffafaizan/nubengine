    
      This is an open label, randomized, two-arm Phase 3 study in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory FL and MZL to evaluate efficacy and safety of zandelisib in combination with
      rituximab in comparison to standard immunochemotherapy (Rituximab-Bendamustine or
      Rituximab-CHOP).

      Subjects must have relapsed after at least one previous line of systemic immunochemotherapy.
      Previous treatments must have included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with
      chemotherapy such as Bendamustine (B), CHOP, CVP, FND, or similar regimens, or an anti-CD20
      mAb with Lenalidomide (L).

      Approximately 534 randomized subjects will be enrolled in this study.
