      anatomy, including the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and left colic artery (LCA),to help
      make pre-operative strategies of rectal cancer surgery.The investigators will preserving the
      left colonic artery during rectal cancer surgery and evaluate its feasibility and clinical
      significance.The investigators will focus on the effect of preserving left colonic artery
      during radical resection of rectal cancer on anastomotic leakage and oncology efficacy.
