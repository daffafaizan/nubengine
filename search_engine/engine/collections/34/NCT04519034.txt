      (COVID-19) (ECDC June 2020). According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
      Control (ECDC) risk factors for critical illness include elderly people above 70 years of
      age, and people with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular
      disease, chronic respiratory disease, immune compromised status and obesity (73.4% of
      critically ill patients with BMI 30-40). In addition, in the UK 32% of critically ill
      COVID-19 patients are of Black or Asian ethnic-minority background (ICNARC April 10th, 2020).
      There is therefore an urgent need to fully understand the risk factors for severe COVID-19
      infection and find an effective treatment. In COVID-19 infection those patients that required
      intensive care treatment have high circulating cytokines and chemokines TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6,
      IL-7, IL-9, IL-17, IFN-γ, MCP-1 and MIP-1α (Huang et al 2020). Severe COVID-19 infection
      appears therefore to be associated with a damaging hyperinflammation state (Mehta et al
      2020). In addition to a dysregulated cytokine response there is also dysregulation of immune
      cell populations in COVID-19 infection. For example, there is low T regs, NK cell and CD8+
      and CD4+ T cells in severe COVID-19 infection (Wang et al 2020 and Qin et al 2020). Moreover,
      CD8+ T cells appear to be an independent predictor for COVID-19 severity and treatment
      efficacy (Wang et al 2020).

      Other than genetic factors, e.g. HLA, which may predispose to severe COVID-19, vitamin D
      (25(OH)D) may be important for several reasons. Firstly because 25(OH)D inadequacy is
      prevalent in European and US older adults (>60 years), Black and Asian minority ethnic
      population groups and in those with a high BMI (O'Neill et al 2016, Orces et al 2019).
      Secondly because 25(OH)D is known to have important immunoregulatory roles e.g. in
      downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IFN-γ and
      upregulating anti-inflammatory TGFβ and IL-10 (Hart et al 2011). 25(OH)D also promotes Treg
      and effector CD8+ T cell differentiation and expansion (Brue and Cantorna 2011, Sherri et al
      2017, Alves et al 2018). Furthermore, 25(OH)D has a role in preventing and reducing human
      respiratory infections e.g. influenza and in experimental animals is positively associated
      with virus specific CD8+ T cells (Bergman et al 2013, Surman et al 2017, Martineau et al
      2017). Vitamin D may also be an important modulator of hyperinflammatory response in patients
      with Covid-19 infection through cytokine storm suppression (Daneshkhah et al, 2020; Huang et
      al, 2020).

      As part of the Government's response to Covid-19, Public Health England has re-issued
      existing advice on vitamin D: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/
      This study will provide important information on vitamin D status as a possible risk factor
      in relation to COVID-19 infection in UK elderly and ethnic minority populations. Furthermore,
      the data generated could also have important implications for future supplementation and or
      vaccination strategies for COVID-19.
