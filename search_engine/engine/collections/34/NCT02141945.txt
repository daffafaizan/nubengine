      the gut microbiome with colonic neoplasia. In this study patients will supply samples of
      their gut microbiome prior to scheduled colonoscopy; the relative abundance of microbes from
      those samples will be used to predict the presence or absence of colon polyps or colorectal
      cancer. Microbiome based predictions from blinded samples will be compared with colonoscopy
      and pathology results to quantify the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (reported as %)
      of the Metabiomics Colon Polyp and Colorectal Cancer Assay for colon polyps. The limited
      sample size is anticipated to be insufficient to quantify sensitivity to colorectal cancer.
