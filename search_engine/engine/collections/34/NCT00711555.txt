      emetogenic chemotherapy. Campos et al studied subjects who received their first course of
      cisplatin containing chemotherapy that included a cisplatin dose 70mg/m2 and reported that
      aprepitant in addition to granisetron and dexamethasone increased the number of subjects
      without acute or delayed emesis (p<0.01). A similar study done by Poli-Bigelli et al
      indicated that adding aprepitant to a standard antiemetic regimen increased the percentage of
      subjects without emesis and using rescue therapy during the acute phase (83% to 69%; p <
      0.001). Adding aprepitant also increased the percentage of subjects with no emesis or use of
      rescue medications in the delayed phase (68% vs. 47%, p<0.001). Although these studies
      demonstrate the benefits of aprepitant for a one day chemotherapy regimen, the benefits of
      adding aprepitant to current standard antiemetic therapy (dexamethasone plus a serotonin
      receptor antagonist) in subjects receiving multiple days of moderately-high to highly
      emetogenic chemotherapy have not been examined within a clinical study. We hypothesize that
      aprepitant with dexamethasone and a serotonin receptor antagonist from days one to two days
      after finishing chemotherapy will decrease nausea for subjects receiving chemotherapy
      regimens that include multiple days of treatment with moderately-high to highly emetogenic
      chemotherapy.
