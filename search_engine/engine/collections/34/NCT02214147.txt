      it was processed by the body in participants with advanced solid tumors or
      relapsed/refractory lymphoma with varying degrees of liver function. This study also assessed
      laboratory results and safety.

      The study enrolled 36 participants. Participants were assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups
      based on the status of their liver function: Normal hepatic function (Total bilirubin ≤ upper
      limit of the normal range [ULN] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] level ≤ ULN), moderate
      hepatic impairment (Total bilirubin > 1.5-3 x ULN and ALT level = Any), or severe hepatic
      impairment (Total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and ALT level = Any). All participants were
      administered one 50 mg dose of alisertib on Day 1, Cycle 1. Alisertib was administered again
      on Days 8 through 14 of Cycle 1, followed by a 14-day rest period. Doses administered on Days
      8-14 were 50, 30, or 20 mg of alisertib, depending on hepatic function. Alisertib was then
      continued at the same dose as in Cycle 1, Days 8-14 in 21-day cycles (7 days of alisertib
      followed by a 14-day rest period) for up to 1 year (approximately 16 cycles).

      This multicenter trial was conducted in USA only. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 312 Days. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic including an
      end-of-study visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
