      percentage of patients. Vertebroplasty has become the treatment of choice to alleviate pain
      in those patients who have not responded to medical treatment.Although several case series
      and non-randomized studies have shown the effectiveness of vertebroplasty in alleviating pain
      secondary to osteoporotic vertebral fractures, the long-term effect of this treatment has not
      been compared to standard medical treatment in a randomized study.

      In our study we have analyzed the long-term effect of vertebroplasty in terms of quality of
      life in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, randomizing them into two
      arms: percutaneous vertebroplasty or conventional medical treatment.
