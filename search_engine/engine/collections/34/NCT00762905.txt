    
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-masked multi-center clinical trial.
      Patients requiring laparoscopic surgery will be enrolled and randomized to receive either
      LiquiBand Laparoscopicâ„¢ or DermaBond High Viscosity for incision closure. No other closure
      methods will be allowed. All eligible laparoscopic incisions per patient will be enrolled.
      Patients will be followed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-procedure to assess wound
      characteristics, wound infection, wound dehiscence and at 3 months for cosmesis. The study
      will be double-masked in that both the wound evaluator and patient will be masked to the
      randomized study treatment assignment.
