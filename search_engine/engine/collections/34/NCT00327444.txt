        -  A Thirty (30)-day screening phase

        -  The double blind treatment period for a minimum of 60 days. Day 1 of the double-blind
           treatment period was defined as the date of the qualifying paracentesis (ie, withdrawal
           of >= 1 Liter of ascitic fluid). Participants were randomized after adequate recovery
           from the qualifying paracentesis (The first dose was administered on Day 1 or Day 2).

        -  The optional open-label extension (until treatment discontinuation criteria were met)

        -  A posttreatment follow-up phase lasting 60 days.

      Criteria for discontinuation included:

        1. Participant or his legally authorized representative request discontinuation

        2. In the Investigator's opinion, continuation of treatment would be detrimental to the
           participant's well being, such as disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
           noncompliance, or logistical considerations

        3. Sponsor request

        4. Intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of investigational
           product(IP)

        5. More than 2 IP dose reductions

        6. Unacceptable adverse events (AE) not manageable by symptomatic therapy, dose delay, or
           dose modification

        7. Arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial
           infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, new onset or worsening of preexisting angina

        8. Radiographic evidence of intestinal obstruction (for example, dilated loops of bowel
           accompanied by air-fluid levels) or gastrointestinal perforation (for example, presence
           of extraluminal gas) requiring surgical intervention
