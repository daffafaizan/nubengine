      minimize as much as possible the use of animal or human-derived products in the production of
      vaccines. The study is intended to provide information on the safety and immunogenicity of
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' candidate varicella vaccine formulated without human serum
      albumin (HSA) in contrast to Varilrixâ„¢ (GSK) which contains HSA when both are used in a
      two-dose schedule, with the first and second doses given approximately 42 days apart in the
      second year of life.

      The immunogenicity sub-cohort will be comprised of approximately 400 subjects, representing
      approximately 100 subjects enrolled in each of the participating countries.

      Rationale for amendment 1: Sites in the UK can perform home visits. For subjects
      participating through home visits, the subject's parent(s) / Legally Acceptable
      Representative(s) [LAR(s)] will be requested to sign a Recruitment/Randomisation agreement to
      provide personal information and to agree to have their child randomised before providing
      written consent to participate in the study (to be provided at the 1st home visit).
