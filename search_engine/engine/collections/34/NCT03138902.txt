      will be correlated with diet inventories, baseline body composition and health assessments, a
      standard metabolic panel, fasting glucose and insulin levels, a homeostatic insulin
      resistance model (HOMA), a two hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and a carbohydrate
      sensitivity symptom questionnaire administered during the OGTT.
