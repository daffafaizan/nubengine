      220 mm Hg for 5 mins followed by reperfusion (deflation of the cuff) is commonly known as
      remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC). Traditionally, RIPC refers to 5 minutes of
      inflation-5 minutes deflation repeated 4 times. Recent research has investigated the impact
      of repeated RIPC interventions on cardiovascular health. One previous repeated RIPC
      intervention, whereby RIPC was performed 3 times per week for eight weeks, identified that
      RIPC significantly enhanced conduit artery endothelial function and microvascular function.

      Exercise training is crucial for a healthy lifestyle, with the World Health Organization
      recommending that adults aged 18-64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic
      physical activity per week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity.
      Interestingly, the impact of exercise training on the vasculature is similar to that of
      repeated RIPC interventions, with reductions in arterial blood pressure, increased in blood
      flow and improvements in systemic vascular endothelial function. No study has examined if
      combining exercise and RIPC provides enhanced effects on the vasculature compared to exercise
      alone.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether combining 8 weeks of exercise and RIPC is
      more beneficial to systemic vascular function that exercise alone.
