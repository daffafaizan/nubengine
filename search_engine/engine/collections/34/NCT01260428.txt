    
      Two types of procedures will be tested in a random order, interspaced by resting periods :
      threshold PEEP set at 5,10 and 15 cm of water and pursed leap breathing.

      Subjects will be tested at rest, and during light exercise (30% of sea level predicted
      VO2max).

      FiO2 will be set at 12.5% (4000 m). fc, VE, PETCO2, TA, ECG, cardiac output, and tissular
      oxygenation will be monitored.
