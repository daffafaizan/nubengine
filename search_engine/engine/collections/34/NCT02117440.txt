        1. To determine if tumor metabolic activity plus volume measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT and
           tissue/tumor perfusion measured by 62Cu-ETS-PET before and during treatment predicts CT
           tumor response 3 months after completion of treatment and 1 and 2 year local-regional
           progression-free survival.

        2. To determine if functional imaging based lung dose-volume histograms (DVH) more
           accurately predict changes in diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO)
           compared to the DVH based on simulating CT. Degree of lung toxicity will also be
           documented by functional scans such as Tc-99m HMPAO imaging.

        3. To determine if baseline level, or changes in blood markers such as TGFÃŸ1 measured
           during the course of radiation, predict changes in DLCO.
