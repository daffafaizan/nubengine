      (B/F/TAF) or Placebo B (DTG/ABC/3TC). Randomization will ensure that the patients will have
      equal opportunity to try either placebo tablet first to avoid bias. Randomization will be
      done by an investigator not evaluating or providing the questionnaires to the patient.
      Participants will complete a questionnaire regarding what medications they take and what
      factors they consider affect their ease to swallow pills or tablets. The participants will be
      administered one of the placebo tablet with the research investigator present and will
      complete a questionnaire immediately following the first placebo dose. A study timeout for
      15-30 minutes will be done following completion of the questionnaires. After which,
      participants will take the second placebo tablet and complete the final questionnaires.

      The primary comparison will be between the placebo tablets A and B for tolerability, ease of
      swallow and participant preference. The investigators estimate that the sample size needed to
      detect a difference of at least 1 point in a 5 point Likert scale will be 50 patients with a
      standard deviation of 2 points, with >90% power.
