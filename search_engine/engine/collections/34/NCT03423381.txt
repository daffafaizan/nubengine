      the colon of specific mixtures of cereal dietary fiber and effects on systemic metabolism and
      appetite regulation. For this purpose, short term studies are performed in healthy adult
      subjects. Different cereals, cereal blends and from cereal extracted dietary fiber will be
      studied, as well as effects of different processing of the cereals. Cardiometabolic test
      markers and colonic fermentation metabolites will be followed up to 14 h after intake of the
      test substrates, and gut microbiota composition will be determined prior to and after the
      interventions.
