      the scarcity of organs available, the correct prioritization of patients for liver
      transplantation has a crucial importance. Nowadays, patients are ranked according to severity
      of liver disease, measured by the MELD score. This index is only derived from objective
      measures (serum concentration of bilirubin, creatinine and INR). Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)
      is a serious and progressive disorder in patients with end-stage liver disease. The severity
      of HE has prognostic implications in those waiting for liver transplantation. However, the
      prognosis of HE is independent and not correlated to the MELD score. Hepatic encephalopathy
      triggers multiple changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) providing an objective
      way to evaluate it. Also electroencephalogram and neuropsychological evaluation might
      increase mortality prediction.

      Adding the information provided by MRI, electroencephalogram and neuropsychological
      evaluation to the MELD score model might increase the prediction of mortality. Increase
      mortality's prediction has a fundamental importance because in organ allocation.

      We will evaluate the predictive value of these variables in predicting mortality of those
      patients waiting for liver transplantation.
