    
      1. Compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of definitive
           radiochemotherapy versus(VS) neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for
           esophageal cancer patients who achieved clinical complete response after neoadjuvant
           treatment;

        2. Compare the toxic and side effects of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant
           radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who achieved
           clinical complete remission after neoadjuvant treatment;

        3. Compare the relationship and consistency between pathological complete response of
           endoscopic biopsy specimens after neoadjuvant treatment and pathological complete
           response of surgical specimens in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection
           group;

        4. Assess impact of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus
           radical resection on quality of life of patients.

        5. Clinical Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Treatment: Endoscope biopsy pathologic
           diagnosis indicate pathologic complete response after Neoadjuvant treatment; upper
           gastrointestinal/chest CT and symptom assessment indicate major response after
           Neoadjuvant treatment (Concurrent Radiochemotherapy: Radiotherapy, Intensity Modulation
           Radiation Therapy(IMRT), 40Gy; Chemotherapy, Docetaxel （25mg/m2）+Cisplatin (25mg/m2),
