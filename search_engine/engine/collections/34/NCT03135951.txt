    
      This is a Phase 1, single-arm multicenter study to evaluate the PK and safety of SPI-2012 (a
      long acting myeloid growth factor) in breast cancer patients treated with TC chemotherapy.

      Approximately 25 patients will be enrolled.

      Each cycle will be 21 days and patients will receive 4 cycles of treatment with 2 additional
      cycles based on the investigator's discretion. On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive
      TC chemotherapy and on Day 2 of each cycle, patients will receive SPI-2012.

      Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated only in Cycles 1 and 3.
