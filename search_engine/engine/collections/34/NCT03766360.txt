      report depressive symptoms decrease in the 6 months after bariatric surgery, there is growing
      body of literature suggesting there exists a subgroup of patients whose depressive symptoms
      worsen after surgery and the likelihood of developing depressive symptoms increases
      longitudinally. Depression can be an indicator of an increased risk of self-harm and
      additional studies have found that the risk of suicide may increase post bariatric surgery
      compared to obese individuals who have not undergone surgery.

      Research supports that psychosocial factors contribute to successful postoperative outcomes.
      Functional Analytic Psychotherapy shows potential to impact social variables that may be
      relevant to bariatric surgery outcomes including depression. In this context, FAP aims to
      improve interpersonal relationships through experientially teaching skills intended to
      increase social connection. FAP also seeks to increase awareness, which includes the ability
      to view interpersonal interactions from multiple perspectives, allowing new interpersonal
      skills to emerge.

      The present study seeks to evaluate the use of a FAP group to enhance interpersonal relating
      with a sample of post-bariatric surgery patients. Measures will be collected on quality of
      life and variables involved in interpersonal connectedness.
