      comorbidities, which is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. In
      this study, we aim to investigate the factors that predict 30-day complications after the
      surgical treatment of appendicitis in elderly patients. Records of patients who underwent
      appendectomy for appendicitis will be extracted. The primary outcome is 30-day postoperative
      complications. Independent variables examined include demographics, comorbidities,
      preoperative laboratory values, pathological findings, and surgical features. Both univariate
      and multivariate regression will be performed to identify factors associated with
      postoperative complications.
