      sometimes limiting the ability to perform necessary therapeutic procedures. Recent studies
      suggest, however, that opiate receptors are expressed in the dental pulp and oral mucosal
      tissues and increase in number under conditions of inflammation. The proposed clinical study
      will assess the therapeutic effectiveness of the opioid, fentanyl, to enhance the
      profoundness of the local anesthetic lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine when used on
      inflamed mandibular molar teeth. Delivering lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine
      intraosseously immediately after delivering fentanyl intraosseously is predicted to increase
      the success rate of local anesthesia on the inflamed pulpal tissues of mandibular molars.
      Three different strategies will be studied to assess fentanyl as an adjunct to local
      anesthesia. The first study will assess the efficacy of individual drugs under normal
      conditions in patients whose mandibular molars have healthy pulpal tissues. Pulpal anesthesia
      will be measured by an electronic pulp tester and drugs will be delivered intraosseously. A
      second study will evaluate local anesthetic success using the same drugs and route of
      administration in patients whose mandibular molars have inflamed pulpal tissues. Root canal
      treatment will test for the clinical effectiveness of local anesthesia. A third study will
      assess systemic side effects using different rates of intraosseous drug delivery. This series
      of studies may provide a rationale for the adjunctive administration of opioids in clinical
      conditions where inflammation limits the effectiveness of local anesthetics alone.
