      of deoxycholic acid injection relative to placebo in adults with submental fullness.
      Participants were randomized to either deoxycholic acid injection or placebo in a ratio of
      4:1 and to one of four patient experience management paradigms.

      Participants were required to visit the research facility on 10 separate occasions for
      protocol-defined treatments, procedures, tests, and observations.
