      collected from existing local hospital registries in three countries (Iran, Kingdom of Saudi
      Arabia (KSA), and Kuwait) with 3 years post transplantation follow-up. Data for this study
      was collected based on routine clinical practice of medical practitioners across the
      participating countries. A case report data collecting form was designed for gathering the
      data including the recipient and donor's characteristics prior to transplantation, and after
      transplantation up to three years post transplantation. Using binary logistic regression
      analysis, the potential risk factors for occurrence of DGF in living donor transplantations
      were tested. Graft and patient survival at 1, 2 and 3 years depending on follow-up time was
      evaluated.
