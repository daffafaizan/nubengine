    
      This is a multinational, single-arm, pivotal trial assessing the efficacy and safety of the
      SoundBiteâ„¢ Crossing System - Peripheral. The enrollment will consist of up to 100 patients
      meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to obtain 90 evaluable patients for
      efficacy and safety analysis. The primary endpoints will be compared to literature-based
      performance goals to establish study success.

      Objective Performance Goals (OPG) have been obtained from a literature based review. Reports
      published in the past 10 years were reviewed for both safety and effectiveness in crossing
      infrainguinal CTO. The studies reviewed generally have one primary composite safety endpoint
      and one primary efficacy endpoint. Some studies have performed formal hypothesis testing
      versus a pre-specified performance goal for one or both endpoints.
