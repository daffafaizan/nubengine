      disruption are claimed as possible causes of delirium.

      The authors want to clarify the role of the alterations of different cellular components of
      neuroinflammation (neurons, glial cells, and endothelium) in delirium development. Moreover,
      the authors want to understand whether the neuroinflammation process could cause permanent
      structural and functional brain damage.

      In a nested cross-sectional longitudinal case-control observational study in ICU admitted
      patients.

      The objectives of the studies are as follow: 1) Neuroinflammation biomarkers evaluation in
      non-neurological ICU patients who develop delirium during ICU-stay (case) compared to matched
      non-delirious ICU patients (control), and 2) their correlation with brain structural and
      functional alterations evaluated with a resting-state fMRI protocol and PET.
