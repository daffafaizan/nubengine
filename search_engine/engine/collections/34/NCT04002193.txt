    
      Objective :

      To compare measurements of pleth variability index (PVI), pulse pressure variation (PPV) and
      stroke volume variation (SVV) to predict fluid responsiveness in modified prone position or
      knee-chest position (concord position) for cervical operation.

      To identify Influence of the modified prone position (concord position) on these variables.

      Method

        1. To assess influence of the position change on PVI and other variables(PPV, SVV)

        2. To assess PVI to predict fluid responsiveness at modified prone position
