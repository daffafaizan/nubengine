      Recommended dose (RD will be used in Phase II) Toxicity during treatment Clinical response to
      specific neurologic symptoms Time to neurologic progression Biological response: CSF
      cellularity and protein concentration Radiological response: cerebrospinal meningitis and
      neuraxis RMI Impact on quality of life Impact on survival (overall survival, survival without
      neurological progression, progression-free survival) Pharmacokinetics: dose of trastuzumab in
      CSF and plasma FCGR3A Genetic status influence on efficacy trastuzumab in metastatic breast
      cancer

      Impact on survival (overall survival, survival without neurological progression,

      (confirmation of phase I data with 5 patients) FCGR3A Genetic status influence on efficacy
