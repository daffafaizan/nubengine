      time of screening were enrolled and were receive a two-dose schedule, 21 days apart, with 4
      Î¼g BBIBP-CorV inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The primary safety outcome includes solicited
      local and systemic reactions prompted by and recorded in an electronic diary within 7 days
      post each injection, unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events assessed from the
      receipt of each dose, and clinical laboratory abnormalities from dose 1 through 1month after
      dose 2. Laboratory tests included measurement of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
      aminotransferase, serum total bilirubin, serum albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and
      blood routine examination. Immunogenicity was assessed as the serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific
      antibody responses and neutralizing activity at 4 weeks after the second vaccination.
