      I. To study the complete response rate following OAG (omacetaxine mepesuccinate, cytarabine)
      in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive induction therapy.

      II. To assess the toxicity of OAG using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the disease-free and overall survival of OAG and decitabine in newly diagnosed
      acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive induction therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) and
      omacetaxine mepesuccinate SC BID on days 1-14. Treatment for induction therapy repeats every
      28 days for up to 4 courses or until patients achieve complete response (CR) in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients alternate courses between decitabine and OAG. Patients
      receive decitabine intravenously (IV) on days 1-5. Patients alternate with OAG courses,
      comprising cytarabine SC BID on days 1-7 and omacetaxine mepesuccinate SC BID on days 1-7.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
