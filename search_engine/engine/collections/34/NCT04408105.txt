      referral processes in the United States. These shortcomings will be identified through
      completion of two synergistic aims that assess:, (1) provider knowledge, attitudes, and
      barriers to BE screening referral and (2) patient knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to
      completion of BE screening. The central hypothesis is that there are patient- and
      provider-level factors that can be modified to improve BE screening adherence. This
      hypothesis was formulated based on strong preliminary data demonstrating significant
      single-mindedness among gastroenterologists regarding BE screening criteria.
