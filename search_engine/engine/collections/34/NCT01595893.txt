      radiation over several days before and after vitamin D3 supplementation. Disease symptoms
      will be quantified with a newly established and validated PLE test score, (AA + SI + 0.4P
      [range, 0-12], where AA is affected area score [range, 0-4], SI is skin infiltration score
      [range, 0-4], and P is pruritus score on a visual analogue scale [range, 0-10]). Optional
      biopsies will be taken to investigate the effect of oral vitamin D3 on UV-induced skin test
      sites, including cellular skin infiltration and expression and release of cytokines in situ
      as endpoints. We will also study the effect of oral vitamin D3 on abnormalities i) of levels
      and function of regulatory T cells, ii) chemotaxis of leucocytes, and iii) proinflammatory
      cytokines, i.e. alterations that have been previously linked to PLE pathogenesis. This will
      be done by i) FACS and co-culture T cell proliferation assays, ii) response of peripheral
      neutrophil leucocytes to the chemoattractants leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and
      formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, and iii) ELISA and immunobead assay of patient serum.

      To back-up the results obtained with the PLE test score upon experimental photo provocation
      the study participants will receive a questionnaire on PLE symptoms and quality of life,
      adapted from scores as previously described. This questionnaire will allow monitoring PLE
      symptoms and quality of life in the patients during the summer season following the oral
      vitamin D3 supplementation in spring.

      The results of the project will enlighten the mechanism of PLE and may establish the base of
      a novel prevention strategy via the vitamin D3 pathway.
