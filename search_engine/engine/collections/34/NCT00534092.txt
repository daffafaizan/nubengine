    
      Evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of the X-Stop interspinous process
      decompression system In the patients who received the X-Stop under the IDE. These patients
      consist of two cohorts to be evaluated: patients who had moderately impaired physical
      function prior to X-Stop implantation (as determined by a baseline score >2.0 in the physical
      function (PF) domain of the Zurich claudication questionnaire), and patients who had mildly
      impaired physical function prior to X-Stop surgery(as determined by a baseline score <=2.0 in
      the PF domain of the Zurich claudication questionnaire (ZCQ), through the fifth postoperative
      year. Clinical examination will be performed at each office visit to confirm the absence of
      neurological complications. X-ray films (AP/lateral views) taken during the fifth
      postoperative year will, be analyzed to confirm A) maintenance of distraction and B) the
      absence of radiological evidence of device-related complications. Secondary endpoints will
      include mean scores from the SF-36, and incidence rates of adverse events, device failures,
      and secondary surgeries.
