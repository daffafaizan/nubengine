      including psychological, physical and pharmacological interventions; however their use in
      clinical practice has been limited. Teaching parents about these strategies in an enriching
      setting such as prenatal education classes has the potential to increase utilization of these
      strategies, and empower parents to take on a more active role in the management of their
      infant's pain during routine immunization. Educating parents about pain-management for infant
      immunization has not been previously investigated in this setting. The aim of this
      cluster-randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an immunization
      pain-management education module added to the prenatal education program at Mount Sinai
      Hospital on parental knowledge and behaviour regarding pain management during routine 2-month
      infant immunization injections.
