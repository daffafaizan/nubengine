      have not been defined. The aim of this Phase II study is to determine the response rate of
      combined oxaliplatin and capecitabine treatment at a given dose and schedule in patients with
      Head and Neck cancer for which there is no curative treatment.

      The study also aims to determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility
      of toxicity of the above combination and to evaluate any changes in performance status,
      quality of life, overall survival and progression-free survival.
