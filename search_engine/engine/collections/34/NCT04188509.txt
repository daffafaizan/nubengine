    
      Open-label extension (OLE) study of voxelotor for pediatric participants with Sickle Cell
      Disease who have participated in voxelotor clinical trials. Approximately 50 participants
      with sickle cell disease (SCD), aged ≥ 4 to ≤ 18 years will be enrolled at approximately 19
      global clinical sites. All participants will receive voxelotor once daily, administered
      orally as tablets, dispersible tablets, or powder for oral suspension formulation. The
      objective of this OLE is to assess the safety of, and SCD-related complications of, long-term
      treatment with voxelotor, in pediatric participants who have completed treatment in a Global
      Blood Therapeutics (GBT)-sponsored voxelotor pediatric clinical study.
