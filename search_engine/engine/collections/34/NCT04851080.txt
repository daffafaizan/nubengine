      the influence of factors of the external or internal environment, acute, chronical and
      extreme (in Covid-19 isolation) physiological stress, is formed, which the body is no longer
      able to compensate, and which forms the main group of human diseases - adaptation diseases,
      primarily cardiovascular, including cardiometabolic syndrome. Against the background of the
      Covid-19 pandemic, in conditions of limited physical activity, disruption of the daily
      routine and high psychophysiological load, various health disorders of both functional and
      organic nature may occur and existing pathologies may worsen.

      The aim of the study - screening of health of different age categories of the population,
      based on research of chronotype, sleep quality, seasonal pattern, behavioral time preferences
      and functional state of body's regulatory and respiratory systems in individuals from the
      different age groups.

      Methods: testing of psycho-physiological functions using Composite Scale of Morningness
      (CSM), Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ), Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire
      (SPAQ), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); Heart rate variability (HRV); Spirometry;
      Anthropometry (measurement of height, weight, waist circumference), Blood pressure
      measurement (BP).

      Statistical analyses planned to perform frequency, correlation, factorial and variance
      analyzes using Statistica 10,0 software ("StatSoft, Inc"). Data investigate by mean value (M)
      and standard deviation (SD) in case of normal data distribution or nonparametric method with
      determination of median (Me) and interquantile ranges (25th and 75th percentile) in the case
      of a distribution other than normal. ANOVA, MANOVA analysis. Statistically significant
      differences in all statistical tests set to P<0.05
