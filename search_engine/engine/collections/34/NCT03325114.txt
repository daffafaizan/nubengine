    
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with increased urinary calcium loss, which may contribute
      to the low bone mineral density and increased fracture risk observed in patients with this
      condition. Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic that is commonly used to reduce urinary
      calcium excretion in other conditions such as idiopathic hypercalciuria. Its safety and
      efficacy has not been specifically tested in an adolescent type 1 diabetes population.

      T1D subjects with hypercalciuria and who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be given
      chlorthalidone daily. Blood and urine tests, blood pressure, and glycemic control will be
      assessed at weekly study visits for 4 weeks.
