      people who have relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This study will look at
      progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety in participants who take
      ixazomib in addition to lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to placebo in addition to
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

      The study enrolled 722 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Ixazomib 4 mg + lenalidomide + dexamethasone

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient + lenalidomide + dexamethasone

      All participants will receive treatment in 28 day cycles until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 80 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
      will be contacted every 4 weeks for PFS and every 12 weeks for OS.
