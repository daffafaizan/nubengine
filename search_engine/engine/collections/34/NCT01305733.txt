      days. The study is a single-center, randomized controlled trial, which will be performed in
      Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement in Tampere, Finland. The injectant mixture consists of
      150 mg levobupivacaine mixed with 30 mg ketorolac and 0.5 mg adrenaline with occasional
      variations if the patient is unusually small, very elderly, infirm or has a history of
      significant intolerance to analgesics or anesthetic agents. The RKA mixture is diluted with
      normal saline. Total volume of the solution is 100 ml depending on the size of the wound. The
      normal saline injection are used in the control group in the same manner than in the RKA
      group.
