    
      Those who consent to participate will participate in 60-minute yoga sessions 2-3 times per
      week for 4-6 weeks. Only specified yoga poses will be implemented during the classes.

      The study will be done in three parts: initial evaluation, yoga therapy, and follow-up
      evaluations.

      INITIAL EVALUATION: Participants will complete the PedsQL Cancer Module questionnaire and the
      PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale questionnaire. Physical performance including
      quadriceps strength, grip strength, hamstring flexibility, and balance, will be assessed.

      YOGA THERAPY: The principal investigator (PI) is a certified yoga therapist (CYT) and is a
      registered yoga teacher with 500 hours of training (RYT 500). Participants will take part in
      a 60-minute yoga session conducted by the PI 2-3 times a week for 4-6 weeks, during which
      time they must complete 8-12 yoga sessions. The yoga intervention includes these parts:
      warm-up, strengthening, increasing hamstring flexibility, balance and relaxation. Yoga poses
      will be used for each yoga session from a predetermined roster depending on individual
      adolescent abilities. This will allow for a tailored but standardized yoga intervention.
      Modifications including chairs, straps and blocks will be allowed to promote appropriate form
      and use of these props will be recorded. Immediately before and after each yoga session, the
      therapist will record pain with the verbal numeric pain scale.

      FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS: After completion of the 4-6 weeks of yoga therapy, participants will
      complete all assessments and physical performance measures that were done in the initial
      evaluation.
