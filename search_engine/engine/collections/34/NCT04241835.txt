      normal liver function, or advanced malignancies and moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.
      Subjects in Part 1 of the study will receive a single oral, 800 mg dose of tazemetostat on
      Day 1 and Day 15. In addition, the subjects will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose)
      tablets to be taken twice daily from Day 5 to Day 14. Blood samples for PK analysis will be
      obtained on Day 1 through Day 4 and again on Day 15 through Day 18. Part 1 ends on Day 18.

      Subjects continuing treatment in Part 2 will receive tazemetostat (oral 800 mg dose) tablets
      to be taken twice daily in repeated 28-day cycles beginning on Day 19 until
      Investigator-assessed clinical progression per standard practice, or unacceptable toxicity,
      or until another discontinuation criterion is met. Subjects must have an end of study visit
      after 30 days of the last dose of tazemetostat for safety assessment. Supplementary study
      conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the
      accompanying procedure manuals (i.e., laboratory, pharmacy, ECG manuals). Such manuals will
      provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does
      not impact subject safety.
