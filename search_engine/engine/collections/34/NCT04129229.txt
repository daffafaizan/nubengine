    
      The study design is a multi-site, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm
      clinical study to test the efficacy of the LinguaFlex Tongue Retractor for the treatment of
      moderate to severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) (AHI â‰¥15 at baseline) in adult subjects in
      twelve (12) months of continuous use. The study will include three (3) investigational sites
      that will implant a minimum of sixty (60) subjects with the LTR. No single site is to perform
      more than 25 implants. After informed consent is obtained, eligible subjects (adults who have
      moderate to severe OSA) will be screened for study inclusion. The screening will consist of a
      Polysomnography (PSG) completed within two (2) months of inclusion in the study to confirm
      the diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA, an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assessment,
      Snoring Self-Assessment (SOS) with bed partner input (SBPS), assessment of pain, speech and
      swallowing, and a physical examination. The screening data will be reviewed by the Sponsor's
      designated study monitor to confirm and approve that inclusion criteria are fully met.
      Failure to meet all inclusion criteria will be designated as a screen failure and the
      subject's enrollment will be terminated. Participation in the study is voluntary. Subjects
      may withdraw at any time during the study. Reasons for the withdrawal will be recorded and
      entered into the clinical study report. Any subject who withdraws from the study for any
      reason will have the device removed and will undergo a Post Device Removal Follow-Up within
      30 days (-7/+ 15) of device removal.
