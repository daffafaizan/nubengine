      Netherlands have suggested that an increased intake of dietary fish or fish oil rich in the
      long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is inversely related to the risk of atherothrombotic diseases, in
      particular coronary artery disease (CAD).

      Results of many prospective observational cohort studies have found that diets rich in marine
      PUFAs may be protective against major cardiovascular events, including mortality from CAD,
      total cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and nonfatal myocardial infarction. To date,
      only a few studies have examined the effects of purified n-3 PUFA preparations in human
      subjects for short observation periods. The principle aim of the current study is to test the
      hypothesis that the long-term use of highly purified EPA(eicosapentaenoic acid: 1800mg/day),
      in addition to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is effective in preventing cardiovascular events
      in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia.
