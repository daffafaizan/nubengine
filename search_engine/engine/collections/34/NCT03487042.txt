      approved for the treatment of glaucoma and eyelashes hypotrichosis (Lee et al, 2017).
      Cutaneous hyperpigmentation of the treated sites has been reported as a side effect with this
      agent. Phototherapy (narrow band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB)) of wavelength 308 nm, is considered
      as a successful method of treatment of vitiligo. The cytotoxic T-cells accountable for the
      destruction of melanocytes and disappearance of melanin are eliminated by phototherapy
      through apoptosis (diffuse repigmentation) and UVB does stimulate melanocytic proliferation
      and their migration to the epidermis from nearby follicular units (follicular repigmentation)
      and perilesional active melanocytes (marginal repigmentation).

      In recent years, fractional carbon dioxide laser has been introduced as an add-on treatment
      for vitiligo. It represents a new modality for skin resurfacing based on the theory of
      fractional photothermolysis. The beneficial effect of fractional carbon dioxide laser on
      vitiligo is the release of cytokines and growth factors that act as mitogens for
      melanogenesis. It also alters the skin barrier, which results in increased penetration of
      topical drugs and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, so it can be used in combination therapy.
