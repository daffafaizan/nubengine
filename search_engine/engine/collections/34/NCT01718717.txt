      for thoracic surgical procedure and it seems that can also be effective in reducing the
      incidence of postoperative AF in patients undergoing lung resection. Nevertheless the timing
      of stopping the epidural analgesia and its further substitution with other therapies, remains
      unclear.

      In this study patients who are scheduled for lung resection surgery will undergo the surgery
      under combined general anesthesia with volatile anesthetics and thoracic epidural anesthesia.

      Immediately after surgery the patients will be divided into two groups:

        -  those who will receive thoracic epidural analgesia for 6 days

        -  those who will receive thoracic epidural analgesia for 3 days and will then switch to
           intravenous morphine for another 3 days

      All the patients will be monitored daily for arrythmias
