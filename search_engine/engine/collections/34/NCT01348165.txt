    
      As a transition from preclinical investigations to clinical development in this first-in-man
      trial, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BI 137882 will be assessed in healthy
      male volunteers using single rising oral doses in order to provide the basis for a potential
      ongoing clinical development of BI 137882 in the indication of COPD.

      Healthy male subjects aged 21 - 50 years will be recruited for this study. They provide a
      relatively stable physiological, biochemical and hormonal basis (steady state) for studying
      drug effects, they show no disease-related variation and they are not taking concomitant
      medication.

      Within each dose group, all actively treated individuals will receive the same BI 137882
      dose. The next higher dose will only be administered if the treatment in the preceding dose
      group was safe and well tolerated.
