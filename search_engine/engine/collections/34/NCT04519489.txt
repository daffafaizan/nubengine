      clinical failure after rhythm control treatment and restoring with regular heart beat in
      atrial fibrillation patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The study is designed as a
      multi-center randomized control trial, which plans to recruit 129 atrial fibrillation
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea (86 in the intervention group with atrial fibrillation
      standard care and positive airway pressure therapy, 43 in the control group with atrial
      fibrillation standard care but no positive airway pressure therapy). The subjects will in
      total visit the hospital 4 times during their 6 months follow-up period, at baseline, 1st,
      3rd, and 6th month. Subjects will undergo questionnaire surveys and medical examinations at
      each visit. The primary objective is to compare after 6months, the clinical failure rate
      between the group with positive airway pressure therapy and the group with no positive airway
      pressure therapy.
