    
      In this study, the investigational products are naproxen, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory
      drug (NSAID), and loratadine, an anti-histamine. Both agents are being investigated as
      prophylactic medications to reduce the incidence and/or severity of bone pain in breast
      cancer patients receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant myelosuppressive chemotherapy and
      pegfilgrastim prophylaxis.

      Pegfilgrastim treatment is used to stimulate bone marrow to produce more neutrophils to help
      fight infections in patients undergoing chemotherapy.
