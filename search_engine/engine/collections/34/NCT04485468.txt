      around 160,000 patients

      The coordination of the care pathway for patients with Parkinson disease has been improved
      since the implementation on the national territory of 7 interregional coordination centers
      and 25 regional expert centers in 2012.

      Health insurance reimburses 100% of direct medical and non-medical care as soon as patients
      are registered in Long-Term Condition nÂ°16. However, we currently have little information
      about care that is not recognized for financial coverage by health insurance.

      It is therefore essential to estimate the overall consumption of medical and non-medical
      resources by patients with PD in order to characterize the share of medical and non-medical
      care reimbursed by health insurance, the share of medical and non-medical care not
      reimbursed. by health insurance, as well as the share of formal and informal care in order to
      identify potential economic barriers to an optimal care path for patients with PD. It is also
      necessary to have information on the socio-economic characteristics and the place of
      residence of the resident in order to estimate the impact of these determinants on an optimal
      course of care.
