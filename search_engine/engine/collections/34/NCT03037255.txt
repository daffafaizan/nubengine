    
      Using observational data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) of all
      hospitalisations for acute myocardial infarction in all acute hospitals in England and Wales,
      this study aims to determine the extent to which pre-existing long-term conditions are
      associated with survival following acute myocardial infarction. The study will include an
      investigation of individual long term conditions for patients with acute myocardial
      infarction, including chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure or peripheral vascular disease
      as well as the combination of such conditions and their resulting impact on long term
      all-cause mortality (up to 8.4 years). In addition, an investigation of the association of
      receipt of guideline recommended care for acute myocardial infarction patients with
      pre-existing long term conditions will be made.
