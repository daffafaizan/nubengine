      inactivated through dephosphorylation by ectonucleotidase leading to its very short plasma
      half-life. Consequently the timing at which PD assessments are performed after blood sample
      collection may impact measures of platelet reactivity in patients treated with cangrelor. We
      therefore hypothesize that measures of platelet inhibitory effects observed in cangrelor
      treated patients will reduce with time following blood sampling.
