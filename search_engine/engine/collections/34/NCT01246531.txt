    
      Urolithiasis is a common disease, with an overall prevalence about 2% in the world.
      Accordingly growth of life expectancy, elderly people become more susceptible to present
      renal calculi.

      The investigators have two purposes: (1) evaluate metabolic disturbances in aging men with
      urinary lithiasis, and (2) evaluate bone demineralization in aging men with renal calculi.

      The investigators have made a case-control model. The case-group is compposed by men with
      more than fifty years-old who had their first lithiasic diagnosis (renal colic ou incidental
      finding) after that age. The control-group is compposed by men with more than fifty years-old
      who had never diagnosed with renal stones. So the investigators have excluded men with
      repetitive episodes of renal colic, that could be negatively influence the outcomes of aging
      factors on urinary lithiasis. All the people have to submitted to blood tests, 24-hour
      urinary samples, abdominal ultrassonography and abdominal X-ray (or abdominal CT, if
      necessary); and bone densitometry. The investigators hope to achieve reliable conclusions
      about urinary lithogenesis.

      Blood tests: total calcium, ionized calcium, uric acid, phosphorus, creatinine, urea,
      testosterone and parathyroid hormone.

      24-hour urinary sample(s): calcium, uric acid, creatinine, citrate, sodium, pH and volume.
      Patients of the case arm had to collect 6 24-hour urine samples, while the control arm had
      collected 3 24-hour urine samples.

      Data were analyzed using the Fischer's exact, Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests; a level of
      significance of 5% was adopted.
