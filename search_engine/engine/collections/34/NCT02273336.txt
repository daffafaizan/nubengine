      I. To perform comprehensive genomic analysis of young lung cancer patients' samples to
      facilitate delivery of targeted therapies and clinical trial enrollment.

      II. To characterize the impact of young age at lung cancer diagnosis on the genomic landscape
      of primary lung cancer.

      III. To establish a prospective registry of young lung cancer patients for both tumor and
      germline next generation sequencing.

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue and blood samples are analyzed via next generation sequencing and whole exome
      sequencing.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years.
