      cancer. Approximately half of all women with breast cancer receive radiation therapy. Despite
      advances in medical technology, radiation therapy still causes severe skin effects. Radiation
      dermatitis occurs in approximately 90% of patients and ranges in severity from mild redness
      to more severe skin changes. Dermatitis is a common side effect of radiation treatment, but
      few effective treatments have been developed for it; currently, there is no standard
      treatment for the prevention of radiation-induced dermatitis. Curcumin is a natural compound
      found in both turmeric and curry powder. It has been used for centuries as a spice (curry), a
      food coloring and as a food preservative. Curcumin is non-toxic and has been found to enhance
      the functions of normal tissues.
