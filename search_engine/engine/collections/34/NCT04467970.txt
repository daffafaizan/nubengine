      shown to provide successful outcomes in some studies, it is technically difficult to achieve
      the ideal valgus position postoperatively, and the likelihood of postoperative complications
      after HTO is greater than that after UKA . As compared with HTO, UKA has been reported to
      provide better long-term results, to have a shorter time to full weight bearing, to allow
      easier rehabilitation, and to have fewer perioperative complications. Furthermore,
      indications for UKA are broadening, including younger and more active patients, since
      encouraging midterm and long-term results were published.
