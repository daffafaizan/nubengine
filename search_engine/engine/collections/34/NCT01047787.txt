      congestive heart failure (CHF). We studied consecutive CHF patients in order to compare SDB
      characteristics according to gender, and to determine overall mortality impact of SDB and
      Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) while awake.

      Methods: Eighty nine consecutive outpatients (29 female) with stable CHF (LVEF<45%) were
      prospectively evaluated. The presence of SDB, as characterized by obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) and CSR during sleep, as well as CSR while awake before sleep onset, were investigated
      by overnight polysomnography.
