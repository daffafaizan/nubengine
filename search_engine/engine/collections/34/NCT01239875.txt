      significant toxicity of an autologous DC vaccine injection into a cryoablated tumor site (Arm
      A). II. Evaluation of safety and tolerability as measured by the incidence of significant
      toxicity of an autologous mature DC vaccine + tumor lysate generated in vitro and delivered
      intradermally (ID) (Arm B). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. For cryoablation candidates: To assess
      feasibility, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, time to response, and duration of
      response (Arm A). II. For patients receiving ID vaccine without cryoablation: To assess
      feasibility, clinical response rate, time to response, and duration of response (Arm B).
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. For cryoablation candidates: To assess the change over time in
      non-cryoablated nodes selected as the index lesions (Arm A). II. For patients receiving ID
      vaccine without cryoablation: To assess the change over time in measurable nodes selected as
      the index lesions (Arm B). III. To monitor patients' immune response after vaccine therapy.
      IV. Assess the immune response to Prevnar in cancer patients. V. Assess the effect of DC
      vaccination on presence of myeloid suppressors. VI. Assess the effect of tumor antigen
      delivery methods (in vivo DC into cryoablated tumor vs. ID injection of in vitro generated DC
      + lysate) on T cell response. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. In
      both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1
      year, and then every 6 months for up to 2.5 years.
