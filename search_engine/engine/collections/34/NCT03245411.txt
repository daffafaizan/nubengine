      communication approaches to patients with low health literacy. They have produced mixed
      results in regard to implementation of successful interventions in addressing the needs of
      this populations. Low health literacy is especially common in medically underserved
      communities, including in North Philadelphia. Cancer treatment, including cancer
      chemotherapy, is complex, and it requires substantial skills, in order for patients to adhere
      to care and achieve the goals of therapy. Patients with low health literacy find it
      especially challenging to navigate cancer treatment. Results of previous research showed that
      intervention strategies that address the needs for information and material support of
      African American older adults, can help improve adherence to cancer screening in this
      population.

      The purpose is to develop and evaluate model interventions to improve healthcare outcomes for
      socially disadvantaged populations. The objective in this proposal is to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial that evaluates the effects of an intervention that provides enhanced
      education and material support, on adherence to care, among the cancer patients of the
      Medical Oncology Clinic of the Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia.

      The central hypothesis is that compared to the standard educational intervention delivered by
      a registered nurse, the addition of an enhanced intervention (enhanced education,
      problem-solving skills and facilitative support) will result in greater adherence care,
      especially among patients with low health literacy.
