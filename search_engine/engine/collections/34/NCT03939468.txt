    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center, pilot, noninterventional
      study whose aim is to assess the feasibility and the clinical outcomes of using the Restore
      DCB (Cardionovum GmbH, Bonn, Germany) in combination ("hybrid approach") with a new
      generation DES (type at operator's discretion) for the treatment of diffuse CAD encountered
      in daily clinical practice. The rationale of the proposed strategy derives from the
      characteristics of DCB in treating the atherosclerotic disease without leaving a permanent
      structure in the vessel especially in case of diffuse CAD -avoiding a long metallic,
      permanent cage within extended coronary segments
