      sevoflurane-saline (Group SS) receiving group. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate
      (HR) will record prior to anesthetic induction (T1); following anesthetic induction (T2); and
      0, 1, 3, and 10 min after the seizure has ended (T3, T4, T5, and T6, respectively). Motor and
      EEG seizure durations will be recorded.
