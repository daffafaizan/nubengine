    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, phase II trial of brentuximab vedotin to
      evaluate ORR primarily in patients with EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas. The ORR will be
      evaluated based on the revised Cheson's criteria or modified SWAT criteria in case of
      cutaneous EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas.
