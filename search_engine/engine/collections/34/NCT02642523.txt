      cardiometabolic risk. Epidemiologic studies have shown that in relatively healthy individuals
      without heart failure, low natriuretic peptide levels are associated with unfavorable
      cardiometabolic phenotypes, including higher blood pressure, obesity, higher insulin levels,
      and diabetes mellitus. Understanding the mechanisms behind the "natriuretic peptide
      deficiency" of obesity would illuminate an important way in which obesity interacts with the
      cardiovascular system.

      The investigators propose a prospective cross-over design in 40 healthy lean and otherwise
      healthy obese individuals. The investigators propose the following specific aims and
      hypotheses:

      Aim 1: To study the effect of hyperinsulinemia on the response of the natriuretic peptide
      system to salt loading.

      Hypothesis 1: Hyperinsulinemia will suppress natriuretic peptide levels in both obese and
      lean individuals.

      Aim 2: To examine the effect of an intravenous infusion of natriuretic peptide on acute
      markers of lipolysis.

      Hypothesis 2: An intravenous infusion of natriuretic peptide will raise acute markers of
      lipolysis in both obese and lean individuals.
