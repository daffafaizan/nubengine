      Acupuncture is the insertion of very fine needles into the skin to treat symptoms. In recent
      years, researchers have come to understand how acupuncture might work in terms of nerve
      stimulation and the release of chemical messages in the body. Researchers have found evidence
      that acupuncture is useful in treating a variety of conditions, including headache, nausea,
      and pain after surgery.

      Pain is a common problem after surgery for lung cancer. Many patients experience pain in the
      first few days after surgery, despite medication. In some patients, this pain can last for
      many months or years afterwards.

      Purpose:

      A pilot study of acupuncture in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery was conducted
      previously and found that this study was feasible to implement and well-received by patients.
      We now wish to conduct a larger study in order to determine the effects of acupuncture on
      pain in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.

        -  To determine whether acupuncture versus placebo acupuncture after thoracotomy reduces
           pain or analgesic use

        -  To determine whether acupuncture affects the immediate post-operative period and/or 30,
           60,90 days and approximately 12 months later.
