      mice. Acarbose is FDA-approved for use in humans and has been extensively employed for the
      management of diabetics; there have been few associated side effects reported. Acarbose is
      considered a very safe treatment. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that acarbose treatment
      could be used in elderly humans to elicit improvement in systems known to be negatively
      affected by aging. Since the outcomes of acarbose treatment may be differentially affected by
      age, it is imperative to test the drug directly in older subjects for its safety and
      efficacy. Towards this end, the investigators propose to perform a small pilot study
      assessing the effects of acarbose in ten elderly subjects, aged 75-95 years old. Briefly, a
      cohort of non-diabetics will be recruited; subjects will be in generally good health with all
      chronic diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, etc.) clinically stable. Trial
      participants will be studied before drug initiation (pre-treatment), during 3 months of
      acarbose (blood draws at 1 month and 3 months of treatment), and following termination of the
      drug (1 and 3 months post treatment) such that each subject will serve as his own control.
      Gut microbiome composition will be assessed.
