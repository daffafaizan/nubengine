      abdominal surgeries by relieving both somatic and visceral pain. In the present study, the
      investigators presume that an ESP block will decrease narcotic consumption and NRS values
      both intraoperatively and during the first 24 postoperative hours.

      Patients will be divided into two groups:

      Group LB (Lidocaine-Bupivacaine): A bilateral ESP block will be performed preoperatively (10
      ml 1%lidocaine + 10 ml 0.5% bupivacaine). In addition, IV morphine patient-controlled
      analgesia (PCA) will be applied postoperatively for 24 hours.

      Group S: A bilateral ESP block will be performed preoperatively (20 ml NS).In addition, IV
      morphine-PCA will be applied postoperatively for 24 hours.
