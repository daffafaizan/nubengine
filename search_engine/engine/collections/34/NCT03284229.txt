      and safety endpoints. Upon enrollment after obtaining a written informed consent, each
      patient will be assigned a unique identification number. Only patients eligible to undergo
      cardiac catheterizations as per routine practice will be considered for the study.
      Premedication of patients will be as per the investigator's routine practice. All patient
      data will be recorded on patient data forms.

      Screening: This will be performed prior to the cardiac catheterization procedure. Only
      patients who have consented and fulfill the selection criteria will be enrolled.
      Additionally, ECG and Echocardiogram will be done using hospital equipment to ensure
      fulfillment of inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Procedure: The entire procedure will be carried out as per the site routine practice and the
      device will be used as per the IFU.

      Clinic follow up visit (30 ± 7 days): The subject will return to the clinic at 1 month to
      evaluate angina status as per the CCS classification, AE assessments, concomitant medications
      and any coronary intervention that has occurred since the previous contact.

      An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be repeated during the clinic visit.
