      course of one year from a team of a movement disorders doctor, a nurse, a research
      coordinator, and a social worker. The team will come to a patient's home and assess the needs
      of both the patient and caregiver, and connect the patient with any needed services. These
      visits can replace or be in addition to seeing another movement disorders doctor.

      As part of this study, not only would the patient receive home visits, but his/her caregiver
      would be paired with another caregiver from the community with lots of experience caring for
      someone with PD whose loved one may have passed away, but who volunteers to serve as a
      mentor. Current caregivers who enroll in the study will be asked to speak to their mentor
      once a week over a course of 4 months. These meetings can take place in person, by phone, or
      through video chat on an iPad that will be provided by our study team.

      The information collected from the study participants will be compared to data available in
      the National Parkinson's Foundation's Parkinson's Outcome Project. The data will be matched
      according to age, gender, and disease severity.
