      if they are having an ultrasound at 36 weeks of estimated gestational age or greater. As part
      of the study, women will have umbilical and middle cerebral artery Doppler studies and the
      CPR will be calculated by dividing the middle cerebral artery PI by the umbilical artery PI.
      Providers caring for study subjects will be blinded to this result. Pregnancy outcomes in
      women with CPR values less than the 10th percentile for gestational age will be compared to
      those with CPR values above the 10th percentile.

      A secondary aim of the study is to analyze CPR as a continuous variable.
