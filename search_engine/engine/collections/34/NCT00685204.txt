    
      This is a non-randomized, multicenter, open label, single agent phase II study. Patients with
      malignant mesothelioma that has recurred or progressed following chemotherapy, and who
      qualify for this study, will receive milataxel 60 mg/m2 orally on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle. If
      no toxicities of greater than Grade 1 severity occur, patients will receive 75 mg/m2 for the
      second and subsequent cycles. Patients will receive drug for a total of six cycles. Milataxel
      administration in excess of six cycles will be permitted at the discretion of the
      Investigator if patients have stable or responding disease.
