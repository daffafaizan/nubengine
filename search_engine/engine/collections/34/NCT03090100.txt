      Treatment Phase(Week 0-Week 44),Follow Up Phase(Week 44-Week 56).During various study
      periods,safety assessments(example[e.g] recording of adverse events,Vital signs,Tuberculosis
      evaluation,Chest radiograph,Urine pregnancy Test);Efficacy assessments(e.g IGA,PASI);Clinical
      Laboratory Assessments(e.g haematology,chemistry);Biomarkers/Genetic evaluations,will be
      performed per the study procedures.The primary hypotheses are that guselkumab treatment is
      non-inferior to secukinumab as assessed by proportion of participants achieving PASI 90
      response at Week 48 with noninferiority margin of 10% and,once non-inferiority is
      established,that guselkumab is superior to secukinumab as assessed by proportion of
      participants achieving PASI 90 response at Week 48.
