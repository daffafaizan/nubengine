      locally bladder cancer is not yet standardized. There are no data from randomized,
      prospective studies on the prognostic role of regional lymphadenectomy.

      Results of retrospective studies suggest, that the prognosis of patients with muscle-invasive
      bladder cancer can be improved by extending the limits of pelvic lymphadenectomy. Furthermore
      it could be demonstrated in a prospective study that the pattern of metastasis of bladder
      cancer has a high variability. About two-thirds of lymph node metastases are found outside
      the normally cleared areas of lymphadenectomy. In this study patients will be randomized into
      arms with limited versus extended lymphadenectomy.

      The limited lymphadenectomy includes the removal of the obturatoric, external and internal
      iliac lymph nodes, the extended one includes the removal of all lymph nodes between pelvic
      floor and the inferior mesenteric artery. The primary objective of the study is to detemine
      the influence of limited versus extended lyphadenectomy at the time of radical cystectomy on
      recurrence-free survival. Secondary study objectives include the influence on cancer-specific
      survival, overall survival, complication rates, histopathologic N-stage, the localization of
      recurrence and influence of adjuvant chemotherapy . Adjuvant chemotherapy is optional and is
      recommended in patients with locally advanced disease (pT3/4) or regional lymph node
      metastasis (pN+).
