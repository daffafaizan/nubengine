      aged â‰¥ 55 years receiving LHRH-agonist treatment for 6 months for locally advanced prostate
      cancer. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip was
      measured every 6 months. In addition, bone turnover markers including N-telopeptide, serum
      C-telopeptide and procollagen peptide, and 25-OH vitamin D and intact parathyroid hormone
      were measured at baseline and at 6 months.
