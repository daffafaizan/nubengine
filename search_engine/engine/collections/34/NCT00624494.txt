      bypass grafting (OPCAB). However, OPCAB poses a variety of challenges from the point of view
      of the anesthesiologist and the intensivist. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
      usefulness of an algorithm based on hemodynamic parameters obtained by single transpulmonary
      thermodilution (STD) combined with continuous monitoring of central venous oxygen saturation
      (ScvO2) for perioperative management of patients undergoing OPCAB.
