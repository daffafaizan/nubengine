    
      The aim of the Pilot Study is to describe the clinical performance of the AACR technique in
      the treatment of the cartilage defects in terms of complications after surgery, quality of
      the repaired cartilage tissue and clinical results with regard to pain and function of the
      treated knee.

      The quality of the repaired cartilage tissue will be evaluate through MRI and clinical
      outcomes by the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs).

      All patients will undergo to a blood sample (used to product the patient's own platelet
      concentrate) and an arthroscopic procedure to debride degenerated cartilage tissue and to the
      harvesting of the surrounding healthy cartilage. The fragmented healthy cartilage will mixed
      with the platelet concentrate (PC) and injected directly into the cartilage defect to fill
      it. The platelet concentrate stimulates the healing of the cartilage most actively.

      Before and after surgical treatment all patient will undergo to a follow-up visits after 6,
      12 and 24 months. MRI will be performed at pre-surgery visit and at the 12 and 24 follow-up
      visits.
