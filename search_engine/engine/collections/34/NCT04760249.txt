      performs all procedural sedations in children outside the operating room. Often patient age,
      comorbidities and procedures involving the airway are considered risk factors for adverse
      events, but previous studies investigating adverse events did not involve implementation of a
      specialised sedation team. Medical records of all children receiving procedural sedation by
      the CAST were reviewed for the incidence of adverse events. A bivariate analysis as well as
      an analysis of variance using type II Wald chi-square tests were conducted for identifying
      potential risk factors for adverse Events.
