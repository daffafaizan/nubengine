      be practiced in the US. Theoretically, laser energy in the red and near infrared light
      spectrum is capable of penetrating 2-5 cm into tissue and can stimulate mitochondria in the
      cells to produce more energy (through the production of adenosine triphosphate), which in
      turn may help prevent or repair tissue damage. The effects of low-level laser therapy on
      hearing have not been well studied. It has been suggested that laser therapy might help
      repair damage to the cochlea and restore some degree of hearing loss. Studies of low-level
      laser stimulation of cochleae utilizing microscopy, PET imaging, and MRI suggest potential
      therapeutic benefit to hearing. While preliminary studies suggest a possible improvement in
      hearing thresholds, a carefully controlled study is needed to verify the results using a
      valid battery of audiological tests.
