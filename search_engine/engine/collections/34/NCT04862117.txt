    
      A multicenter, extension study to assess long term safety and efficacy of an active
      implantable VNS device in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The study is uncontrolled
      and randomized, where the sites and subjects are blinded to treatment until completion of the
      parent study. Subjects who were randomized to the inactive device group in the parent study
      are re-randomized to receive active vagus nerve stimulation either 1 min QD or 1 min QID.
      Subject who were randomized to the active device groups remain on their assigned treatment (1
      min QD, 1 min QID).

      Study treatment in SPM-011 begins at the Day 0 Visit. At the Day 0, Week 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
      Visits, all subjects are given the opportunity to have the output current of their implant
      adjusted to the maximum level tolerated.

      From Week 5 onward, subjects will receive their maximally tolerated output current as 1 min
      QD or 1 min QID treatment.

      Follow up assessment visits occur at Week 8, Week 12, Months 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 33 and 36.
      Subjects are assessed for safety and durability of response throughout the follow up period.
      If the subject's symptoms or RA disease worsens, additional concomitant medications are
      allowed for treatment of their RA.
