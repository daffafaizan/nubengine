      I. To explore the feasibility of studying scrambler therapy versus a sham procedure for the
      alleviation of lower extremity chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain prospective pilot experience with recommended scrambler therapy, with regards to
      treatment efficacy to determine effect size estimates, patient related outcome measurement
      tools that we use in this trial, tolerability, and analgesic use.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a sham procedure on the back or scrambler therapy on both lower
      extremities for up to 30 minutes with the Calmare MC5-A device and cutaneous electrode
      patches applied above and below the area of pain on days 1 and 2. Patients continue scrambler
      therapy for 10 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
