      TMAO generation and dietary intervention. The investigators hypothesize that tailored dietary
      interventions may help to reduce the ability for gut flora to generate TMAO in individuals
      with elevated TMAO levels. Specific aims include:

        1. To investigate the proportion of subjects with persistently elevated circulating TMAO
           levels.

        2. To compare the amount of TMAO generated from gut flora using stable-isotope-labelled
           choline, carnitine, and betaine in subjects with elevated versus normal circulating TMAO
           levels.

        3. To evaluate the effect of dietary interventions on the amount of TMAO generated from gut
           flora using stable-isotope-labelled choline, carnitine, and betaine in subjects with
           elevated circulating TMAO levels.
