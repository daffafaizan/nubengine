      been shown that ablation improves endothelial function, suggesting that AFib might be
      associated with the etiology of endothelial dysfunction.

      The objective of this study is to assess endothelial function using Endo-PAT2000 and its
      correlation to clinical outcome following ablation of patients with Atrial Fibrillation
      (AFib).
