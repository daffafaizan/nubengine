      intended to recruit the VTE cases from the primary care sector (i.e. community based) before
      referral to specialized centers/hospitals, from hospitals (emergency department or internal
      medicine ward) or when the cases are referred back to ambulatory care after diagnosis and
      initiation of treatment in hospital settings or specialized diagnostic centers.

      Cases will be prospectively included if they are diagnosed with a new venous thrombotic event
      after study start.

      Controls will be accrued as soon as cases are identified to match with. The index date for
      controls is the date of the event in the matched cases, i.e. information after this index
      date is dismissed in the analyses. Matching will be based on year of birth, sex and region of
      residence. In addition, all controls have to be either current COC users or recent past users
      (non-use for 3 months or less). The recruitment of matched controls will be stopped as soon
      as 4 matched controls have been identified that are current new or incident users of a CMA or
      LNG COC in the pre-defined dosage (as defined as primary exposure).
