      Specific Aim #1: To delineate the relative risk of relapse in women undergoing IVF, IUI, or
      other infertility treatments who discontinue antidepressant therapy for depression, compared
      to those who maintain treatment with these agents.

      Hypothesis: Risk for depressive relapse will be greater among women who stop antidepressants
      compared to those who continue treatment with these agents.

      Specific Aim #2: To identify predictors of depressive relapse among women receiving IVF, IUI,
      or other infertility treatments

      Hypothesis: Relapse rates will be greater among those who have: 1) histories of more
      recurrent depressive illness, 2) longer duration of attempt to conceive, and 3) a lower
      degree of perceived support from respective partners.

      Specific Aim #3 (exploratory): To describe the trajectory of depressive symptoms in women
      with histories of depression across the course of IVF, IUI, or other treatments.

      Hypothesis: Specific phases of the IVF cycle will have differential effects on the burden of
      depressive symptoms. Specifically, these phases include: 1) the phase prior to egg retrieval,
      2) the phase after embryo transfer while a woman waits for the pregnancy test or her
      menstrual period, and 3) the phase after the experience of a negative pregnancy test (when
      applicable) following an IVF cycle. We seek to characterize factors associated both with
      vulnerability to more depressive symptoms and to resilience in the context of the different
      phases of IVF treatment.

      Specific Aim #4 (exploratory): To identify biological markers of stress, including HPA axis
      dysregulation and inflammation associated with depressive relapse, during IVF, IUI, or other
      infertility treatments

      Hypothesis: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, evidenced by increases
      in diurnal salivary cortisol patterns and markers of inflammation, will be associated with
      higher
