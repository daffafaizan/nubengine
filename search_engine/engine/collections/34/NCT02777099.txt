      ischemia-reperfusion injury. But the defensive mechanism of RIPostC still unclear. Stroke is
      frequently associated with autonomic dysfunction. Heart rate variability (HRV) represents the
      autonomic nervous system activity.This study aims to investigate whether RIPostC correlates
      with autonomic function and thus predicts prognosis of stroke.
