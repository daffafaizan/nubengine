        -  Test the hypothesis that omega-3 supplementation is an effective treatment for Dry Eye
           Disease (DED) in Primary Clinical Trial.

        -  Better understand DED by describing and evaluating a comprehensive set of features of
           DED and treatment over 12 months of observation in a well-characterized group of
           patients.

        -  Determine the effects of extended use and discontinuation of omega-3 through the
           Extension trial.
