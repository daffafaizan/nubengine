      Smoking remains a major public health problem and an important cause of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. Although the effectiveness of behavior support and medical treatment,
      many of those who quit smoking subsequently relapse to smoke.

      Objective:

      The primary aim of this study will be to determine the effectiveness of the mobile
      phone-based intervention to prevent relapse among recent smoking quitters. Also, the study
      aims to identify the different factors associated with relapse among recent quitters during
      the first 6 months of quitting.

      Design and Methods:

      A parallel two-armed Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of a
      mobile phone-based intervention for smoking cessation on achieving long term abstinence, will
      be conducted among volunteers. Participants will be recruited from those attended smoking
      cessation program in Southern Alrawdha clinic, Southern Abo Arish clinic, Sabia clinic and
      Aldhabia clinic.

      Primary outcome:

      The difference in relapsing rate among recent quitters, which may subsequently contribute in
      to a reduction in smoking rates.

      Trail Implications for public Health:

      The result of this study will provide evidence for effectiveness of the mobile phone-based
      intervention versus standard treatment to reduce smoking relapse rate. If proven, it will be
      a cost-saving intervention by reducing repeat use of the smoking cessation clinic services
      and by reducing use of healthcare services for smoking-related illness.
