      pituitary gland (part of brain).

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups. You will either be assigned to receive
      goserelin or no treatment. There is an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

      If you are assigned to receive goserelin, the first dose will be given as an injection under
      the skin, 1 week before you start chemotherapy. You will then receive chemotherapy as part of
      your standard of care. Following the first dose of goserelin, you will be given a goserelin
      injection into the skin, once a month until 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose.

      You will be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur during this study. After you
      are finished with chemotherapy, you will have a series of follow-up visits. During the period
      of follow-up, you will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests (2-3 teaspoons)
      to evaluate your ovarian function, every 3 months for 1 year and then at 24 months. You will
      be asked to fill out questionnaires about your menstrual history at these visits. The
      questionnaires should take about 15 minutes to complete. You will be also asked to fill out
      questionnaires about your quality of life at 12 and 24 months. The questionnaires should take
      about 30 minutes to complete.

      This is an investigational study. Goserelin is commercially available and has been approved
      by the FDA for use in breast cancer patients. Its use in this study is investigational. About
      148 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 36 patients will be enrolled at
      M.D. Anderson.
