      of Analysis): Si201/2016 (18/03/2016), and was written informed consent was obtained from all
      subjects. The study was conducted at the Department of Siriraj Obstetrics and Gynecology.

      A total of 90 patients were enrolled in the study between April 2016 and …..2017. All
      patients underwent general anesthesia for elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery.
      Inclusion criteria were patients aged between 18 and 65, elective case, ASA (American Society
      of Anesthesiologist) physical status class I-III, BMI 25-30 kg/sq.m., surgical time > 90
      minutes. Exclusion criteria were the core temperature less than 36ºC or more than 38ºC.
      Withdrawal or termination criterion was the change of laparoscopic surgery to exploratory
      laparotomy.

      On the day of surgery, participants signed the informed consent and were randomized equally
      into two groups: A = 45, receiving intraoperative forced air warming and B =45, having
      intraoperative intravenous fluid via a fluid warmer All patients underwent general anesthesia
      after application of standard monitors, anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg or
      morphine 0.1-0.2 mg/kg., propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg, nimbex 1-1.5 mg/kg or atracurium 0.6 mg/kg.
      Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane ,air,O2, supplemented with fentanyl or morphine.

      Core temperatures were measured with an electronic thermometer via tympanic membrane.
      Intraoperatively, core temperatures and room temperatures were measured at 15 minute
      intervals until the end of surgery .

      Postoperative data were measured at 15 minute intervals at the recovery room. Data consisted
      of vital sign, core temperature, room temperature, shivering, medication requirements and use
      of heating devices.
