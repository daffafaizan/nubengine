    
      The study consists of three parts:

        -  Part I is a dose escalation study to determine the safety and tolerability of a single
           intravenous injection of VCN-01 alone

        -  In Part II the safety and tolerability of the two highest VCN-01 tolerable doses from
           part I will be evaluated in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine.

        -  In Part III the safety and tolerability of the two highest VCN-01 tolerable doses from
           part I will be evaluated in combination with Abraxane®/Gemcitabine in a "delayed"
           schedule compared with Part II.
