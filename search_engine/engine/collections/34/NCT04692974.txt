      phone application -- in physical activity enhancement on cognitive frailty outcomes.
      Cognitive frailty is defined here as having both physical frailty and cognitive impairment
      but does not satisfy criteria for Major Neurocognitive Disorder. The investigators postulate
      that for older adults, such technology will help increase engagement in physical activity
      with subsequent improvement in cognitive and physical outcomes at follow up. This is with the
      aim of preventing this particular group from deteriorating to cognitive frailty because of
      the accompanying increased risk for adverse outcomes and morbidity.

      This pilot study will be a randomized control trial with 2 treatment arms. Assessments will
      be done prior to and following the intervention period. During the period of intervention,
      the wearable will act as a tracking device and will be paired with a mobile application to
      issue prompts to the participant when necessary. The independent variable explored in the
      study is the use of the wearable while the levels of physical and cognitive improvements are
      the dependent measures. These will be tracked at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.
      Additionally, the mediating variable measured is the levels of physical activity to ensure
      that the proposed outcomes are affected through an increased level of physical activity
      encouraged by the use of the device.

      If innovations like technology and the role of self-management proves efficacious, the future
      of healthcare in the context of a rapidly aging population will be more sustainable.
      Furthermore, this supporting role of technology in positive behavioral modification amongst
      older adults can have a multitude of applications in subsequent healthcare interventions.
