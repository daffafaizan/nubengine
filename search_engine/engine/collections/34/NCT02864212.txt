    
      The aim of this observational study is to create a database to extract feature of fast-acting
      drugs that can be monitor in real time to design control strategies based on high order
      sliding mode controller to create a robust drug infusion system.

      The observed drugs in this study are fast acting insulin, propofol and sodium nitroprusside.

      The effect of insulin will be measured by a continuous glucose monitor, the effect of
      propofol by a bispectral index monitor and the the effect of sodium nitroprusside by a
      invasive blood pressure monitor.
