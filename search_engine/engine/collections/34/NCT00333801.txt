      employment (SE) compared to treatment-as-usual vocational rehabilitation program (VRP) for
      veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

      Research Design: This prospective randomized study evaluates the impact of IPS-SE compared to
      VRP on occupational, sobriety, psychiatric, and quality of life outcomes and health care
      costs for veterans with chronic PTSD who enter the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center's (TVAMC)
      vocational rehabilitation program.

      Methodology: Occupational functioning is determined primarily by whether the veteran can
      obtain and maintain competitive employment, and, secondarily, by time worked and wages earned
      for those employed. Veterans who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized to either IPS-SE
      or VRP. Outcomes will be assessed over a fixed 12-month observation period (beginning at
      randomization and computed for the entire 12-month observation period) as percent subjects
      employed at least one week (employed rate), and monthly employment rates (maintained employed
      rate). In addition, PTSD symptoms and other health-related quality of life measures will be
      evaluated. This strategy uses all available data during the 1-year period.
