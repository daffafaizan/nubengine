      +45(T/G) and -11377(C/G) polymorphisms and the response to rosiglitazone monotherapy in T2D
      patients.

      A total of 255 T2D patients (138 males, 117 females) aged from 25 to 70 years (mean 48.6 ±
      10.7 years) and 120 healthy controls (53 females, 67 males) aged from 25 to 70 years(mean
      47.1 ± 11.0 years) were enrolled to participate in this study. Physical examination, medical
      history and serum biochemical tests were performed to identify healthy or T2D subjects. The
      diagnosis criteria of T2D patients were made according to the World Health Organization in
      1997 by fasting plasma glucose (FPG  7.0 mmol/L) and/or postprandial plasma glucose test
      (PPG  11.1 mmol/L). The inclusion criteria of all subjects were that subjects had the range
      of body mass index (BMI) from 18.5 to 30 kg/m2 and did not administrate any PPAR agonists in
      the last 3 months. Patients who were receiving insulin treatment, pregnant or lactating
      women, or with serious diseases such as acute myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular
      accident, trauma, and kidney disease or liver disease were excluded from this study. Table 1
      showed the characteristic profiles of T2D patients and healthy controls. There were no
      statistical differences in the age, height, weight, and BMI value between T2D patients and
      healthy controls. All subjects were recruited from local residents in Changsha city, Hunan
      Province, P. R. China. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiangya
      School of Medicine, Central South University and written informed consents were obtained
      before the start of this study. A total of 42 T2D patients (23 male, 19 female) were randomly
      selected to be only treated with 4mg rosiglitazone daily for 12 consecutive weeks without
      change in previous medications.
