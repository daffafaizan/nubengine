    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if postoperative cryotherapy with a cold-therapy
      system reduces postoperative pain and narcotic consumption following single and multi-level
      spinal fusion.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion who receive
      postoperative cryotherapy treatment with a cold-therapy system will have reduced inpatient
      pain scores and require less narcotics as compared to patients that receive standard care
      (ice pack).
