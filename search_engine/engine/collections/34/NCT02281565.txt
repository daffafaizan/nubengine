      Europe the rate was twice as high.

      In the study the investigators are examining how medical students and medical staff feel
      about the issues of blood donation, especially: blood shortage.

      The investigators are planning to focus on the following specific questions:

      What is the level of knowledge about blood donation among participants? What are the
      sociodemographic, sociocultural and socioeconomic characteristics of blood donors and
      non-blood donors among medical staff and medical students? Evidence on the role of financial
      and other incentives in eliciting blood donation.
