    
      This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy of split-course irradiation with
      concurrent chemotherapy in locoregional recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer after
      surgical resection.

      Patients received four cycles of weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(25mg/㎡), each of 1
      day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 40-51 Gy/10-17 fractions
      and 15-24 Gy/5-8 fractions administered in the first and second courses, respectively, with
      one-month break. The primary end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that
      passes from the first day of radiotherapy to the date at which disease progresses.
      Progression-free survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Toxicities will be
      graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0.
