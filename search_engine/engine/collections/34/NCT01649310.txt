      itself or due to disuse or disease states associated with and represents the reduction in
      muscle mass, leading to decreased strength and endurance, with repercussions on the
      functional abilities of the same. It reduces the power and muscle strength with aging which
      represent decreasing to carry out daily physical tasks.

      In COPD, exacerbations worsen the loss of muscle mass, affecting the respiratory and
      peripheral muscles, exercise capacity and survival rates, and in the case of severe
      malnutrition in advanced cases of the disease, the implications of this state are disability
      which occur between 10-15% in those with mild obstruction and 25% in moderate to severe
      obstructive and are associated with worse prognosis.

      The whole body vibration could be an efficient combination of training methods for elderly
      patients and is based on the generation of sinusoidal vibrations offered by a platform, which
      stimulates the muscle spindles resulting in activation of neurons Î± engines and develop
      muscle contractions, presenting itself as an alternative to conventional treatment for
      muscular endurance as well as improving physical fitness
