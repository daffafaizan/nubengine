      comparison (health promotion) groups. Both groups will learn strategies for successful aging.
      Participants will be in the study for 27 months and will be interviewed on five occasions for
      3 hours per interview. The classroom-based intervention is an 8-session, 1 1/2 hour course
      designed to teach older adults the use of strategies to improve everyday memory.
      Strategically-placed booster sessions will be provided to subjects within 3 months following
      the last class session.
