      prognosis remains dark in spite of the advent of the targeted therapies from 2007. Actually,
      the use of oral targeted therapies, most of the time carried out on an outpatient basis
      (sunitinib in particular), draws new medical management but also new practices for the
      patients (compliance), their family and the healthcare professionals [1,2].

      These therapies have sometimes heavy toxicity: side effects to identify, to treat, and for
      the patient to learn to manage. This situation underlines the importance of a therapeutic
      education to accompany this "learning" [3]. Nevertheless, the therapeutic educational
      programs, built according to the "standards" of the therapeutic education (TE), are still
      very rare in cancer research [4]: multiplicity of the pathology (a cancer, cancers),
      multiplicity of the patients' experiences, the difficulty of implementation? In May 2012, in
      front of the experience told by the patients and the professionals in the context of
      metastatic renal cancer, the members of the oncology department of the Teaching Hospital of
      Bordeaux, the therapeutic educational Federation, the Coordination Cancer Centre (3C), an
      anthropologist, an expert patient and a patient's association developed a therapeutic
      educational program for these patients [current approval].

      This program, built on the model of the TE in France, becomes here an object of research:
      MODAP (action-research).
