      Western population and the lifetime risk of HF is 20%. HF is responsible for 1-2% of all
      healthcare expenditures. Despite major improvements in the management and care of patients
      with HF, the 1-year mortality in patients with HF is 13 % and >50% of HF-patients is admitted
      during a 2.5 year period. Furthermore patients with HF have markedly decreased physical
      capacity and quality of life. Thus, there is a need for new treatment modalities in this
      group of patients.

      Ketone bodies are produced in the liver and are of vital importance in the human body for
      energy generation in the heart and brain during fasting, exercise and severe illness. Ketosis
      can be safely obtained using dietary supplements and can increase exercise capacity in
      athletes. The most important ketone bodies are 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) and acetoacetate.
      Recently, it was demonstrated that patients with severe HF have increased myocardial
      utilization of the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate.

      We have shown, using positron emission tomography, that ketone body infusion reduces
      myocardial glucose uptake and increases myocardial blood flow in healthy subjects. Data from
      another study conducted by our group show a 40% increase in cardiac output during infusion of
      3-OHB.

      Presently there are no data on the clinical cardiovascular and metabolic effects of long-term
      oral ketone-supplementation in patients with chronic HF.

      In this study the investigators will whether ketosis obtained by oral ketone supplements
      affects hemodynamics, contractile function and whole-body substrate metabolism in patients
      with heart failure.
