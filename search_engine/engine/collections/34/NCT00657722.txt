      pulmonary arteries by acute and recurrent pulmonary emboli, and organization of these blood
      clots. ANTOINE BECLERE respiratory unit, in partnership with the MARIE LANNELONGUE hospital
      thoracic and vascular surgery departments was designated recently as reference national
      centre for pulmonary hypertension and represents the only French structure for evaluation of
      CTEPH with 150 patients addressed each year.If the disease is proximately located, CTEPH can
      be cured surgically through a complex surgical procedure performed under Hypothermia and
      total circulatory arrest. In spite of multidisciplinary meeting deciding the operability of
      each case the rate of failure is approximately of 15% (9% of operative mortality rate and 6%
      of technical failure).

      The aim of this study is to identify predictive angiographic and CT findings of success, by
      allowing a better selection of operable patients.

      It would be possible to improve the effectiveness of the surgical treatment and reduce the
      rate failure from 15% to 7 % or even 5 %.
