      Study Consortium is proposing a pilot study. Several scales to assess suicidality and screen
      for depression and anxiety disorders will be administered to a group of epilepsy patients
      with characteristics similar to patients who are usually enrolled in epilepsy clinical
      trials. The study will assess the prevalence of depression, suicidal thoughts, and behavior
      and the feasibility of using the proposed psychiatric rating scales in future epilepsy
      clinical trials. This study will also provide an estimate of the proportion of patients with
      epilepsy who may be ineligible for future trials because they have had active suicidal
      thoughts in the last 6 months, suicidal behavior in the last 2 years or a current major
      depressive episode.
