    
      The study population will be divided into 3 groups each containing 200 women:

      Group (A): 200 patients will receive 5-IU oxytocin bolus over 3 minutes after delivery of the
      baby.

      Group (B): 200 patients will receive 5-IU oxytocin bolus over 3 minutes and 30-IU oxytocin
      infusion in 500 ml 0.9 % saline over 4 hours after delivery of the baby.

      Group (C): 200 patients will receive misoprostol 800 micrograms intrauterine, placed manually
      on the bottom of the uterine cavity after delivery of the placenta and cleaning of the
      cavity.

      Operative blood loss will be estimated in theatre based on the volume in the suction bottle
      and the weight of swabs used. We will record blood loss up until the time the woman will be
      discharged from the theatre recovery ward.

      Hemoglobin level and haematocrit value will be done as follow:-

        1. After admission of each case in the pre-operative period.

        2. Immediately post- operative.

        3. 24 hours post- operative.
