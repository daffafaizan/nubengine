      Treatment of pain is most often accomplished by parenteral opioids analgesics. However,
      inadequate analgesia is often a problem when opioids alone are relied on for pain control. In
      the peri-operative setting ketamine has been used as an adjunct to opioids for acute pain.
      Ketamine may play a role in maximizing analgesia in the ED.
