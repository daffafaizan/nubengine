    
      MPS IIIA is caused by a deficiency of the heparan-N-sulfatase (SGSH) enzyme, leading to the
      accumulation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate in the lysosomes. Untreated patients
      of MPS IIIA experience rapid and progressive neurologic deterioration. To date, there is no
      effective disease-modifying treatment for patients suffering from MPS IIIA.

      This study aims to recruit 3 to 5 patients with MPS IIIA who satisfy the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and provide full consent, between 3 months and 24 months of age. The
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be a cell-based gene therapy that uses
      genetically modified autologous CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells transduced with a lentiviral
      vector containing the human SGSH gene. Patients will be followed up for a minimum of 3 years
      after gene therapy.
