    
      This is a prospective non-randomized trial with two study groups. The trial is designed to
      show if the ARTERY FIRST approach reduces the rate of R1 resections in patients undergoing
      surgery for cancer of the pancreatic head.

      After the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreatic head by clinical, laboratory and imaging
      evaluation patients who are scheduled for resection will be screened for inclusion into the
      trial. Informed consent is obtained at least on the day before surgery and patients meeting
      the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study.
