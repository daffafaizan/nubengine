    
      This study will compare 5 non-invasive lymphedema treatments.

      Patients will be assigned to either:

      - A combination of arm exercises, arm elevation, and wearing of a compression garment every
      day

      OR

      - One of four possible pneumatic compression devices for just two hours every day.

      Pneumatic compression devices are made up of an inflatable sleeve connected to a small
      controller unit that is plugged into the wall. They feel like having your blood pressure
      taken.

      None of the treatments are experimental. None of the treatments are invasive. All the
      treatments are considered standard of care and are used in clinics throughout the United
      States. All of the treatments will be done at home.

      The trial will last for 7 and 1/2 months and will require follow-up visits to monitor
      progress.
