      and record a history of atopic diseases or recurrent infections throughout life. The PANSS,
      PSP, and MCCB battery scales will be administered. A blood sample will be taken for the
      determination of markers of inflammation before the start of pharmacological treatment.

      Patients will start the antipsychotic medication assigned by their treating physician. They
      will also be assigned randomly to the treatment arm. The study drug will be provided by the
      research team under the presentation of capsules containing Celecoxib 200 mg, Minocycline 100
      mg or Placebo, and patients will be instructed to take one capsule every 12 hrs daily.

      The patient will be reassessed with PANSS, PSP, and MCCB after completing 6 weeks of
      pharmacological treatment, type and dose of medication will be recorded and serum markers of
      inflammation will be determined again.
