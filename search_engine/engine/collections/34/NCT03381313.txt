      12 pure anomic patients in the chronic stage of the disease. The to be repeated words were
      presented alongside the corresponding pictures. The timing of word and picture presentation
      was manipulated in order to investigate the suitability of classical conditioning to reteach
      the association between pictures and their names. Data were analyzed at the group and at the
      single subject level with the aim of establishing the relative efficacy of the conditioned
      and non-conditioned word-repetition modality and the cognitive features predicting therapy
      success. In keeping with preliminary results obtained on a single case study, conditioning
      turned out to improve therapy gain at the group level. Moreover, hints were found suggesting
      less generalization to untreated words in conditioned compared to non-conditioned training.
      Non-word repetition skills was the only feature in the participants cognitive profile which
      was reliably linked to the therapy outcome.
