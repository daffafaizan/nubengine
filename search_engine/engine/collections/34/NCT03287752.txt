      surface of the cuff is moulded to direct any oropharyngeal contents away from the glottis and
      towards the side channels to which suction can be attached to facilitate aspiration of this
      space (Fig.1c). These features may reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration of secretions or
      gastric contents that accumulate in the supraglottic area.

      Compared with previous versions, these modifications have made BASKA mask airway a fairly
      safe and effective airway device in low-risk patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic
      surgeries
