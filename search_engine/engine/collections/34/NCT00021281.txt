      colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan with or
      without SU5416. II. Compare the antitumor efficacy of these regimens in these patients. III.
      Evaluate the additional measures of clinical benefit in patients treated with these regimens.
      IV. Determine the relative safety profile of these regimens in these patients. V. Assess
      quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (normal vs
      elevated), and treatment regimen. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms by 2
      different regimens (Saltz vs de Gramont). Regimen I (Saltz): Arm IA: Patients receive SU5416
      IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, and 39. Patients also receive
      irinotecan IV over 30-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 5-10 minutes, and fluorouracil
      IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Arm IIA: Patients receive irinotecan,
      leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in arm I. Treatment in both arms repeats every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimen II (de
      Gramont): Arm IB: Patients receive SU5416 as in arm IA. Patients also receive irinotecan IV
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and
      fluorouracil IV over 2 hours on days 1, 2, 15, 16, 29, and 30. Arm IIB: Patients receive
      irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in arm IB. Treatment in both arms repeats
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life
      is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of each course, and then at the end of treatment.
      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,270 patients (635 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
