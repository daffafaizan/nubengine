        -  Determine the feasibility of adjuvant photodynamic therapy with large diffuser fibers in
           patients with malignant mesothelioma undergoing surgery.

        -  Compare results of this regimen in these patients to historical controls.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive porfimer sodium IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo pleurectomy
      or pleuropneumonectomy followed by intracavitary photodynamic therapy on day 3.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
