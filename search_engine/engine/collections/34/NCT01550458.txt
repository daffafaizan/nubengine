      tolerated dose (MTD) of ascending doses of mibefradil administered four times a day (QID) in
      healthy volunteers. The knowledge gained will then guide the details of a study of Interlaced
      Therapy™ in patients with recurrent High Grade Glioma (HGG). Non-clinical studies are
      currently on-going in the efficacy of Interlaced Therapy™ in ovarian cancer, pancreatic
      cancer, and intracranial malignancy.
