      in human aging that has been conducted in Baltimore since 1958. The study population is a
      series of healthy volunteers of different ages followed indefinitely with serial evaluations
      over time. The major aim of the study is to characterize the aging process in its
      multifaceted aspects. To accomplish this task, a large cohort of volunteers dispersed over a
      wide age range are enrolled in the study when they are healthy, and then followed with
      regular follow-up visits for life. Since the aging process involves the whole range of
      physiological domains, participants receive an extensive evaluation of physiological
      parameters, biomarkers, risk factors, disease-related measures, impairments, and physical and
      cognitive function over follow-up visits that last for multiple days. Blood samples and other
      specimens are collected to obtain part of these measures and/or to be stored for future use.
      Information on mood, personality, psychological and social aspects of life that are relevant
      to the study of aging is also collected. Information collected in the BLSA represents a
      unique source of longitudinal data on aging. Historically the BLSA has contributed more than
      any other research project to our understanding of aging. More recently, the BLSA has begun
      to focus on factors associated with exceptionally healthy aging.
