      in covering denuded root surfaces. Combining enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) with
      periodontoplasic surgical operations is another method in covering denuded root surface. The
      aim of this study is to compare a SCTG operation group and EMD applied group in addition to
      SCTG using complete root coverage rate and a newer method root coverage esthetic scoring
      system (RES).

      Methods: This is a split-mouth and controlled study. Thirthy-eight Class I or II gingival
      recession defects at canine teeth were treated in the control (SCTG) (n=19) and test groups
      (n=19) (SCTG+EMD). The root coverage esthetic score were evaluated by 2 blind periodontists 1
      year after the treatment using RES. The agreement between the two periodontists was assessed
      by kappa analysis. Complete root coverage rate was evaluated for both groups. Two groups were
      compared with statistically methods in terms of RES parameters and gingival recession height
      /width.
