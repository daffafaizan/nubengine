    
      Using larger sample prospective randomized controlled study design, and comparing neoadjuvant
      HT combined with docetaxel chemotherapy to neoadjuvant HT followed by RP and extended lymph
      node dissection to determine whether neoadjuvant HT combined with docetaxel chemotherapy can
      more effectively improve biochemical progression-free survival of locally advanced prostate
      cancer patients.

      Further analysis was performed to determine whether the treatment regimen helped to prolong
      the radiologic progression-free survival (rPFS) or OS in these patients.

      The pathological changes of tumor before and after neoadjuvant treatment were also analyzed.
      To search for the important risk factors influencing the long-term prognosis of these
      patients, the safety characteristics of patients in different treatment groups were analyzed.
      Therefore, it can provide the basis for the formulation of the optimal treatment plan for
      locally advanced prostate cancer, prolong the survival time of patients and improve the
      quality of life.
