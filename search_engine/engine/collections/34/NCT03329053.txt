      standard lifestyle informative procedure and the digital training and decision system
      informative procedure.

      We hypothesize that a higher rate of compliance between seven-day exercise report and
      physical activity recommendations will be observed in the experimental group compared with
      three-months waiting group.

      The goal is to recruit patients with a stable diagnosis, clinically defined as sufficiently
      healthy to participate in an optimized (safe and monitored) exercise programme. Based on the
      experience with similar projects completed on Cardiovascular Health Centres (CHC) expected
      attrition rate is 25%. Such a value and 400 participants as a target recruitment number still
      allows to keep 150 participants in both groups and a power of 80% to detect the differences
      between groups and across the time at an Î± level of 0,05 (two-tailed).

      The trial will be supervised by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board consisting of one
      independent, internationally recognized clinical researcher, one representative
      (cardiologist) from each cooperating Cardiovascular Healthcare Centre as an advisor and
      experts in health psychology, exercise psychology, trial management and exercise physiology.
      The Board will be the policy and decision-making authority of the trial.
