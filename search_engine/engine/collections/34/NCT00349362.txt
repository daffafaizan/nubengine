      development of diabetes. Clinical trials have indicated a potential benefit of testosterone
      treatment in improving diabetic control and insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is also
      associated with changes in arterial stiffness and IMT which are known to be linked to the
      presence of cardiovascular disease. Artificially induced hypogonadism results in increasing
      arterial stiffness whilst testosterone is known to improve risk factors for vascular disease
      and act as a vasodilator. The purpose of this pilot study is to test the effect of six months
      of testosterone replacement, given as testosterone esters 200mg from Sustanon 250 IM
      injection, on diabetes control in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin.
