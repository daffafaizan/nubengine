      undergoing chemotherapy (with or without radiotherapy); stratified by status of iron
      deficiency (i.e. non-iron deficient vs. iron deficient patients ). The study will also try to
      find out whether serum level of Hepcidin and C reactive protein can correlate with response

      Patients will receive one or two doses of FCM, based on the body weight and Hb level.
      Patients will be followed-up for a total of twelve weeks. The study is divided into a
      screening, treatment and follow-up phases and is expected to be completed in 12 months.
