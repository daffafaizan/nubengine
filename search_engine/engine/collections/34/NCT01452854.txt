      physicians to predict the possibility of infertility (the inability to become pregnant)
      following recovery from Temozolomide treatment. Physicians would like to provide better
      individualized recommendations for cancer patients regarding timing of planned treatment and
      future pregnancy.

      We will do this by comparing data from the women being treated for Low Grade Glioma with
      Temozolomide to a similar group of women who have been unaffected by cancer or cancer
      treatment.
