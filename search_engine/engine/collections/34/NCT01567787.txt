      risk associated with photon radiation, by delivering therapeutic doses to a well-defined
      target area with significant reduction in the integral dose. A dosimetry comparison of
      protons and photons at the University of Florida Proton Therapy Institute confirmed the
      feasibility of proton irradiation of these tumors with less exposure of normal tissue to
      radiation than expected with photon techniques. This reduced radiation exposure to uninvolved
      normal tissues is expected to decrease the risk of radiation-induced second malignancies and
      neoplasms.
