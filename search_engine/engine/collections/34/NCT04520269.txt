    
      2.1. Hypothesis

        -  Single agent pacritinib is effective in disease control of patients with 1q21.3
           amplified solid tumors

        -  Single agent pacritinib is safe in patients with 1q21.3 amplified solid tumors

        -  Treatment with pacritinib will decrease plasma cfDNA copy number ratio of 1q21.3 in
           patients with 1q21.3 amplified solid tumors

        -  Plasma cfDNA copy number ratio of 1q21.3 will correlate with serial radiological
           findings in patients with 1q21.3 amplified solid tumors

      2.2. Primary Objectives

      â€¢ To determine the proportion of patients with 1q21.3 amplified breast cancer (primary
      population: Cohort A) who remain progression-free at 4 months after treatment with pacritinib

      2.3. Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of pacritinib in patients with treatment
           refractory solid tumors

        -  To determine the RP2D of pacritinib in patients with treatment refractory solid tumors

        -  To evaluate disease response from pacritinib by RECIST criteria version 1.1 and tumor
           markers

        -  To determine the proportion of patients with 1q21.3 amplified treatment refractory solid
           tumors excluding (exploratory population: Cohort B) who remain progression-free at 4
           months after treatment with pacritinib

      2.4. Exploratory Objectives

        -  To determine pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters including Cmax/min and steady state
           concentrations of pacritinib through serial plasma sampling

        -  To determine pharmacodynamics (PD) parameters including highly sensitive C-reactive
           protein (CRP), HbA1c, changes in cytokine levels and plasma cfDNA levels of copy number
           ratio of 1q21.3

        -  Correlation of plasma cfDNA levels of copy number ratio of 1q21.3 with radiological
           findings determined by RECIST criteria 1.1 and tumor markers
