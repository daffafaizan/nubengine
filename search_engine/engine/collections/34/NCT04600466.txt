      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues on retrospectively identified patients with
      GAC. Germline testing will be done on both retrospectively and prospectively identified
      cohort of patients with diagnosis of GAC. The second part of the study will be accomplished
      via survey administration on retrospectively and prospectively identified patients with
      diagnosis of GAC and to test Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
      infection status, which are known risk factors for the development of GAC, on their FFPE
      gastric specimen. The data from part 1 and part 2 will be analyzed and correlated. The
      overall goal of the study is to identify molecular markers and environmental risk factors in
      GAC unique to Hispanics relative to Non-Hispanics in South Texas, and to define molecular
      alterations in pre-malignant gastric lesions associated with the development of GAC. The
      long-term goal is to improve racial disparities by defining prognostic and therapeutic
      molecular markers and environmental risk factors in Hispanics and ultimately for all patients
      with GAC. Identification of high-risk molecular markers and environmental factors in the
      development of GAC will help future deployment of improved prevention and surveillance
      modalities.
