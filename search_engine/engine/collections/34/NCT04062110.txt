      controversial, Hence, we conducted a two-arm, parallel-group, prospective randomised trial to
      compare the capacity of long casts (above-elbow) and short casts (below-elbow) to maintain
      the reduction of extra-articular distal radius fractures with dorsal displacement (AO/OTA
      classification: 2R3A2.2). Eligible patients with AO/OTA 2R3A2.2 fractures treated with closed
      reduction and cast immobilization were randomized to the long cast group or to the short cast
      group. Baseline radiological parameters, radial inclination (RI), radial height (RH), ulnar
      variance (UV) and palmar tilt (PT) were taken, and compared with clinical (DASH, Mayo Wrist
      and Mayo Elbow) and radiological scores taken at 7-10 days, 4 weeks and 12 weeks.
      Furthermore, to evaluate correlations between radiological parameters and functional
      outcomes, patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not their
      radiological parameters at Follow-ups 2 and 3 were acceptable, i.e. within the range 11-12 mm
      for RH, 16째-28째 for IR, -4-+2 mm for UV, and 0째-22째 for PT.
