      regimen as second-line therapy was evaluated in a large phase III study (EFC10262-VELOUR).
      This combination significantly improved both PFS (4.7 to 6.9 months, HR=0.76; P=<0.001) and
      OS (12.1 to 13.5 months, HR=0.82; P=0.003). In the evaluable population (86.5%), the tumor
      response rate was also improved when adding aflibercept (ORR=19.8% [16.4-23.2]) to the
      FOLFIRI regimen (ORR=11.1% [8.5-13.8]).

      Irinotecan The combination of aflibercept with FOLFIRI3, an optimized irinotecan-based
      regimen, was evaluated in 65 patients in a French multicentric retrospective cohort. (Carola
      C et al, WJCO 2018) In the cohort of irinotecan-naïve patients (n=30), the objective response
      rate was 43.3%, and the disease control rate 76.7%. Median PFS and OS were 11.3 months (95%
      CI 6.1-29.0) and 17.0 months (95% CI 13.0-17.3). The most common (>5%) grade 3-4 adverse
      events were diarrhea (37.9%), neutropenia (14.3%), stomatitis and anemia (10.4%),
      hypertension (6.7%).

      In the cohort of patients previously treated with irinotecan (n=35), the objective response
      rate was 34.3%, and the disease control rate 60.0%. Median PFS and OS were 5.7 months (95% CI
      3.9-10.4) and 14.3 months (95% CI 12.8-19.5).

      Study Objectives

      Primary:

      •To compare once (day 1) or twice (day 1, day 3) administration of irinotecan in combination
      with 5-fluorouracile and aflibercept as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer in terms of overall response rate (ORR)

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate disease control rate (DRC) and Early Response Rate (ERR)

        -  To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS),

        -  to evaluate the conversion rate to locoregional therapy, surgery of metastasis, the
           quality of resection (R0, R1, R2) and the pathological response in patients with
           resected metastatic disease,

        -  To assess the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the European
           Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life
           Questionnaire-C30 (QLQ-C30),

        -  To assess Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) on using
           the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC version 5.0).

      Exploratory:

        -  To assess the impact on selected circulating biomarkers (angiogenic and exosomal)

        -  To assess the impact on selected tumor biomarkers
