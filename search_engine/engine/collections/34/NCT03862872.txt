    
      This is a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, parallel
      intervention study including three groups of 25 subjects between 35-65 years of age, treated
      with either Bend Beauty's Anti-Aging Formula, fish oil control or inert placebo for 90 days,
      with testing points at baseline, 30, 60, and 90 days.

      Subjects will be preselected through a Subject Eligibility Screening (SES) against defined
      inclusion and exclusion criteria for entry into the trial. Eligible participants will be
      tested using the Chronic Inflammation Test for urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2
      (https://chronicinflammationtest.com) and the Omega-3 Index Test for eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in red blood cells (RBC) (https://omegaquant.com ), to
      confirm possible presence of chronic inflammation. If these test results meet a defined
      limit, participants will be enrolled in the trial.

      A number of assessments will be conducted before and after treatment.
