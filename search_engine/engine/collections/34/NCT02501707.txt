      patients, who are treated with curative chemoradiation (CRT).This side-effect can heavily
      impact quality of life and is a dose-limiting factor for the treatment. Identifying high risk
      patients before the start of the treatment would make it possible to adapt the treatment by
      choosing another radiation technique or proton therapy. However, despite the fact that many
      patient and treatment characteristics have been associated with RILI, it is not possible to
      accurately predict the risk of RILI for individual patients. Recently, it has been shown that
      the radiation dose to the heart is a risk factor for lung toxicity in both animal and
      clinical studies. Also, in a study, carried out jointly by CARIM and GROW, it was found that
      patients with a previous diagnosis of cardiac disease had a significantly higher risk to
      develop RILI after CRT (p-value <0.001), even with low or no radiation dose to the heart. It
      is unknown whether asymptomatic cardiac comorbidity is also related to development of RILI.
      Taking into account that approximately 30% of all lung cancer patients suffer from
      symptomatic cardiac comorbidity at the start of cancer treatment, there is an urgent need for
      research projects focusing on cardio-oncology. These projects will make it possible to
      unravel the complex relationship between heart, lungs, chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
      In the current project the investigators hypothesize that biomarkers based on
      echocardiography, which reflects cardiac function, are prognostic for development of
      radiation induced lung injury after chemoradiotherapy. In addition, the investigators will
      validate our previous finding that presence of cardiac comorbidity is associated with RILI.
