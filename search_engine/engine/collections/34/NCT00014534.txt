      Primary

        -  Compare the survival of patients with completely resected locally advanced transitional
           cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with adjuvant doxorubicin and gemcitabine followed
           by paclitaxel and cisplatin vs adjuvant cisplatin and gemcitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to primary tumor
      status (<T4 vs T4), number of positive lymph nodes (0 or unknown vs 1-5 vs >5), and number of
      dissected nodes (0-10 or unknown vs > 10). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and
           cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant doxorubicin IV over 45 minutes followed by gemcitabine
           IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC)
           daily on days 3-10. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 14 days after the completion
           of doxorubicin and gemcitabine, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and
           cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive G-CSF SC daily on days
           3-10 or 4-11. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 18 months, every 6 months for 18 months, and then
      annually thereafter.
