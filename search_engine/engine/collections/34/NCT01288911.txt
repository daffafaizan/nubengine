      double-blind period and demonstration of a statistically significant advantage of
      enzalutamide over bicalutamide as assessed by the primary endpoint, all ongoing enzalutamide
      treated participants and ongoing or previous bicalutamide treated participants that met entry
      criteria were offered open-label enzalutamide at the discretion of the participant and study
      investigators.
