      weekly Social Skills Training Sessions for the treatment of social impairment in children
      (ages 5-11 years) with PDD during a randomized placebo-controlled trial. This will examine
      our central hypothesis that D-cycloserine will enhance learning of social skills in children
      with PDD's.
