    
      To evaluate and compare two AmBisome dosing regimens for the initial treatment of invasive
      aspergillosis and other filamentous fungal infections diagnosed by modified EORTC criteria in
      immunocompromised patients, as determined by overall response rates at end of course of
      treatment.

      Determine and compare the following parameters for the two treatment arms:

        -  Safety and tolerability

        -  Survival rates and the rates of infection relapse at 4 weeks Post Treatment.

        -  Survival rate at 12 weeks after study entry.

        -  Time to favorable overall response and time to End of Treatment for patients with
           favorable overall response.

        -  Cumulative dose of study drug given through End of Treatment.
