      treatment with 10 mg melatonin daily or placebo during the menstruation for 2 menstrual
      cycles. Another 40 women with endometriosis will be randomized to treatment with 20 mg or
      placebo daily during 8 weeks. Participants will report drug intake, bleeding details
      (duration and amount) and pain as well as possible side effects. They will also perform a
      test for sleep quality and cognition before and after completion of the study.
