      stroke, given the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Oral anticoagulation can
      prevent most strokes in patients with AF; provided that AF is recognized before a stroke
      occurs. Up to about 40% of incident AF may be sub-clinical, producing minimal or no symptoms,
      or being too short to allow detection.

      DX AF is a prospective, randomized-controlled, open-label trial. Patients who are identified
      on clinical grounds for a single-chamber ICD will be randomized to a VDD ICD (experimental
      group) or single chamber ICD (control group).

      The study will compare the Dx-ICD system (experimental) to standard VVI-ICD (control) on the
      ability to diagnose silent AF in patients without prior AF receiving an ICD for standard
      indications.
