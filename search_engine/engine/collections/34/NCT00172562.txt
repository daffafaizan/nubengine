      capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, e.g. by sprouting or by intusseption. Through the
      pioneering work of Folkman, it was recognized that angiogenesis plays an important role in
      tumor development, progression, and metastasis. It is also conceivable that there are forms
      or developmental stages of leukemia, multiple myeloma, or lymphomas that will progress
      independently of angiogenesis. Synthesis of angiogenesis activators, such as vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other angiogenic factors, such as basic fibroblast
      growth factor (bFGF), has been demonstrated for leukemia cells, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and
      myeloma cells. Microvessel density is also significantly elevated over normal controls with
      progressive increases according to the stages of myelodysplastic syndrome. Increased
      microvessel density (MVD) in the bone marrow was found in patients with multiple myeloma in
      comparison to normal controls and increased MVD is an adverse prognostic marker in multiple
      myeloma. However, the functional status of the blood vessel (e.g. permeability) cannot be
      determined by the above mentioned methods.
