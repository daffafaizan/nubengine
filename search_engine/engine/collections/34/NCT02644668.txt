    
      CY 5021 is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study of
      reldesemtiv in 2 sequential ascending dose cohorts of patients with SMA. Patients will be
      randomized 2:1 to receive reldesemtiv or placebo twice daily for 8 weeks. Patients randomized
      to reldesemtiv in Cohort 1 will receive a dose of 150 mg twice daily and patients randomized
      to reldesemtiv in Cohort 2 will receive 450 mg twice daily. Within each cohort, randomization
      will be stratified by ambulatory status (ambulatory versus non ambulatory).

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the PD effects of reldesemtiv on measures
      of pulmonary function, respiratory function, muscle strength, and motor function. Other PD
      measures include changes in the timed up and go (TUG) test, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and
      patient and investigator global assessments. Secondary objectives include the safety of
      multiple doses of reldesemtiv and an evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of reldesemtiv.
