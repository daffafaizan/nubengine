      standard. The conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system is associated with
      inflammatory reaction, hemolysis, hemodilution an disturbances of the blood coagulation
      system. Also it's well known that neurological disturbances caused by embolic material and
      air bubbles are potential risks of CPB. The new minimized perfusion circuit ROCsafeTM is a
      closed, reservoir-less, reduced prime, surface coated circuit, with optimized safety features
      in effectively eliminate both macro and micro air bubbles and should optimize the clinical
      outcome after CABG using cardiopulmonary bypass.
