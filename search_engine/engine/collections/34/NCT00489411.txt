      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of duloxetine hydrochloride in cancer patients with painful
           chemotherapy-induced (taxane or platinum agent) peripheral neuropathy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the influence of this drug on peripheral neuropathy-related functional status
           and quality of life of these patients.

        -  Describe the differences in duloxetine hydrochloride efficacy when used to treat pain
           caused by chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy based on the neurotoxic drug and
           class.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Patients
      are stratified according to prior neurotoxic agent (paclitaxel vs oxaliplatin vs other taxane
      agents without paclitaxel vs platinum agents [cisplatin] without oxaliplatin) and high risk
      for developing painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (no vs yes). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral duloxetine hydrochloride once or twice daily in weeks 1-6.
           After a 1-week rest period, patients cross over to receive an oral placebo once or twice
           daily in weeks 8-13.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo once or twice daily in weeks 1-6. After a
           1-week rest period, patients cross over to receive oral duloxetine hydrochloride once or
           twice daily in weeks 8-13.

      Patients complete pain and quality of life questionnaires, including the BPI-SF once weekly
      and FACT/GOG-NTX and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires, in weeks 1, 6, 8, and 13.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 weeks.
