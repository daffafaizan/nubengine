      Once enrolled the study will take two weeks. During the first week subjects attend daily,
      hour-long outpatient visits at San Francisco General Hospital. At these visits subjects will
      receive an oral dose of l-methamphetamine, have their vitals read, answer questionnaires and
      receive a blood draw.
