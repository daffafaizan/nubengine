      routinely recommended to patients with coronary disease. However, the relative importance of
      dietary cholesterol to serum lipids has become a subject of active debate. Eggs provide a
      complete array of amino acids and an array of micronutrients, and are low in total fat.
      Epidemiological and clinical studies have showed that dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids
      decreases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Endothelial function testing represents a
      uniquely valuable means of assessing aggregated influences on cardiac risk by gauging
      physiologic responses of the vascular endothelium. In prior studies the investigators have
      shown that daily egg ingestion for 6 weeks did not adversely affect endothelial function in
      healthy adults or in hyperlipidemic adults. The investigators now propose a prospective,
      randomized, single-blind crossover study to assess the effects of eggs, egg substitute and
      high-carbohydrate American breakfast on endothelial responses and serum lipids in
      participants with clinically established CHD.
