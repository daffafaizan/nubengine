      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal (IP) paclitaxel when given
      concurrently with fixed dose intravenous (IV) doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) and IV
      cisplatin.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of IP paclitaxel when given concurrently with
      fixed dose IV doxorubicin hydrochloride and IP cisplatin.

      III. To determine the feasibility of an IV/IP based doxorubicin hydrochloride, paclitaxel,
      and cisplatin chemotherapy regimen in patients with advanced endometrial cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of paclitaxel.

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 1
      hour on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 2, and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on
      days 3-12 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients then receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV and cisplatin IV or IP on day 1, and
      paclitaxel IP on days 1 or 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
