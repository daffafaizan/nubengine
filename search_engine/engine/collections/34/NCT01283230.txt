      elastography is acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. ARFI has the advantages
      which can be conducted in parallel ways of measuring points in the patients with chronic
      liver disease when they underwent routine ultrasound examination. Thus, the aim of this study
      was to identify the normal range of ARFI velocity and assess the best cut-off value by
      recruiting healthy living liver and kidney donors.
