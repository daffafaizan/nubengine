      intra-operative bleeding. Therefore, rapid fibrinogen supplementation to restore
      physiological plasma levels is an important component to achieve and maintain hemostasis in
      bleeding patients. In this study, patients with major blood loss during elective spine
      surgery will be randomized 1:1 to a single intravenous transfusion of the fibrinogen
      concentrate BT524 or to fibrinogen-containing fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
