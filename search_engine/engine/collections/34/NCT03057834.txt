      function status. The design will involve tracking the number of women recruited with physical
      function impairment and those without any functional impairment. Investigators aim to recruit
      similar numbers of women in each group. If they find unequal numbers, they will adapt recruit
      strategies based on a woman's functional status.

      Investigators will compare changes in outcome measures within and between groups after 6 and
      12 weeks of pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME). The change in pelvic floor
      strength/efficiency will be assessed by repeating the pelvic floor PERFECT assessment and
      will be compared between groups. Changes in UI symptoms, symptom severity, and impact of UI
      symptoms on quality of life will be determined using standardized measures described above.
      Data analysis will define associations between changes in PERFECT measures and the change in
      UI episodes (based on 3-day voiding diary), severity, and type (based on QUID-7), and impact
      on quality of life (PFIQ-7) within and between groups. Objective measurement of
      lower-extremity strength will inform the relationship between lower-extremity strength,
      pelvic floor strength, and UI symptoms at baseline and the 6-week visit.
