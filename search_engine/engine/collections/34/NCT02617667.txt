      concentrations as one drop twice daily versus vehicle (placebo). In addition to the masked
      vehicle control arm, an open-label comparator arm consisting of Restasis was included.

      The study explored a range of signs and symptoms of DED to gain an understanding of the
      possible treatment effects in comparison to vehicle and estimation of effect sizes. In line
      with current treatment guidelines, the proposed phase 2 population consisted of patients
      suffering from moderate to severe DED.

      The primary treatment comparisons in this study were between the two CyclASol concentrations
      versus vehicle for the sign variable total corneal fluorescein staining and the symptom
      variable dryness severity visual analogue scale at day 113. All other comparisons between
      treatments groups were considered secondary analyses.
