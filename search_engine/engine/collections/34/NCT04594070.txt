    
      Eligible pregnant women in the first or second trimester who carry a diagnosis of iron
      deficiency anemia as defined by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology will be
      approached, consented, and randomized to receive either daily oral ferrous sulfate (325mg)
      supplementation or every other day oral ferrous sulfate (650mg). Participants will undergo a
      phone survey 2-4 weeks after starting the study to assess for side effects. Participants will
      continue routine care and surveillance of iron deficiency in pregnancy until the end of
      pregnancy.
