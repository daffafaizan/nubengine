      radiation. MR which does not produce radiation was not possible due to the low concentration
      of fluids in the open spaces of the lungs. With hyperpolarized noble gases we can now use the
      safe techniques of MR imaging to view the airways of the lungs, thus limiting human exposure
      to radiation. This technique has already been proven to be possible in human subjects but
      there is insufficient data show its efficacy in a clinical setting. This study is designed to
      image a variety of pulmonary disorders to better find possible clinical uses for
      hyperpolarized gas MRI.
