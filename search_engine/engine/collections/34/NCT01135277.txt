      and societal costs of sepsis, the mechanism by which it kills remains unclear. The
      pathophysiology of sepsis is not completely understood, but many investigators now believe
      that sepsis induces a prolonged state of immune suppression. This study will attempt to
      quantify the degree of immune suppression during the first 5 days of sepsis by measuring the
      immune function of peripheral blood monocytes and the inflammasome constituent proteins in
      peripheral blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages.
