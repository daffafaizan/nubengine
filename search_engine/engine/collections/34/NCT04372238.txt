      among PWUD. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive the RAPIDS intervention or the
      attention-matched control condition. Experimental arm participants will receive the RAPIDS
      intervention, which includes education about the dangers of illicitly manufactured fentanyl
      (IMF), motivational interviewing to increase willingness to use fentanyl test strips and
      engage in overdose risk reduction behaviors, hands-on training to use the test strips, and
      opportunities to plan and role- play how to implement overdose risk reduction behaviors upon
      receipt of a positive or negative test result. In the attention-matched control arm,
      participants will receive standardized overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND)
      training. All participants will attend additional study visits at months 1,2,3,6, and 12. The
      primary endpoint will be the rate of self-reported overdose over the follow-up period.
      Secondary endpoints (e.g., overdose death) will be ascertained by data linkage to statewide
      overdose surveillance databases.

      The primary aims of this study are to: 1) Assess the efficacy of the RAPIDS intervention in
      reducing rates of overdose among people who use drugs; 2) Examine the degree to which
      reductions in rates of overdose are mediated by increases in information, motivation,
      behavioral skills, and self-efficacy regarding fentanyl, rapid fentanyl testing, and harm
      reduction practices; and 3) Explore whether there is heterogeneity of treatment effect
      related to key participant characteristics.
