      attempt to determine the most beneficial and efficient treatment for Bankart lesions and
      anterior shoulder instability. To date there is only weak evidence supporting the superiority
      of Bankart lesion repair in addition to rotator interval closure compared to Bankart lesion
      repair alone.

      Does Bankart lesion repair with rotator interval closure result in differences in quality of
      life, range of motion and recurrence at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2
      years in similar patients with Bankart lesions who are treated with Bankart lesion repair
      alone?
