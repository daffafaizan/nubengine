      hour glycemic fluctuation by restoring the physiologic pattern of insulin secretion.
      Furthermore decrease postprandial glycemic excursion should decrease the oxidative stress
      markers. Those effects might be amplified in Asian patients because of prominent early phase
      insulin secretory defects accompanied with relatively less degree of insulin resistance.
      Based on this assumption, this research will focus on the effect of Sitagliptin on 24 hour
      glycemic excursion and improvement of oxidative stress markers compared to long acting
      sulphonylurea Glimepiride in type 2 diabetic patients with inadequate glycemic control on
      metformin.
