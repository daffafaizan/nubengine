      in recent years into increasing the complete response (CR) rates. In elderly patients (over
      the age of 60), CR rates are lower, 40 to 50%, and long term disease-free and overall
      survival is less than 10%. The therapeutic options for relapsed/refractory AML are
      significantly limited. Bortezomib has shown promising activity in patients with advanced
      hematologic malignancies, including those with leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Given the available data suggesting efficacy of bortezomib in combination with doxil in
      patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and Non
      Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) as well as the known sensitivity of AML to anthracyclines and in
      vitro data demonstrating the sensitivity of multiply resistant AML cells to bortezomib, we
      are proposing the use of this combination in patients with relapsed/refractory AML or elderly
      patients who are not candidates for standard induction therapy.

      Using the subcutaneous formulation of bortezomib would provide patients with reduced
      neurotoxicity and easier schedule due to decreased time in the infusion room and it would
      decrease overall cost of care.
