      replaced. After having a heart valve replaced, patients have a higher risk of death than
      people who have not had a valve replaced. In young adult patients, replacing the aortic heart
      valve with a mechanical valve halves their life-span compared to other people their age.
      Mechanical valves tend to form blood clots so they need long-term blood thinners that
      increase risk of bleeding and lower quality of life. Animal tissue valves reduce clotting and
      bleeding risks but wear out sooner and shorten patient life-span. An operation, called the
      Ross procedure, replaces a patient's diseased aortic valve with his/her own pulmonary valve
      and uses a donor valve in the pulmonary position which receives less stress than the aortic
      valve. The Ross procedure aims to improve valve durability with less clotting, avoiding use
      of blood thinners. Patients and physicians need a large, high-quality study comparing the
      Ross procedure and standard valve replacement to know if either approach is better. In
      parallel to the REVIVAL Registry, a REVIVAL Randomized Trial will also take place.

      Patients included in randomized trials often systematically differ from those who are not. By
      creating a registry of patients who are eligible for but not recruited into the REVIVAL
      trial, the investigators will better understand: 1) the reasons for not including these
      patients; 2) how those patients differ in terms of baseline characteristics from the trial
      cohort; 3) whether the outcomes of registry participants differ from those in the trial,
      assessed by treatment group. The registry will aid in understanding the generalizability of
      the results that the trial produces.
