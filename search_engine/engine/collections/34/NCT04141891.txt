      drivers (n=300; â‰¥70 years) from clinical settings, and one family member each (n=up to 300),
      with longitudinal follow-up. Study goals are to test how much the DDA improves outcomes and
      identify who benefits most from the DDA. Evaluation of the DDA's efficacy (Aim 1) and its
      relative effect in subgroups (Aim 2) corresponds to Stage II in the NIH Stage Model for
      Behavioral Intervention Development. Findings from Aims 1 & 2 could identify necessary
      refinements (Stage I) and inform future efficacy, effectiveness or implementation trials.
