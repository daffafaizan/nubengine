      teaches children to alter their brainwave activity with a Cognitive Training attention
      training system (CT). The investigators hypothesize that both treatments will show
      improvement in ADHD symptoms and academic outcomes compared to a control condition.

      104 children with ADHD in grades 2 and 4 are randomly assigned to receive the NF, CT, or a
      Waitlist-Control (WLC) condition that receives NF or CT the following academic year. Children
      receive forty 45-minute sessions three times a week at school for 4 months. A comprehensive
      assessment, consists of data completed by teachers, parents, participants, and double-blind
      classroom observations.
