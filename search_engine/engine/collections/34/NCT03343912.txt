      0.200 mg E3 and 0.18 mg TMG per 24 h, will be applied intravaginally and remain in the vagina
      for the subsequent 21 days (single dose, 1 treatment cycle). A total of 36 female subjects,
      12 per treatment group, are intended to be randomized.

      Blood samples for determination of E2 and PG levels will be collected during treatment and
      until 20 days after removal of the ring. Blood samples for determination of E3 and TMG in
      plasma will be collected over the treatment period and until 48 h after removal of the ring.

      Bleeding intensity will also be documented during treatment and until 20 days after removal
      of the vaginal ring in a diary to characterize the effects of the different treatments.
