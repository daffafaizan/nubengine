      common location at proximal part of esophagus. Because of the location, lesions are likely to
      be missed during routine gastroscopy. The clinical significance of inlet patches remains
      unknown, however they may be symptomatic and may cause morphologic changes such as
      strictures, ulcers, webs, stenoses or even adenocarcinomas. Moreover inlet patches may be
      correlated with reflux symptoms up to 73,1%. Several studies were conducted to determine
      whether NBI improves detection of cervical inlet patches, some of them were also prospective
      studies, however no randomized study was conducted.
