      endurance type activities. This is especially true for soldiers during basic military
      training or subjects with a sedentary lifestyle taking up exercise to prevent disease, as
      they are vulnerable for sustaining an overuse injury. Contradictory to traumatic injuries,
      little is known about the prevention of overuse injuries using a training program. This study
      evaluates the preventive effect of a training program based on known intrinsic risk factors
      for the occurrence of anterior knee pain and shin pain in soldiers undergoing basic military
      training. We also evaluate the effect on physical performance.

      METHODS: From December 2004 - March 2006 1000 soldiers undergoing basic military training
      divided into 24 platoons are cluster randomised into a prevention-training (PRE) group or a
      placebo-training (PLA) group. The PRE group will perform exercises based on known intrinsic
      risk factors namely strength, flexibility and coordination of the lower extremity, while the
      PLA group will perform exercises for the upper body. Both programmes consists of 5 exercises
      and will be performed 3 times a week during a 12 weeks period. All subjects will
      prospectively be examined by the same observer, who will be blinded to the allocation.

      OUTCOME: primary outcome: reduction in anterior knee pain and shin pain.
