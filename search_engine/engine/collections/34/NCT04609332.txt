      cardiovascular events, the investigators will perform an observational study to evaluate
      plasma biomarkers concentrations in Covid-19 patients hospitalized in critical care units.

      After ethical review board approval, the investigators will select 40 patients admitted to
      intensive care units (ICU). After patient written consent or if the participants are unable
      to consent, after a relative subrogated acceptance, the investigators will collect blood
      samples in the first 24 hrs and on the 10th day of hospitalization.

      Venous blood samples are collected. After obtaining all samples, serum Syndecan-1,
      thrombomodulin, ANG-2, FGF basic, HGF, IL-8, PDGF-BB, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TNFÎ± y VEGF will be
      determined by a researcher blinded to the patient using commercially available Elisa kits.
      The concentration of each biomarker at each sample time will be compared. The investigators
      will observe clinical outcomes after one, 3, 6, and 12 months after the hospitalization.

      The investigators found no previous data of this measurement in the COVID-19 scenario. In
      this observational study, the investigators select a sample size on convenience for the
      primary outcome.
