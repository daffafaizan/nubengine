    
      SPECIFIC AIM 1:

      To conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of osteopathic
      manual treatment (OMT) vs sham OMT in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
      comorbid chronic low back pain (LBP). This will involve a 12-week protocol to study changes
      in response to OMT in such outcomes as LBP severity (primary outcome measure), somatic
      dysfunction, renal function, glycemic control, and other biomarkers potentially related to
      T2DM.

      SPECIFIC AIM 2:

      Within the RCT, to corroborate previous findings indicating that patients with T2DM have a
      high prevalence of tissue texture abnormalities in the T11-L2 spinal segmental region and to
      determine if such findings can be statistically associated with the presence of diabetic
      nephropathy using such laboratory measures as serum creatinine, urinary microalbuminuria and
      macroalbuminuria, and the glomerular filtration rate.

      SPECIFIC AIM 3:

      Within the RCT, to explore potential mechanisms of action of OMT by longitudinally measuring
      concentrations of biomarkers such as insulin, glucagon, cortisol, hemoglobin A1c, tumor
      necrosis factor-α,interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 in subjects with T2DM and
      comorbid chronic LBP over 12 weeks. Significant changes in biomarker concentrations may help
      explain the effects of OMT and whether such effects are mediated by changes in somatic
      dysfunction.
