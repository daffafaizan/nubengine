      follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, confirmed via take-home ovulation testing. On the
      day of the baseline study visit, all participants underwent ovarian sex hormone suppression
      with GnRHant therapy (cetrorelix acetate, 0.25 mg/day) delivered daily as subcutaneous
      injections for a 1-week period. Participants were randomized to one of two concurrent
      intervention groups: transdermal estradiol patch (0.075 mg/day) (+E2) or placebo patch (+PL)
      and returned for a follow-up visit after 1 week of the intervention. Both study visits
      included collection of anthropometric measures, a fasting blood sample, measures of arterial
      stiffness, flow-mediated dilation, and endothelial cells via an intravenous catheter.
