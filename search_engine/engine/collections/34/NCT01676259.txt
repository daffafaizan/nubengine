      12-week cycles to patients with unresectable LAPC combined with chemotherapy treatment
      (Gemcitabine+nab-Paclitaxel). This will be the first study to assess the response rate of the
      siG12D-LODER in patients with unresectable LAPC. The study is of a two-arm design with one
      arm receiving siG12D-LODER + chemotherapy, and the other arm receiving only chemotherapy.

      The investigational agent siG12D-LODER is a miniature biodegradable bio polymeric matrix that
      encompasses the drug, designed and produced by Silenseed Ltd. The implantation of LODERs is
      selected to meet current gastroenterology endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) biopsy procedures,
      proved to be highly effective and safe.

      siG12D-LODER has been studied in the escalating dose Phase I study of 15 patients, and
      results showed high safety and tolerability profiles, with no single DLT.
