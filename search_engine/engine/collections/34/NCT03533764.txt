      adolescents. Despite this, there are few interventions for high school students, and none
      have been tested when delivered by Community Health Workers (CHWs) or in rural areas. This
      represents a significant limitation because the CHW model has been shown to be successful in
      clinic- and home-based interventions. Also, rural adolescents with asthma represent a very
      large population. Given the high prevalence of asthma in this group, this oversight is a
      significant public health concern. Cost effectiveness analyses and implementation research
      are also lacking in asthma intervention research. This study addresses these treatment and
      methodological gaps. The investigators developed and established the efficacy of Asthma
      Self-Management for Adolescents (ASMA), an 8-week, high school-based intervention, in urban
      Hispanic and African American adolescents.
