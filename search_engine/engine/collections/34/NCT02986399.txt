    
      The Norwegian hip fracture register prospectively collects data on all hip fracture patients
      including, among others, time to surgery, type of fracture, type of surgery and American
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. The register also collects quality of life data 4
      and 12 months after surgery. Using the unique Norwegian personal identification number the
      data from the Norwegian hip fracture register will be connected with data from the electronic
      patient record at Akershus University hospital (AHUS). Fast track surgery for hip fracture
      patients was introduced at the end of 2013. Mortality and quality of life data will be
      compared for all hip fracture patients operated at AHUS two years before and two years after
      this change in standard care. The combined data from the register and the electronic patient
      records will be used for regression analysis.
