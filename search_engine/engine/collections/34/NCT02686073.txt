      collected at the time of admission to calculate the BMI (body mass index) & further
      classified according to WHO (World Health Organization) categories. Putting into
      consideration the physiological increase in BMI related to pregnancy, the overweight
      participants whose BMI (25-29.9) will be combined with the normal range BMI (18.5-24.9)
      category. Labor characteristics of these participants will be then compared with those of the
      underweight (BMI less than 18.5) & obese (BMI 30 or higher) participants.Females are assigned
      in one of 3 groups based on their BMI; Underweight group (BMI <18.5kg/m2), Control group
      whose BMI within normal range (18.5-29.9 kg/m2),& Obese group (BMI more than or equal
      30kg/m2).

      Labor management protocols are fixed. Data on labor progression are collected, including
      cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, head station & descent. The median duration of
      labor , estimated by rate of cervical dilatation in cm, will be used as a measurement of
      labor progression in each group.

      A cesarean section for abnormal labor pattern will be documented as failure of progress.
