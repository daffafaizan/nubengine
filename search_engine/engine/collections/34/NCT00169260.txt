      the effects of a proactive, personally-tailored, biologically-based motivational intervention
      to those of a proactive, generic motivational intervention for smoking cessation. The
      biologically-based motivational treatment will include feedback on participants' carbon
      monoxide (CO) exposure (expired CO and estimated carboxyhemoglobin levels), pulmonary
      functioning assessed via spirometry, and self-reported smoking-related symptoms. All
      participants will be given equal access to action-oriented treatment.
