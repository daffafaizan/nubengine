      ~86 kDa type 2 transmembrane protein that belongs to the α-ketoglutarate-dependent
      dioxygenase family. It is a highly conserved enzyme, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of
      aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in epidermal growth factor-like domains of proteins
      including Notch and homologs. HAAH was initially identified in a novel screen to identify
      cell surface proteins up-regulated in liver cancer. It has subsequently been detected in a
      diverse array of solid and blood cancers, including: liver, bile duct, brain, breast, colon,
      prostate, ovary, pancreas, and lung cancers as well as leukemia. HAAH is not found in
      significant quantities in normal tissue or in proliferative disorders.

      The investigators have designed a bacteriophage lambda system to display HAAH peptides fused
      at the C terminus of the head protein gpD of phage lambda. The phage carry 200-300 copies of
      the gpD protein on their head and thus display many copies of an approximately 25 kDa
      molecular weight fragment of HAAH on their surface. The drug substance is one of these HAAH
      bacteriophage lambda constructs: HAAH-1λ (PAN-301-1).

      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of the PAN-301-1 vaccine in patients with
      biochemically-relapsed prostate cancer.
