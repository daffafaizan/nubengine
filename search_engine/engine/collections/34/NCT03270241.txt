    
      This is a dermatology study of the effects of short-term NB-UVB treatment, standard
      phototherapy for Vitiligo patients. In the study, demographics information, three ascending
      dose of phototherapy, and small skin biopsies will be required of the participants.

      For all enrolled participants, the starting dose of NB-UVB administered will be 250 mJ/cm2,
      which is the standard of care for patients with Vitiligo. The dose will be increased by 10%
      with each treatment, as long as there are no side effects with treatment such as burning or
      redness/ erythema. Small skin biopsies will be collected from normal skin and from affected
      skin from vitiligo participants at the baseline visit and 3 days after the conclusion of
      treatment; up to a total of 6 biopsies will be collected from each patient. Participants will
      be compensated for time and effort.
