    
      Dyspnea is present in 50% of patients with malignant pleural effusion and quality of life is
      significantly impaired.

      Chemical pleurodesis using various sclerosing agents is accepted as a palliative therapy for
      patients with recurrent, symptomatic, and malignant pleural effusions.

      Silver nitrate solution (SNS) is a valid sclerosing agent that induce a caustic injury to the
      mesothelium that results in an effective pleurodesis.

      However, various clinical parameters and biochemical factors affect the success of
      pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with MPE: symptoms and performance status of the patient,
      daily fluid drainage, primary tumour, and mainly lung reexpansion following pleural fluid
      evacuation.

      The pleural injectate consists of 50 mL 0.5% SNS with 10mL of lidocaine (25mg/5mL).

      An alternative treatment is intermittent or continuous drainage of the pleural fluid with a
      chronic indwelling pleural catheter.
