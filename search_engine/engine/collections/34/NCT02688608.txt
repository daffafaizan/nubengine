      metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer patients with immune checkpoint therapy. This trial will
      potentially lead to the development of new therapy for anaplastic thyroid cancer. The drug to
      be administered, pembrolizumab is FDA approved with known side effects and is active in many
      tumor types.

      Programmed death 1 or (PD-1) PD-1/PD-L1 expression will be measured and reported for patients
      undergoing therapy with pembrolizumab. This will help determine if there PD-1 or PD-L1 are
      predictive biomarkers for anti-PD-1 therapy. It will also add to the data regarding their
      frequency in aggressive thyroid cancer. Where available, genomic profiling data will be
      analyzed to determine if there is a correlation between response and mutational status.
