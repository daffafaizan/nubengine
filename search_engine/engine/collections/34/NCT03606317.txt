      parameters and guidelines associated with identifying patients with cachexia. Cachexia is a
      clinical diagnosis associated with weight loss, decreased muscle mass (sarcopenia), decreased
      strength, fatigue, and an increased inflammatory state. Patients with cachexia have a poorer
      prognosis than patients who have maintained their weight. Also, patients who have lost weight
      prior to initiating definitive therapy have worse side effects from subsequent therapy.

      This study involves no treatment or invasive procedures. The chart review will attempt to
      characterize lung and pancreatic cancer related cachexia in the setting of a palliative care
      clinic including both primary treatment and treatment at the time of recurrence.
      Interventions in cachectic patients for weight control including nutritional support and
      supplements, pain control, anti-inflammatory medications, and appetite stimulants will be
      tracked along with clinical markers including weight and laboratory values.
