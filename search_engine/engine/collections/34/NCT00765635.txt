      Otocerum®; Taponoto ®, and a control group with sterile saline solution (NaCl 0.9%, Braun
      Medical SA, Barcelona, Spain). The test medication was instilled into an occluded ear for 15
      minutes. Following this treatment, the subject's ear was irrigated with 50 mL of water. The
      main outcome was the proportion of tympanic membranes that were completely visualized after
      cerumenolytic agents or saline, alone or with irrigation if needed.
