      resistance'. Over time, people with pre-diabetes may progress to type 2 diabetes and
      experience complications including cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease,
      hyperlipidemia, retinopathy, neuropathy, and/or nephropathy. Conventional interventions for
      pre-diabetes are glucose control through diet, exercise, and, if necessary, medications. An
      efficient but still uncommon adjunct intervention is flaxseed supplementation. Since few
      studies have examined the affect of flaxseed supplementation on type 2 diabetes and to date,
      no studies have reported flaxseed's influence on glycemic control in individuals with
      pre-diabetes, additional research is warranted. The objective of this study is to determine
      the affect of consuming flaxseed on fasting plasma glucose, insulin, fructosamine,
      adiponectin, fatty acid concentrations, serum interleukin-6 (hs-IL-6), C-reactive protein
      (hs-CRP), and urinary lignan excretion in overweight or obese men and postmenopausal women
      with pre-diabetes. This research will provide data for the strength of the relationship
      between regular flaxseed intake and biomarkers for pre-diabetes and glycemic control as well
      as adiponectin values and markers of inflammation.
