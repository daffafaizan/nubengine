      kinetics and reduced pain. Today, insulin is injected to the SQ space, using, in most cases,
      various devices incorporating standard metal needles and usually causing considerable pain
      and discomfort to the patients. NanoPass has developed a microneedle based needle substitute
      for intradermal injections. This device requires minimal expertise and is expected to cause
      minimal or no pain during injections.

      The objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      insulin NovorapidÂ® (Novo Nordisk) injected via the MicronJet device intradermally, to a
      conventional needle injected to the SQ space.
