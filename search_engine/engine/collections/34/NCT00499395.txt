      Primary

        -  Determine the sensitivity and specificity of fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET imaging in
           detecting residual disease within 48 hours after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver
           metastases in patients with colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the findings on day 7 after RFA using FDG-PET imaging in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-PET imaging at baseline. They then undergo
      percutaneous laparoscopic or intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Patients then
      undergo further FDG-PET scans within 48 hours and 7 days after RFA. FDG-PET images are
      evaluated for residual disease, including focal FDG uptake at the site of ablation. Beginning
      1 month after RFA, patients undergo contrast-enhanced MRI for routine post-ablation
      follow-up. MRI scans are performed at 1, 4, 7, 12, 18, and 24 months after completion of RFA.
