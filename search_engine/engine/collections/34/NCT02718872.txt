      patients' smoking. Tobacco consumption in low and middle income countries is increasing, but
      these countries usually lack measures to face the epidemic, including tobacco cessation
      training programs addressed to their health professionals and organizations.

      Based on a previous online training program for hospital workers in Spain, the Fruitful Study
      aims are twofold:

        1. to adapt the course to the reality of 3 Spanish-speaking low and middle income countries
           (Bolivia, Guatemala, and Paraguay) and;

        2. to evaluate the effectiveness of the program among the participant hospitals and
           workers.

      Investigators use a mixed methods design with a pre-post evaluation (quantitative approach)
      and in-depth interviews and focus groups (qualitative approach). The main outcomes will be:

        1. participants' attitudes, knowledge and behaviors before and after the training and

        2. the level of implementation of tobacco control policies within the hospitals before and
           after the training.

      The theoretical framework for this project includes Card's adapting model and Roger's
      diffusion of innovations model.

      This study will show whether it is possible to adapt an online course to the reality of
      developing countries. In addition, investigator will measure whether an online program will
      produce changes in tobacco control policies at the organizational level and increase the
      level of knowledge, attitudes and perception in tobacco cessation at participants' level.
