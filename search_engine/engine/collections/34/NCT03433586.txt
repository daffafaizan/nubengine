    
      This is a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled study. This study is designed to
      detect the variation in platelet function based on COMT variation and how these platelets
      respond to cancerous cells.

      We expect to enroll 100 healthy participants with the intention of studying 90 participants
      to complete the protocol.

      Individuals aged 18 to 40 years will be eligible to participate in this study if they do not
      have history of fainting/problems related to blood draws, major chronic medical illnesses,
      regular or current treatment of Aspirin™.

      Examine the role of genetic variation in in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) on platelet
      function in a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial of daily Aspirin™
      (81 mg) versus placebo over 10-14 days. Platelet function will be assessed with a platelet
      aggregometry and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting assessment of platelet adhesion
      molecule GPIIIb/IIIa and p-selectin.
