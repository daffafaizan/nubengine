      habitually worn multifocal contact lenses and to the competitor Lens B. This is a
      prospective, randomized, participant-masked, crossover, bilateral dispensing study conducted
      at up to 5 clinical practice sites in the United States. Each lens type will be worn for up
      to 3 weeks.
