      in vitro and animal models. A recent study undertaken in a canine model of myocardial
      infarction demonstrated a 50% reduction in myocardial injury following the administration of
      sodium nitrite prior to the ischemic event. In humans, the setting of coronary artery bypass
      surgery lends itself well to study potential cytoprotective agents. During cardiac surgery,
      the heart undergoes a period of ischemia allowing the surgeons to operate on the heart. This
      is followed by a period of reperfusion which in itself can add to cellular injury. Such
      injury can hinder post-operative myocardial recovery.

      The aim of this pilot study is to determine whether the cardioprotective effects of sodium
      nitrite demonstrated in animal models are translated in humans and to determine the exact
      underlying mechanisms of this cytoprotection. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
      grafting surgery who give written, informed consent will receive sodium nitrite 24 hours
      prior to surgery, during cardiac surgery or placebo. Myocardial injury will be assessed
      through the measurement of biochemical markers such as troponin T. Cardiac biopsy samples
      will be obtained to determine underlying molecular mechanisms of this cardioprotection. The
      other aim of this pilot study is to determine what dose of sodium nitrite (i.e. 0.2mcg/kg/min
      or 1mcg/kg/min) is optimal for cardioprotection. This study will form pilot data also for a
      larger clinical trial with clinical endpoints.
