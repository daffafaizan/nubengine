      patients with multi-organ Bodily distress syndrome (BDS). BDS is a unifying diagnosis that
      encompasses a group of closely related conditions such as somatization disorder,
      fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. The project consists of
      a three-armed randomized controlled trial of ACT treatment given as a supplement to standard
      treatment as either 9-session group therapy or as a 1-day workshop followed by an individual
      consultation, compared to standard treatment, which is one single advisory consultation.

      Primary outcome is patient-rated improvement measured by Clinical Global Improvement Scale
      (CGI-I). Secondary outcome is functional level (physical, mental and social) measured by the
      SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS). The study includes 180 participants.
