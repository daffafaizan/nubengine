      (modulating the expression of NK stimulatory ligand on tumor cell), the investigators
      performed phase II trial of docetaxel and ANKL combination s the second line treatment in
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLN) and reported the results in May 2013. (Anticancer
      Research 33;2115, Poster Presentation in ASCO).In that study, the investigators observed the
      feasibility and safety of ANKL combined with docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC, but
      the clinical benefit was not evaluated properly because the study was interrupted
      unintentionally and most of the enrolled patients were far advanced with large tumor burden,
      that is, poor immunological environment for ANKL to work.

      The object of this study is to identify the combined effect of ANKL and doublet chemotherapy
      in advanced NSCLC. The approved doublet chemotherapy based on platinum is widely used with
      the response rate (RR) 25-35% after 4-6 courses as the first line treatment. The
      investigators design the combination of ANKL and chemotherapy as the 3rd and 4th courses in
      the patients who show stable response after x2 courses. Higher RR with the combination
      treatment is the primary outcome as compared with the chemotherapy alone - historical
      control; about 12% PR and 50% stable response after x2 initial courses and 25% PR after x2
      more courses among the patients who get stable response after x2 initial courses. Peripheral
      blood 32 ml will be drawn from the patients who decide to be enrolled and about 2 weeks later
      ANKL (2x10*9) are scheduled to be administered rapidly iv 12-36hr after each chemotherapeutic
      agents while peak effect of NK cell ligand modulation by chemotherapeutic agent is
      maintained. After 4th course, response evaluation is done by RECIST and 40% or more PR
      (increased by 15% or more from historical control 25%) is the expected target and Simon's two
      stage design will be applied through the study (power 80%, a= 0.95, N1= 33, N= 68)
