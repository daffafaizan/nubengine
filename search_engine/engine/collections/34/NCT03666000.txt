      dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, find an appropriate dose to
      optimize safety and efficacy, and evaluate clinical activity of PBCAR0191 in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL). Before initiating PBCAR0191, subjects will be administered lymphodepletion
      chemotherapy composed of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. At Day 0 of the Treatment Period,
      subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of PBCAR0191. Subjects who receive a split
      dose will also receive an IV infusion of PBCAR0191 on Day 10 and/or Day 14. Subjects may be
      considered for retreatment. All subjects are monitored during the treatment period through
      Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR0191 will be followed in a separate long-term
      follow-up (LTFU) study for 15 years after exiting this study.
