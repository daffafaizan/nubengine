      beam radiotherapy and High Dose Rate brachytherapy will be entered in this study. High Dose
      Rate brachytherapy will be performed using TransRectal UltraSound guidance and then planned
      using both cone-beam Computed Tomography and TransRectal UltraSound. Planning by Computed
      Tomography is to check the reliability and reproducibility of UltraSound imaging to correctly
      identify the needle positions. Correct needle localization is essential because this is the
      basis for determining source dwell positions, dose calculation and dose optimization.
