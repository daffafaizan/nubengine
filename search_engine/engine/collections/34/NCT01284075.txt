      therapy guided by CDs. As there are no studies which discuss whether the act of listening to
      any therapy will affect outcomes, we will also explore whether white noise can affect
      outcomes as well. Therefore, one control group (WN) will abide by the same regimen and will
      listen to a CD with white noise; the other control group (CP) will have no intervention at
      all and will follow our current peri-operative procedures.
