      Recently, circulating MMPs can be measured and are elevated in patients with chronic heart
      failure (CHF). It has been reported that spironolactone improves myocardial fibrosis in CHF
      animal models. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of
      spironolactone on circulating MMP levels in patients with chronic heart failure.
