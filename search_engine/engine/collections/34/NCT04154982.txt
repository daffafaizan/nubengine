      Eligible patients undergoing CAP at the Arrhythmology Unit of Centro Cardiologico Monzino
      will be enrolled.

      The hypothesis driving our study, based on published literature and our preliminary data, is
      that administration of antioxidant agents, before cardiac procedures involving IR exposure,
      might prevent IR harmful effects on human tissues in terms of reduction of systemic oxidative
      stress status and, in parallel, of oxidative DNA damage.

      The antioxidant agent tested in our study is NAC. NAC is a well-tolerated and safe medication
      and it has antioxidant properties is based on three main mechanisms: 1) direct antioxidant
      effect, 2) glutathione (GSH) precursor action, and 3) its activity in breaking thiolated
      proteins.

      Another hypothesis to be tested is whether genes involved in DNA damage repair could explain
      the great variability in patient radiosensitivity to IR exposure and whether these genes
      could affect NAC protective/healing effects.
