    
      The CUPID-3 Trial is an interventional study of SRD-001, an adeno-associated virus serotype 1
      (AAV1) vector expressing the transgene for sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a
      isoform (SERCA2a), in anti-AAV1 neutralizing antibody (NAb) negative subjects with ischemic
      or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms of
      heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

      The Phase 1 trial is an open-label, uncontrolled study investigating one dose of SRD-001 at
      3E13 viral genomes (vg) in 3 to 6 subjects.

      The Phase 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with prospective
      assignment to a single dose of either SRD-001 at 3E13 vg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and a
      total sample size of N=50.
