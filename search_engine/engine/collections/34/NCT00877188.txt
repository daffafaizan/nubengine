      cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength, and overall quality of life. Furthermore, cancer
      survivors are at increased risk for cancer recurrence and for secondary effect such as
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and functional decline. Increase
      physical activity or exercise is proposed to overcome the negative psychological and
      physiological effects. Preliminary research evidence shows that exercise in cancer survivors
      improves quality of life, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical functioning, and decrease of
      fatigue. However, the best exercise mode and intensity has not been well established. Little
      is known regarding the long term effect. No study investigated impact of exercise for breast
      cancer survivors on upper extremity function, and correlation between fitness, upper
      extremity function and quality of life.
