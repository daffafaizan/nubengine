      women, there is evidence from animal studies that primary age-related hypothalamic and
      pituitary changes may also contribute to reproductive aging. Complete cessation of ovarian
      function results in the loss of negative feedback of ovarian steroids and inhibin on the
      hypothalamic and pituitary components of the reproductive axis. An increase in serum levels
      of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) occurs in postmenopausal
      women with removal of negative ovarian feedback. However, levels of LH and FSH after
      menopause decline steadily as a function of age in most though not all studies.

      The current study is designed to determine: 1) whether negative feedback on LH and FSH occurs
      at the pituitary; and 2) whether there is an effect of aging on estrogen negative feedback at
      the pituitary. Younger and older postmenopausal women underwent a baseline study and a second
      identical study after a month of low dose estrogen replacement. The study protocol consisted
      of the following: 1) administration of a GnRH antagonist (Nal-Glu at 150 mg/kg that blocks
      endogenous GnRH so that the dose and interval of pituitary exposure to GnRH are precisely
      controlled; 2) beginning 8 hours following GnRH antagonist administration (at a time when LH
      had reached its nadir following GnRH receptor blockade), administration of 4 graded doses of
      GnRH (25, 75, 250 and 750 ng/kg every 2 hours with 2 hours of blood draws following each
      dose). Blood was sampled every 30 min for 4 hours before antagonist administration, every 30
      min for the following 7 hours and then every 10 min until the completion of the study.
