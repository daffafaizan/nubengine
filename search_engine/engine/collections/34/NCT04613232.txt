      (RT). Ongoing technological advances in wearable biometric sensors allow for real-time
      collection of objective data e.g. physical activity and heart rate, which in the future might
      help to detect and act against side effects before they become severe. A smartwatch such as
      the Apple Watch allows for objective data monitoring outside hospital with minimal effort for
      the patient. To find out if such tools can be implemented in the oncological setting
      feasibility studies are needed.

      The aim of the study is to determine the adherence to using an Apple Watch during curative
      intended radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Secondly it will bring new insights to the
      patient's activity levels and how heart rate varies during treatment course.

      The study will assess the feasibility of using the Apple Watch for home monitoring of
      patients with HNC. It will bring new insights to the patient's activity levels and how heart
      rate varies during treatment course. This is important knowledge before further investigating
      how biometric data can be used as part of symptom monitoring.
