    
      Background: The revised 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America
      guidelines recommend a clarithromycin-based combination therapy for treatment of
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease and stipulate approximately 1 year of
      continuous treatment after bacilli negative conversion. However, supporting data are
      insufficient.

      Objectives: To obtain data on the clinical outcome of clarithromycin-based regimens by
      conducting a nationwide prospective study mainly of MAC lung disease.

      Methods: In accordance with the guidelines, patients were enrolled in this survey according
      to their chest radiographic findings and microbiologic test results. They were treated with a
      multi-drug regimen including clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol (clarithromycin
      -based regimen) until bacilli negative conversion on continual treatment for 1 year. Data
      were collected "pre-administration," "on the bacilli negative conversion," and "at 6 months
      after the end of treatment."
