    
      Objectives and Methodology:

        -  To analyse the change in temperature and microcirculation of the skin overlaying BAT
           depots in the region of FDG-uptake detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT before and after a cold
           test in PHEO patients.

        -  To check the decreased temperature and microcirculatory response after a cold test
           following resection of the tumor

      All the patients affected by will benefit from a:

        -  clinical: treatments

        -  biological evaluations: glycemia, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, plasma
           epinephrine and norepinephrine, urine catecholamine

        -  cutaneous microcirculation by means of Laser Speckle Imaging will be recorded at rest
           and during a cold test in the supra-clavicular region

        -  cutaneous microcirculation by means of Laser Doppler Flowmetry will be recorded at rest
           and during a cold test with one probe in the supra-clavicular region and one probe in
           umbilical region

        -  skin temperature by means of infrared thermography will be recorded at rest and during a
           cold test in the supra-clavicular region

      Patients who will have surgery will be investigated before and after one year following
      resection of the tumor.
