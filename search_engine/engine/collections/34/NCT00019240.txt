      Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. II.
      Assess the effect of intravenous cidofovir on the load of KS-associated herpesvirus/human
      herpesvirus-8 in KS lesions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative polymerase
      chain reaction. III. Assess the toxicity of cidofovir in KS patients with and without HIV
      infection. IV. Assess the effect of cidofovir on angiogenic cytokines related to the
      pathogenesis of KS.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive intravenous cidofovir weekly for 2 weeks, then every other week
      for 6 months. Patients with a complete or partial response may continue treatment until
      disease progression intervenes.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 25 evaluable patients will be entered over approximately 6 months if
      there are at least 2 responses in the first 15 patients.
