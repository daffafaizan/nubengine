      which risk factors associated with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in general
      Chinese population. A total of more than 2000 participants were recruited by using multiple
      stages sampling (first cluster sampling and then simply sampling). Data involved in
      demographic information, clinical biomarkers such as glucose and lipids profiles, medical and
      therapy history were collected. Every participants was complete DNA extracted and genotyped.
      Cardiovascular autonomic functions were measured by using short-term heart rate variability
      (HRV) to evaluate the outcome of CAN. Univariate and multiple variables analysis have been
      performed to examine potential environmental and genetic risk factors of CAN. In addition,
      clinical risk model, simply screening model and non-linear system model such as artificial
      neural network was created, respectively.
