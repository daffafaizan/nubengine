      the treatment of chronic pain. Chronic Pain is defined by the American Chronic Pain
      Association as "pain that continues a month or more beyond the usual recovery period for an
      illness or injury or pain that goes on over months or years as a result of a chronic
      condition." Chronic pain affects the patient's quality of life, work performance and
      attendance, mental health, social interactions and overall activities of daily living.

      Implantable pumps were used for cancer and non-cancer patients, who had pain, which was
      resistant to conventional therapy. Intrathecal morphine administration is now accepted as a
      safe and effective method of controlling or reducing pain and its impact on the sufferer.

      The Codman ARCHIMEDES Implantable Constant-Flow Infusion Pump is CE marked, and has been
      commercially available in Europe for intrathecal delivery of morphine and baclofen since
      August 1997. ARCHIMEDES is intended for the treatment of chronic intractable (cancer or
      non-cancer) pain, which requires chronic intrathecal infusion of preservative-free morphine
      sulfate.

      This is a European, multicenter, prospective, single arm, observational registry conducted on
      a total of 150 Subjects at up to 10 centers in Europe.

      Subjects will be followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post Archimedes implant to assess their
      pain management and quality of life.
