      will be allocated into 2 groups randomly, with COOK ballon and estrogen and progesterone
      sequential therapy given to prevent adhesion routinely. 7 day later, G-CSF or normal saline
      will be injected into the uterine cavity by Tom catheter after removing the balloon
      respectively. A second hysteroscopic examination will be performed in 2 months to check up
      the adhesion reformation. In addition, the endometrial thickness after surgery and fertility
      outcome will be followed up.
