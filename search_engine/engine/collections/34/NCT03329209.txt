      treat people who have ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). This study will look
      at the PK, safety, and tolerability of vedolizumab following a single intravenous infusion of
      vedolizumab IV in healthy adult Chinese participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. All participants will be assigned to
      receive a single dose of vedolizumab IV 300 mg on Day 1.

      This single center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 7 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
      will be contacted by telephone, 6 months after single dose of study drug for a follow-up
      safety survey assessment.
