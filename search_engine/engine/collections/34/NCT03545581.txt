      proposed that uric acid may contribute to insulin resistance by impairing
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation, promoting pro-inflammatory effects and dyslipidemia by
      activating de novo lipogenesis.

      These consequences of fructose overconsumption may be even more marked in individuals with
      hereditary alterations in fructose metabolism. Indeed, individuals with hereditary fructose
      intolerance (HFI), due to biallelic mutations in the gene coding for aldolase B (ALDOB), may
      develop acute, life-threatening manifestations when exposed to fructose. Heterozygous
      carriers of ALDOB mutation are quite common in the general population, with a predicted
      frequency ranging between 1:55 and 1:120. Few studies have examined the effect of fructose
      ingestion in heterozygotes subject for HFI. Heterozygous carriers are generally considered to
      have normal fructose metabolism since a ~ 50% level of aldolase B activity is presumed to be
      sufficient for adequate function. However, heterozygous carriers were reported to have
      enhanced uric acid responses to large intravenous and/or oral fructose loads.

      Investigators hypothesized that heterozygous carriers may also have mild defects of fructose
      metabolism and/or a larger increase in cardiometabolic risk factors than the normal
      population after ingestion of moderate amounts of fructose.
