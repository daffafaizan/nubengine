        1. What are the person- and system-level factors associated with use of rehabilitation
           services following acute ischemic stroke?

        2. Among stroke survivors discharged to short-term inpatient rehabilitation, are
           high-intensity services performed at an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) more
           effective than lower intensity services performed at a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF),
           at improving patient outcomes at 3 and 12 months?

        3. Among stroke survivors discharged home, is early follow-up with a physician more
           effective than follow-up after 7 days at 3 and 12 months?
