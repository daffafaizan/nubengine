    
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been recommended as first line non-curative
      therapy for non-surgical patients with large/multifocal HCC who do not have vascular invasion
      or extrahepatic spread. There has not been any standardized protocol in the choice of
      chemotherapeutic agents, dosage, dilution, rate of injection, and time interval between
      treatments. Similarly, there is no agreement on the choice of embolizing agents, degree of
      embolization, and whether the chemotherapeutic agent should be given together, or before the
      embolizing agent.

      Comparison(s): In patients with HCC who underwent TACE therapy, stratified by whether they
      have vascular invasion and tumor size, we compare efficacy, safety, and patient reported
      outcomes (PRO) of different regimens of TACE.

      Regimen 1: lipiodol combined chemotherapy with embolization

      Regimen 2: lipiodol combined chemotherapy without embolization

      Regimen 3: lipiodol single agent chemotherapy with embolization
