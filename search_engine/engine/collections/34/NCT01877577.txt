      IBD. However, it is unclear whether low vitamin D levels contribute to the pathogenesis of
      IBD or are a consequence of IBD. Recent animal data studies suggest that maintenance of the
      epithelial barrier integrity in the large intestine by vitamin D is important in preventing
      IBD.

      However, more evidence is required to determine the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation in
      patients with IBD. Furthermore, there is no clear consensus regarding the appropriate dose of
      vitamin D supplementation in IBD patients.
