    
      This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment
      that the participant receives), placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study in
      participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress. Participants who had
      treatment initiated with a SSRI/SNRI allowed by the protocol will be evaluated at the
      investigation site. The site assessment will be reviewed and validated by an independent
      central rater. The review will include the clinical history of MDD, SSRI/SNRI treatment of
      adequate dose and duration for the current episode of depression, and current symptom
      severity on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17). Enrolled participants will be
      maintained on SSRI/SNRI treatment throughout the study to determine whether additional
      treatment with JNJ-4216579 can reduce the symptoms of MDD with anxious distress.The study
      will consist of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of up to 4 weeks, an 11-week double-blind
      Treatment Phase, and a 3-week post-treatment (follow up) Phase. The double-blind treatment
      Phase of the trial will consist of 3 periods. The first period is a placebo lead-in of
      double-blind duration, after which participants will enter the treatment period when they
      will be randomly assigned to JNJ-42165279 or continuation on placebo for 6 weeks.
      Participants who successfully complete the treatment period prior to the end of Week 11, will
      be treated with placebo for the remaining time of the double-blind phase of the study, which
      will vary depending on the duration of the placebo lead-in for the specific participant. The
      total study duration for each participant will be approximately 18 weeks. Efficacy and safety
      of JNJ-42165279 will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
