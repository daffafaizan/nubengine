      I. To determine feasibility of administering ferumoxytol and obtaining ferumoxytol enhanced
      magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with resectable locally advanced rectal cancer
      with enlarged or suspicious lateral pelvic lymph nodes before starting neoadjuvant therapy
      and again before total mesorectal excision.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect detailed information about the location of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron
      oxide (USPIO)-MRI detected lymph nodes prior to neoadjuvant therapy and again prior to total
      mesorectal excision.

      II. To compare the sensitivity and specificity of ferumoxytol enhanced MR imaging in
      assessment of pathological lymph nodes with those of non-USPIO-MRI and positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and then after 24-36 hours
      undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI before start of neoadjuvant therapy and within 4 weeks
      before surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.
