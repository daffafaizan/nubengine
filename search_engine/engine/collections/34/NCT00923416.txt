      of steep dose gradients from conformal and intensity modulated radiotherapy. This is
      particularly challenging when soft tissue target organs, such as the prostate, displace
      relative to bony anatomy. Although novel imaging techniques are being developed for the
      direct visualisation of such soft tissue structures, contrast and image quality is currently
      limited. However, the use of radio-opaque intra-prostatic fiducial markers(IPM) during high
      dose radiotherapy has proven very effective in terms of improving accuracy, and decreasing
      toxicity.
