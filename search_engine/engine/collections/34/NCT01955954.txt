      feedback program for PD has been previously established. The aim of the present study was to
      expand these results by testing a similar program with more clinically representative
      patients and settings. The intervention is delivered via home use following initial training
      by a clinician and provides remote monitoring of client adherence and progress by the
      clinician. Outcomes were assessed post-treatment and at 2- and 12-month follow-up.
