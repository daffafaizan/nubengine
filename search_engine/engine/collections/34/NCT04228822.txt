      LCD. Participants will be asked to attend a total of 5 visits (4 in person and 1 phone visit)
      during the 6 month-duration of the study. Participants will be randomized to an intervention
      group with a LCD (50% of carbohydrate recommended daily allowance) vs. the standard diet.

      During the screening visit, participants will be assessed by a dietitian to categorize their
      existing dietary regimen before randomization to either the LCD or the standard diet. In
      addition, participant's insulin regimen (either pump settings or multiple dose insulin
      injection therapy) will be reviewed for insulin dose adjustments as needed over a 2
      week-period.
