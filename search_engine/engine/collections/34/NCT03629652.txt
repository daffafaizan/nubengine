      mechanical thrombectomy as the most effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke. However,
      the two methods are restricted by a strict time window, which greatly limits the number of
      the patients receiving treatment. The abundant studies have suggested that good collateral
      circulation can provide compensatory blood supply to save the ischemic penumbra and reduces
      the infarct volume, which improves the prognosis. How to improve collateral circulation in an
      efficient and safe way is a clinical challenge. Our recent experiment results of the animal
      and clinical experiments show that head-down position can significantly increase cerebral
      perfusion and improve neurological function. Clinically, head-down position is simple and
      easy to operate, and theoretically may increases brain perfusion and improve collateral
      circulation. A pilot randomized clinical trial is designed to investigate the effect of
      head-down position combined with routine rehabilitation in patients with ischemic stroke.
