    
      T Cell Large Granular Lymphocyte (T-LGL) Lymphoproliferative Disorders are a heterogeneous
      group of uncommon diseases which may involve a polyclonal or a monoclonal T cell population,
      which bear characteristic surface markers corresponding to activated cytotoxic (CD3+, CD8+)
      lymphocytes. They are often associated with quite severe neutropenia, anemia, and
      thrombocytopenia which may be life-threatening. There is some evidence that the abnormal
      cytotoxic lymphocyte population may cause the cytopenias by suppressing hematopoiesis,
      although the mechanism is unclear. Case reports suggest that immunosuppressive therapy
      directed toward T cells may reverse the cytopenia. This pilot study involving up to 25
      patients evaluates the clinical response to cyclosporine, an immunosuppressive drug, and
      seeks to elucidate the mechanism underlying the cytopenia.
