      for patients with chronic and treatment refractory symptoms of abdominal pain and bowel
      dysfunction. Many of these patients are diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, painful
      functional constipation or functional abdominal pain syndrome using Rome III criteria. The
      presenting symptoms of the referral population are frequently in the severe range, with
      patients having intensely painful symptoms, Axis I and Axis II co-morbidities, and impaired
      health related quality of life. Failure of multiple standard treatment attempts prior to
      referral is customary for patients seen in our clinic. Additionally, a greater number of
      patients only experience a partial response to standard treatment. We are therefore
      attempting to address these patients utilizing novel treatment strategies such as we propose
      here.
