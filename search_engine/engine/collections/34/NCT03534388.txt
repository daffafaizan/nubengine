      The study will investigate the rate of infection with subjects undergoing elective lower
      extremity arterial bypass graft surgery or femoral endarterectomy. The subjects are
      instructed to shower with the sodium hypochlorite body wash daily, or as modified by the
      physician, for 5 of the 7 days leading to their surgery.
