      Ten patients with stroke and 4 certified occupational therapists were recruited in this phase
      I study. During the pilot testing, each stroke patient will try to use each training mode of
      digital AOT and MT by the assistance of the therapist. At the end of the pilot testing, the
      patients and the therapists will be asked to complete the System Usability Scale and a
      self-designed questionnaire to assess the user experience and perspective about this new MSR
      system and their view of its suitability for stroke patients.

      Phase II: Validation of Clinical Treatment Efficacy

      This three-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial will investigate the treatment
      effects among the 3 groups of digital AOT, digital MT, and dose-matched control intervention.
      An estimated 60 patients with stroke will be recruited to participate in this phase II study.
      Each participant will receive a total of 15 training sessions (60 minutes per session) for 3
      to 4 weeks. Clinical outcome measures will be conducted at baseline, immediately after
      treatment (the fourth week), and at 1 month follow-up after treatment.
