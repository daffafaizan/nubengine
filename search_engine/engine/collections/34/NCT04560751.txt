      stage and can only receive palliative treatment such as TACE or systemic treatment.
      Lenvatinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which mainly inhibits
      vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) receptor-1, 2, 3; fibroblast growth factors(FGF)
      receptor-1, 2, 3, 4; platelet derived growth factor receptor(PDGFR)Î±; RET and KIT and showed
      significant anti-tumor effect in REFLECT study. The purpose of this study is to explore the
      efficacy and safety of Lenvatinib and TACE in unresectable HCC patients.
