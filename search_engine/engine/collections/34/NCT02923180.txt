    
      This is a single-center, single arm, open-label phase II study evaluating the safety,
      anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant MGA271 given prior to radical
      prostatectomy in men with intermediate and high-risk localized prostate cancer. Eligible
      patients will receive MGA271 at a dose of 15mg/kg IV given weekly for 6 doses beginning 50
      days prior to radical prostatectomy. 14 days after the last dose of MGA271, prostate glands
      will be harvested at the time of radical prostatectomy, and prostate tissue will be examined
      for the secondary endpoints. Follow-up evaluation for adverse events will occur 30 days and
      90 days after surgery. Patients will then be followed by their urologists according to
      standard institutional practices, but will require PSA evaluations every 3 (±1) months during
      year 1 and every 6 (±2) months during years 2-3.

      In Amendment 1, the study was expended to enroll an additional 16 patients for a total of 32
      patients to continue evaluating safety and better estimate the clinical benefit of
      Enoblituzumab in terms of undetectable PSA level (<0.1 ng/mL) at 12 months following radical
      prostatectomy.
