    
      Background: The optimal dose regimen of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for
      thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients is unknown.

      Objectives: We performed a prospective, randomized study to determine anti-Xa activities
      following subcutaneous administration of 5000 IU or 7500 IU dalteparin for thromboprophylaxis
      in ICU patients compared with medical patients receiving the standard dose of 5000 IU.

      Patients and Methods: Twenty-five ICU patients received 7500 IU (group 1) and 29 ICU patients
      received 5000 IU dalteparin subcutaneously (group 2) for thromboprophylaxis. Twenty-nine
      medical patients receiving 5000 IU dalteparin served as control group (group 3).
