      Forty eight of the participants will be regular cannabis users with a self-reported frequency
      of at least once weekly over the past 6 months, and a control group of twenty four cannabis
      non-users. Cannabis users will be asked to quit using cannabis for 11 weeks and will be
      required to attend 25 visits during the 11 week abstinence/contingency management period.
      Non-users will be asked to return to the clinic once a week for 11 weeks. Abstinence will be
      determined by self-report, qualitative urine rapid screening test at the clinic and
      quantitatively via Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) analysis of THC (cannabinoids) and, by Liquid
      Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LCMSMS) analysis of 11-nor-9-carboxy-âˆ†
      9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) performed by an analytical lab contracted by the study team.
      Semen sample for both groups will be collected prior to the start of abstinence and after 11
      weeks. Semen analysis and DNA methylation of sperm cells will be compared.
