      have been used in the Orient for nearly 2000 years for a variety of GI symptoms including
      diarrhea and nausea/vomiting. Extensive pre-clinical research has been done with Chinese
      herbal medicine, and studies have documented significant anticancer activity in combination
      with various cytotoxic agents including Irinotecan, which is a semi-synthetic derivative of
      the natural alkaloid camptothecin and belongs to the class of topoisomerase I inhibitors.
      Irinotecan has been evaluated extensively as a single agent as well as in combination with
      other cytotoxic agents in several schedules. We recently completed a phase I study of
      irinotecan using the every-2-week schedule in combination with varying doses of KD018. Based
      on this phase I study, the dose of irinotecan that will be used in this study is 215 mg/m2.
