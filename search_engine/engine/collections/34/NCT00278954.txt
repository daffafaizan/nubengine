      infections/subject/year, and it will be based on the total of all of the following events as
      defined by the FDA: bacterial Pneumonia, bacteremia/sepsis, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis,
      visceral abscess, and bacterial meningitis.

      Secondary Efficacy Variables Secondary efficacy will be determined by using the following
      variables: number of days of work/school missed because of infection per subject year; number
      and days of hospitalizations because of infection per subject year; number of visits to
      physicians for acute problems and/or number of visits to hospital emergency rooms per subject
      year; other infections documented by fever or a positive result on a radiograph and/or
      culture; number of infectious episodes per subject per year; number of days on therapeutic
      antibiotics.These data will be entered into the subject diary, confirmed by the physician,
      and entered on the electronic-CRF (e-CRF).

      Safety Variables. The variables used to assess safety will be the following: adverse events
      (AEs); vital signs; clinical laboratory tests and Direct Coombs' Test; transmission of
      viruses; physical examination.

      Test product, dose/mode of administration, batch number(s): The GAMMAPLEX dose is 300-800
      mg/kg/infusion (milligram per killgram per infusion) every 21 or 28 days, intravenously. At
      least 2 batches will be used in this study and no more than 1 batch in any given infusion.

      Duration of treatment:
