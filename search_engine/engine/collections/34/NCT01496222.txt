      190, female 132) and 260 urological patients (male 220, female 40) who meet the inclusion
      criteria to join the study. The process of the project is explained to the interested
      patients in details before an informed consent is obtained.

      All participants are interviewed by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test. The history
      of drug used preoperatively (medication reconciliation) has also been recorded.
