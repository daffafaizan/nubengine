      ventilation they must be conditioned. No data are present on the necessity to condition the
      medical gases during non invasive mechanical ventilation. In this study the investigators
      studied the humidity and the temperature of the medical gases with and without any
      conditioning during non invasive mechanical ventilation in a group of healthy subjects and
      critically ill patients.
