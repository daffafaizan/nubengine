      The planned treatment was given to the participants after randomization. Response rate,
      recurrence-free survival, overall survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints
      events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the combination treatment with
      modified-FOLFIRINOX and Anti-PD-1 antibody could or couldn't benefit the patients with
      borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
