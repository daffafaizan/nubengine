      acceleration of the brain. The biomechanical forces which cause concussion lead to the
      opening of ion channels within the neuronal cell membranes, allowing for a massive influx of
      sodium and efflux of potassium. This results in a spreading depression type of phenomenon,
      leading to the depolarization of neurons diffusely throughout the brain.19 In order to
      restore the homeostatic ion gradients across the membrane, the sodium-potassium pumps require
      increasing amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Thus, there is an increased need for ATP
      after concussion. ATP is supplied by the glycolysis of glucose from the blood stream. Both
      experimental models of concussion and human studies, however, show decreased cerebral blood
      flow after the initial response to injury. Thus, there is an increased demand for ATP after
      concussion; but a diminished supply of glucose to meet the demand.

      The absorption of light in the red/near infrared wavelength spectrum by cytochrome C oxidase
      increases ATP synthesis. Thus, by increasing ATP synthesis, red/near infrared LEDs can treat
      the underlying pathophysiological cause of concussion symptoms. If successful, this would be
      the first therapy to directly treat the underlying pathophysiology of concussion.
