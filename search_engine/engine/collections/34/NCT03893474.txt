      affecting mainly patients over the age of 65. At some point during follow-up the disease
      becomes inactive in many cases and does not need more injections. The risk of a flare-up is
      high, however, and patients need to continue to be seen every month for a significant period
      of time.

      Hospital-based eye clinics are struggling to cope with current and expected workload for
      assessing and treating patients with nAMD. Transferring care of these patients to the
      community closer to home would ease the workload for hospital based clinics and offer a
      better experience of care to patients.

      This study will recruit 742 patients with nAMD who have reached this inactive phase of the
      disease. Half of the patients that want to take part will continue to have their follow-up
      appointments in the hospital eye clinics as usual. The other half, chosen by chance, will
      have follow-up visits every month in a community optometrist practice by trained
      optometrists. The research team will provide the training for community optometrists.

      The study will seek to show that the community based care is no less safe than hospital-based
      care.

      The study will also check what is the impact of this different way of offering care on the
      NHS budget and how the patients and practitioners perceive this. The study will involve
      several hospital eye clinics across the country and several community optometrist practices.
      Meetings will also be held with patients to discuss their priorities and needs when looking
      at how to set up the community based eye clinics.

      During meetings with patients in preparation for this research, they felt positively about
      the possibility to receive care closer to home.
