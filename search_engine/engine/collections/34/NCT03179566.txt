      a surplus of opioid pills within our patients' homes and communities, increasing the
      potential for diversion and nonmedical use. A recent study suggests that for outpatient
      general surgery procedures, roughly 72% of prescribed opioids go unused. Current opioid
      disposal options are limited to DEA-authorized opioid collectors, including select law
      enforcement agencies, pharmacies, or organized pill drop events, and many patients remain
      unaware of these avenues. Several studies have found that few patients have knowledge about
      opioid disposal options and even fewer dispose of their unconsumed opioids.

      Unconsumed opioids pose a diversion risk. In the 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,
      70.8% of those who used a prescription medication non-medically obtained the medication from
      a friend or relative, with or without their knowledge. Additionally, nonmedical prescription
      opioid use is a common pathway to heroin use. Importantly, over 80% of young intravenous drug
      users report initiation of prescription opioid misuse prior to heroin.

      Considering that 40% of the prescriptions written by surgeons are for opioids and patients
      frequently have excess opioids and limited options for and/or knowledge of opioid disposal,
      the present study will provide patients with information and novel options for opioid
      disposal as part of the surgical care pathway.
