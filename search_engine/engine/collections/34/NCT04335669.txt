      primary end-point of the study, which will be evaluated by comparing the effects of
      neoadjuvant administration of a carboplatin-based treatment and treatment adding capecitabine
      on pCR.

      Primary translational aim: To investigate if the effects of the treatments depend on
      homologous repair deficiency (HRD)-status. More specifically, the aim is to test for
      differential effect of the two treatments on pCR for HRD-negative (HRD low and intermediate
      by oncoscan) and HRD-positive (HRD high by oncoscan) patients.
