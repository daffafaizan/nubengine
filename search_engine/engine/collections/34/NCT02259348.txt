    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate engraftment by day +42 post-transplant in patients who receive
           CD45RA-depleted haploidentical donor progenitor cell transplantation following reduced
           intensity conditioning regimen that includes haploidentical natural killer (NK) cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the incidence of malignant relapse, event-free survival, and overall survival
           at one-year post-transplantation.

        -  Estimate incidence and severity of acute and chronic (GvHD).

        -  Estimate the rate of transplant related mortality (TRM) in the first 100 days after
           transplantation.

      Blood progenitor cells will be collected from adult donors to be used for transplantation.
      Donor cells will be processed and filtered in a laboratory at St. Jude using a machine called
      the CliniMACSâ„¢ device, and later infused (transplanted) into the participant through his/her
      veins.

      Participants undergo a conditioning regimen beginning Day 21 prior to progenitor cell
      transplantation that includes chemotherapy medications and natural killer cells in
      preparation for transplantation. They will then receive T-cell depleted HPC transplant
      followed by CD45RA-depleted HPC transplant the following day.
