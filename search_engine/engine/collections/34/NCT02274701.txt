      signposts issues of emotional, practical, financial and clinical concern. The purpose of a
      HNA is to identify patient's individual needs in order to facilitate better collaboration.
      During consultation the HNA facilitates a dialogue that will have the patient's concerns at
      the centre. In conjunction with a subsequent care plan the process supports timely
      intervention based on a collaborative, person centred discussion. However, there is little
      evidence on how HNA impacts upon the dynamics of the clinical consultation. This study aims
      to establish a) how HNA affects the type of conversation that goes on during a clinical
      consultation and b) how these putative changes impact on shared decision-making and
      self-efficacy.
