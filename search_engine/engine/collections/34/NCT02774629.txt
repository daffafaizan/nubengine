      prick test and atopic patch test are useful in finding the causative foods in some cases. The
      local food extracts have been shown to be at least as effective as commercial ones. From
      previous study the investigators keep the extract at 2-8 degree Celsius for 1-3 months for
      the usage. The investigators want to evaluate the duration that the extracts are still useful
      in diagnosis food allergy
