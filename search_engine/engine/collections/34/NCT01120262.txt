        -  To test the association between serum PSA response (< 4 ng/mL) at 7 months with
           inherited variability of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms, in a set of candidate
           genes, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with combination induction
           androgen-deprivation therapy comprising bicalutamide and goserelin.

      OUTLINE: DNA extracted from whole blood or serum samples is analyzed for inherited
      variability of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms.
