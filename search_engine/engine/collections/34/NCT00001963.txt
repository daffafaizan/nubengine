      contributes importantly to vasodilator tone of the coronary and systemic circulations by
      activating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation. Although regional
      synthesis of NO by the endothelium contributes to local vasodilator tone, Stamler and
      co-workers have proposed that regional vascular tone may also be regulated by NO transported
      from the lungs by hemoglobin as a consequence of enhanced binding of NO to reactive thiols of
      oxygenated hemoglobin. This study is designed to determine the contribution of
      hemoglobin-transported NO to forearm microvascular dilator tone in healthy subjects at rest
      and during regional hypoxia associated with forearm exercise stress, with measurements made
      before and after regional blockade of endothelial NO synthesis. Findings in this study may be
      relevant to understanding the physiological contribution and therapeutic potential of
      hemoglobin-transported NO in the regulation of vasodilator tone in diseases and conditions
      associated with regional endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelial NO bioactivity
      (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, and estrogen
      deficiency).
