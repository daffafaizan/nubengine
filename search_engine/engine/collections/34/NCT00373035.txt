      Primary

        -  Identify unique proteins or peptides that are associated with prostate cancer by
           comparing the proteomic or metabolomic analysis of serum, plasma, and urine from
           patients with histological evidence of prostate cancer to those without prostate cancer
           (after transrectal ultrasound prostatic biopsy).

      Secondary

        -  Collect seminal fluid from a subset of patients to test the hypothesis that the fluid
           collected from the "target organ of injury" in prostate cancer will have a higher signal
           of proteins/peptides that are different from those without cancer and may help guide the
           identification of these differences in the serum, plasma, and urine.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo collection of serum, plasma, and urine for biomarker/laboratory analysis.
      Samples are examined by proteomic/metabolomic analysis (by mass spectrometry) and
      immunoassays. Patients then undergo a transrectal ultrasonography prostatic biopsy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
