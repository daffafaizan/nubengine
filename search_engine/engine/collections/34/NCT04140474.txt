      lesions is an increasingly frequent situation. However these SPN cause difficulties in
      obtaining a sample. Indeed, current endoscopic techniques remain insufficient in terms of
      performance. Moreover, computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle biopsy despite a very
      good sensitivity has many limitations related to the size of the lesions, the accessibility
      and important complications. The Archimedes® system is an improved version of LungPoint® and
      combines 3D reconstruction of chest images with intraoperative radioscopy. It uses a catheter
      to access through the bronchial wall the pulmonary parenchyma and navigate to the SPN. All
      included patients will receive anesthesia consultation, biological assessment and chest CT
      scan in thin sections. A surgical treatment will always be planned after presentation of the
      file in a meeting of multidisciplinary consultation of thoracic oncology. The Archimedes®
      procedure will be performed during a bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. Immediate
      monitoring consisted in a chest x-ray 1hour after the procedure. Patients' participation in
      the study will stop once they benefit from their thoracic surgery
