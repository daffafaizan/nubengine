      Given the known result of NAF-1 protein dysfunction in animal and cultured cell line models
      namely a toxic accumulation of iron in the mitochondria,leading to mitochondrial destruction
      and oxidative stress we aim to obtain fibroblast samples from the patients and (use
      laboratory fibroblasts from healthy subjects as controls) These cell cultures will initially
      be studied for intracellular iron accumulation and then re-evaluated following treatment by
      Deferiprone and/or Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) ex-vivo in the laboratory .

      If repeated (n>=3) histological evidence confirms the beneficial effect of Deferiprone and/or
      GLP-1(incertin based therapy) in the patient's cultured fibroblasts by reversing the toxic
      iron accumulation in the patient's mitochondria to a normal level, he/she will be offered "in
      vivo" therapy using the oral chelating agent - with or without dipeptidylpeptidase-4
      inhibitor (DPP-4) inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists. Adding GLP-1 based therapy will
      depend on the diabetic status of the patient.

      Prior and following 60 and 150 days of Chelator and/or GLP-1 therapy they will go through the
      following clinical and laboratory evaluations which will establish the baseline and post
      therapeutic parameters (outcome) to be compared:

      detailed medical history and physical examination complete blood count (CBC) and iron levels
      platelet aggregation studies Fundoscopy and visual evoked potentials (VEP) Hearing evaluation
      Oral glucose Tolerance Test optional Intra venous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT)
      /glucagon/arginine test HBA1C Daily profile of blood glucose Optional CGMS ( continuous
      glucose monitoring system) Gastroscopy and gastric biopsy if the patient suffers from
      abdominal pain, hematemesis, melena or iron deficiency anemia or if peptic ulcer disease is
      clinically suspected.

      Based on the routine use of the iron chelator, FDA approved, Deferiprone for Thalassemia
      (with detailed official guidelines of the Israel association for Pediatric Hematology) and
      for a similar subcellular iron accumulating disease - e.g. Friedreich Ataxia, we will
      initially use a dose of 20 mg per kilogram body weight (BW) daily divided in two equal doses.
      N-Acetylcystein an over the counter drug which also is an anti-oxidant will be given orally
      in the dose of 200mg twice daily to have a synergistic effect with Deferiprone.

      In addition if they suffer from diabetes they will receive Januet (Sitagliptin/metformin) .
