      I. Determine whether MRI guidance during internal radiation therapy applicator placement
      improves the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) D90 (dose to 90% of the high-risk
      clinical target volume) rate compared to conventional guidance, with ultrasound and freehand
      technique, for patients with cervical and vaginal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify diffusion weighted MRI image features that can be used to identify sites of
      viable tumor following external beam radiotherapy as assessed by tumor aspirate cytology.

      II. Determine if diffusion weighted MRI findings are associated with immune infiltration as
      assessed by multi-spectral flow cytometry.

      III. Identify potential correlates between clinical outcomes (survival, progression) and
      these data objectives (brachytherapy dosimetry/therapeutic ratio, diffusion-weighted MRI
      imaging features, tumor aspirate cytology findings).

      IV. Define the financial costs and feasibility of an MRI-guided brachytherapy approach to
      determine the overall healthcare quality value (outcomes/cost) of this novel approach for
      application at other brachytherapy centers.
