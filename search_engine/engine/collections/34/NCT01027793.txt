      stretch marks.

      Group 2 will receive 16 sessions of dermabrasion that would be held in the research center.

      Subjects will be evaluated by pictures, measurement of width and length of stretch marks,
      using Mirror System(Canfield).

      Biopsy to quantify alterations of epidermis and dermis of treated area, will be held
      pre-treatment and 2 weeks after the conclusion of treatment. For biopsy will be used a punch
