      population. Strength and balance exercise in combination with information about falls
      prevention seems to be effective in reducing falls, but less is known about the effect of
      this kind of intervention on quality of life. This randomized controlled trial investigates
      the effect of a falls prevention program on health-related quality of life, fear of falling,
      falls and physical function in community-dwelling older people who receive home care.
