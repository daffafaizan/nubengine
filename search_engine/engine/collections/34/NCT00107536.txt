      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR])
      as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in each
      group of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival at 6 months. II. To evaluate the toxicity
      profile of this treatment in each group of patients.

      III. To evaluate median overall survival, 6 and 12 months survival rates. IV. To assess
      target-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/EGFR-P protein expression and the genes that
      regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis, which are either downstream of or cross-talk with the
      EGFR signaling pathway, to explore their association with clinical outcome.

      V. To measure expression profile and mutations of genes critical for EGFR and (v-erb-b2
      erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2 signaling pathways with particular
      relevance to GW572016, and to explore new gene-drug relationships as relating to
      hepatocellular and biliary carcinomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
