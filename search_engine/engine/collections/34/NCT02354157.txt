      children to behave in a normative manner in non-food domains. Since food high in fat or sugar
      is usually chosen as a reinforcer for control rules, these rules may lead to children's
      increased preference and every day intake of food high in sugar/fat. Research propositions
      were examined in 207 six to twelve-year-old children (97 boys and 110 girls). Their parents
      reported the children's everyday dietary intake through a food frequency questionnaire, and
      provided information regarding the children's sensitivity to rewards as well as an indication
      of how frequently they enforce family control rules.
