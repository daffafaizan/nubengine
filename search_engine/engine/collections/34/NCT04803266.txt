      breast cancer without distant metastases were included. All patients underwent breast
      conservation surgery or mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection before irradiation.
      Patients underwent regional nodal irradiation along with breast or chest wall irradiation and
      randomly allocated to either IMNI or no IMNI.
