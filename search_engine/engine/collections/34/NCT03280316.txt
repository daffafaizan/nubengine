      of all intradural spinal cord mass lesions, which can influence the function of bladder. The
      investigators' goal is to compare the efficacy of three different management strategies
      (sacral neuromodulation, botulinum toxin, M receptor antagonist) in treating consistent OAB
      (Overactive Bladder) in patients with SVMs after surgery.
