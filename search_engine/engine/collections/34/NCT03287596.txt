      time) that are not or only poorly detected on conventional T2-weighted MR sequences. These
      components are mostly located in musculoskeletal organs such as tendons, ligaments, menisci,
      periosteum or cortical bone.

      Considering that conventional sequences do not detect tissue components with T2 shorter than
      10ms, imaging of body tendon or enthesis is therefore very limited. This represents a
      limitation of MR imaging in early diagnosis of a certain number of pathologies, such as
      mechanical or mostly inflammatory tendinopathy or enthesopathy.

      This study, would provide the feasibility of ZTE 2 sequence to quantitatively assess normal
      and pathological spondyloarthropathy Achilles tendon enthesis at 3 T, and would demonstrate
      that this sequence allows the detection of SpA enthesopathy prior to conventional sequences
      and enables disease monitoring.

      For those purposes, during inclusion visit sequences ZTE 2 and UTE (with and without
      gadolinium injection) will be add to routine macrocyclic gadolinium injected MRI of 3 groups
      of patients (symptomatic and non sympatomatic spondyloarthropathy and mechanical
      tendinopathy). Healthy volunteer group will undergo an MRI exam without gadolinium injection
      comprised of following sequences T2 FS, T1, DP FS, ZTE 2 and UTE.

      No follow up visit are schedule in this study
