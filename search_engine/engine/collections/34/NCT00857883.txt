      hedonic) response to eating highly sugary or fatty foods is increased by opioids. The drug to
      be tested in this study attaches to specific binding sites in the brain, known as mu-opioid
      receptors. This may stop the natural effect of opioids and therefore reduce the pleasurable
      response to food. We predict that this in turn may help patients with obesity to lose weight
      more effectively. The study is divided into three parts:

      Part A: This part of the study will start with a very low dose of study drug, which will then
      be gradually increased in subesquent doses. This is known as dose-rising and is the way to
      assess safety and tolerability (any side effects that make taking the drug unpleasant).
      Effects will be compared to those seen when a placebo (a "dummy" drug) is taken. Up to 4
      groups of 6-9 healthy male or female volunteers will be enrolled in this part of the study.

      Part B: A dose selected from Part A that was well tolerated will be used to check if there is
      a difference in the blood levels of the study drug when taken without food in liquid form,
      without food as a capsule, or with a high fat meal as a capsule. One group of 12 healthy male
      or female volunteers will be enrolled in this part of the study.

      Part C: A well tolerated dose selected from Parts A & B will be used to test whether the drug
      has an effect on preferences for sugary and high fat food, when compared to placebo. Up to 32
      healthy overweight male volunteers will be enrolled in this part of the study.
