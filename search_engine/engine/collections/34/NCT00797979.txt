      Grip titanium clamps will be positioned equidistant to one another along the craniotomy
      opening. The lower parts (complete circle) will be inserted between the dura and the cranium.
      The linear parts of the superior semicircle have to be in line with the craniotomy borders to
      allow the lodging of the bone flap. The different heights of the device are finalized to suit
      it for the different thickness of the cranial vault. The same procedure will be performed
      with all remaining Skull Grip titanium clamps.The bone flap will be then placed in its
      original position. By using a forceps, a simple and easy clockwise rotation of the superior
      semicircle will allow to block the SKULL GRIP clamp in place. For simple removal if necessary
      of the Skull Grip titanium clamps, even if bone ossification of the craniotomy edges has
      already occurred, it will be necessary just to lift up the superior semicircle of the Skull
      Grip by a forceps and to cut by a cutting forceps the pin between the two circle. Then,
      craniotomy could be completed in a standard way.
