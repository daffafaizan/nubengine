      influences arterial wall remodeling and the endothelium-dependent vasomotor function in the
      coronary and systemic arterial systems. The intensity of this inflammatory upregulation is
      strongly related to the incidence of recurrent coronary events. High dose potent statins can
      rapidly reduce plasma levels of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins and inflammatory activity in
      subjects during ACS. By inference, it is plausible to hypothesize that these effects during
      the acute phase of myocardial infarction may influence the post-discharge endothelial
      dysfunction. So far, data is unavailable to verify this assumption or to define the potency
      required for such statin anti-inflammatory effect in myocardial infarction patients. The
      present study aim to investigate the role of statin dose on the time-course of the
      inflammatory response during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and its late effect on
      endothelium-dependent arterial dilation.
