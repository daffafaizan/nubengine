      whole brain radiation. However, patients receiving whole brain radiation sometimes complain
      of dry mouth. Investigators hypothesize that standard whole brain radiation fields cause an
      acute measurable increase in xerostomia at one month post-radiation, and that the severity of
      xerostomia is related to the dose received by the parotids. In this study, investigators will
      use the validated University of Michigan Xerostomia Questionnaire to prospectively collect
      baseline and post-radiation xerostomia scores up to 6 months after treatment. The radiation
      dose to the parotids will be evaluated to assess whether there is a dose-toxicity
      relationship. Investigators anticipate a total accrual of 60 patients with a goal of 48
      evaluable patients.
