    
      First, the investigators hypothesize that a proportion of patients with moderate to severe
      PsO may sustain reasonable good outcomes when a short course of ixekizumab is withdrawn.

      Second, the investigators hypothesize that the investigators can identify the perturbations
      in the architecture of the immunome which are pathogenic, and to discriminate such
      perturbations based on treatment and clinical responses, thus distilling theragnostic
      signatures.

      Therefore, the objectives of the study are as follow:

      Specific aim 1: To describe the clinical course, sustained good outcomes, relapse rate, time
      to relapse and quality of life in PsO patients who stopped a 6-month short course treatment
      of ixekizumab, till the end of 2-years.

      Specific aim 2: To identify the genomic and immunomic signatures in skin biopsies and blood
      in PsO patients who has good outcomes (PASI 75) at 6 months, comparing treatment vs pragmatic
      control.

      Specific aim 3: To identify the genomic and immunomic signatures in skin biopsies and blood
      in PsO patients who sustained good outcomes at 1 year after stopping ixekizumab, compared to
      those relapsed.
