      experimental group will receive BCI-based lower limb functional training, 30 minutes per
      time, 5 times per week, with a 4-week training period; the control group will only receive
      routine lower limb training, with the same treatment frequency, intensity and duration.
      Statistical analysis will be performed to compare the relevant evaluation indexes of the
      experimental group and the control group after treatment and 90 days. In this study, the
      investigators will use Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (LE-FMA) to comprehensively
      evaluate the function of lower limbs, Functional Ambulation Category Scale (FAC) and 10-meter
      walking test (10MWT) for walking ability, modified Barthel index (MBI) for daily living
      abilities, functional magnetic resonance imaging（fMRI）and near infrared functional brain
      imaging (NIRS) to evaluate brain function and network reconstruction, the translocator
      protein(TSPO)-positron emission tomography (PET) and blood immune inflammation indicators to
      evaluate systemic and intracranial immune status.
