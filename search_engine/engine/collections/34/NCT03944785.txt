      outcomes and patient-reported outcomes related to motor and non-motor symptoms, health
      status, quality of life and treatment satisfaction in PD patients who have been newly
      prescribed XADAGO according to Package Insert indication.

      This study also will gather "real world" data from a PD population in the US regarding their
      overall experience and degree of satisfaction with the use of XADAGO as an add-on treatment
      to their L-dopa regimen. Treatment experience will be captured using patient self-rating
      assessments as well as clinician ratings on assessments.
