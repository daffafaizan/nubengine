    
      Following the baseline enrolment visit, the following data corresponding to the patient's
      visits scheduled according to routine clinical practice will be collected in accordance with
      the following model:

        1. Recruitment period: data collection at the baseline visit, every 4 months +/- 15 days in
           the first year (month 4, 8 and 12) and every 6 months +/- 1 month in the second year
           (month 18 and 24).

        2. Follow-up period: (study will end at 4 years following enrolment of the first patient)

             -  From month 24 until up to 4 years from enrolment of the first patient, follow-ups
                will be performed with semi-annual data collections coinciding with the patient's
                routine clinical practice visits.

             -  In case of progression, suspension or unexpected termination of treatment (for
                example due to toxicity), or death, a data collection coinciding with the visit in
                which any of the cases presented occurs will be performed.

             -  If a new line of treatment is started, the follow-up model will be started with the
                same frequency of follow-ups described in point 1 above (month 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24
                and semi-annually according to routine clinical practice until up to 4 years from
                enrolment of the first patient in the study).

        3. Observation period: Following this 4-year period, an additional 5-year follow-up will be
           performed only to evaluate the onset of second primary malignant neoplasms. This
           follow-up during the 5-year observational period will be performed semi-annually (Â± 1
           month) according to routine clinical practice at each site.
