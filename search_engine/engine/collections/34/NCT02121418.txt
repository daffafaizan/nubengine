      I. Examine whether a combination of decitabine given for 10 days (days 1-10), rather than the
      usual 5 days, plus "standard dose cytarabine (ara-C) (100 mg/m^2 daily days 1-7) might
      improve 6-month survival probability from the historical 65% to 80% in patients age >= 60
      with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. Test whether this combination might maintain complete response (CR) rate at our historic
      45% in these patients.

      III. Study factors that lead physicians to escalate or maintain ara-C doses in those patients
      who have had an "intermediate response" short of CR to the first 2 cycles of the combination.

      IV. While maintaining awareness of confounding covariates, examine the effect of such dose
      escalation on CR rate.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) daily on days 1-10 and cytarabine IV once
      daily (QD) on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28-35 days for 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After course 3, patients achieving remission
      will receive 1-2 more courses of therapy at the same dose. Patients in remission with
      significant side effects will receive decitabine and cytarabine at decreased doses. Patients
      not achieving remission will not receive any more treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months and then
      periodically.
