      development and function. BDNF also appears to function downstream of the leptin-melanocortin
      signaling pathway to control appetite. In both animals and humans, diminished BDNF function
      is associated with hyperphagia, obesity, and neurocognitive deficits. We propose to study
      BDNF in two hyperphagic disorders: Prader-Willi syndrome and MC4R function-altering
      mutations. We hypothesize that patients with PWS may have increased BDNF during infancy,
      followed by a decline in BDNF that precedes the onset of hyperphagia and persists after the
      onset of obesity. We hypothesize that patients with MC4R mutations will have decreased BDNF,
      the severity of which will be associated with the degree of MC4R functional loss caused by
      the specific mutation(s) in each individual. To test these hypotheses, we wish to conduct
      cross-sectional studies to evaluate serum BDNF concentrations, metabolism, body composition,
      and neurocognition in: subjects with PWS, subjects with MC4R mutations and control subjects
      matched for age, sex, race, and BMI. If alterations in BDNF are found to be associated with
      PWS and/or MC4R mutations, these investigations could lead to future studies of BDNF receptor
      agonists as mechanism-specific pharmacologic therapy for hyperphagia and obesity in PWS and
      MC4R mutations, or BDNF receptor antagonists for failure-to-thrive in neonatal PWS.
