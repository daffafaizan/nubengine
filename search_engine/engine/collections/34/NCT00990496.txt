      presence of IE-1 and/or pp65. Subjects whose tumors test positive for either or both CMV
      antigens will be consented for the treatment phase which will include a regimen of
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide daily for two days, cyclophosphamide only for a third day,
      followed by one day of rest prior to the day of CTL infusion.

      This trial intended to be a Phase 1/2 trial, but it never progressed to Phase 2 before
      termination.
