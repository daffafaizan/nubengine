        -  Determine whether raloxifene is more or less effective than tamoxifen in significantly
           reducing the incidence rate of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

        -  Evaluate the effects of tamoxifen and raloxifene on the incidence of intraductal
           carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, endometrial cancer, ischemic heart
           disease, fractures of the hip and spine, or Colles' fractures of the wrist in these
           participants.

        -  Evaluate the toxic effects of these regimens in these participants.

        -  Determine the effect of these regimens on the quality of life of these participants (at
           selected centers). (Quality of life evaluation closed to accrual effective 5/31/01.)

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Participants are stratified by age (35 to
      49 vs 50 to 59 vs over 59), race (black vs white vs other), history of lobular carcinoma in
      situ (yes vs no), prior hysterectomy (yes vs no), and estimated absolute risk of invasive
      breast cancer within 5 years (using the Gail model)(less than 2.0 vs 2.0-2.9 vs 3.0-4.9 vs
      5.0 or greater). Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral tamoxifen plus placebo daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral raloxifene plus placebo daily for 5 years. Quality of
           life is assessed (at selected centers) at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48,
           54, 60, and 72 months. (Quality of life evaluation closed to accrual effective 5/31/01.)

      Participants are followed annually after 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19,000 participants will be accrued for this study within 5
      years.
