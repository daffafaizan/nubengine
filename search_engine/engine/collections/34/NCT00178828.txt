      antidepressants called sertraline (Zoloft®) and bupropion (Wellbutrin SR, Zyban ®). Spinal
      fluid is used to measure chemical levels of dopamine, serotonin, and other chemicals thought
      to be involved in depression. The study has potential to help understand and treat
      depression.
