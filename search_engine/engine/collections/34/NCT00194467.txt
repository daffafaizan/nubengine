      suppression of HHV-8 shedding in HHV-8 seropositive men. Our hypothesis is that
      valganciclovir will substantially reduce the frequency of detection and amount of HHV-8 in
      the mouth. Such reduction will serve to confirm that the mouth is the site of active HHV-8
      replication. If valganciclovir is found to be effective, the findings from this proposal
      would serve as the basis for a clinical trial with valganciclovir for prevention of Kaposi's
      Sarcoma (KS) in high-risk HHV-8 seropositive persons.

      After informed consent, all subjects will undergo medical history, physical examination and
      screening laboratory examination. Eligible patients will return to clinic for randomization
      to receiver either valganciclovir 900 mg qd or placebo. Participants will receive a diary for
      noting adverse events and concurrent medications. The clinician will instruct the
      participants on collection of mouth swabs and provide Dacron swabs, vials with PCR media and
      pre-printed labels. Subjects will be asked to obtain a swab of oral mucosa every morning.
      Clinic visits every other week will serve to review interim medical history and diaries for
      adverse events, collect PCR swabs, dispense additional medication and draw safety labs. The
      study uses a double-blind, randomized placebo design. Therefore, participants will not know
      whether they will be taking a placebo or active medication at any time during the study. Due
      to the crossover study design, however, all participants will receive the same amount of
      placebo and study drug over the duration.
