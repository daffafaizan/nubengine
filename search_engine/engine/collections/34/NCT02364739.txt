      from developed countries. The objective of this study is to evaluate if educational
      interventions in oocyte donors increase on their level of fertility knowledge and awareness
      through a RCT. The investigators will evaluate the effect of the interventions through a
      questionnaire filled in at first visit (pre-test) and at the end of the treatment
      (post-test); the investigators will compare the increase in the total score between groups.
