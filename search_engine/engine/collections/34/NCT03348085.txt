      Investigators collected all physiological parameters and baseline characteristics of patients
      with prolong mechanical ventilator. Investigators use Gold-Galileo ventilator and patients
      use adaptive support ventilation mode. In adaptive support ventilation, the clinician enters
      a target minute volume , using a parameter called minute ventilation percentage. The minute
      ventilation percentage setting be initially set at 100% (the 100%minute ventilation setting),
      which provides a target minute ventilation of 0.1 L/min/kg of ideal body weight .
      Investigators observed respiratory frequency of patients, the minute ventilation percentage
      was increased every 5 min until the mandatory breath began to appear and spontaneous rate is
      zero. If the minute ventilation percentage had exceeded 250%, but patients do not have
      mandatory rate appeared, the optimal minute ventilation of the patient is means above 250%.
      Investigators also measure other weaning parameters. Finally, Investigators analyze the
      prediction of optimal minute ventilation as a weaning parameter.
