      mild-to-moderate depression and/or anxiety, as well as caregivers of people with PD. Several
      8-week long MBCT groups will be held between September 2020 and May 2021, based on the
      adapted protocol. The MBCT intervention will consist of 90-minute weekly groups focused on
      teaching mindfulness techniques and ways to recognize cognitive patterns that can increase
      anxiety and/or depression. Participants will be recruited from the community, according to
      the eligibility criteria detailed below. For all participants, the pre- and post-MBCT anxiety
      and/or depressive symptom severity and mindfulness levels (as measured with standardized,
      validated scales) will be compared, using a paired t-test. For caregivers, pre- and post-MBCT
      caregiver burden scores will be compared as well.
