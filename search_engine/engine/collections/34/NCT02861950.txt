      caudal block and urethrocutaneous fistulas after hypospadias repair. The most common
      alternative to caudal blockade is a penile nerve block. The investigators will test the
      following hypothesis:

      There is no difference in the incidence of urethrocutaneous fistula formation following
      single stage hypospadias repair with caudal anesthesia compared with penile nerve block.

      The investigators will use a prospective randomized controlled design where subjects will
      receive either a caudal block or a penile nerve block to provide postoperative analgesia.
      Meatal anatomy will be graded by the urologist in the anesthetized child according to the
      HOPE (Hypospadias Objective Penile Evaluation) score, a validated scoring system. Both the
      total score and the individual component scores will be recorded. The operating urologist
      will determine the presence or absence of a fistula at the postoperative visit about 12 weeks
      after surgery, with subsequent follow up at 6 months and again at 12 months.
