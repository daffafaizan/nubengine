      glutamate and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) levels, and their association with clinical
      response. In the current study, we used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to
      examine longitudinally the effects of citalopram on the glutamine/glutamate ratio and GABA
      levels in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) - a region that has been repeatedly
      implicated in antidepressant response - of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).
      We acquired 1H-MRS scans at baseline and at days 3, 7, and 42 of citalopram treatment in
      nineteen unmedicated individuals with MDD. Ten age- and sex-matched non-depressed comparison
      individuals were scanned once and did not receive citalopram. The association between
      baseline metabolites and the change in metabolites from baseline to each time point and
      change in Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to day 42 was
      assessed by longitudinal regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, and baseline MADRS,
      using generalized estimating equations.
