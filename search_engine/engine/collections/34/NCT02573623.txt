    
      The study is designed as a prospective study for the evaluation of diagnostic tests.

      Children admitted with probable TB based on clinical and radiological symptoms are recruited.
      Gastric lavage or sputum on two to three consecutive days will be collected as per routine
      practise. Active TB will be defined as a positive GeneXpert diagnostic test or MTB culture.

      In addition, children with no sign of TB will be recruited to estimate the specificity of the
      diagnostic tests. These children will be recruited from the surgical ward of the hospital,
      and matched for age group and HIV status.

      In all children, blood samples will be drawn and stored to perform quantiferon (R) and the
      new tests under evaluation.

      The analysis will evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the tests against the current
      gold standard (detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in any specimen obtained from
      the patient). Identification of diagnosis algorithms, including these tests if they prove to
      be informative, will be elaborated and evaluated.
