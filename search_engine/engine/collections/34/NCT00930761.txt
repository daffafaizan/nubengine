      special education, rehabilitation and social development. Its use as a means to facilitate
      communication and expression of emotional contents was shown to be able to promote relief of
      anxiety, fears and tensions. However, in the maternal and child health area there are still
      few studies demonstrating the contribution of this therapy in the promotion of health and no
      study evaluating specifically the impact of this intervention on the rates of breastfeeding
      in mothers of premature newborns.
