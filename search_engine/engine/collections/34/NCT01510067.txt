      disease processes, treatments and quality of life associated with CLE. The CLE database
      incorporates the CLASI (Cutaneous Lupus Activity and Severity Index), a validated outcome
      measure of disease responsiveness in patients and other assessment tools, surveys and patient
      information to help validate the clinical course and quality of life of patients with CLE
      (cutaneous lupus erythematosus).

      The CLE database has led to publication of significant studies on lupus and its clinical
      course, the effect of lupus on Quality of Life (QoL), including the effect of
      photosensitivity on QoL, and the effect of first line medications.

      The CLE database is an ongoing resource that enables clinicians to evaluate the evolving
      clinical changes, treatment modalities and patient response to a challenging disease.
