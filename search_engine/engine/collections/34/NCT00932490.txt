      medications varies. Patients who successfully adhere to chemotherapy regimens have a greater
      chance of non-recurrence and long-term quality of life. Thus, helping patients tolerate oral
      chemotherapy regimens is critical to their survival. The aims of this study are to 1) test
      the effectiveness of a tailored protocol to promote adherence to oral chemotherapeutic agents
      in adults receiving treatment for cancer, 2) examine adherence to oral chemotherapeutic
      agents over time, and 3) examine the effects of age, gender, caregiver availability, personal
      involvement in health care, and depression on adherence rates to oral chemotherapeutic
      agents.

      The tailored adherence protocol is based on the self-regulatory model of adherence. The
      intervention identifies patient knowledge, behavioral skills, and affective support and
      tailors adherence strategies or overcomes barriers in each of these three categories. A
      randomized clinical trial will examine the adherence rates in a 150 adults started on a new
      oral chemotherapeutic agent. A control group will receive standard chemotherapy education.
      Participants in the experimental group will receive the standard education, an assessment and
      the tailored intervention developed by an advanced practice nurse. The intervention will be
      administered via telephone calls over six months. Patient adherence rates will be measured in
      both groups at 2, 4 and 6 months using self report, symptom profiles, and pharmacy fill
      rates. To determine the effectiveness of the adherence protocol, we will use Generalized
      Estimating Equations (with SAS), which provide a unified approach to longitudinal modeling
      techniques for normally and non-normally distributed outcome variables.
