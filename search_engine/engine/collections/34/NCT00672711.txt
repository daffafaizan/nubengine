      experienced single extremity trauma, or who have scheduled elective surgery on a single
      extremity. HRQoL will be determined at recruitment. We will identify their haplotypes and
      genotypes for 4 linked SNPs in the coding region of COMT as described by Diatchenko [2].
      Patients will receive follow-up at 3 and 6 months following trauma or surgery. Individuals
      who report either neuropathic pain or a reduced HRQoL score will be more closely examined, in
      order to identify CPSP or CRPS. Statistical analyses will be performed to determine whether
      haplotypes are associated with the development of either condition, and to determine the
      strength of this association.
