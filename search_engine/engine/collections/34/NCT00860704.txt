      hemodynamics in lean patients and obese patients, respectively. Consequently, we want to
      compare lean patients (BMI <25) vs. obese patients (BMI >25) in regard of their respective
      needs for intraoperative fluid therapy, and the impact of the goal-directed fluid regimen on
      tissue oxygenation.
