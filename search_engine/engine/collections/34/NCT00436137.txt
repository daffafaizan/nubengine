      reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, although only when accompanied by a complete
      diagnostic evaluation of the colon in the setting of a positive result. 90% of patients with
      a positive FOBT result have completed a subsequent colonoscopy within Harvard Vanguard
      Medical Associates. This project will use a pre-post study design to increase the rate of
      followup colonoscopy in the setting of positive FOBT results. Patients in the intervention
      group will receive a personalized mailing highlighting their positive result and need for
      colonoscopy, followed by telephone outreach from a centralized gastroenterology scheduling
      office. The primary outcome will be the performance of colonoscopy, however we will also
      perform chart reviews to identify predictors of completing appropriate followup.
