      study of flexible daily dosing with Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in subjects 4 to 17 years
      of age with partial onset seizures (POS). The study is designed to enroll subjects to receive
      ESL as adjunctive treatment with the option to convert to ESL monotherapy after 6 months of
      ESL adjunctive treatment. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled to obtain approximately
      75 subjects completing 1 year of treatment. At least 25% of subjects will be enrolled in each
      age group (4 - 6, 7 - 11, and 12 - 17 years of age). An attempt will be made to enroll no
      fewer than 30% of subjects in each gender. It is anticipated that approximately 50 subjects
      will convert to monotherapy during the study.
