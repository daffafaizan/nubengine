      high-risk regions),54-56Gy to the PTV of CTV2(i.e., low-risk regions),and 64-66Gy to the PTV
      of the GTVnd for the metastatic cervical lymph nodes in 30-33 fractions. For the GTV and CTV,
      the target volumes that received more than 95% of the prescribed dose was used to reflect the
      target coverage. Subdivision of the PTVnx into regions with different prescribed absorbed
      doses (PTVsv1,PTVsv2, PTVsv2 is the overlaps between PTVnx and temporal lobe) can be used in
      cases for which the PTVnx overlaps temporal lobe. When the volume of PTVsv2 is less than 0.2
      cubic centimeter (cc), the prescribe dose for PTVsv2 is as the same as that of the PTVsv1,
      D1cc 63.1Gy, Dmax 72.9Gy for TL (32 fractions). When the volume of PTVsv2 is between 0.2 cc
      and 0.5cc, the prescribe dose for PTVsv2 is 66Gy, D1cc 63.1Gy, Dmax 72.9Gy for TL (32
      fractions). When the volume of PTVsv2 is between 0.5 cc and 1cc, the prescribe dose for
      PTVsv2 is 66Gy, D1cc 65.8Gy, Dmax 75.2Gy for TL (32 fractions).
