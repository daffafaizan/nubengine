      microorganisms, which increases the risk of suboptimal dosing of antibiotics as the time
      above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC) is suboptimal. Continuous infusion of
      beta-lactam antibiotics is more likely to optimize T>MIC than intermittent infusion. At the
      Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, continuous infusion with
      piperacillin/tazobactam for a period of 2 weeks, has been used for several years in patients
      with CF, suffering from acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE). It is an outpatient treatment,
      and the patients are given 16 g of piperacillin per 24 hours. To assess the efficacy and
      quality of the treatment, a blood test every 3rd day will be required to monitor the
      blood-plasma concentration of piperacillin, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and white
      blood cell count (WBC).
