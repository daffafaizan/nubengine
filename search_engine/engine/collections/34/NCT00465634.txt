      perinatal morbidity and mortality. Routine antenatal care is focused on the detection of
      women at increased risk to apply this population a program of careful monitoring and
      appropriate intervention.

      Uterine artery Doppler during anomaly scan at 20 to 24 weeks in selected women at increased
      risk, has proved to be accurate to detect those who will develop PE or IUGR during the second
      half of pregnancy. Studies have reported detection rate of 50-70% for a 5% false positive
      rate in women developing early pre-eclampsia.

      A variety of proteins and hormones have been studied as potential markers for pre-eclampsia.
      Among these protein serum placental leptin has demonstrated higher levels in pregnant women
      who will subsequently develop pre-eclampsia. However, screening performance of leptin
      detection in early pregnancy has never been assessed.

      Our study is aimed to evaluate the performance of serum leptin measurement in association
      with uterine artery Doppler as a screening too for placental insufficiency.
