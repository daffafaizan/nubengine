    
      80 community-dwelling adults (50-75 years of age) will be recruited from clinics and the
      community through posters and advertising (n = 40 in the Healthy Group; n = 40 in the Distal
      Radius Fracture (DRF) Group (adults with 3-12 months post-DRF)).

      Participants will be randomly allocated to a homeowner paper checklist or a GoPro video
      assessment and then cross-over to the opposite intervention.

      To assess accuracy, a gold standard home assessment will be completed by a trained evaluator,
      after the homeowner checklist and GoPro video assessment.

      Upon completion of the data collection, the evaluator will conduct their assessment (gold
      standard); review the findings from the GoPro "playback" with the participant, and conduct a
      semi-structured interview on their prior awareness of fall hazards, perceptions about the
      different methods of detecting fall hazards in their home; and intentions to remediate
      identified hazards.
