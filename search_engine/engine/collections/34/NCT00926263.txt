      adverse events and altered benefit/risk ratio in healthy subjects, the findings in healthy
      volunteers are not considered to alter the benefit/risk evaluation of figitumumab in cancer
      patients. No changes due to the termination of this study are anticipated in the conduct of
      the ongoing cancer patient studies with figitumumab at this time.
