      sources in men and women with normally functioning ileostomies.

      Study design: Intervention study with 6 test days, testing 3 meals each twice. Study
      population: Eight men and women with normally functioning ileostomies will be recruited for
      the study.

      Intervention: On six separate test days, subjects will receive a meal, consisting of a drink
      and biscuit. With this, two different protein containing meals, i.e. zein and whey, and a
      protein-free meal is tested; these three treatments are given at two occasions, thus in total
      6 meals are tested. After consumption of the meal, subjects collect their digesta for nine
      hours.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Ileal amino acid digestibility of zein and whey protein
      isolate.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The subject will not benefit from the study except for the contribution to
      scientific research. The risk of participating to this study is low, some gastrointestinal
      discomfort could occur. Subjects have to come to the research facility seven times, a
      screening visit of 1 hour, and 6 experimental days of 10 hours. Subjects will be financially
      compensated for participation.
