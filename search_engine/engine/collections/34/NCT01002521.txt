      from an unusually high prevalence of diabetic foot complications, which can cause
      difficult-to-heal foot ulcers and even lead to amputations of the toes or feet.Studies from
      the CDRC have indicated alarmingly high rates of amputation and mortality due to diabetic
      foot in Barbados. The goal of this study is to improve early detection of persons at risk of
      the vascular complications of diabetes through non-invasive scanning and genetic
      susceptibility tests.

      The general hypothesis to be tested in this study is that persons with diabetes (PWD) and
      non-healing foot ulcers are more likely to have a disturbed mechanism for wound-healing than
      PWD without this particular complication. If the hypothesis is proven correct, this will
      empower patients and physicians with the diagnostic tests to make early interventions towards
      avoiding the complications of diabetes.
