      I. Determine the response rate (complete and partial) to FR901228 in patients with relapsed
      or refractory mantle cell or diffuse large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. Evaluate the safety and feasibility of FR901228, in terms of the incidence of toxicity
      and maximum grade observed and courses delayed or dose reductions, in these patients.

      III. Determine 2-year progression-free and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive FR901228 IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.

      Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.
