    
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, biomarker driven, preoperative window of
      opportunity study with a pharmacodynamic primary endpoint. Patients with resectable,
      histologically confirmed OCC for whom surgical treatment is planned as definitive management,
      will be randomized 2:1 to receive PF-00299804 pre-operatively at a dose of 45 mg once daily
      orally for 7-11 days or to Matching Placebo for 7-11 days depending on surgery schedule. The
      target is a total of 8 days of treatment but with a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 11 dosing
      days. All patients will receive surgery as per standard of care without delay. Biomarkers
      from the surgical specimen and baseline tumor biopsy or consent to provide a tumor block from
      existing primary diagnostic tumor biopsy completed within 90 days will be evaluated for
      primary and secondary pharmacodynamic endpoints.
