      diagnosed hydronephrosis. It remains a controversial topic what prognostic factors may be
      predictive for deterioration of the differential renal function.

      The tissue transit time (TTT) in the 99mTc- MAG3 diuretic renogram seems to be a predictive
      factor for the deterioration of the differential renal function in these patients. We
      therefore analyze the tissue transit time in the 99mTc- MAG3 diuretic renogram in a
      prospective multicenter observational study to determine it as a prognostic and diagnostic
      factor. Aim of the study is to differentiate which children could be treated conservatively
      and which will benefit from operative pyeloplasty
