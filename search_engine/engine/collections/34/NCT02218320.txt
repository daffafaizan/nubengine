    
      Purpose: To compare virologic and immunologic responses to raltegravir and dolutegravir in
      the gastrointestinal tract of HIV-positive men and women

      Participants: Twenty HIV-infected volunteers will be enrolled equally into two groups. Group
      A will consist of subjects receiving an antiretroviral regimen of raltegravir, tenofovir, and
      emtricitabine and Group B will consist of subjects receiving an antiretroviral regimen of
      dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine.

      Procedures (methods): This is a Phase IV, open label study to compare the gastrointestinal
      tissue concentrations, cytokine response, and viral replication in gut-associated lymphoid
      tissue of two integrase-inhibitors in HIV-infected volunteers who are virologically
      suppressed in blood plasma. Subjects will undergo an observed bowel preparation, followed by
      a colonoscopy in which tissue will be obtained by a board-certified gastroenterologist from
      the terminal ileum/ascending colon, splenic flexture, and rectum/sigmoid colon. Blood plasma
      will be collected immediately prior to collection of tissue samples.
