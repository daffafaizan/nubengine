      dasiglucagon (0.6 mg) or GlucaGen (1 mg), with 1 week between doses. Patients were followed
      for 15 weeks from the day of the first dose to assess the immune response. Patients with
      previous exogenic glucagon exposure were not excluded from the trial, but the information on
      previous glucagon administration was recorded to enable subgroup analyses. It was expected
      that 112 patients in total would be randomly assigned to treatment groups and treated. A
      total of 90 patients were expected to complete the trial (45 in each treatment arm). To
      qualify as completed, the patient had to be dosed according to the procedure described in the
      protocol and to have blood drawn for the antidrug antibody analyses as scheduled.
