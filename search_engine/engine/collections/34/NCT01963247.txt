    
      A single center study evaluating the effectiveness of BNA technology as an objective tool for
      sport related concussion management in youth athletes' populations.

      The study will include 150 athletes from Minnesota Youth Hockey Programs. Subjects enrolled
      in this study will undergo a screening and baseline pre season visit and follow up visit/s.

        1. Follow-up testing for concussed athletes - Concussed athletes will complete a series of
           post concussion follow up visits. Each will consist of BNA™ test, ImPACT™ test, and exam
           by neurologist or neurology nurse practitioner. The first visit will be within 72 hours
           of injury and re-evaluations will occur weekly until BNA has normalized AND subject is
           asymptomatic. Subject may return to play at that point and subject will have a final
           additional BNA™ test one week after the athlete returns to full activity. If participant
           is still symptomatic and/or BNA is still abnormal at 6 weeks reevaluations go to every 2
           weeks for up to three months or clearing of symptoms AND normal BNA™. If not back to
           baseline at three months, monthly reevaluations until study completion.

        2. Follow up visit for non-concussed athletes - non-concussed athletes will complete a
           follow up visit upon completion of the sport season.
