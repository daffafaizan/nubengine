      into the brain. Outcome is directly related to the amount of bleeding that occurs. Many
      patients die early and others are left with significant disability. A quarter of all people
      with intracerebral haemorrhage are taking an antiplatelet drug, which is associated with
      larger volumes of brain haemorrhage and significantly worse outcomes. Four to five million
      people are taking antiplatelet drugs in the UK and use continues to rise in an ageing
      population.

      Despite advances in treatment of ischaemic stroke, there is no effective drug treatment for
      intracerebral haemorrhage. Treatment for intracerebral haemorrhage has been identified as a
      priority area by Stroke Association and stroke survivors.

      Desmopressin is a drug that reverses blood thinning effects of antiplatelet drugs, by
      indirectly increasing platelet adhesion, which the investigators hypothesise will minimise
      the devastating consequences of intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet drugs.
      Desmopressin is commonly used in patients with inherited platelet dysfunction disorders and
      is an appealing treatment for antiplatelet-associated intracerebral haemorrhage. A recent
      systematic review did not find any randomised controlled trials evaluating desmopressin for
      antiplatelet-associated intracerebral haemorrhage. Desmopressin is affordable, available and
      could be implemented clinically across the UK and worldwide in the next five years with
      immediate benefit for stroke patients, their families and society.
