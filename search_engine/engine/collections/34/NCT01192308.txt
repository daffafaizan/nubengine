      and/or the use of CYP2D6 inhibitors as co-medication that may influence the treatment outcome
      of tamoxifen, this information does currently not lead to a change in the management of this
      patient population. All women on tamoxifen receive the standard dose of 20mg QD, irrespective
      of the use of potential CYP2D6 inhibitors, and are not tested for CYP2D6 polymorphisms prior
      to start of tamoxifen treatment.

      In an attempt to at least resolve some of these issues we propose a prospective study in
      women taking tamoxifen at a dose of 20mg QD who are being followed at several large oncology
      clinics in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands (Nijmegen (CWZ & Radboud), Den Bosch,
      Harderwijk and Arnhem). In each woman, information will be collected on endoxifen levels,
      CYP2D6 status, adherence and use of co-medication. In women who are phenotypically poor
      metabolizers of tamoxifen, a dose increase to 40mg QD will be applied and the effect of this
      intervention on tamoxifen pharmacokinetics will be evaluated after 4 weeks.
