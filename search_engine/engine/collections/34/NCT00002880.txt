      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma when treated with daily oral etoposide. II. Describe the toxic effects
      of daily oral etoposide in these patients. III. Monitor etoposide trough levels and determine
      whether etoposide concentrations correlate with age, response, and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral etoposide daily for 21 days. Treatment is repeated every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in complete or
      partial remission receive 2 courses past best response (minimum 6 courses). Patients with
      stable disease after 3 courses may be removed from study. Patients are followed every 6
      months for 2 years, then annually for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 97 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
