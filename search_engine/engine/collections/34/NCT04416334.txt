      reduces number of deaths due to COVID-19 and severe complications due to the virus in elderly
      patients with comorbidities.

      The secondary objective is to determine the safety of colchicines in this patient population.

      Approximately 954 subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none exclusion criteria will
      be randomized either to receive colchicines or symptomatic treatment (2:1 allocation ratio)
      during 21 days. Follow-up assessments will occur every 48 hours and always at day 10, 21 and
      61 following randomization for evaluation of the occurrence of any trial endpoints or other
      adverse events.
