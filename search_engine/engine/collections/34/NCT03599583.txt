    
      This intervention will incorporate prompts via electronic health record (EHR) (e.g. alerts in
      electronic charts indicating patient is due for vaccination) and study practice staff prompts
      (reminders from study staff that a patient is due for vaccination, e.g. placing Vaccine
      Information Statements (VISs) on desk) to study practitioners that encourage HPV vaccination
      at all visits. An initial learning module on practitioner prompts will highlight how study
      practices can consistently implement both EHR and staff HPV vaccination prompts at all
      visits. Throughout the intervention, text message mini-lessons will remind participants how
      to best use prompts via EHR and/or office staff to improve HPV vaccination rates. This trial
      focuses on study period 3 where study periods are as follows:

      Period 1: Arm-1 intervention study practices receive communication skills training; Arm-2
      comparison study practices provide standard of care. Period 2: Arm-1 intervention study
      practices add performance feedback, building upon their prior training in communication
      skills; Arm-2 comparison study practices continue delivering standard of care. Period 3:
      Arm-1 intervention study practices add prompts, building upon prior communication skills and
      performance feedback; Arm-2 comparison study practices continue with standard of care.
