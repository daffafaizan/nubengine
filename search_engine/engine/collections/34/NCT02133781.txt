      twins will be randomly assigned to receive a single administration of the 2009-2010
      formulation of either seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live,
      attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Twins within a pair will receive different vaccines.
      18-30 year-old and 70-100 year-old subjects will receive a single administration of the
      2009-2010 formulation of TIV. Blood samples to conduct the assays will be taken at
      pre-immunization, Day 7-8 and Day 28 post immunization.
