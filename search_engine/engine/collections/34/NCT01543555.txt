      perioperative period of noncardiac surgeries. To the moment there are no safe and effective
      interventions to reduce vascular events in this scenario. Data from observational studies and
      small-sized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown promising results in terms of risk
      reduction. In addition, experimental data have indicated that statins have acute
      anti-inflammatory properties, which promote the stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions and,
      therefore, might reduce the risk of MI, even in the short term. This study was designed to
      explore the effects of atorvastatin, as compared with placebo, on the 30-day risk of a
      composite of death, nonfatal Myocardial Injury after Noncardiac Surgery (MINS), or stroke
      among patients who undergo noncardiac surgery.

      The study was conducted in accordance with the prespecified protocol and reached successful
      enrollment rates when, by the end of 2014 the steering committee was invited to join an
      international initiative and participate in a much larger clinical trial to investigate this
      relevant question. Due to this outstanding possibility, the steering committee decided to
      redesign the study which is now formatted as an exploratory trial. As described, the study
      was completed with the inclusion of 648 participants in June, 2015.
