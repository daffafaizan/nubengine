      complete the Healthy Living Kansas-Breast Health survey by computer. The survey will take
      about 20 minutes to complete. You will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to one of
      two groups. The groups will receive different breast health information. After completing the
      survey, you agree to be contacted by telephone in 4 months to answer questions. You will be
      asked for your name, home address, and phone number.

      You will be given information about breast cancer and mammography. You may or may not benefit
      from the information provided. Care will be taken to safeguard the information you provide
      but under rare circumstances confidentiality breaches may occur.
