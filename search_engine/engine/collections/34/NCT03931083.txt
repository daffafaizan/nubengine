      application of acetic acid (VIA). However, the ability of this screening method to correctly
      identify precancerous lesions (sensitivity) and women free from these lesions (specificity)
      is limited. The investigators aim to identify alternative screening methods which maximize
      sensitivity and specificity, particularly in HIV-infected women in receiving care in Southern
      Africa. The investigators will evaluate the screening test accuracy of a new portable
      magnification device , the Gynocular™ with Swede score assessment, in women who are
      HIV-positive and eligible for cervical cancer screening. The investigators will assess the
      accuracy of the device when used as a stand alone test, as well as when used subsequent to
      positive VIA or HPV tests. The investigators will make comparisons with current screening
      practices (VIA alone), as well as, recommended screening practices (HPV testing). The
      investigators will enrol 450 HIV-positive women receiving care for HIV/AIDS at the Centre for
      Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, in Lusaka, Zambia. Consenting women will be screened
      with VIA, HPV testing and visual assessment with Gynocular™. All women undergo biopsy
      (reference standard) and receive treatment as indicated and in accordance with national
      guidelines.
