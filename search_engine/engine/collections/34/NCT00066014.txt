      uses a four-period, six sequence, three treatment crossover design to test the hypothesis
      that defined outcomes of variable implant overdenture treatments are equivalent. The project
      tests three overdenture treatment modalities, (1) four-implant, bar/clip-attached treatment,
      (2) two-implant, bar/clip-attached treatment, and (3) two-implant independently attached
      (O-ring) treatment. Each subject has four dental implants placed into the anterior mandible
      and new dentures are fabricated. After successful implant integration, subjects are randomly
      assigned to one of six sequences of treatment. Each treatment is followed for data collection
      for at least twelve months before the mandibular denture is modified to incorporate the next
      treatment in the sequence. Equivalence is measured in terms of prosthesis retention,
      stability, supporting and peri-implant tissue response, patient satisfaction/preference and
      treatment complications/failures.

      Information from this study will assist dental practitioners during treatment planning in
      selecting appropriate and cost effective treatment choices. There is an inverse relationship
      between edentulism in the U.S. population and socioeconomic status. If less costly and
      simplified treatment methods are shown to provide an equivalent treatment outcome to more
      costly/complex methods, these simplified treatments can be used to treat a larger percentage
      of the edentulous population.
