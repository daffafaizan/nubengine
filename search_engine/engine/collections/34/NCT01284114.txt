      number is much higher in the elderly population and may be as high as 30%. CKD is an
      independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is called "Cardio-renal
      Continuum". The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays pivotal roles in both
      cardiovascular and renal functions.

      The increased oxidative stress by activated RAS on vascular endothelium is one of important
      factor to development of Cardio-renal Continuum. The blockade of RAS by angiotensin I
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been
      reported to ameliorate the renal disease and CVD; however,they do not completely suppress
      RAS, leading to a reactive rise in plasma renin activity (PRA). Aliskiren, an oral direct
      renin inhibitor, is effective against essential hypertension by reducing PRA, resulting in
      more complete suppression of RAS; however, little is known about the effects of aliskiren on
      heart and kidney functions in elderly hypertensive CKD patients. In this study, we assessed
      the efficacy of aliskiren on heart and kidney functions in elderly hypertensive CKD patients.
