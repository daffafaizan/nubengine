    
      This is an open-label clinical study to explore the activity signal of ABC294640 and of
      ABC294640 and HCQ in adult subjects who have been diagnosed with unresectable
      cholangiocarcinoma either intra- perhilar or extra-hepatic. The study will be conducted at 5
      sites in the USA.

      For Part 1, a maximum of 39 participants evaluable for efficacy will be enrolled in the
      study. Eligible participants will receive ABC294640, 500 mg twice a day, continuously
      administered in 28 day cycles.

      Part 2 will be a single-arm Phase IIA study identical to Part 1 but treatment will consist of
      both ABC294640 together with HCQ. Additionally, Part 2, will consist of two phases: Phase I:
      accelerate HCQ dose-escalation run-in starting with a HCQ dose of 200 mg QD (once a day).
      Based on safety results, patient cohorts will be expanded, and dosing will continue to 200 mg
      BID (twice a day), 400 mg BID and 600 BID. At the end of Part2, Phase I, it will be
      determined what is the safe and tolerable HCQ dose for Phase II.

      For Part 2, up to 15 patients evaluable for safety and tolerability will be enrolled in Phase
      I component of Part 2; and 20 patients evaluable for efficacy in the Phase II component of
      Part 2. All eligible participants will receive ABC294640, 500 mg BID in addition to the
      determined HCQ dose, continuously administered in 28 day cycles.

      In addition to physical, neurological and eye exams (eye exams only for participants
      receiving HCQ), blood and urine samples will be routinely collected for safety and to
      determine response to the study drugs. Participants will be radiographically assessed for
      disease status every 2 cycles of treatment.

      Tumor biopsies, when accessible, will be obtained within 21 days prior to the beginning of
      treatment and again on the beginning of the second treatment cycle.

      All participants will be followed every 2 months for progression and survival for a maximum
      of 24 months after the last patient has been entered to the study. Follow up procedures may
      include physical examination, laboratory work and radiographic tumor assessment.
