      The multidisciplinary SCOR examined causes, consequences, and treatments of human
      hypertension. A central theme was the renal basis for human hypertension. The subproject on
      white coat hypertension began in December of 1985.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In the longitudinal study, eighty patients with white coat hypertension were compared with 40
      age- and sex-matched normotensives, and with 80 patients with sustained hypertension. The
      protocol consisted of (a) clinic blood pressure measurements made both by a physician and a
      nurse, (b) self-monitoring at home, (c) noninvasive ambulatory monitoring, (d) reactivity
      testing (cold pressor test, mental arithmetic, and isometric exercise) and (e) Korotkoff
      signal recording. Patients were also tested for early markers of disease (echocardiography
      and urine albumin).

      The 80 patients in each of the two hypertensive groups were randomized to one of four
      treatment protocols (20 patients each); an alpha blocker, a beta blocker, a combined alpha-
      and beta-blocker, or an ACE inhibitor. The doses of medication were adjusted to produce
      similar reductions of clinic blood pressure in the different groups. The test battery (a-e)
      was reported during treatment.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
