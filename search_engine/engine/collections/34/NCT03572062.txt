      vaccine candidates, some with adjuvant, when administered concomitantly with SIIV. Healthy
      male and female subjects between 65 to 85 years of age will be enrolled. Subjects will
      receive 2 intramuscular injections to assess the concomitant administration of SIIV when
      given to subjects receiving one of the 3 RSV vaccine dose-level candidates formulated with or
      without an adjuvant.

      If interim support implementation of revaccination, invited, consenting subjects will be
      revaccinated with the same dose and formulation of the RSV vaccine or placebo received at
      Visit 1, concomitantly with SIIV. The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the second
      dose will be evaluated through 12 months after revaccination.

      62 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive a dose of high dose adjuvanted RSV vaccine or
      placebo followed by a second dose 2 months later. Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity
      will be evaluated. The subjects will be enrolled before the influenza season. There will be
      no concomitant SIIV administration.
