    
      In this clinical trial, the investigational product is administered intra-articularly at 1
      week after high tibial osteotomy in a patient with degenerative arthritis of the medial side.

      The investigational product is autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. As it does
      not use allogenic tissue and is incubated without additional genetic modification or
      mechanical and chemical modification through differentiation, it is classified as 'autologous
      cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.

      It primarily aims to regenerate cartilage, to improve pain and joint function. The
      intra-articular injection of the investigational product is expected to stimulate the
      regeneration and growth of cartilage, and to innovatively improve pain and joint function
      with cartilage regeneration compared to high tibial osteotomy alone.
