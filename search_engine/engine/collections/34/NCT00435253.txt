    
      Prospective, open-label, non-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 Study evaluating the efficacy
      and safety of the 10 mL BLVR System in patients with advanced upper lobe predominant
      emphysema. Twenty patients will be divided into 2 groups of 10 patients each and treated
      under conscious sedation at a total of 8 subsegments. Group 1 will be treated in 4
      subsegments in 1 lung and have a second treatment of 4 subsegments in the other lung 6 to 12
      weeks later. Group 2 will receive treatment at 8 subsegments (4 in each lung) during a single
      treatment session if possible; if not completed in 1 session the remaining subsegments will
      be treated 6 to 12 weeks later. Patients will be followed 96 weeks after completion of the
      final BLVR treatment. All patients will receive standard medical therapy in addition to BLVR
      treatment.
