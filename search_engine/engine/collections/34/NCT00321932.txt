    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate whether prophylactic administration of zoledronic acid can reduce the severity
           of bone mineral loss in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of zoledronic acid in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled study.
      Patients are stratified according to participating center and type of transplant
      (myeloablative vs nonmyeloablative). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control): Patients receive oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D) and oral calcium once
           a day for 12 months.

        -  Arm II (treatment): Patients receive vitamin D and calcium as in arm I. Patients also
           receive zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) over 15-30 minutes at 28 days prior to stem
           cell transplantation and at 3 and 6 months after transplantation.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 12 months.
