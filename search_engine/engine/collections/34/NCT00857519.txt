      vincristine), thermotherapy, cryotherapy (freezing treatment), laser photocoagulation, plaque
      radiotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, and enucleation. The treatment is tailored to each
      individual case. Over the past 15 years, intravenous chemotherapy has risen as the most
      popular conservative (eye-saving) method for retinoblastoma management because it is
      effective and safe. In recent years, there has been keen interest in providing chemotherapy
      more focally to a diseased organ including the liver, brain, and eye. The benefit of focal
      chemotherapy delivery is to avoid toxicity to other organs and this toxicity includes the
      risk of future cancers.
