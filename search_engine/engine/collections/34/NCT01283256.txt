      surveillance study to comparing the safety and efficacy of zonisamide as adjunctive therapy
      or monotherapy in patients with partial, generalized or combined seizures, in a initiating
      dose of 100mg/day titrated to a maximum of 600mg per day based on the seizure control and
      tolerability over a 24 weeks treatment period. This study will include a total of 900
      patients with partial, generalized or combined seizures across 30 centres in the country. The
      patients will be enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be evaluated
      for safety and efficacy at every 4 weekly interval for 24 weeks. There will be total 7 study
      visits and the patients will be evaluated for clinically reportable adverse events, safety on
      Patients Global Assessment of Tolerability to Therapy (PGATT) on a 4-point scale and for
      efficacy by evaluation of reduction in seizure frequency as the primary objective of the
      study. For secondary objectives the patients data will be evaluated to determine the
      responder rates (> or = to 50% reduction in seizure frequency from baseline) and seizure
      freedom over the 24 weeks study period.
