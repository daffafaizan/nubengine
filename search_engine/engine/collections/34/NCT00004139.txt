      versus gemcitabine and irinotecan in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB or IV
      non-small cell lung cancer. II. Compare the overall and failure free survival, duration of
      response, and toxicity associated with these combination regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage
      (stage IIIB vs stage IV without CNS involvement vs stage IV with CNS involvement vs
      recurrent/progressive disease post surgery and/or radiotherapy). Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes immediately
      followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Arm II: Patients receive
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving partial or complete response or stable disease receive treatment
      for least 6 courses and for 2 additional courses beyond the maximum response, and then at the
      investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (36 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 12 months.
