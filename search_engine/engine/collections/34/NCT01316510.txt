      motility delays the introduction and advancement of feeds which prolongs hospitalization. The
      use of probiotic bacteria may improve intestinal motility. It is unknown whether the
      intestinal microbiota of infants with gastroschisis differs from that of healthy infants
      without gastroschisis and whether probiotics will change the microbiota. The primary outcome
      in this study is the composition of the fecal microbiota in infants with gastroschisis
      following surgical correction treated with Bifidobacterium infantis or placebo. We will also
      look at differences in hospital length of stay.
