      trial, testing instructions to be delivered to participants will be translated and adapted
      into Turkish. In order to maximize potential agreement and to improve rating accuracy,
      reliability, and validity, assessment skills of the raters will be refreshed through
      training.

      Administration of the tests will be performed in a corridor of the school. Assessments will
      be performed in a quiet and adequately lighted environment to minimize the distraction.
      Participants will be tested with their regular footwear. The demographic information of
      participants will be recorded. The dynamic balance performances on the four square step test
      (FSST) and the Timed up & Go test (TUG) will be assessed by Rater A and B independently and
      these assessments repeated 24-h later. The participants will be allowed to rest up to five
      minutes between sessions. A stopwatch will be used to measure time to complete the FSST and
      TUG test.

      Evaluations of concurrent and discriminative validity will be based on mean scores from the
      first measurement of rater A. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) will be used to assess
      the concurrent validity of the FSST and TUG tests. Between-groups discriminative validity of
      the FSST will be evaluated by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni
      post-hoc test. Both intra- and inter-rater reliability will be assessed using intraclass
      correlation coefficients (ICC). ICC2,1 and ICC2,2 estimates and their 95% confidence
      intervals will be calculated based on absolute-agreement. Bland & Altman plots will be
      constructed to demonstrate agreement between TUG and FSST, and between assessments of rater A
      and B.
