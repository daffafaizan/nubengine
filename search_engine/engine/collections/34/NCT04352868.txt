      can slow the amount of change of myopia progression in children with myopia plus astigmatism.
      Multifocal contact lenses have been theorized to influence the peripheral optics of the eye
      such that they slow the rate of myopia progression in nearsighted children. This outcome is
      yet to be evaluated in children with myopia plus astigmatism.The secondary outcome is to
      measure the change in peripheral optics caused by the contact lens. This information is key
      to understanding the mechanism of multifocal contact lens optics on the eye. Ultimately this
      information would be used to create a software that can estimate the effect of multifocal
      contact lenses on the peripheral optics of the child's eye. This software can potentially be
      used by practitioners worldwide to better customize multifocal contact lenses to slow myopia
      progression.
