    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to study 3
      cohorts of subjects with Crohn's Disease including (but not limited to) those with colonic
      involvement. Each cohort (n = 9) will include PDA001 treated subjects (n = 6) as well as
      placebo (vehicle control) treated subjects (n = 3). Cohorts will be enrolled sequentially,
      beginning with the lowest dose cohort (1/4 unit PDA001) and progressing until the maximum
      tolerated dose of IV PDA001 is determined.
