    
      Exercise behavior will be defined as patient reported mean total minutes (frequency x
      duration) of mild, moderate, and vigorous-intensity physical exercise per week over the past
      month at baseline (prior to enrollment in the study). In addition we will collect patient
      reported mean total minutes per week of mild, moderate, and vigorous-intensity physical
      exercise over the course of radiation therapy.Baseline characteristics including demographic
      data (age, education, employment) as well as BMI, waist to hip ratio, and health
      comorbidities (including smoking status, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes) will also be
      collected. BMI and health comorbidities will be extracted from the chart. Patient-Reported
      Outcomes will include QOL, fatigue, depression, pain and sleep. QOL will be assessed using
      the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) scale developed for the assessment of
      patient symptoms and QOL in cancer patients. Fatigue will be assessed using the 13-item
      FACT-fatigue scale for the assessment of fatigue in cancer patients.Skin toxicity will be
      defined as radiation dermatitis, pruritus, and pain.

      Lymphedema will be assessed by measuring limb girth. Measurements will be taken by first
      marking both limbs while patient is lying supine, starting at the ulnar styloid at 5cm
      intervals on the length of the arms. The diameter of the limb will then be measured at these
      markings. Based on these measurements, the affected limb will be compared to the unaffected
      limb. Range of motion will be defined as reduced abduction compared to the contralateral
      shoulder . All measurements will be taken with a goniometer.
