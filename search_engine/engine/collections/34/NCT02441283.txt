      dose of an ABT-493- and/or ABT-530-containing regimen at any dose level in an eligible prior
      AbbVie Phase 2 or 3 study for the treatment of chronic HCV and elected to enroll in this
      study. The participant must have completed the follow-up period of the prior eligible AbbVie
      study. Participants were followed for a total of approximately 3 years after their last dose
      of DAA in the previous HCV clinical study. The 3 years were inclusive of any post-treatment
      period in the prior study, as well as any gaps between the end of the prior study and
      enrollment in this study.
