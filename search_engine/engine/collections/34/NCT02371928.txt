      traumatic dislocated shoulder. This injury accounts for almost 50% of all joint dislocations
      registered in the emergency departments. Due to post-traumatic laxity and injuries to the
      surrounding shoulder tissue, one major problem is the risk of developing a chronic recurrent
      instable shoulder affecting patients both physically and psychologically decreasing their
      overall quality of life.

      Biomechanically, proprioceptive changes and decreased sensorimotor control are found in
      patients with post-traumatic shoulder instability inhibiting the ability to control and
      stabilize the glenohumeral joint. In other similar musculoskeletal disorders, recent studies
      clearly shows positive effects of progressive neuromuscular exercise.

      Finally, no studies have yet investigated the effect of a structured, physical
      exercise-training regime based on neuromuscular principles targeting the shoulder joint.

      This trial is performed as a randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled multi-center trial with
      cooperation from various shoulder outpatient clinics located at different hospitals in The
      Region of Southern and Northern Denmark.
