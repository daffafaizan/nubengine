      and are between the ages of 2-21, can be considered for participation in this research if
      they are having an acute rejection episode. After a biopsy is done and the diagnosis of acute
      rejection is made, ten patients will be randomly enrolled in the group to be treated with
      Rituximab and steroid pulses. Ten children will be enrolled as the control group, receiving
      standard of care for acute transplant rejection.

      Assignment will be based on a 1:1 randomization scheme. That means two patients will be
      assigned to the group of patients receiving steroid pulsing and 4 doses of Rituximab. The
      third patient would be assigned to the group receiving steroid pulses and adjustment in
      immunosuppression medications which is the standard of care at Stanford University.

      The dose of Rituximab that will be given is 375 mg/m2 and is administered through an IV.
      Additional doses of Rituximab will be administered on a weekly basis. A total of four doses
      will be given.

      If the acute rejection does not resolve by one-week, patients in both groups have the option
      of receiving polyclonal antibody therapy.
