      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. Hence, enhancing NMDA neurotransmission was considered as a new approach for
      schizophrenia treatment. To date, there have been a few pilot studies exploring the efficacy
      of NMDA enhancers as adjuvant therapy for schizophrenia, for instance, D-serine (an
      endogenous agonist of the NMDA-glycine site). They were not only well-tolerated but also
      synergistic in improving positive, negative and cognitive symptoms in those receiving typical
      and atypical antipsychotics (except clozapine).

      Refractory schizophrenia (particularly clozapine-resistant) is still a difficult clinical
      issue at present. Previous studies revealed that add-on treatment of D-serine or other
      agonists of NMDA receptor failed to give significant benefits in such patients. The primary
      goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of glycine transporter(GlyT)-1
      inhibitor adjuvant therapy in refractory schizophrenia, and to identify the predictors for
      treatment response to NMDA enhancers.
