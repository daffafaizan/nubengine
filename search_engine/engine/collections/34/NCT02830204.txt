    
      Technical Success:

      Alive, with

        -  Successful access, delivery and retrieval of the device delivery system, and

        -  Deployment and correct positioning (including repositioning/recapture if needed) of the
           single intended device, and

        -  No need for additional unplanned or emergency surgery or re-intervention related to the
           device or access procedure

      Device Success:

      Alive and stroke free, with

        -  Original intended device in place, and

        -  No additional surgical or interventional procedures related to access or the device
           since completion of the original procedure (i.e., exit from the cath lab/Operating
           Room(OR)), and

        -  Intended performance of the device:

             -  Structural performance: No migration, embolization, detachment, fracture,
                hemolysis, thrombosis (including reduced leaflet motion) or endocarditis, etc, and

             -  Hemodynamic performance: Maintenance of relief of stenosis or insufficiency without
                producing the opposite (Stenosis = Mitral Valve Area (MVA) < 1.5cm2 and Mitral
                Valve (MV) gradient > 5mmHg, Insufficiency = Mitral Regurgitation (MR) >1+), and

             -  Absence of para-device complications (e.g., Paravalvular Leak (PVL) > mild, need
                for a Permanent Pacemaker (PPM), erosion, Annular rupture or Aortic Valve (AV)
                Groove disruption, Left Ventricular Outflow Tract (LVOT) gradient increase >
                10mmHg)

      Procedural Success:

      Device success, and

        -  No device or procedure related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (Life threatening bleed;
           major vascular or cardiac structural complications requiring unplanned reintervention or
           surgery; stage 2 or 3 Acute Kidney Injury (includes new dialysis); Myocardial Infarction
           (MI) or need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)/coronary artery bypass graft
           (CABG); severe heart failure (HF) or hypotension requiring intravenous (IV) inotrope,
           ultrafiltration or mechanical circulatory support; prolonged intubation ( > 48 hours)
