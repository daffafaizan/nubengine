    
      Design: The proposed study is a pre/post-test design where up to 60 female adult
      black/African Americans in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, Louisiana will be recruited to
      participated (Intervention, n=30; control n=30). If a woman is interested in participating,
      she will be asked to complete an evaluation/screen to determine if they are eligible for the
      study and asked to consent to participate. If a woman consents to participate they will be
      randomized to one of 2 groups:

        1. Intervention group: Text messages to promote healthy eating: In this group, participants
           will receive personalized text messages to encourage healthy eating, specifically to
           increase consumption of fruits, vegetables and water; and a reduction in sugar sweetened
           beverages. They will receive some messages that will ask for a reply. They will receive
           an average of 1-2 messages per day for 4 weeks.

        2. Control group: Control group participants will receive non-nutrition-related physical
           activity and general health/wellbeing text message. They will receive the text messages
           an average of 1-2 messages per day for 4 weeks

      All participants will be asked to do the following tests that are not used to determine
      eligibility: Complete questionnaires about their background, nutrition habits, physical
      activity habits, health history, beliefs and opinions about health and habits. Data will be
      analyzed by comparing assessment outcomes within and across study arms (i.e., intervention,
      control).
