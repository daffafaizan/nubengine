    
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common virus that affects all human age groups and can
      cause a range of respiratory disease such as bronchitis and lower respiratory infections.
      These serious illnesses affect infants and adults who are older especially if they are over
      65, have chronic heart or lung disease or have a weakened immune system. Vaccination against
      RSV has the potential to be a highly beneficial and effective approach to reduce RSV disease
      in older adults and pediatric populations, however there is no current vaccine approved for
      the prevention of RSV infections.

      RSVpreF is being developed to prevent RSV-associated moderate to severe lower respiratory
      tract disease in adults 60 years of age and in infants by active immunization of pregnant
      women.

      This study is an exploratory proof-of-concept to assess the safety, immunogenicity and
      efficacy of RSVpreF using a human challenge model. The RSV challenge model is developed to
      help understanding the RSV disease and assess new vaccines by testing them in participants
      deliberately infected with the virus.

      In this study, approximately 62 (up to 72) participants will be vaccinated with the
      investigational RSVpreF to account for withdrawals between vaccination and challenge.
      Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive RSVpreF or placebo.

      The study will consist of a vaccination phase, quarantine phase and a follow-up phase.
