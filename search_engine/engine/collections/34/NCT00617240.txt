      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either flexible-dose treatment with metformin
      for 6 months as well as a newly initiated second generation antipsychotic medication or to
      receive placebo and the newly initiated antipsychotic medication. All subjects will also be
      provided healthy lifestyle instruction. The study involves monthly visits for the duration of
      the study. Participants may be treated as inpatients or outpatients throughout the course of
      the study. Participants will receive a psychiatric evaluation, physical exam, lab work, ECG,
      medication treatment, and psychiatric care.

      The goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of means to prevent and treat weight gain and
      the associated endocrine, metabolic, and inflammatory changes caused by antipsychotic
      medications. Behavioral treatments to reduce weight gain and metabolic problems after weight
      gain has occurred have had little impact. Such interventions must be intensive and sustained
      over months, if not years to be effective. Although basic lifestyle instruction (diet and
      physical activity) should be the standard of care for all children and adolescents at risk
      for becoming overweight, pharmacologic interventions may be the best option for substantially
      augmenting behavioral approaches to weight management.
