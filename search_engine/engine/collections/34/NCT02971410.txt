      I. To examine the effect of simvastatin on myeloma (M)-protein and/or free light chains ratio
      when added to conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who
      have received up to 3 (=< 3) and > 3 different chemotherapy regimens. (group A and group B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and duration
      of response (DOR) in group A, group B, and both groups combined.

      II. To describe toxicities (frequency and severity during the treatment) in group A, group B,
      and both groups combined.

      III. To estimate overall response (OR) in group A, group B, and both groups combined.

      IV. To evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of patients on the combined treatment in group A,
      group B, and both groups combined.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard of care chemotherapy for up to 3 courses and simvastatin orally
      (PO) daily 2 days before the first dose of chemotherapy for up to 2 days after the last dose
      of chemotherapy. Treatment with simvastatin continues in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3-5 weeks for
      the first 6 months, and every 1-3 months thereafter.
