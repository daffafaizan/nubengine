      assessment alone. It is necessary to evaluate the functional significance to guide their
      treatment.

      Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is the current gold standard for determining this functional
      significance but its adoption in clinical practice remains low. The instantaneous wave-free
      ratio (iFR) is an alternative way to determine the flow-limiting characteristics of a
      coronary stenosis with a pressure wire but without the need to induce hyperemia. Large
      randomised trials have confirmed the non-inferiority of iFR in respect to FFR in terms of
      outcome.

      Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR) is another new method for evaluating the functional
      significance of coronary stenosis It is a software-based analysis of conventional
      angiographic images to estimate the pressure drop caused by a coronary stenosis. The
      diagnostic agreement with FFR seemed promising in the FAVOR Pilot Study and a larger trial is
      enrolling for confirmation.

      A stepwise approach of QFR and iFR could make the functional assessment of intermediate
      stenoses more practical and cost-effective. However before being used as a combination in
      daily practice, QFR has to be validated in respect to iFR.

      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the diagnostic agreement between QFR and
      the pressure wire-based iFR in a real world setting
