      Primary

        -  Correlate pre-treatment and 3-month post-treatment carbon-11 (^11C) acetate and
           fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (^18F-FDG PET) images with changes in
           clinical response measures in patients with bone-dominant metastatic prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET scanning results with bone scintigraphy in these
           patients to determine which best predicts clinical response.

        -  Correlate changes in ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET with changes in prostate-specific
           antigen level.

        -  Correlate changes in ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET with clinical symptom parameters
           (pain scale scores and analgesic usage scales).

        -  Correlate ^11C acetate and ^18F-FDG PET scan response with clinical time to progression.

        -  Determine if PET scan response can predict duration of progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to hormone response
      (sensitive [stratum 1] vs refractory [stratum 2]).

      Patients undergo carbon-11 acetate and fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography
      imaging prior to and 3 months after initiation of either androgen-deprivation therapy
      (stratum 1) or docetaxel (stratum 2).

      Pain and quality of life are assessed at baseline and at 3 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
