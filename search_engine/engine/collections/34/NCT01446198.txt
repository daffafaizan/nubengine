    
      The APTIMA HPV Assay is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative
      detection of E6/E7 viral messenger RNA (mRNA) from 14 high-risk types of human papillomavirus
      (HPV) in cervical specimens. The high-risk HPV types detected by the assay include: 16, 18,
      31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. The APTIMA HPV Assay does not
      discriminate between the 14 high-risk types. Cervical specimens collected in ThinPrep Pap
      Test vials containing PreservCytÂ® Solution with commercially available collection devices
      (broom-type device or cytobrush/spatula combination) may be tested with the APTIMA HPV Assay
      either pre- or post-Pap processing. The assay is used with the TIGRIS System and the PANTHER
      System.

      The objective is to establish that APTIMA HPV Assay performance on the PANTHER System is
      comparable to performance on the TIGRIS System.
