      post-menopausal period is also increasing. In order to have a healthy menopause, which is an
      important part of women's life, it is thought that the acupressure without health risks by
      women may be effective in reducing the symptoms of menopause experienced by women and quality
      of life. In line with this information, it was aimed to determine the effect of acupressure
      on menopausal symptoms and quality of life and the relationship between menopausal symptoms
      and quality of life. The study will be carried out with menopausal women between the ages of
      40-60 in Mersin province in Turkey. Therefore, in the study, 46 women in the menopausal
      period between the ages of 40-60 will be randomly assigned to acupressure and control groups.
      The study group (n = 23) will be applied to the determined points in a certain order.
      Sequence of application Large intestine 4th point (LI 4), Heart 7th point (HT 7), Triple
      warmer point 23 (TE 23), Stomach 36th point (ST 36), Spleen 6th point (SP 6) and Liver The
      3rd point is (LV 3). Acupressure application for 20-25 minutes three times a week for four
      weeks will be applied individually to the study group. No intervention will be made to the
      control group for a period of four weeks. The primary expected outcome of the research is the
      effect of acupressure on menopausal symptoms of menopausal women. The second expected result
      of the study is to determine the effect of acupressure on quality of life. Results will be
      applied three times in total, before the study and control application, two weeks and 4 weeks
      later.
