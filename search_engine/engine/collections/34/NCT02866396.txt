      pregabalin-treated patients (>more than 15 days) for neuropathic pain associated to spinal
      surgery and pregabalin-free patients for whom pregabalin will be prescribed for 48 hours.
      Patients will be included without randomization as an observational study. All the patients
      will receive multimodal analgesia and intraoperative management will be standardized. The
      main outcome will be the amount of oxycodone during the first 24h after surgery. Other
      outcomes include pain scores, the quantification of the neuropathic pain diagnostic
      questionnaire (DN4), nausea and vomiting, length of stay, side-effects of pregabalin and
      opioid. Patients were also evaluated at three months for pain scores and DN4 score.
      Postoperative evaluation will be performed in a single-blind manner with investigators not
      include in the recruitment or the peroperative period.
