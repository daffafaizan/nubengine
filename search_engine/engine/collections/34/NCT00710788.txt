      general population. Higher levels of serum phosphate are associated with adverse
      cardiovascular outcomes, especially in the setting of overt hyperphosphatemia. Given the
      biological importance of serum phosphorus, it is conceivable that also within the normal
      range values the higher serum phosphate levels may be associated with the worst outcome.
      Several paper have shown that vascular calcifications in dialysis patients are associated
      with increased relative risk of death; it has also been demonstrated in uremic patients that
      vascular calcifications decrease arterial elasticity. We previously observed that vascular
      calcification directly correlate with QT interval (QTc) as well as QT dispersion (QTd) in
      dialysis. Also, QT correction (obtained by the correction of phosphoremia and dyslipidemia)
      can ameliorate the development of arrhythmia and sudden death. Aim of this study is to
      evaluate the relationship between vascular calcifications and both QTd increase and mortality
      in incident hemodialysis patients, and to investigate the efficacy of sevelamer to reduce
      vascular calcifications and QTd.
