      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib in combination with rituximab
           and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade,
           follicular B-cell, or mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation study of
      bortezomib.

      Patients receive rituximab IV over 4 hours followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV
      over 10 minutes on day 1 to assess biodistribution. Patients without altered biodistribution
      receive rituximab IV over 4 hours followed by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10
      minutes on day 8. Patients also receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 4, 8, 11, and
      15.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients may be treated at the
      MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 18 months and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
