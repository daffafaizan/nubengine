      administered OT can modulate interpersonal motor resonance (IMR) and/or the enhanced effects
      of eye contact on IMR. To investigate the effects of exogenous OT administrations, the
      investigators adopted a double-blind, within-subjects (cross-over), randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will recruit approximately 30 neurotypical young
      adults males between 18 - 35 years old. Since a cross-over design is included, subjects will
      participate in two sessions, separated by one week. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive a single dose of OT (24 international units) or placebo nasal spray at the first and
      second session.

      In each session, the non-invasive brain stimulation technique 'transcranial magnetic
      stimulation' (TMS) will be used at the level of the primary motor cortex to obtain an
      end-state measure of unconscious 'mirror-motor mapping' or IMR. During TMS, participants will
      observe video stimuli of a model performing simple, intransitive hand movements combined with
      either direct or averted gaze. Additionally, behavioral measures will be included: social
      attachment and social responsiveness will be assessed via self-report questionnaires and eye
      tracking technology will be included to monitor participant's spontaneous gaze behavior.

      The main statistical analysis of the neurophysiological data will have the within-subjects
      factor of administered nasal spray (OT or PL), observed gaze direction (direct or averted
      gaze) and observed movement (opening hand movement or no movement). Furthermore, the link
      between the neurophysiological (TMS) and behavioral measures (questionnaire data and gaze
      behavior) will be investigated.
