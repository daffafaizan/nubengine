    
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging involves injection of radioactive tracers (small
      amounts of biologically active molecules with radioactive atoms attached) and scanning the
      body to see where the tracers localize, and how intensely they "stick" there.

      The tracers are used in such small amounts that they do not affect brain or body functions.
      The amount of radioactivity used is also very small and disappears quickly. Overall radiation
      exposure for participants is low and well within accepted safety levels for the human body.
