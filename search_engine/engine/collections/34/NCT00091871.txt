      protocol. A thorough clinical evaluation will be performed biyearly with emphasis on
      potential sequelae of eosinophil-mediated tissue damage. Blood cells, bone marrow and/or
      serum will also be collected to provide reagents (such as DNA, RNA, and specific antibodies)
      for use in the laboratory to address issues related to the genetic and immunologic basis of
      FE as well as its pathogenesis. It is anticipated that patients will undergo a more extensive
      evaluation than is generally available and that the specimens collected from them will prove
      to be valuable reagents for laboratory studies related to eosinophilia, eosinophil activation
      and function. While the study is not designed to address the question of therapy for FE, in
      patients for whom medical therapy is indicated (for either the hypereosinophilia itself or
      its sequelae), appropriate treatment will be instituted by our clinical service or the
      patients' local physicians. No experimental chemotherapy is involved in this protocol. Family
      members of affected family members may also be enrolled and provide research specimens on
      this protocol to help determine the underlying genetic causes of FE.
