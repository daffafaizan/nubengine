      damage caused to tissue and bone may result in considerable pain, edema and trismus. The
      symptoms start gradually, peaking in 2 days after the extraction. The use of medications such
      as dexamethasone and diclofenac associated to codeine may support the prevention of
      post-surgical pain. This clinical trial aim compare the the pre-emptive effect of
      dexamethasone and diclofenac associated to codeine to prevent the pain, edema and limited
      mouth opening at the extraction of third molar.
