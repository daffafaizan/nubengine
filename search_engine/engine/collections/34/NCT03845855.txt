      disorders are frequently seen. In stroke rehabilitation, with the use of robots and virtual
      reality systems with conventional methods, it is aimed to increase patient's motivation, to
      check if exercise is effective, to provide objective evaluation data and to support the motor
      learning process and the use of these methods in the field of neurological rehabilitation is
      increasing.

      Multi-task evaluations can be made with the virtual environments created by virtual reality
      applications and complex tasks.

      The traditional approach to stroke rehabilitation is mainly focused on balance and gait
      training under single task conditions. In everyday life, people should not only have balance
      and mobility skills, but also have the ability to perform other cognitive and motor tasks
      with these skills. Therefore, traditional approaches are not sufficient for the individual to
      return to society after a stroke.

      In this respect, this study was planned in order to examine the effects of frequently used
      virtual reality treatment in addition to robotic gait therapy on the dual task, balance and
      gait performance.
