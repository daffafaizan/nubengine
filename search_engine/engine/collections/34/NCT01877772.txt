      of pain relief. However the re-tear rates remain high and are associated with significant
      morbidity in terms of functional outcome and shoulder strength. As rotator cuff disease
      becomes ever more prevalent with our aging population, it is imperative to determine if
      healing rates can be improved with autologous stem cell enhancement with pre-surgical
      preparation of the tendon insertion site through trephination. This trial is necessary both
      to provide optimal care of our patients, and to do so in a fiscally responsible fashion.

      The primary outcome measure the re-tear rate as measured by ultrasound at 24 months
      post-operatively.

      The secondary outcome measures are Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC), Constant Score,
      and the American Shoulder and Elbow surgeons standardized assessment of shoulder function
      (ASES).
