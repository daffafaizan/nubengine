      Change(PABC) intervention for Veterans with dysvascular lower limb amputation. In addition,
      preliminary efficacy of the PABC intervention will be assessed using a two-group randomized
      cross-over design. Testing will occur at baseline (pre-intervention), three months (end of
      intervention), and six months. The primary aim is to determine feasibility of using the PABC
      intervention with Veterans who have dysvascular amputation by measuring:

        1. participant retention

        2. dose goal attainment

        3. participant acceptability

        4. safety The secondary aim is to preliminary assess efficacy of the PABC intervention by
           measuring accelerometer-based physical activity and self-report disability effect sizes.
