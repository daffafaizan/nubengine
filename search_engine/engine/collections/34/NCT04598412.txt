      patterns in older adults. These studies must report total, and per-meal protein intake,
      evaluated through 24-h dietary recalls, food diaries or food frequency questionnaires.
      Afterwards, the researchers will contact the authors for data requests and analyze the data;
      these data will also include some demographic variables (e.g. sex, age, height, weight). Once
      the data are obtained, the patterns of protein intake will be compared among countries with
      an ANOVA test. As it is very likely that variances and/or sample sizes will be unequal, a
      Welch's correction and a Dunnett test for post hoc analyses will be performed. This analysis
      is going to be performed for the whole sample and by sex. Similarly, the proportion of older
      adults that do not reach the recommended amounts of protein in a daily (0.8, 1.0, 1.2
      g/kg/day) and per meal basis (30 g, 0.4 g/kg) will be calculated. These proportions will be
      compared among countries with a chi-squared test and employing a z-test for proportions (with
      Bonferroni adjustment) to identify pairwise differences.
