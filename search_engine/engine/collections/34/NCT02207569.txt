    
      This objective will be accomplished by a prospective, single arm, historical controlled,
      multi-site study involving a minimum of 150 implanted subjects with no more than 250
      implanted subjects at up to 25 study sites in the United States. Procedural and 30 day safety
      and efficacy results from this study will be compared to appropriate historical control data
      for the Medtronic CoreValve System. Subjects will be followed up to 5 years following
      implantation.

      The enrollment phase of the study is estimated to take approximately 6-9 months. As each
      implanted subject is to be followed up to 5 years, the estimated study duration is
      approximately 66-69 months, excluding the time required for preparing the final report.
