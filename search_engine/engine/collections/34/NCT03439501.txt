    
      Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) generally has poorer prognosis than other
      lymphomas because the majority of patients are present as advanced disease and show poor
      response to treatment.

      In particular, treatment of relapsed or refractory stage ENKTL is very poor and there is no
      standard treatment.

      ENKTL is entirely infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the prevalence of this disease
      is closely related to EBV.

      Therefore, the biological properties of ENKTL may be affected by EBV-related protein and LMP1
      may induce activation of molecules in various sub-channels, such as PI3K/Akt and NF-kB, and
      affect the aggressiveness of lymphoma.

      As an increase in PDL1 has been reported recently among the major roles of LMP1, the role of
      Immuno-oncology drug targeting PDL1 among ENKTL is expected.

      Therefore, Avelumab that inhibits PDL1 may effectively treat NK/T-cell lymphoma besides
      relapsed or refractory stage lymphoma.
