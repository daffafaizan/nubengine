      hyprparathyreoidism on oeritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, predialysis patients and patients,
      who have received a kidney transplant will be included,. Data collection in the dialysis
      group is finnished and the first article published (Aaltonen et al, Bone 2020). A control
      group was recruited for validation of the PET-method.

      All participants undergo a 18F-PET-TT scan. PET, with the short half-life bone seeking
      18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF), provide an unique way of assessment of regional bone
      metabolism. 18F-NaF binds to sights of new bone formation and serves as a marker of bone
      blood flow and osteoblastic activity. A dynamic 18F-PET-TT imaging is first done of the
      lumbar region of the spine, following with a static PET-TT and also measurement of
      calcification score using PET-TT. 18F-NaF is injected intravenously by direct venipuncture or
      intravenous catheter. All the patients are also asked for permission to use DNA-samples if
      needed.

      Blood tests measuring the bone formation and turnover will be taken during the normal
      clinical controls of the patients or at the latest wheb the bone biopsy is takekn.
      Echocardiogram, which is reasonable sensitive, is done to detect and evaluate valvular
      calcification. Bone biopsy is done in the day care unit within one month from the PET-scan.
      To obtain information about dynamic parameters of the bone, the patients had double labeling
      with tetracycline. The biopsy is taken in local anesthesia from the anterior iliac spine
      vertically.
