      You will come to the urology clinic for 1 visit. At this visit, a video urodynamics test will
      be performed. The urodynamics test is used to check bladder and urinary function using
      pressure and volume measurements with x-ray images.

      Pressure-monitoring catheters will be inserted into your bladder and rectum, and your bladder
      function will be checked as the bladder is slowly filled with fluid. Measurements will then
      be made of your bladder capacity (the volume of urine the bladder can hold), bladder and
      abdominal (stomach) pressures, and bladder compliance (the bladder's ability to hold urine)
      throughout the course of this study. This procedure will take about 90 minutes to complete.

      After the urodynamics test is completed, you will complete a questionnaire about your urinary
      function and your quality-of-life (regarding daily living after surgical treatment for
      prostate cancer). The questionnaire will take about 30 minutes to complete.

      If you have had urodynamic testing with Dr. Westney within the past year, we would like your
      consent to use the data from that test, and also for completion of the questionnaire
      mentioned in the previous paragraph. You will complete this informed consent and
      questionnaire being sent with a return envelope and will not need to come to the urology
      clinic for a visit.

      Length of Study:

      Once you have completed the urodynamics testing and questionnaire, your participation on this
      study is complete.

      This is an investigational study. The video urodynamics test is approved by the FDA and
      commercially available. Up to 50 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled
      at M. D. Anderson.
