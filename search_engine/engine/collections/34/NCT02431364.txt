    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, sequential, dose-escalation, Phase 1 trial to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of verdinexor. Verdinexor or placebo will be given on Days 1 and
      3 to healthy adult participants.

      Cohorts of 8 participants each (6 active, 2 placebo) will be sequentially administered
      verdinexor or placebo (one dose on Day 1 and one dose on Day 3) using a dose-escalation
      scheme. A conservative, sequential, dose-escalation strategy employing decreasing escalation
      increments will be used.
