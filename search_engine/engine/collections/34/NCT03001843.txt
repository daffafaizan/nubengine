      bypass surgery. The methods of intraoperative anesthesiology will be Ketamine or Narcotic.
      Both are FDA approved methods of delivering anesthesia.

      The amount of narcotics a patient receives is part of the medical record post-operatively
      will be followed from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) through to discharge. The amount of
      narcotics needed to control the patient's pain (converted to morphine equivalent units) and
      pain scores (a hospital standard measure) will be collected for 48 hours for the study, or
      until discharge, whichever occurs sooner. The conversion to a morphine equivalent unit allows
      investigators to compare different narcotics the patient may receive in a more standardized
      way. The results will be analyzed and compared between the two groups.
