      study will start with a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period based on diet and
      exercise interventions for screening eligible subjects. After run-in, eligibility is
      confirmed with required laboratory tests at Day -1 prior to randomization. The eligible
      subjects are randomly assigned to CVI-LM001 100 mg, 200 mg, 300mg QD group or placebo QD
      group with ratio 1:1:1:1 to receive a 12-week double-blind treatment. After 12-week
      treatment, all investigational compound and placebo should be discontinued, followed by 4
      week for safety evaluation.
