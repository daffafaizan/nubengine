      determining whether the operation is successful is based on the Miami principle. That means
      The PTH hormone decreased to 30% of the baseline level after 15min after the tumor was
      removed. However, due to the differences in PTH monitoring conditions in various hospitals,
      many hospitals cannot perform rapid PTH monitoring in the operation. Therefore many doctors
      choose rapid freezing pathology to confirm the lesion., This also led to the inability to
      evaluate PTH in the presence of multiple lesions,and resulting in the need for reoperations.
