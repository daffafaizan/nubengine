      be enrolled and treated with three trials of COS plus IUI. All patients will be randomly
      allocated into two different groups (groups A and B). In group A, COS will be obtained using
      the same ovulatory agent (CC or metformin) employed in the previous ovulatory cycles, whereas
      in group B using gonadotropins in a low-dose step-up regimen.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the clinical and reproductive
      outcomes, and the adverse experience will be evaluated and the will be analyzed also
      categorizing the patients according to ovulatory agent used for COS (CC or metformin).

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant. Continuous variables will be analyzed with the unpaired t
      test and general linear model for repeated measures analysis with Bonferroni test for the
      post-hoc analysis as required. For categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square and Fisher's
      exact tests will be used. Cumulative pregnancy rate, our primary end-point, will be
      calculated by the Kaplan-Maier method, and the differences between the two groups will be
      assessed with the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards model will be used to calculate the
      hazard ratio for new pregnancy in both groups.
