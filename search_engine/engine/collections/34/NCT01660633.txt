      Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Spectrum), which licensed the Melphalan HC1 for Injection (Propylene
      Glycol-Free) product from Ligand Pharmaceuticals , formerly CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
      (CyDex). This new injectable form of melphalan HCL incorporates Captisol®, β cyclodextrin
      sulfobutyl ether sodium salts (also known as [SBE]7m-β-CD), into the product. Captisol is
      present to facilitate the use of an all aqueous diluent (normal saline) for reconstitution
      and administration of the freeze-dried product in place of the propylene glycol-ethanol
      diluent necessary for the currently used melphalan intravenous product. Captisol provides for
      solubilization and improved stability of the all aqueous reconstituted and diluted infusion
      solution.

      This is the second of two studies supporting product registration. This study will be a
      multicenter study of high-dose Melphalan HCL for Injection (Propylene Glycol-Free) conducted
      in 60 patients who have symptomatic MM and qualify for autologous stem cell transplantation
      (ASCT).

      During the Study Period, patients will receive 100mg/m2 of either Melphalan HCL for Injection
      (Propylene Glycol-Free) on Day -3 and on Day -2 for a total dose of 200mg/m2. Blood samples
      (5 timepoints post infusion) for population pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be withdrawn
      through an indwelling i.v. cannula on the first day of administration of melphalan (Day -3)
      for all patients and then additional blood samples (2 timepoints post infusion) drawn in a
      subset of patients on the second day of melphalan administration (Day -2).

      Following one day of rest after the high dose myeloablative conditioning (Day -1), patients
      will receive an autologous graft (Day 0).
