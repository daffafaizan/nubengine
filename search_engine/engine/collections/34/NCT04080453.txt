    
      Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to
      infection which can lead to many failures of vital organs (kidneys, lungs, liver) in
      critically ill patients. It is accompanied at an early phase by both a proinflammatory and
      procoagulant state generating many platelet activators. Given their essential role in the
      inflammatory response, a dysregulation of platelets activation may be one of the contributors
      to tissue damage. To determine if platelet activation contribute to deregulation of the
      inflammatory response of the host in sepsis, the main objective of this study is to compare
      platelet activation markers levels of patients with septic shock and after major surgery.
      Plasma concentration in CD154, beta thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, platelet
      microparticles, soluble CD62, RANTES, GRO-alpha, HMGB-1, monocyte Dnases signal, circulating
      free DNA and DNase1 and DNase1L3 activities will be studied and compared at inclusion (Day
      0), Day 1 and Day 5.
