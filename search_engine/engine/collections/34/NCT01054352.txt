    
      A four-part, single and multiple dose study to investigate the safety of JNJ-38224342 versus
      placebo in healthy patients and in patients with seasonal allergies. Volunteers (or patients)
      are randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups or Parts. Part 1 and 2 are randomized
      (study drug will be assigned by chance) and double-blind (neither the physician nor volunteer
      knows the identity of the assigned drug). In Part 1 patients receive a single oral dose of
      either 25, 100, 300, 600, 1250 or 2000 mg of JNJ-38224342 or placebo. In Part 2 patients
      receive multiple oral doses of either 100, 250, 500 or 700 mg of JNJ-38224342 or placebo
      administered over 14 days. Part 3 (for male volunteers only) is open-label (all people
      involved know the identity of the assigned drug), 2-period crossover (meaning that volunteers
      will receive both treatments at different times) study of the effects of food on
      JNJ-38224342. Participants will be given a single 100 mg oral dose (either solution or
      capsule formulation). Part 4 is for patients with seasonal allergies only. The dose of
      JNJ-38224342 will be determined based on information collected in Parts 1 - 3. Patients that
      participate in part 4 of the study will also have their nasal passage flushed out with salt
      water and the contents will be collected. Patients will be asked to remain in the clinic for
      either 5 days or 18 days depending on what part of the study they are participating in. A
      physical exam will be performed and a medical history collected. Safety evaluations include
      adverse event monitoring, blood pressure measurements, ECG and lab work requiring blood and
      urine samples at various time points throughout the study. Single oral dose of either 25,
      100, 300, 600, 1250 or 2000mg of JNJ-38224342 or placebo; Multiple oral dose of either 100,
      250, 500 or 700 mg of JNJ-38224342 or placebo administered over 14 days; single oral 100mg
      dose of JNJ 38224342 as a solution versus capsule with or without food; multiple oral doses
      of JNJ38224342 or placebo administered for up to 14 days where the number of days dosed,
      actual dose levels, food requirements will be determined based on the data from Parts 1, 2,
      and 3
