      relapsed malignancies after allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation and who are not eligible for other FHCRC protocols.

      OUTLINE: Patients with rapidly progressive disease receive reinduction chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy prior to study therapy. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) begin after recovery
      from chemotherapy or sooner, if clinically indicated. Patients receive 1 or more DLI from the
      original donor. Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, then every 3-6 months for 9
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An unlimited number of patients will be accrued for this study.
