      decision aid tool is justifiable and feasible and to optimise its design. Specific objectives
      are as follows:

        1. To examine the effect of the DAT on decisional conflict regarding disclosure both
           immediately and at 3 months post first use.

        2. To collect data to inform sample size calculations for the primary outcome measures for
           use in a future full scale trial(gaining employment and workplace accommodations).

        3. To test study procedures, including the sample that can be drawn using the inclusion and
           exclusion criteria; the full time equivalent needed for research assistants to recruit
           sufficient numbers and carry out the study procedures in the time available; and whether
           the measure leads to too much respondent burden.

        4. To pilot the use of a questionnaire on employment and disclosure related activities.

        5. To test the selected randomisation method, in this case individual level randomisation,
           including the methods for avoiding and measuring contamination.

        6. To pilot recruitment and retention methods for service users and vocational specialists.

        7. To estimate effect sizes and their confidence intervals for employment related
           activities (proxy outcome measures for gaining employment and workplace accommodations),
           in order to determine whether a full scale trial is justified.

        8. To modify the conceptual model
