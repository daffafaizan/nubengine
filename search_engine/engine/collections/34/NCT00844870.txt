      scale (RPS), but the trunk -stabilized group led to more significant changes. Training under
      less restrictive conditions associated with Task-Related Training (TRT) (auditory feedback
      from trunk sensor) as compared to stabilized TRT, led to improved functional and impairment
      measure scores (WMFT, FM and shoulder flexion). Conclusion: Fading feedback with both
      training methods, during extended TRT reaching/grasping practice generally led to some
      improvements. However, as demonstrated by impairment and functional outcome measures, using
      TRT with an auditory feedback signals is a more effective approach than forcing the
      stabilization of the trunk during rehabilitation of the upper-limb.
