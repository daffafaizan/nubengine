    
      Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal dominantly inherited neurological disorders,
      characterized by a predominant atrophy of the cerebellum and the brainstem. The most common
      forms are caused by abnormal CAG repeat expansions, encoding elongated polyglutamine (polyQ).

      Nowadays, no preventive or curative treatments are available but different therapeutic
      approaches are ongoing. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) therapy showed promising results in
      Huntington disease (HD), a disease that shares with the SCAs the same mutational mechanism.
      ASOs are currently under development for SCAs.

      However, in SCAs, clinical scales as an only criteria to monitor a treatment are not
      appropriate because of the lack of sensitivity of change and the small number of patients
      available. The importance to dispose of outcome measures to inform about the efficacy of a
      treatment is fundamental as well as of new alternative designs to conduct a clinical trial in
      rare diseases with small sample sizes.

      A comprehensive, multimodal approach is hence needed to provide a translational and
      integrated overview of cerebellar dysfunction in polyQ SCAs over a year.
