      for these injuries at most centers in North America, includes a progressive algorithm of
      epidural anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy. Surgical management of flail
      chest injuries has previously been reserved for refractory cases unable to wean from
      mechanical ventilation or severe chest wall instability. However, the use of surgical
      stabilization of multiple rib fractures has demonstrated substantial improvements in ICU
      length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and the incidences of pneumonia,
      tracheotomy, and reintubation. These results have been reported in small cases series without
      prospective or randomized trial designs.
