    
      • Principal Objective : Investigate the association between obstructive sleep apnea diagnosed
      and hemispheric ischemic stroke

      • Secondary Objective :

      Evaluate the relation between obstructive sleep apnea and:

        -  stroke mechanisms

        -  stroke prognosis

        -  post-stroke tolerance to CPAP treatment.

             -  Study design :

      Prospective case-control study

      • Inclusion criteria :

      Patients (150):

      Fist ischaemic hemispheric stroke or TIA Age: 50 to 90 French native speaker Able to answer
      the questions

      Controls (600):

      Age: 50 to 90 French native speaker Able to answer the questions

      • Exclusion criteria : Patients Haemorrhagic stroke Stroke of the brainstem Past medical
      history of ischaemic stroke Dementia Confusion Unable to give his informed consent

      Controls:

      Past medical history of ischaemic stroke Dementia Confusion Unable to give his informed
      consent

      • Study plan: Cases will be recruited in the stroke unit of the Pr Orgogozo at the Bordeaux
      University hospital. After verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria Berlin scale will
      be measured. A polygraphic study will be performed to patients with a Berlin scale > 2.
      Patients stroke characteristics will be recorded (initial severity, stroke mechanism) at
      baseline and stroke outcome will be evaluated at 3 months (stroke recurrence and functional
      outcome).

      Controls will be recruited among sex and age matched patients hospitalized at the
      Bordeaux-University hospital for investigation of non-vascular disorder. After verification
      of inclusion and exclusion criteria Berlin scale will be measured. A polygraphic study will
      be performed to subjects with a Berlin scale > 2. Controls will be evaluated at 3 months
      using a phone interview

      • Number of subjects : 150 cases and 600 controls
