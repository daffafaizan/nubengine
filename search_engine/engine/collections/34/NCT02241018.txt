      several hematological disorders. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and
      treatment of side effects associated with transplantation, aGVHDremains a common and
      life-threatening complication with poor prognosis. Corticosteroids are still acted as the
      first-line treatments of aGVHD, with a response rate of 50-80. However, those who failed to
      initial therapy only have 10-30% long-term survival.

      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be
      isolated from many tissues, such as bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Such
      cells possess the capacity to suppress immunological responses, support hematopoiesis and
      repair tissues. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly for preventing and
      treating GVHD. Although the results are still controversy, most prospective and retrospective
      data suggest that MSCs are effective to aGVHD.

      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors combined with CD25 monoclonal
      antibody and calcineurin inhibitors in treating patients with aGVHD.
