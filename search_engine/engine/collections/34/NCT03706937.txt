      autonomy and user participation through strategies designed to strengthen the patient's
      empowerment. [SNS 2018-2022, Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé] The 2014-2019 Cancer
      Plan calls for the systematic support of smokers during smoking cessation. This means that
      health workers need to be trained to help with smoking cessation, as well as the motivational
      attitude that reinforces the patient's smoker's self-esteem as well as his desire to off-load
      this addiction. [Perriot, Underner, Peiffer, Dautzenberg, 2018] It is recommended that these
      interventions be included from the beginning of the management, once the diagnosis of Cancer
      is made. It seems legitimate then to wonder about the place of choice the Motivational
      Interview (EM) could have in the course of cancer care, for the management of addictions
      during the treatment of cancer. We therefore wish to carry out descriptive qualitative
      research in the Lucien Neuwirth Oncology Institute in order to try to define the management
      of addictions in the oncology care course. Thus, an approach in terms of social
      representations among paramedical professional actors involved in the care of patients
      treated for cancer and with an unresolved addictive disorder sounds the best way for this
      research.
