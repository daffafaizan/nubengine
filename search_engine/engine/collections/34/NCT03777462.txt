      chemotherapy plus SBRT results in better outcomes compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      alone and also compare the efficacy of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel with SBRT and S-1 plus
      nab-paclitaxel with SBRT. It is known that neoadjuvant therapy is vital for improved
      survival, which has been confirmed in previous studies that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or
      without radiotherapy provides superior overall compared with upfront surgery. However,
      question of whether the addition of radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve
      prognosis compared with chemotherapy alone is a challenging matter. Also, no studies have
      evaluated the efficacy of S-1 as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for BRPC albeit similar
      prognosis has been found between S-1 and gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer. In this
      trial, patients with biopsy and radiographically confirmed BRPC will be randomly allocated
      into three groups: neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus
      nab-paclitaxel with SBRT and neoadjuvant S-1 plus nab-paclitaxel with SBRT. Surgical
      resection will be performed 3 weeks after SBRT. The primary endpoint is overall survival. The
      secondary outcomes are progression free survival, pathological complete response rate, R0
      resection rate and incidence of adverse effects. If results show the survival benefits of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus SBRT and similar outcomes between S-1 and gemcitabine, it may
      provide evidence of clinical practice of this modality for BRPC.
