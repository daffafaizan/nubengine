      chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer, we have to investigate possible therapeutic
      options after AG regimen. In this single arm, open-label clinical trial, metastatic
      pancreatic cancer patients will be received apatinib, irinotecan and S-1. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks until the disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, death or begin a novel
      therapeutic.

      The efficacy and safety data will be assessed through PFS, OS, ORR and adverse effects as
      graded by CTC-AE 5.0.
