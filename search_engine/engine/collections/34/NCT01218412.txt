      for application of Motivational Interviewing (MI) for physical activity (PA),
      web-applications for PA promotion, web-based MI for behavior change, and finally web-based MI
      for PA. Based on collective findings in these areas of inquiry, it is necessary to
      investigate the efficacy of MI as a method that lends readily to practical applications for
      PA promotion. The current study seeks to investigate whether web-based MI can be applied in
      an adult population to enhance PA participation using a physician referral scheme.
      Additionally, mechanisms of behavior change are considered in order to inform future research
      and intervention.
