      verified mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) course will improve the ability for
      subjects to concentrate on the control of the SMR thus improving the performance of BCI.
      Subjects will be recruited for short term MBAT and then undergo BCI training. The performance
      of subjects with MBAT will be compared with those without MBAT to test the hypothesis.
      Procedures involved include a standard 8-week MBSR course, and an EEG brain noninvasive brain
      computer interface study.
