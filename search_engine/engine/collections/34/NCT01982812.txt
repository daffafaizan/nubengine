      Antimalarial medications can rapidly clear P. falciparum parasites, but mortality rates
      remain high (12-25%). Survivors do not escape unscathed--~30% experience neurologic sequelae
      including epilepsy, behavioral disorders and gross neurologic deficits. Acute seizures occur
      commonly in CM and are associated with higher neurologic morbidity and mortality. Seizure
      management in malaria endemic regions is challenging because the available antiepileptic
      drugs (AED) induce respiratory suppression and assisted ventilation is unavailable. More
      optimal seizure control may improve neurologic outcomes in pediatric CM survivors, especially
      if the medication used is affordable and can be delivered safely and easily in resource
      limited settings. The investigators conducted a dose- escalation study detailed elsewhere
      (NCT01660672) to determine the optimal dose for use in this safety and feasibility study of
      enteral levetiracetam (LVT) for seizure control in children with CM and seizures admitted to
      Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Enteral LVT given via nasogastric tube
      (NGT) rather than an intravenous (IV) formulation will be used since LVT has excellent
      enteral bioavailability and IV formations are not affordable in most malaria-endemic regions.
      LVT 40mg/kg followed by 30mg per kg Q12 hourly. Children admitted with cerebral malaria and
      seizures will be randomized to LVT vs. standard of care with phenobarbital as needed
      comparing seizure control, safety, and neurological outcomes.
