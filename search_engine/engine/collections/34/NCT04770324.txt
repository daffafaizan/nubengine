      All patients shall be indicated for glaucoma surgery alone (not combined with cataract), and
      will undergo incisional glaucoma therapy, including a novel simplified surgical technique
      allowing placement of 2 interposition supraciliary permanent devices.

      Several patient data like IOP, visual capacity or associated pharmacological treatments will
      be recorded pre and post-operatively all along the follow-up.

      Purpose is to ensure device safety, and verify IOP and associated pharmacological treatment
      reduction after surgery, and evolution along follow-up.
