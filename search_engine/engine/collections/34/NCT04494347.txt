      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have an indication for oral anticoagulation
      to reduce stroke risk but who also have a rational to seek an alternative to long-term
      anticoagulation (e.g., recurrent bleeding, fall risk). Transcatheter mitral valve repair with
      the MitraClip device is approved by the FDA for patients with severe degenerative mitral
      regurgitation who are deemed to be at high-risk for valve surgery and patients with severe
      secondary MR despite optimal medical therapy. It is also anticipated that the device will
      soon be approved for patients with severe symptomatic functional mitral regurgitation based
      on the results of the COAPT trials. Atrial fibrillation is common in patients referred for
      TMVr. A recent study from the Mayo Clinic documented that up to 50% of patients undergoing
      TMVr might qualify for LAA based on their risk assessment. Both procedures are performed via
      a large bore femoral venous access, and utilize transseptal puncture, general anesthesia, and
      transesophageal echo guidance. Hence, combining the two procedures in one session might
      provide incremental benefit to those patients by avoiding the risk of repeated large-bore
      access, transseptal puncture, and general anesthesia. A limited number of case reports
      illustrated the safety and feasibility of a combined TMVr with LAAO when clinically
      indicated. Experience with combined TMVr/LAAO in the United States is limited, mostly due to
      the lack of supportive data and concerns about the incremental cost of the Watchman device
      that might not be covered by the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) per current guidelines.
