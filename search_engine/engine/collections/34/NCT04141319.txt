      blinded-endpoint clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that the addition of
      ketorolac to pre-emptive scalp infiltration analgesia can significantly improve analgesia
      after craniotomies. One hundred participants will be randomized to the ketorolac group or the
      control group. Patients in the ketorolac group will receive pre-emptive scalp infiltration
      with opivacaine,ketorolac and epinephrine while patients in the control group will receive
      pre-emptive scalp infiltration with ropivacaine and epinephrine.The primary outcome measure
      will be cumulative doses of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) butorphanol consumption from 0
      to 48 h postoperatively.
