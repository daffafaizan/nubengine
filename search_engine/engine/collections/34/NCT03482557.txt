      Unfortunately, mammography does not work as well in women who have dense breast tissue or who
      are at high-risk for breast cancer. In these women, breast MRI is also used to help find
      breast cancers.

      Contrast enhanced mammography is a new type of mammogram. It uses contrast material combined
      with the mammogram to highlight areas that might be breast cancer and that could be missed on
      the mammogram alone. This is similar to breast MRI.

      For this study, participants who are already getting a breast biopsy will have a contrast
      enhanced mammogram and a breast MRI before the biopsy. The participant's contrast enhanced
      mammogram and breast MRI images will then be included within a large collection of images.
      Radiologists will compare the images to see if the contrast enhanced mammograms and the
      breast MRI find the same number of breast cancers. If the investigators find they perform
      similarly, then contrast mammography may be used to aid in breast cancer screening in the
      future.
