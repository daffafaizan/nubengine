      compared with preoperative immunonutrition in patients underwent colorectal surgery (Braga M,
      Gianotti L, Vignali A, Carlo VD. Preoperative oral arginine and n-3 fatty acid
      supplementation improves the immunometabolic host response and outcome after colorectal
      resection for cancer. Surgery. 2002; 132:805-14, PMID: 12464864). Object of this study is to
      investigate the additional effects of perioperative immunonutrition on cell-mediated immunity
      and incidence of infectious complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
