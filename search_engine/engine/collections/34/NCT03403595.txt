      membrane antigen (PSMA), is a surface molecule specifically expressed by prostate tumors
      which was shown to be a valid target for radiotherapy. 177Lu-PSMA-617, a urea-based compound,
      provide an effective target for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer. However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-PSMA-617 has been its short
      half-life and fast rate of clearance. This study was designed to investigate the safety,
      dosimetry and preliminary effects of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.
