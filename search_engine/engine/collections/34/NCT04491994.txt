      progression of Mild Covid-19 patients and decreasing viral load.

      Participants of study will be randomized 2:1 to receive either Active drug or standard of
      care (SOC) treatment respectively. We aim to demonstrate reduced COVID-19 progression and
      early viral clearance in individuals on HCQ therapy.
