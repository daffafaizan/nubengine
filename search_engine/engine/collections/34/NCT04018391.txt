      associated with worse adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). A task-shifted intervention
      for depression and ART adherence, suitable for delivery by non-specialists, could make a
      critical difference to the health and survival of people managing the challenges of HIV
      treatment in Zimbabwe. The TENDAI trial is a two-arm randomized controlled trial of an
      intervention for people on ART with viral non-suppression and clinically significant
      depression. It will be delivered at an HIV clinic in Marondera. TENDAI is a collaboration
      between the Department of Psychiatry, University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences,
      King's College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (London UK), and
      the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School.
