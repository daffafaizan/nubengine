      cardiovascular consequences in elderly Veterans. Positive airway pressure therapy is deemed
      cumbersome and often associated with non-adherence to therapy. This proposal will investigate
      whether alternative therapies can be developed by modulating specific physiologic mechanisms
      of ventilatory control. Specifically, the investigators will study whether interventions with
      sustained hyperoxia (Aim 1), finasteride (Aim 2) and acetazolamide (Aim 3) will reduce
      breathing instability during sleep by reducing chemoresponsiveness and/or increasing
      cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in order to alleviate sleep disordered breathing in the
      elderly with sleep apnea. The proposed aims will also allow us to delineate key mechanisms of
      breathing instability in the elderly. The investigators envision that the results obtained
      from this project will ultimately allow us to develop novel alternative therapies for sleep
      apnea in the elderly. We will also compare CVR in young vs older adults
