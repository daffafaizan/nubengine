    
      Non-inferiority trial comparing Propofol versus placebo during the intra tracheal Less
      Invasive Surfactant Administration (LISA) in preterm babies < 32 weeks of gestation for the
      need for mechanical ventilation after the procedure. An open-label ketamine treatment as
      rescue is possible in each group.

      In each participating unit, information will be given to parents of preterm babies <32 wGA
      upon their admission to the delivery room or to the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), and
      informed consent will be sought as soon as possible. Eligible babies presenting a RDS
      (respiratory distress syndrome) will be included and randomized to the control (placebo)
      group or Propofol group. While benefiting from Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure
      Ventilation (NIPPV) the newborn will be prepared as usual for tracheal intubation. Trialists
      will be blinded to treatment allocation.

      The drug administration in the two groups will be titrated according to weight (0.5mg/kg per
      dose of Propofol or a similar volume of placebo). After each dose, a pain score (FANS) will
      be quickly evaluated within 2 minutes of the injection, to assess the need for a
      supplementary dose (up to a predefined limit) or rescue treatment by Ketamine.

      After the steps of sedation, the LISA procedure will be performed, with detailed data
      collection of per procedure events up to 72 hours of life. Babies will be subsequently
      managed as usual in each NICU and data will be collected about respiratory, neurological and
      hemodynamic outcomes during the hospital stay, and especially at discharge, 28 days, and 36
      weeks. At two years of corrected age, a final examination will be performed to evaluate
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.
