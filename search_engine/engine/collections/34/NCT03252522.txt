    
      This study examines a broad spectrum micronutrient treatment for children with ADHD. The goal
      is to broaden the scope of evidence-based treatments, and to address the public desire for
      non-pharmacological treatment options. This study will use a randomized controlled trial
      design, comparing micronutrients with placebo in 135 children, ages 6-12, with ADHD plus
      irritability or anger based on parent-report of symptoms. The study will also collect
      biological samples (saliva, stool, urine, hair, and blood) from the children to examine
      physiological mechanisms of micronutrient effects. If the micronutrient treatment
      successfully diminishes symptoms, the clinical implication is to offer this as a legitimate
      non-pharmacological alternative to stimulant medication.
