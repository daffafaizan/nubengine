      method. Pregabalin group received capsule Pregabalin 150mg and Placebo group were given
      Vitamin B capsule 1 hour prior to surgery.

      All patients underwent endoscopic myringoplasty with tragal cartilage and perichondrium
      graft. Surgical procedure was done under local anesthesia. 5ml of 2% xylocaine with
      1:2,00,000 adrenalin was infiltrated in the four quadrants of external ear canal and on
      tragus. Around 2cm incision was given on canal surface of tragus and around 2cm x 1.5cm
      cartilage- perichondrium graft was obtained. The skin was closed with 4/0 prolene interrupted
      suture. Using rigid Hopkins II 0-degree endoscope (Karl Storz) with 4-millimeter diameter and
      18 centimeters in length, margin of perforation was refreshed. Gelatin sponge was kept in the
      middle ear and cartilage perichondrium graft placed. Canal was then packed with gelatin
      soaked in ciprofloxacin ear drops followed by ribbon pack medicated with soframycin. Small
      dressing was applied over it.

      Post-operative pain severity was assessed with VAS scale at 6, 12, 24, 48 hours. Rescue
      analgesia is given with Injection Ketorolac (30mg IV) or Tab Flexon (Ibuprofen 400mg +
      Paracetamol 500mg) whenever the patient required.
