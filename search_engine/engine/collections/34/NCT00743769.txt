      model.The authors demonstrated that systemic Tβ4 treatment (intraperitoneal, intracardiac, or
      i.p. plus intracardiac) every third day enhanced early myocyte survival and significantly
      improved cardiac function. Several weeks after the heart attack, it was evident that mice
      treated with Tβ4 had less muscle damage and stronger hearts compared with mice treated with
      placebo. Specifically, Tβ4 treatment significantly improved fractional shortening by about
      60% and ejection fraction by about 100% and myocardial salvage by about 53% when compared
      with controls.
