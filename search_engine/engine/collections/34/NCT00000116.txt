    
      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal degenerations with a worldwide
      prevalence of approximately 1 in 4,000. Patients typically report night blindness and
      difficulty with midperipheral visual field in adolescence. As the condition progresses, they
      lose far peripheral visual field. Most patients have reductions in central vision by age 50
      to 80 years. Based on electroretinograms (ERGs), the course of the disease can be slowed on
      average among adults on 15,000 IU/day of vitamin A palmitate. While conducting the trial on
      the effects of vitamin A on RP, it became apparent that another substance in the diet could
      be affecting the course of the disease. This prompted the present randomized, controlled
      trial.

      This study is a randomized, controlled, double-masked trial with a planned duration of 5
      years. Patients with the common forms of RP are assigned to either a test or a control group.
      All receive 15,000 IU/day of vitamin A palmitate in addition to the capsules under study.
      Participants will not know the contents of the supplement or the group to which they have
      been assigned until the end of the trial. The main outcome measurement is the total point
      score on the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA). In addition, computer-averaged 30-Hz cone ERG
      amplitudes and visual acuity are measured annually.
