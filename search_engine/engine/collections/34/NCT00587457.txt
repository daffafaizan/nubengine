      and anti-neoplastic activity of CAT-8015 in relapsed or refractory participants with CLL,
      PLL, or SLL. Participants in the initial dose cohort were to receive CAT-8015 at a dose of 5
      microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg) CAT-8015, increasing to 10 mcg/kg in the second dose cohort,
      and then increasing by 10 mcg/kg increments in subsequent cohorts (that is, to doses of 20,
      30, 40, 50, 60 mcg/kg, etc) until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. Following
      identification of the MTD, the MTD cohort was to be expanded to 16 participants.
