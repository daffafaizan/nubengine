      rTMS 5 days per week for 4 consecutive weeks (a total of 20 sessions) as an add-on to their
      current antidepressant regime. Adolescents must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.
      We will monitor for depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation over the 4 weeks as well as 1
      week following the last rTMS administration using rating scales. These scales will be given
      once a week, on Fridays, and will require roughly 40 minutes to complete. TMS sessions will
      last approximately 25 minutes each.
