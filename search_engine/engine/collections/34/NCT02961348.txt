      recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but the optimal time point to
      start after an acute ischemic stroke is not known.

      The intervention in this study will be timing of treatment onset. The choice of NOAC (i.e.
      apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban or rivaroxaban) after the acute ischemic stroke is at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      This study will use the Swedish Stroke Register for enrolment, randomization and follow-up,
      with additional data linkage from other mandatory national registers. Primary outcome will be
      assessed at 90 days and secondary outcomes (including all-cause mortality and health economic
      analyses) and will be assessed at 90 days and up to one year after the index ischemic stroke.
