      different respiratory diseases. To further examine differences in disease and health, and
      between diseases SLP measurements will be recorded in a range of diagnostic conditions that
      effect breathing and in healthy normal subjects.

      This is a non-randomised observational study to validate Structured Light Plethysmography in
      two groups of participants: those with Respiratory condition such as COPD and a normal
      healthy group. Neither group will receive any clinical intervention. SLP data capture and
      spirometry (as part of the patients clinical care) will be performed by the patients. The
      data collected from this study will allow examination of different breathing patterns between
      patients with different diseases, to compare breathing patterns in patients to those in
      healthy individuals, and to compare breathing patterns within a healthy population.
