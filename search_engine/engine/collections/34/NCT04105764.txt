      in laparoscopic surgery [6,7,8,9]. However, it is unknown whether deep NMB improves
      postoperative QOR in ambulatory gynecological laparoscopy.

      Therefore, we designed a double blind randomised trial to compare the effects of deep and
      moderate NMB on postoperative QOR in ambulatory gynecological laparoscopic surgery. We
      hypothesized that deep NMB improves postoperative QOR, compared to moderate NMB. The primary
      outcome was postoperative QOR in POD1. The secondary outcome was quality of surgical
      conditions, pain scores, time to meet PACU and hospital discharge, and opioid consumption
