    
      30 patients with milk allergy (at least 18 year olds), 30 patients with peanut allergy and 30
      patients with egg allergy are treated with OIT. The diagnosis of food allergy is verified
      with positive history, skin prick test, egg and milk allergen specific IgE antibodies. In
      addition, food allergy is verified with an open label (milk allergy) or blind (peanut and egg
      allergy) allergen specific challenge test. Quality of life, anxiety and patient history data
      is collected by questionnaires. All the patients undergo a spirometry with a bronchodilatator
      test, exhaled nitric oxide test and a methacholine challenge before and a year after oral
      immunotherapy. All the patients undergoing oral immunotherapy are prescribed with emergency
      medication such as antihistamine tablets, prednisolon tablets (40mg for three days in
      adults), epinephrine autoinjector (300 Âµg per dose) and salbutamol or terbutaline inhalator.
