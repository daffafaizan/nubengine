      women undergoing surgery for bunion, and 10 controls. Surgery will implant hardware to fuse
      (stabilize) the arch. Methods will evaluate the patient's problems associated with bunion and
      satisfaction with surgery, and assess the effectiveness of surgery in reducing motion of the
      arch. The hypotheses are that patients treated with surgery will demonstrate improvement in
      function, and that surgery will reduce motion of the arch postoperatively (posttest measures
      acquired 6 months after surgery), and in comparison to measures taken on a control group.

      The data collected will come from a comprehensive examination. Methods will include the
      measurement of arch motion made by an examiner using a device and a fluoroscopic gait
      examination procedure, and completion of two medical questionnaires. The fluoroscopic
      acquisition of the digital images will be analyzed across the specified time dimensions of
      the gait cycle.

      Device and fluoroscopy of measures of arch motion will be made at 2 time points on patients
      enrolled in this study: presurgery (baseline) and 6 months postsurgery. The questionnaire
      measurements of self-reported pain and function will be made at 4 time points: presurgery
      (baseline) and again at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postsurgery. Outcome measurements
      will be collected on control subjects at one time point only, on the day of their enrollment
      into the study.

      Prospective studies have not characterized outcomes in patients receiving this type surgical
      fusion as part of the corrective treatment for bunion. Results have potential to improve
      surgical treatment outcomes and, improve upon the current methods of fluoroscopic motion
      analysis.
