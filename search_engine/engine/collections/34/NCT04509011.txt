      total thyroidectomy. The rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism in quality registries are in
      the range of is 5-7 percent of patients undergoing surgery.

      Patients operated on benign disease with total thyroidectomy, and who suffer from permanent
      hypoparathyroidism (defined as medication with active Vitamin D analogue therapy for more
      than 6 months, are at increased risk of renal insufficiency. They also have, for unclear
      reasons, an increased risk of suffering from malignancy, compared to patients without this
      complication. Patients with known ischemic heart disease before surgery also have an
      increased risk of suffering a new episode of cardiovascular disease. Finally, patients with
      permanent hypoparathyroidism have an increased risk of mortality compared to patients without
      this complication.

      If, by using a technique for autofluorescence (Fluobeam® -LX), one can more accurately
      identify and avoid damage to the parathyroid glands during the surgical procedure, this would
      be of great importance for patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for thyroid disease.

      Patients undergoing total thyroidectomy are randomized to the use of Fluobeam® -LX to detect
      the parathyroid glands through autofluorescence during thyroid surgery, or clinical
      evaluation only (control). Outcome is evaluated by parathyroid hormon (PTH) levels the first
      postoperative day and the need for medication with calcium and Vitamin D up to 6 months
      postoperatively.
