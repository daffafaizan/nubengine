      that is below the minimum needed to absorb nutrients and fluids required for adequate
      homeostasis. There are limited data regarding the optimal choice for oral rehydration in the
      setting of SBS that can maximize fluid absorption in the setting of diarrhea with limited
      intestinal absorptive surface area. The investigators propose a preliminary open label single
      center study assessing tolerability and palatability of enterade® ( an amino acid (AA) based
      oral rehydrating solution (ORS)) and compare to baseline. Eligible patients with SBS will
      participate in a 14-day trial monitoring and measuring tolerability and palatability of an
      AA-ORS, enterade®, in addition to their regular diet.
