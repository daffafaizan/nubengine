      sleep, and metabolic parameters in healthy, moderately obese women (BMI 28-35 kg/m2). We will
      look at 2 populations of women, one with normal glucose metabolism and one with impaired
      glucose homeostasis (IGH)--either impaired fasting glucose (IFG, fasting glucose 101-125
      mg/dL) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, glucose 140-199 mg/dL 2h after a 75g oral glucose
      load). This is a randomized, double blind, crossover study with two 16-week treatment periods
      separated by a 3-week washout period. There are 19 study visits over 35 weeks.

      The goals of this study are 1) to examine the effect of exenatide on body weight and
      dysglycemia in populations in which this medication has not been studied, namely obese women
      with and without IGH and 2) to investigate possible mechanisms of weight loss through
      measurements of energy expenditure, hunger, satiety, nausea, and sleep.

      The primary outcome of this study is weight loss. We will calculate absolute and relative
      change in body weight from baseline to week 16 (the first treatment period) and from week 19
      to week 35 (the second treatment period). Body weight will be measured at every study visit
      which will also allow us to assess the absolute and relative change from baseline throughout
      the entire study.
