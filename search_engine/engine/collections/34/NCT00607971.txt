      renzapride will be prescribed and used by patients on a daily basis for long periods of time.
      Hence the need to understand its long-term safety and tolerability in the target population.
      This study is open label and so all subjects will take renzapride and will know that they are
      taking it. Enrolment in to this study is restricted to subjects completing a 12-week,
      placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of renzapride in providing relief from IBS-C
      (Study no. ATL1251/038/CL).
