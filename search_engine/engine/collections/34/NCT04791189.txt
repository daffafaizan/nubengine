    
      This study is non-interventional, multi-centre and does not change current practice.

      It will begin with the construction in a multidisciplinary team of two "needs assessment"
      questionnaires, the first for adult patients who have suffered from JIA, the second for their
      parents.

      They will be drawn up by three sexologists, two rheumatologists, a pediatrician, a nurse from
      UTEP, a biostatistician, a statistician specializing in questionnaire metrology, two patients
      with JIA, two parents of JIA patients, and the Director of the ANDAR patient association.

      These "needs assessment" questionnaires, entirely anonymous, will be composed of closed,
      Likert scale or semi-open questions.

      The questionnaires will be implemented under RedCapÂ° for patient associations.

      The material necessary for the study (invitation letter + "patients"/"parents"-information
      letters + paper questionnaires for both surveys + pre-stamped letters) will be in paper
      format for hospital centres. These centres will ensure the follow-up of the study.

      The invitation to participate in the survey by mailing or newsletter or association website
      will be made by the heads of patient associations.
