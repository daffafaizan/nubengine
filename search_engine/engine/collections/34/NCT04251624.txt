    
      Goal Management Therapy is a structured, short-term, present-oriented cognitive remediation
      program with an emphasis on mindfulness and practice in planning and completion of
      goal-oriented behaviors. The primary objective of GMT is to train participants to interrupt
      ongoing behavior through the resumption of executive control in order to define goal
      hierarchies and monitor performance in achieving goals. Sessions include instructional
      material, interactive tasks, discussion of patients' real-life deficits, and homework
      assignments. The matched psychosocial education control group will focus on educational
      materials (e.g. brain function, neuroplasticity), and lifestyle interventions (e.g. sleep
      hygiene, stress, exercise.) The study will take place in two phases: phase 1 will consist of
      6 sessions of Goal Management Therapy and 6 sessions of psychosocial education among public
      safety personnel and civilians who are inpatients at a mental health and addiction facility.
      Phase 2 will consist of 9 sessions of Goal Management Therapy and 9 sessions of psychosocial
      education, among public safety personal who are members of the local community.
