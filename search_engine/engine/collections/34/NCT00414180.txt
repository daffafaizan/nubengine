    
      CONTEXT: No pharmacotherapies have been shown to increase long-term (&#8805; 6 month) tobacco
      abstinence rates among smokeless tobacco (ST) users, although bupropion SR has demonstrated
      potential efficacy in pilot studies.

      OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of bupropion SR for tobacco abstinence among
      ST users compared with placebo.

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      conducted between August 2003 to May 2005 at two research centers with a 12-week treatment
      period and follow-up of smoking status to week 52.

      INTERVENTION: Bupropion SR titrated to 150 mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks plus weekly
      behavioral interventions.

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint was 7-day point-prevalence tobacco abstinence
      rate at week 12. Secondary outcomes included the prolonged and continuous tobacco abstinence
      rates at weeks 12, 24, and 52.
