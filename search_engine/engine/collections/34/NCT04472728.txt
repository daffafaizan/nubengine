      immediate-release 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) at ≥ 97% purity. BIO101 activates MasR on the
      protective arm of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS). The engagement of MasR by BIO101 is
      responsible for a number of preclinical beneficial activities in normal and pathological
      contexts.

      The COVA clinical study is a global, multicentric, double-blind, placebo-controlled, group
      sequential and adaptive 2 parts phase 2-3 study in participants with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
      Part 1 is a Phase 2 exploratory Proof of Concept (PoC) study to provide preliminary data on
      the activity, safety and tolerability of BIO101 in the target population. Part 2 is a phase 3
      pivotal randomized study to provide further evidence of safety and efficacy of BIO101 after
      28 days of dosing.

      The trial will use an adaptive design based on pre-specified criteria, using an independent
      external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to monitor safety, efficacy, and review data at
      appropriate intervals to allow the initiation of the confirmatory part of the study.

      The general objectives of the study are:

        -  The purpose of Part 1 is to obtain preliminary indication of activity of BIO101, in
           preventing respiratory deterioration in the target population (50 patients, age ≥ 55
           years) and provide preliminary data on the safety and tolerability of BIO101 in the
           target population

        -  The purpose of Part 2 is to re-assess the sample size that is needed for the
           confirmatory part of the study and to provide confirmation on the benefit of BIO101 and
           safety in the larger target population (up to 310 patients)
