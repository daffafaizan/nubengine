      Healthy volunteers will be positioned supine and undergo preoxygenation by tidal volume
      breathing for 3 minutes using each technique in turn. The sequence of techniques for each
      volunteer will be randomised in advance. Investigators will be instructed to ensure a good
      mask seal throughout the testing period. At the end of a 3 minute preoxygenation period,
      after a brief breath hold, the volunteer will exhale into reservoir tubing, allowing the
      fractional expired oxygen concentration (FeO2) to be determined (primary outcome) using a
      calibrated gas analyser.

      The techniques being assessed have been chosen from methods of preoxygenation commonly
      available to clinicians in the prehospital environment:

        1. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure mode with fractional inspired oxygen concentration
           (FiO2) 100% using a portable ventilator.

        2. Bag-valve-mask device (BVM) with 15 l/min oxygen flow.

        3. Non-rebreather mask (NRM) device with 15 l/min oxygen flow.

      Volunteers will also be asked to indicate the subjective ease of breathing for each technique
      (secondary outcome) using a visual analogue scale (VAS).
