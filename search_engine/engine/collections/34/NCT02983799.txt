    
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study assessing the efficacy and
      safety of olaparib tablets 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) given orally twice daily (bid) in
      subjects with platinum-sensitive or partially platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous
      or high-grade endometrioid epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer,
      who have received at least 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy.

      The study will assess the effectiveness of olaparib tablets as measured by the objective
      response rate (ORR) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      v1.1, in subjects with germline BRCA mutations (gBRCAm), somatic BRCA mutations (sBRCAm), or
      potential aberrations in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) as determined by myChoice®
      HRD, as well as in subjects without identifiable HRD. This study will utilize Myriad
      BRACAnalysis CDx® for germline BRCA analysis and a tumor test (myChoice® HRD) for tumor BRCA
      analysis and HRD status. Four cohorts will be identified based upon the genetic testing
      described above:

        -  Cohort 1: gBRCAm,

        -  Cohort 2: sBRCAm and germline BRCA wild type,

        -  Cohort 3: myChoice® HRD positive (genomic instability positive) and BRCA wild type
           (BRCAwt) (no BRCA mutation),

        -  Cohort 4: myChoice® HRD negative (genomic instability negative) and BRCAwt (no BRCA
           mutation).
