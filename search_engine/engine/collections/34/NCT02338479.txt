      HCT for hematologic malignancies. This study is a collaboration between the Pediatric Blood
      and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC), the Center for International Blood and Marrow
      Transplant Research (CIBMTR), the National Marrow Transplant Program (NMDP) and the Resource
      for Clinical Investigation in Blood and Marrow Transplantation (RCI-BMT) of the CIBMTR. The
      study will enroll pediatric patients who undergo myeloablative HCT for hematologic
      malignancies at PBMTC sites.

      The study examines the hypothesis that survivors of pediatric HCT are at risk for late organ
      toxicity and they will have identifiable biomarkers present within the first two years
      following HCT which will be predictive for late adverse outcomes allowing for early
      identification of patients at risk.
