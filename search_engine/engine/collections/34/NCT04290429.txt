      protective effects on the gastrointestinal tract after bowel injury. It induces positive
      effects in the GI tract like nutrient uptake, mucosal growth, protection from inflammation,
      etc. One of the target organs from GVHD is the GI tract, and since patients suffering from
      GI-GVHD experience intestinal disorders like loss of mucosal epithelial integrity, diarrhea
      accompanied by strong abdominal pain that can lead to food inanition, the investigators
      therefore aimed to examine the outcome of patients suffering from SR-GI-GVHD that are treated
      with the GLP-2 analogue, Teduglutide. The investigators will determine the outcome of each
      patient by monitoring the gastrointestinal signs like diarrhea frequency, intestinal
      absorption measured by serum-albumin concentrations and GI histology, specifically the number
      of Paneth cells before and during teduglutide treatment.
