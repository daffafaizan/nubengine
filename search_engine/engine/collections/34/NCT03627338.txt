      gain a better understanding of the causes of deficient adherence including evaluation for
      medication beliefs, satisfaction, depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life. A
      number of long-term medications have been approved for this group of patients in various
      indications and / or recommended by guidelines. However, adherence has not been adequately
      investigated yet. The investigators aim to focus on the following groups of ingredients /
      classes:

        -  Primary and secondary antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. Norfloxacin)

        -  Non-selective beta-blockers (e.g. Carvedilol and Propranolol)

        -  diuretics (Spirolactones [e.g. Spironolacton], loop diuretics) Methodically, this is
           will be investigated in particular by taking into account the patients history,
           standardized questionnaires and validated interviews.
