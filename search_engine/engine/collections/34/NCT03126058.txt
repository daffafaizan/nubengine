      important for treatment of colorectal cancer to enhance the quality of treatment, increase
      patients' survival rate and improve the life quality. So far, surgical resection is optimal
      treatment for patients with colorectal cancer. As a result, increasing the quality of surgery
      and improving the perioperative managements have a great influence on patients received a
      coloproctectomy. Investigators have spent over ten years studying enhanced recovery after
      surgery programs for colorectal cancer and have got some successful experience. Investigators
      found enhanced recovery after surgery can accelerate patients' recovery without increasing
      complications. This study is the first multi-center study of enhanced recovery after surgery
      for colorectal cancer in China. During this period, the study is aimed to evaluate the safety
      of applying enhanced recovery after surgery for colorectal cancer.
