    
      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the two study arms in terms of:

        -  Efficacity for pain relief during suturing according to other validated scales (a visual
           analog scale (VAS), the EVENDOL (Evaluation Enfant Douleur) scale);

        -  the duration of the procedure, the time between the start of the care process for pain
           (hypnosis or nitrous oxide) and the beginning of the suture;

        -  the amount of nitrous oxide administered;

        -  the conditions under which suturing takes place, in terms of (i) the general conditions
           of implementation, (ii) the need to use physical restraint, (iii) failure of the
           procedure and the need to resort to supplementary means of anesthesia, (iv) satisfaction
           of the operator and his/her perceived ease of operations, (v) satisfaction of the
           parents;

        -  the behavior of the patient during removal of the suture;

        -  the conditions under which suture removal takes place;

        -  complications related to the used treatments.
