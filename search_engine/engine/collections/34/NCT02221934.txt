      alleviate pain. Use of this device may be associated with providing an effective,
      mechanism-based yet non-destructive, treatment for managing intractable limb pain in
      amputees. In a given patient, the Altius System will be deemed effective if treatment results
      in 50% reduction of pain score for more than 50% of all pain episodes.
