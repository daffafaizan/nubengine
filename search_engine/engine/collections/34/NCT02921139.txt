      unresectable intermediate stage. Nowadays, many therapies have been used for treating this
      group of HCC patients, including TACE. However, residual tumors after TACE are not uncommon.
      In conventional, re-TACE is recommended for managing residual tumors. However, accumulated
      overall survival is still poor in consecutive TACEs, leading to a low rate of <20% in 5
      years.

      In this regard, radiotherapy has been proved to be effective in managing HCC patients,
      especially a novel technique named SABR. When compared with conventional-fractionated
      radiotherapy, SABR demonstrated better treatment responses with fewer side effects in
      managing primary or metastatic liver tumors. In the literature, phase I and II trials of TACE
      plus SABR showed excellent local control rates and promising 1- and 2-year survival rates.
      However, till now, there is no head-to-head comparison between TACE + SABR and consecutive
      TACEs.
