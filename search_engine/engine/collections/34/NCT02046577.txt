      socioeconomic impact, particularly affecting young children. Observational studies have shown
      an association between vitamin D (VD) deficiency and higher incidence and severity of
      respiratory infections. Chile has a high prevalence of VD deficiency, particularly in the
      southern regions of the country. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of oral VD supplementation to decrease the incidence of ARTIs in 275 preschool
      children. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study will be performed in Santiago,
      Coyhaique and Punta Arenas. Children aged 18 to 36 months will be given weekly oral 5600 IU
      of vitamin D3 (VD3), 11200 IU of VD3, or placebo doses during 6 months.
