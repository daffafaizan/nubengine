    
      With the recent addition of carfilzomib as a treatment option for multiple myeloma, no data
      is available yet on how the drug is being used outside of the clinical trial setting.

      The Primary Objective is to describe carfilzomib utilisation in routine clinical practice,
      including dosage, administration schedule, regimen, duration of treatment and reason for
      discontinuation.

        -  Secondary Objectives:

        -  Describe the population treated with carfilzomib in terms of demographics, multiple
           myeloma (MM) disease characteristics, treatment history, and comorbidities.

        -  Describe the safety profile of carfilzomib in routine clinical practice.

        -  Describe response to treatment as assessed by the physician and recorded in the medical
           file.

        -  Describe healthcare resource utilisation of subjects treated with carfilzomib, in terms
           of unplanned hospitalisations.

        -  Describe the reasons for choosing carfilzomib as the MM treatment of choice.

        -  Describe specific concomitant therapy (bisphosphonates, thromboprophylaxis,
           antihypertensive treatment, anti-infective treatment) and whether these therapies were
           used as prophylaxis or as treatment.

        -  Describe a cardiovascular assessment at carfilzomib regimen initiation and at occurrence
           of cardiac adverse events, where available per routine care (electrocardiogram [ECG],
           echocardiography, left ventricular ejection fraction).
