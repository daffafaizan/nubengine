    
      INO schedule of administration will be as described in the refractory/relapsed INO-VATE study
      for the first cycle, with sequential day 1/8/15 doses of 0.8, 0.5 and 0.5 mg/m2,
      respectively. Reduced dose of INO will be used for the second and last cycle (0.5 mg/m2 on
      day 1/8). This was retained in order:

        1. to minimize potential toxicities, including liver disorders and prolonged
           thrombocytopenia; and

        2. to allow delivery of subsequent chemotherapy consolidations cycles.
