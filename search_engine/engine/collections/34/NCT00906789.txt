      could assist radiologists in the detection of small lung cancers on chest radiographs.
      Radiologists using the system showed a statistically significant improvement in lung cancer
      detection rate when they used the system, compared to their interpretation of chest
      radiographs when they did not use the computer system. This study, along with other
      supporting data, resulted in the FDA giving Pre-Market Approval for the system.

      The system has undergone several improvements in software and hardware, and it is now
      intended to test two different software systems to determine whether radiologists using the
      systems can improve their detection of lung cancer on chest radiographs.

      One of these systems processes the chest radiograph to decrease the emphasis given to the
      shadow of the ribs and thereby enhances the ability of radiologists to detect disease in the
      lungs. The second system performs a series of evaluations on chest radiographs and, based on
      a complex system of analysis, points to locations on the chest radiograph that contain
      solitary pulmonary nodules having the characteristics of primary lung cancer or solitary
      metastases of cancer to the lungs.

      This will be a test of radiologists to determine the degree of improvement, if any, that
      results when they interpret chest radiographs that may or may not have cancer, first
      interpreted without the computer and, second, with the images output by the software.
