    
      This is a parallel, two-arm, randomized 1:1, stratified by tumor size and nodal involvement,
      open-label, multicenter, exploratory study in postmenopausal women with primary operable
      HR+/HER2-negative Luminal B breast cancer according to PAM50 intrinsic subtype to evaluate
      the clinical benefit and biological effects of ribociclib combined with letrozole.

      The primary trial objective is to evaluate the ability of each treatment strategy to provide
      ROR-low score at surgery.

      Luminal B patients will be randomized 1:1 to either letrozole plus ribociclib or
      chemotherapy.Two weeks after the first administration of the assigned treatment, patients
      will undergo a biopsy to assess early biological response to treatment, at Ki67 protein and
      gene expression level. After finalization of the assigned neoadjuvant treatment, patients
      will undergo surgery.

      The primary endpoint, Rate of ROR-low (at surgery) after neoadjuvant treatment, according to
      the Prosigna test will be centrally assessed.

      Baseline, Day 15 and post-treatment (surgical) primary breast tumor tissue samples should be
      available for each patient for molecular characterization A post-surgery visit will be
      performed within 28 days (7 days) from surgery, and will mark the end of the study for that
      patient
