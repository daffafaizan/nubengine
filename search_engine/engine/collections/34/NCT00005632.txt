      (106) with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 induces an
      antibody, helper T cell and/or cytotoxic T cell response against MUC-1 in patients with
      prostate cancer expressing MUC-1. II. Determine post-immunization changes in PSA levels and
      other objective parameters or disease (radionuclide bone scan and/or measurable disease if
      present) in these patients after receiving this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive glycosylated MUC-1 antigen containing MUC-1 (106) with keyhole
      limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ) plus immunological adjuvant QS21 SQ on weeks
      1-3, 7, 15, and 27 for a total of 6 vaccinations. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1
      year or until documented disease progression.
