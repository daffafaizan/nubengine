      patients. Posaconazole, a new triazole antifungal agent with broad spectrum coverage, was
      approved for both treatment and prophylaxis of IFIs. Previous studies have demonstrated the
      relationship between posaconazole plasma concentration and efficacy, thus, the importance of
      posaconazole therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was gradually accepted. However, studies found
      inter- and intra-individual variation between concentrations, and these phenomenons were
      affected greatly by GI function, food intake and concomitant medication. Furthermore, there's
      a lack of posaconazole TDM study in Asian population.

      The study was designed to describe the prescribing pattern of posaconazole, to study the
      relationship between concentration and clinical outcomes/ adverse events, to identify factors
      that influence plasma concentration, and to evaluate whether routine TDM is needed in our
      institution.
