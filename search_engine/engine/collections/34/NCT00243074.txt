      I. Determine the objective confirmed, complete, and partial response rates in patients with
      unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with AZD2171.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical benefit, in terms of objective response and stable disease rates,
      in patients treated with this drug.

      II. Determine the 1-year median overall survival and progression-free survival in patients
      treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects in patients treated with this
      drug.

      IV. Correlate, preliminarily, pre- and post-treatment plasma vascular endothelial growth
      factor and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule with clinical outcomes in patients treated
      with this drug.

      V. Correlate, preliminarily, circulating endothelial cells with clinical outcomes in patients
      treated with this drug.

      VI. Correlate variants of genes in the pathway targeted by this drug and variants of genes
      involved in the development of hypertension with the antiangiogenic property of this drug in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years
      from study entry.
