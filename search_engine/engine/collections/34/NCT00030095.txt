        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 2-methoxyestradiol in patients with advanced
           solid tumors.

        -  Determine the side effect profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the changes in positron-emission tomography scans of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the changes in apotosis in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) once on day 1 followed by 2 days of
      evaluation. Patients then receive oral 2ME2 every 12 hours. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 2ME2 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at day 30.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
