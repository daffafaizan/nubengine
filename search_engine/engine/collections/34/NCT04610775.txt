      community. Enrolled participants will have 2-3 sets of three automated BPs measured, each set
      with a different cuff size. To accomplish this, the investigators will utilize a 2-3 period
      cross-over design:

      â€¢ Two or three different periods with 3 automated BP measurements, using a BP cuff that is:

        -  Appropriately sized based on mid-upper arm circumference ( standard)

        -  Too small (one size lower than appropriate)

        -  Too large (one size higher than appropriate)

      Individuals in whom the smallest available cuff (small adult) and largest available cuff
      (extra-large cuff) is appropriate for their arm circumference will only be able to undergo
      two periods of BP measurements.
