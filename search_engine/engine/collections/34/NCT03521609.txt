      Hospital of the Addictions Unit of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona. The
      level of emotional intelligence will be assessed through the following measurement
      instruments: MSCEIT for the objective emotional intelligence coefficient and the TMMS-24 for
      the perceived emotional intelligence. Patients will attend 9 sessions of brief group
      intervention based on emotional intelligence and pre-post intervention differences in
      participants' TMMS-24 scores will be analyzed
