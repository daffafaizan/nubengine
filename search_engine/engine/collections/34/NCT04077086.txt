      teacher incentive to promote use, increase academic high school attendance?

      Design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial

      Rationale: Rural Chinese children have high myopia prevalence, but poor access to glasses.
      Our previous trials show giving free glasses significantly improves academic performance,
      with greater effect size than parental education or family income, equaling or exceeding
      other classroom-based medical interventions. Non-vocational (academic) high school attendance
      is only 30% in rural western China. Strong evidence of educational benefit from glasses is
      needed to spur adoption of national distribution programs.

      Methods: Children in Year 1 and 2 (1 class each) at 130 randomly-selected middle schools in
      Ningxia, western China, will be randomized by school to receive free glasses and a
      trial-proven teacher-based incentive to promote wear (Intervention) or prescriptions only
      (Control). The main outcome 2-3 years later will be high school attendance (powered to detect
      10% difference between study groups); secondary outcomes of compliance, test scores and use
      of near versus distance classroom learning aids will elucidate biological plausibility of a
      causal pathway between myopia correction and learning. Local knowledge and attitudes about
      myopia and spectacle use and intervention cost-effectiveness will be studied.

      Statistical methods to be employed in the analysis and justification for the choice of sample
      size:

      Adjusted- and unadjusted-comparison of the difference between study groups

        -  Of academic high school attendance

        -  of mathematics test performance at endline (adjusted for baseline),

        -  of observed spectacle wear at un-announced examinations

      Sample size: Assuming 50% of children will fail vision screening, 70% of these needing
      glasses, with loss to follow-up=10%, Î±=0.05, intra-class correlation=0.15, explained
      variation by covariates=0.40, difference between the groups in the main study outcome=10%,
      high-school attendance rate in the Control group=30%, a sample size of 130 middle-schools (65
      in each group) will provide power=85%.
