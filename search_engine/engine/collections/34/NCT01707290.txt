    
      Ivacaftor is the first Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulator
      to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical benefit in participants with CF. Results
      from Phase 3 studies (NCT00909532 [Study 102] and NCT00909727 [Study 103]) showed that
      ivacaftor is effective in the treatment of participants with CF who have the G551D-CFTR
      mutation, as evidenced by sustained improvements in CFTR channel function (measured by
      reduction in sweat chloride concentration) and corresponding substantial, durable
      improvements in lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, respiratory symptoms, and weight
      gain. Ivacaftor was also well tolerated, as evidenced by the rates and reasons for premature
      discontinuation and results of safety assessments.

      Ivacaftor (Trade Name Kalydeco; 150 mg tablets) was initially approved in the United States
      for the treatment of CF in participants 6 years of age and older who have a G551D mutation in
      the CFTR gene.
