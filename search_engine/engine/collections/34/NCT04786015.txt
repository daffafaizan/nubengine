      younger adults and have a negative effect on their overall health-related quality-of-life by
      decreasing mobility, reducing social participation and causing substantial difficulties with
      activities of daily living. Canada's population is rapidly aging and the socioeconomic burden
      associated with these conditions will continue to escalate. Indeed, older patients (â‰¥65
      years) account for 18.8% of a chiropractor's case load. Given the high proportion of older
      adults as chiropractic patients, research on the safety of chiropractic care for this
      population is critical. Previous studies have reported adverse events (AEs) following
      specific chiropractic techniques or as secondary outcome measures in older adults; however,
      there has been no attempt to prospectively capture changes in symptoms (and specifically
      AEs).

      Purpose: To: 1) calculate the frequency of AEs reported by older adults following
      chiropractic care with an active surveillance reporting system; and 2) explore patient and
      provider factors related to changes in symptom (e.g., new, worsening, improving) following
      chiropractic care.

      More specifically, this study will use active surveillance reporting system to track the
      change in symptoms experienced by older adult patients after a chiropractic visit, in
      comparison to before. These symptoms can be pain, stiffness, fatigue, weakness, dizziness,
      nausea, etc. As active surveillances track the change in all symptoms experienced by all
      patients in a participating clinic, no specific condition/disease is being studied, but how
      the symptoms experienced by older adults seeking chiropractic care for a musculoskeletal
      condition (such as low back, neck, hip, should pain) change.
