      cause of production loss and absenteeism. The risks of developing stress-related mental
      illness is today well established, however, it is less studied how this can be successfully
      treated or prevented in workplaces through interventions.

      The SPA project intends to evaluate the method the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement
      System (ProMES). The method is mainly evaluated for production improvement, but there are
      indications that it also has stress-reducing effect on working groups. The method gives
      employees within health care opportunities to participate actively in productivity-enhancing
      measures. The employees, along with their immediate supervisors, identify and prioritize
      responsive and desirable results in all of the activities important dimensions. International
      studies have shown that participation (participation) has positive effects on employee
      performance and attitudes.

      The aim of this study is to test whether efforts in targeting the organization and work
      environment can reduce stress and prevent stress-related ill health in the workplace. Primary
      outcomes of the study are tense work i.e. imbalance between demand and control and other
      primary indicators of stress, such as sleep and recovery.

      The hypothesis in study 1 is that productivity enhancing workplace interventions based on a
      participative approach also increases employees' sense of control and control over their own
      work. This in turn means that the method also could be used to reduce the occurrence of tense
      work and thus affect / reduce the stress-related illness.
