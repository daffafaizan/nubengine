      measure (Day 84 FAST Score) for aphasic subjects. This interim analysis indicated that there
      was less than a 20 % chance of showing a 15 % difference between placebo and piracetam at the
      end of the trial, under the assumption that there was indeed a 15 % difference. Thus, it was
      the decision of UCB to stop further recruitment into this study.
