      be administered using targeted supradose cisplatin chemoradiation in patients with squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Determine the partial and complete response rate of
      cisplatin chemoradiation. III. Determine the incidence of adverse events using cisplatin
      chemoradiation therapy. IV. Determine the rate of disease-free survival and overall survival
      in these patients. V. Determine the incidence and pattern of recurrence in these patients.
      VI. Document quality of life measured by disease-specific instruments in these patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive four courses of cisplatin on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 concurrent
      with radiotherapy. One course of chemotherapy consists of intra-arterial cisplatin given over
      3-5 minutes. Radiotherapy is given 5 days a week for 7 weeks. This weekly cisplatin
      chemoradiation course will be repeated 4 times, providing recovery from toxicity is present.
      Dexamethasone is started the evening prior to cisplatin treatment, and continues until the
      morning following the procedure.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be enrolled.
