      are in need of treatment for alcohol abuse, yet only 7.2% of those in need of treatment
      received it. Importantly, most youth (90.5%) who were classified as needing treatment based
      on their self report of Adolescent Alcohol Study Plan; v.2; 3/30/12Page 2 of 35 symptoms,
      perceived no need for treatment. Thus, there is a need to develop treatments that target
      populations of alcohol abusing youth who are not highly motivated to change their substance
      use. New outpatient family based and contingency management interventions for adolescent
      marijuana abuse have been developed, yet none of these interventions has specifically
      targeted adolescent alcohol use. It is important to target primary alcohol abuse and
      dependence in adolescence as approximately 20% of treatment-seeking youth report primary
      problems with alcohol. The primary aim of this proposal is to adapt our family-based
      contingency-management treatment to target adolescent alcohol abuse and dependence. This
      project will develop, manualize, and pilot a contingency management intervention that
      includes two components. First, an incentive program will enhance the adolescent's engagement
      in the treatment process and engender alcohol abstinence by providing positive reinforcement
      for documented abstinence via breathalyzers administered by parents regularly at home, self
      and parent report, and clinic based urine drug testing. Second, a parent management training
      program will enhance and maintain the positive effects of the incentive program by teaching
      parents how to effectively use contingency management in the home environment to motivate
      their adolescent to achieve abstinence and improve their behavior in other domains.
