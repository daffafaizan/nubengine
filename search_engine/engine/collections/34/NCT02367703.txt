      than 3 millimeter diameter's instruments to achieve in daily practice laparoscopic
      hysterectomy.

      The study will be unicentric, single-blind. Study period will be one year and 4 months.
      Patients will be enrolled in pre-operative consultations or at the weekly staff. They will
      have to sign an informed consent.

      The day before surgery: patients will be randomized by the statistician. A resident will
      carry out a preoperative ultrasound to determine an estimated uterine volume. Nurses will
      make a blood test (hemoglobin).

      The day of surgery we will assess: operative time, surgeon's ergonomics, the amount of
      bleeding, patient's pain at rest and mobilization.

      At Day-1 post surgery nurses will make an other blood test (hemoglobin) and we will assess
      patient's pain at rest and mobilization.

      At the postoperative consultation we will lister : complications (Accordion Severity score
      classification), esthetic result (PSAQ), patient's pain.
