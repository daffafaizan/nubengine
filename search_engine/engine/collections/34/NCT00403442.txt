      treatment. Lesions must have blood as a primary component (i.e., contain more than 50%
      blood). Patients will receive one of two combination treatments:

        -  Verteporfin PDT reduced fluence (300 mW/cm2) immediately followed by bevacizumab (1.25
           mg) intravitreal injection

        -  Verteporfin PDT standard fluence (600 mW/cm2) immediately followed by bevacizumab (1.25
           mg) intravitreal injection A total of 10 patients will be enrolled, 5 per treatment arm.
