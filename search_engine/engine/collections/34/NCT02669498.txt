      the Fallopian tubes is proclaimed to reduce cancer risk, on the other hand we know that
      surgical pelvic procedures result in early onset of menopause. Pokoradi et al were not able
      to distinctively tell which part of pelvic surgery (ie hysterectomy, oophorectomy,
      salpingectomy, tubal ligation?) is affecting menopause because data was not providing
      surgical details. Nevertheless, Dietl et al's statement "Timing of menopause and other
      long-term effects have not been studied yet...thus all negative effects are still
      speculative"1 can only partly be agreed upon regarding Pokoradi's findings. It might be too
      early to proclaim a routine Fallopian tube removal as long as there is no data on how much
      this procedure affects ovarian function. This is further supported by another statement in
      their study "Although most malignant serous "ovarian" carcinomas originate from the distal
      Fallopian tube, a smaller proportion of serous cancers as well as endometroid, clear cell,
      mucinous carcinomas are still thought to arise from ovarian surface epithelium.1" which means
      the exact impact on cancer prophylaxis can only be estimated due to a lack of studies. Other
      histopathologic entities might not be influenced by tube removal.
