      streptococcus (MS) levels. Samples were randomly divided into experimental group (30 pairs)
      and control group (30 pairs). Mothers in the experimental group received xylitol chewing gum
      treatment three times/day for three months, whereas the controls received fluoride varnish.
      Both groups received oral hygiene instructions, dietary counseling and restorative treatment.
      All children were examined after 6, 12 and 18 months from the initiation of the study to
      assess caries, plaque and salivary mutans streptococcus (MS) levels.
