      infected cells. Recent data suggest that intravenous administration of HIV-specific CD8 cells
      is safe, augments host immunity, and mediates a dramatic reduction in circulating
      HIV-infected CD4 cells. However, the observed antiviral effects are transient, and HIV
      infected CD4 cells re-emerge as the number of self CD8 cells declines. Augmenting CD8 cell
      response to HIV by immunotherapy with CD8 cells may be a useful addition to drug therapy if
      the infused CD8 cells can survive long-term in vivo. Administration of interleukin-2 (also
      known as aldesleukin or IL-2), a naturally occurring cytokine, has been proposed as a way to
      maintain the number of CD8 cells. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      immunotherapy with HIV-specific CD8 cells in HIV infected patients. Additionally, this study
      will determine if aldesleukin injections improve the persistence of self CD8 transplants and
      the duration of antiviral activity without severe toxicity.

      This study will last 18 months. CD8 cells will be isolated from the blood of HIV infected
      patients; the cells will be allowed to multiply in the laboratory, and patients will receive
      back their CD8 cells. Patients will receive up to 3 infusions of self CD8 cells. On Day 0,
      patients will receive their first infusion of CD8 cells. On Day 7, patients will receive
      their second infusion of CD8 cells; this infusion will be followed by 14 days of aldesleukin
      administered daily by injection under the skin. Patients with less than a Grade 2 toxicity
      will receive a third infusion of CD8 cells; this infusion will be followed by 21 days of
      aldesleukin.
