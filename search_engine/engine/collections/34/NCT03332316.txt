      popliteal nerve block for analgesia after ankle surgery.

      After ankle or foot arthrodesis patients need a good analgesia. Nevertheless early
      mobilisation and discharge are important for the healing process after surgery. Peripheral
      nerve blocks have provided a safe, effective method to control early postoperative pain when
      symptoms are most severe. Perineural dexamethasone added to local anesthetic prolongs the
      duration of analgesia of the perineural nerve block.

      The perineural use of dexamethasone is still off-label. There is a ongoing discussion of
      which has better benefits, intravenous or perineural dexamethasone.

      There are multiple research where the intravenous and perineural dexamethasone use has
      compared, but there is still a limited amount of research of low dose perineural
      dexamethasone versus intravenous dexamethasone.

      In this study investigators compare different doses of perineural dexamethasone added to
      ropivacaine 2 mg/ml 20ml. After arthrodesis under spinal anaesthesia the patients receive
      popliteal block ropivacaine 2 mg/ml 20 ml and dexamethasone of different doses. Groups 1 to 4
      has dexamethasone doses 0, 2mg, 3mg or 4 mg.

      After the popliteal nerve block investigators follow postoperative pain, opiate consumption,
      mobilisation and long term quality of life.

      Investigators goal is to find a dexamethasone dose which is as low as possible but at the
      same time covers the need for a good pain relief and fast recovery postoperatively.
