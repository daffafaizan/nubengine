      the early development of temporal networks, as it is observed at the turning point between
      non-sensory driven spontaneous local processing and cortical network functioning. The role in
      development and the precise location of TTA-SW remain unknown. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that preterms from 28 weeks of gestational age (wGA) are able to discriminate
      phonemes and voice, supporting the idea of a prior genetic structural or activity-dependent
      fingerprint that would prepare the auditory network to compute auditory information at the
      onset of thalamocortical connectivity. They recorded TTA-SW in 26-32 wGA preterms. The rate
      of TTA-SW in response to click stimuli was evalu- ated using low-density EEG in 30 preterms.
