      trimester achieves undetectable HBV DNA at delivery in >=95% of pregnant women with chronic
      hepatitis B. The one-arm, open-label, interventional study aims: 1, To estimate the time to
      complete HBV DNA suppression (<100 IU/ml) in 170 HBV DNA positive women who start TDF in the
      late first or early second trimester; and to estimate the proportion of women with HBV DNA
      <100 IU/ml at delivery. 2, To address potential barriers to and the efficacy of implementing
      TDF in early pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. The
      investigators will measure potential barriers to acceptability and effectiveness of this
      intervention: adherence, potential hepatitis B flares in mothers (safety), and the proportion
      of hepatitis B infections in the offspring at 1 year of age (efficacy).
