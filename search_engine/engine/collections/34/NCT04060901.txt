      empathic accuracy, enhances well-being, and attenuates the pro-inflammatory response to
      psychosocial stress. CBCT is a secularized compassion meditation program adapted from the
      Tibetan Buddhist mind training (lojong) tradition, and it may be an ideal addendum to the
      spiritual caregiving provided by Emory University hospital chaplains and chaplain residents
      to approximately 100,000 patients, staff, and faculty members each year.

      With this in mind, The Emory University Spiritual Health department now incorporates CBCT
      into their training curriculum using a phased approach that began in Fall 2017. The Spiritual
      Health department also developed an adapted program based on CBCT principles that chaplains
      can then deliver to patients and staff, called Compassion-Centered Spiritual Health (CCSH).
      Spiritual Health proposes to pilot a systematic implementation of CCSH Interventions for
      Teams (CCSH-TI) to clinical research teams at the Winship Cancer Institute.

      This is a randomized trial of CCSH Interventions for Teams versus a wait list control
      condition. CRC teams will be randomized to receive CCSH-TI during a first cohort or to a
      wait-list group that will receive CCSH-TI during the second cohort. CRCs (n = 93) will be
      randomized by team to receive CCSH Interventions for Teams either in the fall or in the
      spring. Participating CRCs will complete self-report measures at 4 timepoints throughout the
      year: (1) Prior to randomization, (2) immediately upon completion of CCSH Interventions for
      Teams for cohort 1 (3) prior to CCSH Interventions for Teams for cohort 2, and (4)
      immediately upon completion of CCSH Interventions for Teams for cohort 2.
