      which may in turn influence the overall outcome of this syndrome. So, proper diagnosis of
      ACLF and its precipitating factors in our locality enable us for proper management of these
      cases and dealing with these precipitating factors to be avoided later on in patients with
      liver cirrhosis

      Aim of the work:

      To identify the pattern of acute on chronic liver cell failure (ACLF) within 28 days
      including prevalence, percipitating factors, and outcome.
