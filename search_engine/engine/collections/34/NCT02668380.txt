      regimen for the extension of survival time in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (mGC).
      New evidence suggests that salvage chemo-therapies, as second-line treatments, may have a
      survival advantage when compared with best supportive care. After failure of second-line
      chemotherapy, the results of further treatment are poor, yielding response rates of 0% to 5%
      with no evidence of prolonged survival. Apatinib is a small-molecule VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, Had been approved by the CFDA for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer,
      However, this study defines a variety of inclusion/exclusion criteria, efficacy and safety
      are not well reflect in the real world for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.
      Therefore, an Open Label, Prospective, Multicentre, Non-interventional Study could evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of apatinib for Advanced Metastatic Gastric Cancer in the real world.
