    
      Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, recessive disorder with a more than 1000-fold increase
      in the frequency of all major skin cancers in association with defective DNA repair. The risk
      of skin and other cancers among normal appearing XP heterozygote individuals has not been
      fully studied. We plan to study the family members from XP families with known DNA repair
      gene mutations to determine if heterozygote carriers of XP disease mutations are at an
      increased risk of developing cancer. For controls we will compare XP heterozygotes to their
      non-carrier blood relatives and spouses and to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results
      (SEER) rates. For this purpose, blood, skin or buccal cells will be obtained from all
      available relatives for DNA or RNA mutation analysis. Cancer confirmation will be
      accomplished through review of pathology reports, medical records and death certificates. In
      addition, willing family members will be clinically examined to determine current cancer
      status. Individuals who are determined to be heterozygous carriers of XP DNA repair gene
      disease mutations in these families by mutation analysis or by pedigree will be compared to
      non-carrier relatives and spouses with respect to history of any type of cancer. We will also
      focus on skin cancer and cancer of the nervous system since the risks of these cancers are
      elevated among the XP homozygotes.
