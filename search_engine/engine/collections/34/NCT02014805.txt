      studies were for the radiotherapy, but others were against. However, more inherent biases
      existed in these trials. Resection, Masaoka stage and pathology were widely accepted as the
      prognostic factors for thymoma. Furthermore, the frequency of local failure after radical
      resection was still high in Masaoka stage II-III B type thymoma. With the conformal technique
      appearing, conformal radiotherapy can escalate the dose without increasing the risk of normal
      tissue toxicities.
