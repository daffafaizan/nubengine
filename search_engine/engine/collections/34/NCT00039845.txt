      language processing in pre/early literate children. These studies are designed to test the
      hypothesis that language networks are strongly lateralized and regionally specific in
      children younger than eight. The study extends our investigations of paradigm development and
      language network organization in adults and older children (8-12) to the 4-7 year age group.
      Word reading, object naming, and auditory comprehension paradigms will be adapted for
      children 4-7 years old. Paradigm stimuli will be devised from pilot data obtained under
      protocol 01-N-181. Paradigms will be piloted in adults and older children (8-12 years) before
      young child studies (4-7 years) and will employ the 1.5 and 3T scanners. Paradigms will be
      designed to overcome limitations in previous studies: monitoring performance in the scanner,
      using 3T and event related designs to improve signal to noise and allow data analysis in
      relation to task item response, and improve motion correction, using language neutral control
      conditions, and using paradigms appropriate for pre-literate children. Data will be analyzed
      on an individual basis with AFNI and group analysis with SPM 99 using random effect analysis
      to identify brain regions associated with task performance. These paradigms will be used as
      language probes for other protocols designed to study the effect of acute and chronic disease
      states (e.g. stroke and epilepsy) on the plasticity of neuronal organization in language
      networks. In order to compare two non-invasive language mapping modes, we will perform
      magnetoencephalography with auditory category and description decision tasks.
