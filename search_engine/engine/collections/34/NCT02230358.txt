      cerebral blood-flow between a regional anesthesia (RA) and a general anesthesia (GA) in a
      randomized, controlled, single center study at the Medical University Innsbruck, Department
      of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine.

      For this purpose patients with the need of a carotid endarterectomy (CEA) will be included
      and randomized either to the regional anesthesia (RA) or the general anesthesia (GA) group
      until a patient number of 45 in each group is achieved.

      The cardiac output and cerebral blood-flow via trans-cranial Doppler (TCD) will be measured
      at 6 time points:

        -  T0 Baseline (after insertion of an arterial line)

        -  T1 After induction of anesthesia, but before surgical start

        -  T2 Two minutes after clamping the carotid artery

        -  T3 Two minutes after shunt insertation of the carotid artery

        -  T4 After reperfusion

        -  T5 After completion of the skin suture
