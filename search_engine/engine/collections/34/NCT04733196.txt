      on different active substances. The study include 180 patients divided into 6 groups of 30
      patients, each group rinse with one of the following mouthwashes - mouthwash based on
      essential oils (menthol, thymol and eucalyptus), mouthwash based on essential oils (menthol,
      thymol and eucalyptus) and 0.12% chlorhexidine, mouthwash based on 0,8 % hydrogen peroxide,
      mouthwash based on prebiotic, water based on 0.2% chlorhexidine, placebo mouthwash. Inclusion
      criteria are: generalized gingival inflammation, plaque index of Turesky, 1970 > 1.95,
      gingival index of Loe & Silness, 1963 > 0.95, no systemic diseases, no systemic medication,
      lack of severely damaged teeth, no large fillings, no orthodontic treatment. Patients are
      motivated and instructed to maintain proper and optimal personal oral hygiene. All
      participants undergo professional mechanical plaque removal. After instrumentation
      participants are instructed to rinse with 15 ml mouthwash 2 times a day for 21 days.
      Researchers control the amount of mouthwash used by giving a new bottle of mouthwash with the
      required amount for 1 patient for 1 week at the beginning of each week and taking back the
      bottle from the previous week. During the study period, patients are monitored on days 14 and
      21, examining plaque index of Turesky, 1970, gingival index of Loe & Silness, 1963, bleeding
      index of Ainamo & Bay, 1975, side effects like staining, burning itching, oral lesions. At
      the end of the study (day 21), patients complete a questionnaire.
