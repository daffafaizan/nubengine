    
      Background:

        -  The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates the degradation of important regulatory
           proteins and transcription factors that control the cell cycle and cell death.
           Proteasome inhibition can lead to block of different phases of the cell cycle, and block
           expression of genes that prevent cell death induced by radiation or other cytotoxic
           therapeutic agents.

        -  In preclinical studies, proteasome inhibitor PS-341 has demonstrated cytotoxic,
           radiosensitizing, and anti-tumor activity against squamous cell carcinomas of the head
           and neck (SCCHN).

      Objectives:

        -  The primary objective of this phase I dose escalation clinical study is to determine the
           maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 to be given concomitant with radiation in patients with
           recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

        -  Secondary objectives include detection of 20S proteasome inhibition, cell cycle block,
           apoptosis and inhibition of transcription factor NF-kappaB activation in tumor tissue
           biopsies following PS-341 and radiation.

      Eligibility:

        -  Persistent or recurrent SCCHN,

        -  Eligible for local primary or re-irradiation,

        -  ECOG performance less than or equal to 2, life expectancy > 3 months,

        -  Adequate organ function (PLT > 100, 000/microL, neutrophils > 1500/mciroL, serum
           creatinine < 1.5 times the upper limits normal (ULN), serum bilirubin < 1.5 times the
           ULN, serum transaminases < 2.5 times the ULN)

        -  No systemic chemotherapy within the past 4 weeks and recovered from chemotherapy
           toxicity,

        -  > 6 months since prior radiation.

      Design:

        -  Phase I dose escalation, standard 3+3 statistical design, up to 51 subjects,

        -  PS-341 will be given in escalating doses of 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 mg/m(2) in cohorts of 3 or
           more patients by IV bolus on M, Th (or T, F), and radiation will be given in 1.8 Gy
           fractions M-F to 60 Gy in previously radiated or 72Gy in previously unirradiated
           patients.

        -  Radiation and/or drug will be given in two courses split by a two week rest to allow
           recovery from combined modality therapy.
