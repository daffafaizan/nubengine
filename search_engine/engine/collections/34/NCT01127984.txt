    
      Purpose of the study. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of a fibrin
      sealant (Tissucol-Baxter) in prevention pocket haematoma and subsequent complications in
      patients who required implantation/replacement of a pacemaker or ICD wich cannot discontinue
      dual antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

      Target. The primary endpoint is to test the impact of pocket haematoma in patients treated
      with tissucol compared to a conventional treatment with vacuum drainage system without dual
      antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy discontinuation.

      The secondary endpoint is to compare the length of hospitalization between the two groups.

      Type of study. Prospective, randomized, single center, open label.

      Materials and methods. Will be consecutively enrolled approximately 100 patients.

      Inclusion criteria: patients over the age of eighteen who require an initial implantation or
      replacement of a device (pacemaker, biventricular pacemaker, ICD) treated with:

        -  dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel or prasugrel or ticlopidine, and acetylsalicylic
           acid) or

        -  anticoagulants (warfarin or heparin or low molecular weight heparin). Patients Do not
           discontinue the antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

      According to a randomization list, patients will be assigned to tissucol treatment or vacuum
      drainage system:

        -  50 patients: treated with local application of tissucol in the pocket of pacemaker/ICD;

        -  50 patients: treated with vacuum drainage system.
