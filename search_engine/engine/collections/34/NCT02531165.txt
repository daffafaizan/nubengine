      for PPCI will be screened for inclusion in the study. Eligible patients who require analgesia
      for the relief of acute chest pain, defined as Visual Analogue Scale â‰¥3, will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio into one of the two treatment arms to receive analgesia with either Morphine
      or Fentanyl following administration of a pre-hospital loading dose of Ticagrelor. Randomized
      patients will undergo primary PCI and managed according to the current guidelines of the
      European Society of Cardiology. Blood samples (10 ml) will be collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12
      and 24 hours after the loading dose of Ticagrelor to assess platelet inhibition using the
      VerifyNow P2Y12 function and the Vasodilator-Stimulated-phosphoprotein Phosphorylation (VASP)
      assays, plasma concentration of Ticagrelor and its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) using a
      validated liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry detection method and the procoagulant
      action of platelets.
