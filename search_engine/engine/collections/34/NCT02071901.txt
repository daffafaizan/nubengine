      I.To determine whether eltrombopag leads to early platelet recovery in older AML patients (≥
      60years) who attain morphologic remission on day 14 (range, day 14-17) bone marrow assessment
      following remission induction chemotherapy (IC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on megakaryopoiesis - median time to reach platelet
      count ≥50,000 /μL and ≥100,000 /μL, number of days of platelet transfusion, rates of platelet
      transfusion-independence and the median time to reach platelet transfusion independence.

      II. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on the rates of clinically significant bleeding
      events (CSBE).

      III. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on erythropoiesis the median time to red blood
      cell transfusion independence.

      IV. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on granulopoiesis- the time taken to reach an
      absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 500 /μL. V. To determine the safety and tolerability of
      eltrombopag in AML patients undergoing remission IC - incidence and severity of
      eltrombopag-related adverse events. VI. To determine rates of complete remission (CR), rates
      of partial complete remission (CRp), time to attain CR, and time to initiation of
      post-remission consolidation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) until platelet counts
      reach ≥50,000/uL or for 8 weeks, whichever comes earlier. Treatment continues in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 2 years.
