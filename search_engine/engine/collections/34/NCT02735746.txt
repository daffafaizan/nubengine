      hopes of identifying patients who may be at risk for radiation pneumonitis. Eligible subjects
      will undergo standard of care treatment with the use of the Varian TrueBeam system for
      radiation therapy of a cancer lesion in the chest. The imaging data acquired as part of usual
      standard of care for these patients is a pre-treatment 4D planning CT scan, and a daily cone
      beam CT at each radiation treatment visit. We will also obtain a series of images consisting
      of five six-second cinefluorographs (real time fluoroscopic movies, for a total each time of
      30 seconds of fluoroscopy) of the lungs while the subject is breathing, each at precisely
      measured angles to the subject, on 4 different occasions. This study will compare lung
      function data generated by applying High Fidelity Functional Lung Imaging (HFFLI) software to
      4D CT, cone beam CT, and fluoroscopic images of the lungs breathing to determine the degree
      of correlation between data generated from different imaging modalities. The study is open to
      adults over the age of 18, at any stage of cancer.
