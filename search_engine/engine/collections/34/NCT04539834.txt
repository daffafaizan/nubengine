      the cell membrane. ACE2 is widely distributed in many types of human tissues, especially in
      the vital organs, such as heart, liver, kidney, and lungs. ACE2 is viewed as the principal
      counter-regulatory mechanism for the main axis of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that is an
      essential player in the control of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The final effect
      is to increase reabsorption of sodium and water, and thereafter increase blood pressure and
      excretion of potassium (K+). Besides, patients with COVID-19 often had gastrointestinal
      symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting

      Early studies proved that high percentage of COVID-19 patient were presented with electrolyte
      disorders, including sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium abnormalities. Such electrolyte
      disturbances have important implications not only for patient management but also for
      identifying potential pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying COVID-19 that could drive novel
      therapeutic opportunities
