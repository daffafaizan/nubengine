      the progression of tumorigenesis, little information is available on the contribution of
      reprogramming of energy metabolism in cancer initiation and how it influences further the
      bioenergetic behavior of tumors.

      By applying a quantitative proteomic approach, the consortium has recently found that
      specific metabolic modifications precede cSCC.

      This study will investigate the role of energy metabolism in malignant transformation of
      premalignant skin lesions into cSCC, and in cSCC progression, with correlation with clinical
      characteristics and metastatic outcomes. Using several cutting-edge technologies in human
      samples, the team will evaluate whether targeting energy metabolism has the potential to be
      used as curative treatments for cSCC and whether pre-determined metabolic alterations could
      be exploited as new preventive strategies. These modifications in energy metabolism could be
      used as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers.
