      Due to the high bioavailability of voriconazole, switching between oral and intravenous
      administration is permitted if clinically allowed. Few data are available for the
      bioavailability of voriconazole in critically ill patients. However, to obtain a therapeutic
      concentration of voriconazole (>1.5 mg/L, which is associated with a beneficial response to
      treatment) one study showed that a higher oral dose is required compared with the intravenous
      dose, to obtain this therapeutic concentration. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics can be
      changed in critically ill patients, including bioavailability.

      In this study, patients who receive voriconazole orally (prescribed by their attending
      physician) will receive one intravenous dose of voriconazole instead of the oral dose. The
      intravenous dose will be the same as the oral dose voriconazole.
