      receive three intravenous injections of one of two doses of the investigational product, one
      every month for three months. Safety evaluation data will be composed by the register of
      adverse events (including type, frequency, intensity, seriousness, severity, and action taken
      related to the investigational product), could be include changes in vital signs, physical
      and medical evaluations, laboratory or serology tests and electrocardiogram (ECG), and by the
      incidence of benign and malign neoplasms. Preliminary evidence of efficacy will be evaluated
      by global clinical improvement (CIBIS) and evolution of disease improvement (motor, cognitive
      and behavioral degradation) through Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale - UHDRS and
      inflammatory markers: IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 (interleukin IL) e TNF-alpha (tumoral necrosis factor
      alpha). CNS improvement will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fluctuation in
      suicide tendency grade will be evaluated by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS).The
      immunological response of HD product over the administration period will be evaluated by CD4+
      and CD8+ proliferation and inflammatory markers release.

      Participants who show evidence of loss of clinical benefit achieved over the course of
      treatment verified through worsening greater or equal to that expected for the natural course
      of the disease on motor, cognitive, behavioral and functional capacity symptoms assessed by
      the UHDRS scale, will receive additional doses of the product as long as there is clinical
      benefit at the Investigator's discretion and/or until the product is marketed. The same dose
      used by the subject during the treatment period will be administered throughout the period of
      additional doses.
