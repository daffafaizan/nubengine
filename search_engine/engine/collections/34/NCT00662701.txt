      around the world. It is a large burden on health care resources and may even lead to a
      shorter life expectancy. Drug treatment has been found insufficient and sometimes even
      hazardous to the pt. Traditionally, there was only one invasive approach available, being
      MAZE 3 procedure by means of full open chest cardiac surgery. This was a very invasive
      approach, limited to only a few skilled surgeons, with insufficient options to treat large pt
      volume.

      With the discovery that AF often is initiated and maintained by electrical instability inside
      and around the Pulmonary Veins, catheter ablation is now a widely accepted early invasive
      strategy to cure AF. Success rates of 60% to 90% have been reported, depending on technique
      employed and the type of AF (Resp, chronic versus paroxysmal)
