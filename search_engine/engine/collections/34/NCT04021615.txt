      medical technology and interdisciplinary team cooperation.

      Functional losses , reduced quality of life and survival , and increased healthcare costs are
      consequences of prolonged immobility in ICU.

      The European Respiratory Society and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine task force
      has recommended a hierarchy of ICU mobilization based on progressively increasing exercise
      intensity; decubitus change and functional positioning , passive mobilization , active-
      assisted and active exertion , cycloegonometry in bed , sitting in bed orthostatism , static
      walking , transferring from bed to chair, chair exertion and walking.

      Failure to wean may have different etiologies such as underlying severe respiratory disease,
      respiratory muscle dysfunction , metabolic and endocrine disorders and cognitive dysfunction.
      Peripheral and respiratory muscles dysfunction is a consequence of prolonged mechanical
      ventilation and ICU- acquired weakness. Weaning from mechanical ventilator should be
      considered to be as early as possible to avoid complications caused by absence of spontaneous
      breathing and further muscles atrophy.

      Targeted mobility therapy (TMT) , simulating comprehensive rehabilitation program that will
      be used in the present study, is a novel strategy for managing critically ill patients . This
      concept will work as a scientifically- driven, dynamic bundle of rehabilitation intervention
      that include inspiratory muscle strength training , bronchial hygiene , and active
      mobilization . This concept will guarantee the bet outcomes for critically ill patients with
      difficult and prolonged weaning as regards weaning success , days on mechanical ventilator ,
      length of hospital stay and functional mobility.
