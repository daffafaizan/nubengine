      beneficial partnership between well-established sexual assault prevention researchers and a
      CDC Rape Prevention and Education Program (RPE)-funded community agency to conduct a rigorous
      experimental evaluation of universal primary prevention programming designed to reduce sexual
      aggression among high school boys. The present research tests multi-session prevention
      programming that targets change at multiple levels of the social ecology (i.e., individual-,
      peer- and community-level) through social norms theory and bystander education. Specifically,
      the present research evaluates Your Voice Your View. Your Voice Your View was developed and
      is currently administered in Rhode Island High Schools by the CDC RPE-funded agency Day One
      of Rhode Island. The program will be tested in a group randomized cluster trial among 10th
      graders at 30 high schools, with the aim of reducing perpetration of sexual aggression among
      high school boys.

      Specifically, this research will conduct a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 10th
      grade students to demonstrate efficacy of the intervention in reducing rates of sexual
      aggression among high school boys, rates of dating violence involvement, and related risk and
      protective factors over a 2- and 6-month follow-up in comparison to a wait-list control
      group. Thirty schools will be matched on demographic characteristics (i.e., % receiving
      subsidized lunch, racial/ethnic minority enrollment) and randomized to receive Your Voice
      Your View or to the wait-list control group.
