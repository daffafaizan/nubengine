    
      Eight week open-label flexible dose trial in adult outpatients diagnosed with Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have had a prior failure with escitalopram. Failure is
      operationally defined as either premature discontinuation because of side effects or the
      report of an incomplete response to escitalopram, minimum dose 10mg/day, maintain for 3 weeks
      or more. 10mg/day was chosen because 1) it is the most commonly prescribed single dose of
      escitalopram in clinical practice, 2) it is equivalent to approx. 30mg/day of arcemic
      citalopram and 3) escitalopram has very high potency at the serotonin transporter (Ki=1.1);
      this means that escitalopram would be expected to saturate the transporter at relatively low
      doses. A total of twenty patients will be treated.
