      and Cerecyte coils in comparison to bare platinum coils, the next step is a direct comparison
      of Hydrocoils and non-HydroCoils (Cerecyte or Platinum). Considering the increased costs to
      society of treatment with these new coils, it is essential that the benefits of the new
      technology are properly evaluated against the existing platinum coil technology in a
      scientifically valid manner.
