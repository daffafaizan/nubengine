    
      All parturients will receive oral ranitidine 150 mg on the night and the morning of surgery
      and 30 mL of 0.3 mol/L sodium citrate, 15 min before induction.

      All operations will be performed by the same obstetricians. Voluven 6% solution 7 mL/kg will
      be infused over 30 min. Left uterine displacement will be maintained before induction. All
      routine medications except angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will be continued until
      the morning of the operation.

      All patients will be monitored with pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure and five
      leads electrocardiography (leads II and V5). A radial artery catheter and a central venous
      catheter will be placed under local anesthesia before induction. On-screen pressure tracing
      will be used to determine end-expiration, and the CVP will be averaged over three respiratory
      cycles to eliminate respiratory artifacts. All staff in the operating room will be unaware of
      the randomization code.

      After pre-oxygenation for 5 min, a rapid sequence induction will be performed with propofol
      1-2.5 mg/kg and suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Cricoid pressure will be applied, laryngoscopy will
      be performed after the 1-min blood pressure recording, and tracheal intubation will be
      completed before the 2-min reading. Anesthesia will be maintained with end-tidal
      concentrations of 2-2.5% of sevoflurane, in combination with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen and
      cisatarcurium 0.1-0.2 mg/kg. The patients' lungs will be ventilated to maintain an EtCO2 of
      4-4.6 kPa.

      After the umbilical cord was clamped, infusion of 5-10 U oxytocin, midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and
      fentanyl 1-2 µg/kg will be given and nitrous oxide will be increased to 70%. Sevoflurane will
      be discontinued at the start of skin closure and the nitrous oxide will be discontinued after
      the last skin suture will be applied. At the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular block
      will be antagonized with neostigmine 50 µg/kg and atropine 20 µg/kg, and trachea will be
      extubated.

      Intraoperative hypertension, defines as increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) >= 25%
      of baseline for more than 1 min, with or without associated tachycardia (defined as HR value
      > 20% of the baseline value > 2 min) will be treated with IV boluses of fentanyl (1μg/kg). If
      blood pressure levels do not reach at least 20% of baseline levels after 5 min, slow
      intravenous administration of labetalol 20 mg will be considered. In the presence of
      hypotensive episodes (MAP decreased to <= 60 mmHg >= 2-3 min) and CVP < 8 mmHg, 5-7 ml/kg of
      6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 will be given. In the presence of MAP ≤ 60 mmHg, and CVP > 10
      mmHg, repeated bolus doses of ephedrine 5 mg will be given 5 min apart from each dose.
      Tachycardia ≥ 20% from the baseline values for ≥ 1 min will be treated with boluses of
      esmolol 20 mg.
