      individuals and concerns over 30 000 patients in France for example. As of today, there isn't
      any reliable specific blood analysis that can be used to assess the prognosis of SLE, that
      means predict a SLE flare. The discovery of such a blood test could allow a better patients'
      monitoring in order to help doctors to better adapt treatments (lowering background
      treatments when they are not needed and increase them ahead of a potential flare when the
      risk assessment raises).

      In SLE patients, a recent study shows elevated levels of GADD34 RNA in mononuclear blood
      cells : higher than twice the control levels for 36 of the 60 SLE patients and ten times
      higher than the control levels for 13 of the 60 SLE patients.

      Given that GADD34 has been described as a potential key regulator of pro-inflammatory
      cytokine production in human and elevated blood marker in SLE patients, this study aim to
      prove that the GADD34 RNA level in mononuclear blood cells can be used as a prognostic marker
      to assess the risk of SLE flare.
