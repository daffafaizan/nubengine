      increasing self-efficacy among caregivers with food insecurity in the household. CRx-H is
      recruiting primary caregivers of hospitalized children at a large urban children's hospital
      at the time of admission. Aim 1: Researchers are studying whether the intervention will
      increase self-efficacy among food insecure caregivers compared to those who receive the usual
      standard of care. Aim 2: Researchers will enroll and randomize caregivers with and without
      food insecurity to the intervention to compare satisfaction with care.

      Eligible, self-identified caregivers will complete a baseline survey during the child's
      hospital stay, followed by phone surveys at 7, 30, 90, 180 days, and 12 months. Caregivers
      randomized to the intervention will receive a tailored list of resources to address food
      insecurity and other health-related social needs, plus a brief educational component
      delivered by a trained member of our research team. Cases will receive a "booster" dose of
      the resource list prior to discharge. After discharge, cases will receive proactive text
      messages about those same community resources.

      All caregivers (regardless of research arm) will receive a series of text messages related to
      the study such as reminders to schedule the phone survey with a member of the research team.
