      with the conventional diagnostic aspiration needle, that uses an excitation laser light to
      create 'real-time' microscopic images of tissues. Therefore this technique provides
      additional information regarding the nodal status and could therefore improve the diagnostic
      yield of EUS-FNA. Specifically, we will describe the nCLE image characteristics of lymph
      nodes involved in lung cancer and sarcoidosis as well as in healthy lymph nodes. Improved
      characterization of mediastinal nodes might lead to improved diagnosis.
