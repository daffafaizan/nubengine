      numbers of older adults hospitalized for an acute medical or surgical condition. Dementia and
      delirium, the most common causes of CI among these elders, is associated with higher
      mortality rates, increased morbidity and higher health care costs. A growing body of science
      suggests that these patients and their caregivers are particularly vulnerable to systems of
      care that either do not recognize or ignore their needs. The consequences are devastating for
      the patients and their caregivers and add tremendous burden to hospital staffs coping with a
      severe shortage of nurses. For these reasons, the Institute of Medicine identified improved
      care management of this patient group as a national priority for action. Unfortunately,
      little evidence is available to guide optimal care of this patient group or to address the
      unique needs of their caregivers. Collectively, available evidence suggests that these
      patients may benefit from interventions aimed at improving management of CI, comorbid
      conditions or both but the exact nature and intensity of intervention needed to effectively
      and efficiently improve their outcomes and those of their caregivers is not known. Thus, the
      timing is excellent for rigorous research aimed at identifying care management strategies
      that will result in high quality, cost-effective outcomes for this challenging patient group
      and their caregivers.
