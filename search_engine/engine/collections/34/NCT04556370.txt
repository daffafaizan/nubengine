      neonatal morbidity and mortality. Because of constricted myometrial spiral arteries with
      exaggerated vasomotor responsiveness, though blood pressure in parturients with preeclampsia
      are apparently higher than healthy parturients, placental hypoperfusion is more common.
      Spinal anesthesia is still the preferred mode of anesthesia in parturients with preeclampsia
      for cesarean section. In preeclampsia parturients, spinal anesthesia improve intervillous
      blood flow (provided that hypotension is avoided) which contribute to increase placental
      perfusion. Even so, 17-26% parturients with preeclampsia experienced postspinal anesthesia
      hypotension due to the extensive sympathetic block that occurred with spinal anesthesia. As a
      potential substitute drug for phenylephrine and ephedrine, norepinephrine has gained traction
      for use in parturients undergoing cesarean section. But the suitable infusion dose of
      norepinephrine in parturients with preeclampsia is still unknown. The purpose of this study
      is to investigate the suitable infusion dose of norepinephrine for prophylaxis against
      post-spinal anesthesia hypotension in parturients with preeclampsia undergoing cesarean
      section.
