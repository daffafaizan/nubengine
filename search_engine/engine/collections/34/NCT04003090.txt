    
      At the visit all patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examination including best
      corrected visual acuity assessment, slit lamp evaluation, IOP measurement using Goldmann
      applanation tonometry, and fundus dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy.

      Additionally, all patients had central retinal thickness measurements with spectral-domain
      optical coherence tomography associated with central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal
      endothelial cells density (ECD) evaluations.

      Patients started the treatment with 1 drop of a solution of citicoline 1% eye-drops, 0.2%
      hyaluronic acid and 0.01% benzalkonium chloride for 3 times/day over a total time of 14 days
      before surgery and 1 drop 2 hours prior to the surgery.

      Five patients served as controls and received a vehicle solution without citicoline.

      The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the presence and concentration of citicoline and
      its metabolites (choline, cytidine and uridine) in the vitreous body in vivo in human eyes
      after topical eye-drops administration by means of high performance liquid chromatography.

      Secondary aims were the comparison of citicoline and its metabolites concentration in the
      vitreous of treated phakic and pseudophakic eyes and the correlations with age and ocular
      biometric parameters including CCT and ECD.
