      in random order for six weeks with a washout period of at least 14 days, daily 10 g of echium
      oil or a high-oleic acid sunflower oil (HOSO) as control.

      Thirty-six healthy men and women, aged 18-70 yrs, with a body mass index between 25 and 35
      kg/m2 will participate. Subjects with an increased BMI are at increased risk to develop
      hypertriglyceridemia.

      During the experimental period, subjects will receive daily one sachet at lunch and one
      sachet at dinner each providing 5 g of echium oil. During the control period, subjects will
      receive daily at the same time points sachets with the same amount of HOSO.

      The main study parameter is the change in fasting serum triacylglycerol concentrations. The
      secondary endpoint is the change in the omega-3 index.
