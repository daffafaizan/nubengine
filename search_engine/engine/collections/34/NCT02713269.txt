    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To document the rate of local control at 6 months in patients who receive a combination of
      thermal ablation and stereotactic spine radiosurgery (SSRS) for spine metastases with
      moderate to severe epidural involvement.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine local control at 1, 3, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, and to compare to a
      historical control where patients received only SSRS at these time points and at 12 months.

      II. To document the extent of epidural tumor regression at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months.

      IIa. Calculate decrease in epidural tumor volume (by volumetric measurements). IIb. Calculate
      increase in thecal sac patency (by volumetric measurements and according to Bilsky method).

      III. To determine overall survival at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. IV. To assess changes in
      muscle strength, location and severity of spinal-related pain, sensory function, ability to
      ambulate, and neurological grading at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months compared with
      pretreatment baselines.

      V. To assess the effect of treatment on quality of life (QOL), measured at 1 month and every
      3 months after with validated outcome measure tools.

      VI. To describe adverse side effects after treatment and to descriptively correlate those
      effects with radiographic findings, pain control, and quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo thermal ablation and computed tomography (CT)-guided SSRS via
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy on different dates within a 1-14 day window. The order
      of treatment is at the doctor's discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      and then every 6 months.
