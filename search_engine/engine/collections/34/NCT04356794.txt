      dialysis. End-stage renal disease, a decrease in HRV is typically found, with abnormal HRV
      being considered an independent risk factor for mortality.While the majority of studies show
      an initial improvement in symptoms, longer studies and clinical experience show that either
      treatment efficacy decreases with time, and/or augmentation develops: dopaminergic
      augmentation has been reported to be the main reason for treatment discontinuation and
      treatment failure in RLS/WED.

      The study randomly assigned to either true acupuncture treatment or placebo/sham acupuncture
      treatment. Each participant will undergo 8 treatments twice-weekly, for a period of 4 weeks.
      At the end of the eighth treatment session, each participant will again fill out a IRLSRS
      questionnaire and HRV test.Then following a 4-week washout period, patients will be crossed
      over to either placebo/sham or true acupuncture treatment, again 8 twice-weekly treatments,
      for a period of 4 weeks. At the end of the second treatment regimen all participants will
      again fill out a IRLSRS questionnaire and HRV test.
