    
      The BATwire Study is a prospective study of up to 180 subjects enrolled at up to 25 U.S.
      sites. A total of 71 subjects will be implanted with the BAROSTIM NEO System using the
      BATwire Kit after all screening is complete and all enrollment criteria are met. The study
      will evaluate the implant experience, safety and effectiveness of the BATwire kit.

      All subjects will be implanted, and the device will be activated prior to being discharged.
      Follow-up visits will occur at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months post implant. Once the 12-month
      visit has been completed, the subject is withdrawn from the study and followed in a
      commercial setting.
