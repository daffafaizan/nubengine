      exercise training on ED among 50 sedentary men undergoing radical prostatectomy for
      clinically localized prostate cancer. This project has three specific aims:

        -  Specific Aim #1: To determine the effects of aerobic exercise training versus wait-list
           control on incidence of ED among sedentary men undergoing radical prostatectomy for
           clinically localized prostate cancer.

        -  Hypothesis #1: Aerobic exercise training will be associated with a significantly lower
           incidence of ED compared with usual care among sedentary men undergoing radical
           prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.

        -  Specific Aim #2: To determine the effects of aerobic exercise training versus wait-list
           control on changes in patient symptoms (i.e., erectile function score, sexual
           functioning, urinary incontinence, and QOL) and the number of men receiving
           phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor therapy as well as therapy dose.

        -  Hypothesis #2: Aerobic exercise training will improve patient symptoms and reduce the
           number of men requiring PDE-5 inhibitor therapy.

        -  Specific Aim #3: To determine the effects of aerobic exercise training versus wait-list
           control on changes in postulated biologic mechanisms that may underlie the relationship
           between exercise training and ED [i.e., CVD risk factors (cardiorespiratory fitness,
           lipid profile, blood pressure, c-reactive protein, body composition), cardiac function,
           and penile and brachial artery endothelial function].

        -  Hypothesis #3: Aerobic exercise training will be associated with favorable changes in
           postulated candidate mechanisms.
