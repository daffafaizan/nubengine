      Emend, in reducing post-operative nausea and vomiting in morbidly obese patients.
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting that occurs in morbidly obese patients can greatly
      increase the chances of complications during the post-operative period. By treating morbidly
      obese patients with Aprepitant, the goal is to reduce the risk of such complications that may
      be induced by nausea and vomiting.
