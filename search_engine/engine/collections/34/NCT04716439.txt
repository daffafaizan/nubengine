        1. Decrease anesthetic consumption

        2. Decrease use of muscle relaxants

        3. Decrease analgesic consumption

        4. Excellent recovery

      Patients & Methods:

        -  2 groups (total 50) Randomized Controlled Double Blind (RCDB) Study

        -  Propofol + remifentanil + saline (Control = C group)

        -  Propofol + remifentanil + Mgso4 (Magnesium = M group)

        -  Adult Spine decompression and fixation After getting the Institutional Review Board
           (IRB) approval, This randomized controlled double blind study includes 2 groups of
           patients (each group 25) will be enrolled in the study. All patients undergo spine
           decompression and fixation surgery

      Induction:

      All patients in the study will receive iv fentanyl 2 mic/kg + propofol 2mg/kg and
      endotracheal intubation will be facilitated with rocuronium 0.60 mg/ kg. Then anesthesia will
      be maintained using total intravenous anesthesia with propofol (6-9 mg/kg/hr) + remifentanil
      (0.03-0.05 mic / kg/ min) Group 1 (C group) : Receive 10 mg/kg /hr 0.9% Normal Saline Group 2
      (M group) : Receive 10 mg/kg/hr Magnesium Sulfate

      Monitoring:

        1. IONM

        2. train-of-four (TOF)

        3. bispectral index (BIS)

      Measurements:

        1. IO Anesthetic Consumption

        2. IO Hemodynamics

        3. somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP), motor evoked potential (MEP), TOF, BIS Readings

        4. PO visual analogue scale (VAS) (24hours)

        5. PO Morphine Consumption (24hours)
