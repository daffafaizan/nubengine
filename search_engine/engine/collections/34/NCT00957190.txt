      immunotherapy will be recruited.

      A complete routine ophthalmic examination including biomicroscopy, gonioscopy and fundus
      ophthalmoscopy will be performed. The eye with better visual acuity is selected for fundus
      flowmetry.

      All patients will undergo a complete diurnal workup including IOP, as well as 10am Confocal
      scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg Retina Tomography-3) of ONH topography. Optic nerve
      head, nasal and temporal peripapillary retinal blood flow are measured with scanning laser
      Doppler flowmetry (SLDF; Heidelberg Retinal Flowmeter/Tomograph, SLDF analysis software v3.3,
      Heidelberg Engineering, Germany Goldmann IOP will be measured at 8am, 10am 2pm and 4pm. Pulse
      amplitude, similar to Pulsatility Ocular Blood Flow (POBF) will be measured using the Pascal
      Dynamic Contour Tonometer (DCT) at 8am, 10am, 2pm, and 4 pm.

      All procedures will conform to the Declaration of Helsinki and the study will be approved by
      the Ethics Committee and each patient will sign an informed consent form.

      Following visit one, Cosopt will be added to the patients therapy (bid). Following 6 weeks of
      therapy patients will return for visit two. Cosopt will be applied by the investigator at 8am
      on visit 2.

      We expect that this blood flow will be improved with COSOPT therapy and that the diurnal
      fluctuation of this parameter will be improved as well. It is evidently of great interest to
      examine diurnal changes in ocular blood flow with and without COSOPT and the measurement of
      POBF can be performed without great cost and is well tolerated by the patient.

      Changes in IOP, ONH Topography, and ONH blood flow will be analysed using appropriate
      statistical approaches
