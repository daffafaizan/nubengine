      Cruz, Bolivia), between May 2018 and June 2018, will be analyzed. All the patients are
      current or ex-smokers, complaining of dyspnea, cough or expectorations. Spirometry
      measurements will be performed with a Medisoft Body Box 5500 by one highly trained and
      experienced pulmonologist according to the guidelines of the ATS/ERS.

      The criteria used to detect airway obstruction are either the fixed cut-off points according
      to GOLD recommendations (FEV1/FVC<0.70) or the lower limit of normal (FEV1/FVC<LLN). These
      indices will be compared to a fixed cut-off FEV1/FEV6 <0.73 as proposed by Vandevoorde et al.
      or to a FEV1/FV6 ration < LLN. Reference equations used are those of Caucasians from the
      NHANES III survey.

      Statistical tests will be done using IBM SPSS 24 software. Cohen's κ will be used to
      determine if there is an agreement between the definitions of airway obstruction.
