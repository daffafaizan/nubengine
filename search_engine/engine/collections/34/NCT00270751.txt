      especially regarding the method of pleurodesis. Previous studies have shown that
      thoracoscopic apical pleurectomy is a reliable method with a very low incidence of
      recurrence. However, this procedure is more technical demanding and time consuming through
      thoracoscopy. In addition, a more extensive pleural injury may cause impaired pulmonary
      function and a higher risk of perioperative complication such as hemothorax. In our previous
      studies, we have shown that thoracoscopic pleural abrasion with minocycline instillation is
      an easy and convinent method of pleurodesis which decreases the rate of recurrence without
      affecting pulmonary function. In this study, we hypothesized that pleural abrasion with
      minocycline instillation is as effective as apical pleurectomy in preventing pneumothorax
      recurrence while the short-term and long-term complications are less.
