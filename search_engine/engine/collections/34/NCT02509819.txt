      crossover design (for Aim 2). It will be conducted in the Military Performance Lab (MPL) at
      the Center for the Intrepid (CFI), Brooke Army Medical Center, Joint Base San Antonio
      (JBSA)Fort Sam Houston, Texas. Subjects who use IDEOs will come to the Military Performance
      Lab for one test session during which they will walk in standardized shoes with six different
      heel wedges in random order. Control data will also be collected on able-bodied individuals.
      Control subjects will also come to the MPL for one test session in which they will walk using
      the same standardized shoes. For all subjects, biomechanical gait data will be collected as
      the subjects walk along a walkway in the MPL. This data will be used to calculate roll-over
      shape, instantaneous radius of curvature, Center of Pressure (COP) velocity, and ankle
      moment.
