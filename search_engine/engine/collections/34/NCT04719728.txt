    
      Materials and Methods:

      - It is a prospective study on cochlear implant recipients in sohag cochlear implant unite
      from 2014: 2020.

      • Subjects: Cochlear implant recipients in sohag cochlear implant unite from 2014: 2020.

      Subjects will be divided into 2 categories:

        1. Prelingual patients: subdivided into 3 groups

             -  Cochlear implant recipient with no medical or radiological issues.

             -  Cochlear implant recipients with medical concern or with other disabilities as
                syndromic patients.

             -  Cochlear implant recipients with radiological issues.

        2. Postlingual patients: subdivided into 3 groups

             -  Cochlear implant recipients with no medical or radiological issues.

             -  Cochlear implant recipients with medical concern or with other disabilities as
                syndromic patients.

             -  Cochlear implant recipients with radiological issues.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients who received cochlear implant at Sohag university hospital and fulfill the following
      criteria:

        -  Age: from one year up to 60.

        -  Prelingual who had one year of regular speech therapy

        -  Postlingual patients.

           • Method:

             1. Background information:

                  -  History: Age, gender, Age at which hearing loss occur, cause of hearing loss,
                     duration of hearing loss.

                  -  Family support.

                  -  Expectation of patient (if post lingual patient).

                  -  Expectation of parents.

             2. Hearing assessment:

        -  Aided Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA) level.

        -  Speech perception

             1. speech perception threshold (SRT).

             2. Speech perception in quiet for patients who developed language and postlingual
                patients using phonetically Balanced words for kinder garden ( PBKG) words,
                phonetically balanced words for adult (PBA), word intelligibility by picture
                identification (WIPI) or minimal birds.

             3. Speech in noise test: for patients who developed language and post lingual
                patients.

                3- Impedance telemetry. 4- Electrically evoked action potential (ECAP). 5- Cortical
                evoked P1N1 potential. Informed written consent will be taken from all Participant
                patients or their legal guardians.

                This search will submit for approval from Research Ethics committee of Sohag
