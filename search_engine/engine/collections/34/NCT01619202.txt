      Teen drivers (ages 16 to 19) are four times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than
      adult drivers (ages 25 to 69). Driving simulators are a safer alternative to on-road
      assessments that are often affordable and can provide experimental control for research.
      Though driving simulators have advantages for evaluating driving performance in teens, there
      are gaps in the literature on the validity of a multidimensional outcome of driving
      performance in a simulator. To further examine the validity of a multidimensional measure of
      driving performance in a simulator, we compare simulated driving performance among teens who
      are trained hazard anticipation-perception training and those who are not.
