      comprised of 240 BC patients in palliative and curative care (comprised of 50% Jewish and 50%
      Arab). This population will be randomized to receive a standard art therapy intervention or a
      comparison group. The AT intervention is an 8-week group intervention comprised of 8 1.5 hour
      weekly sessions conducted by an experienced Art Therapist The comparison group will engage in
      the coloring of prefabricated shapes (mandalas) and will receive Psychoeducation on topics
      related to coping with BC, identical to the topics of the AT group. This design will allow
      the study to test the mechanism of AT that is beyond the effects of time with a group, focus
      on a task and engagement with art materials.
