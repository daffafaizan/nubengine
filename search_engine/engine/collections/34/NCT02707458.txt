      the US, but remains in clinical use in Asia. In rodents, probucol increases synthesis and
      availability of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). ApoE is the protein
      product of the polymorphic gene APOE, allelic variation in which remains the strongest known
      risk factor (other than age itself) for Alzheimer's dementia. Oral Probucol is absorbed
      variably. Administration of a single, fixed dose therefore results in a wide range of plasma
      concentrations when the drug is given to various individuals in a fixed dosage. Limited human
      data suggest that higher plasma and CSF concentrations of probucol result in stronger
      increases in CSF apoE concentration. The dual aims of DEPEND are therefore 1) to develop an
      individualized dosing regimen that will result in plasma concentrations that are likely to
      increase CSF apoE concentration by 50%; and 2) to treat 20 persons at elevated risk of
      Alzheimer's dementia, each at his/her ideal individual dosage, for 12 months, observing the
      resulting change in CSF concentrations of apoE. Simultaneously, subjects will be observed
      carefully for evidence of any treatment effects on cognition or other probable markers of
      progression in pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease, as well as safety risks that might deter
      further human experimentation with the drug.
