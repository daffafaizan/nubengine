      AEDs also affect the EKG. Lacosamide is a new AED that selectively enhances slow inactivation
      of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal
      membranes and inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing. Information is lacking about the
      effect of lacosamide on brain and heart rhythms.
