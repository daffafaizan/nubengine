      failure and that is related to clinical condition, we will study the effects of 3 different
      treatments (clinical usual treatment,ultrafiltration and isovolumetric hemofiltration with
      diuretics) to participants are followed until discharge to Adrenomedullin level and clinical
      outcomes,and also their relationship with angiotensin II level, brain natriuretic
      peptide(BNP), sympathetic nervous system and oxydative stress.

      The patients will be randomized in three different treatment group and analyzed in three
      moments: on the randomization, at discharge and 90 days after randomization(plus or minus 3).

      The clinical treatment will be optimized, the ultrafiltration will be done until clinically
      adequate fluid removal or until hematocrit increased 10% from basal level, and isovolumetric
      hemofiltration will be done for 8 hours- dose of 35 ml/kg/h in association with diuretic. All
      this dialytic procedures will be done with PAES membrane- filter HF1400 and automatic
      machine.
