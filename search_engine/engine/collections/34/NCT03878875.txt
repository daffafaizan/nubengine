      STUDY DESIGN

      Type of Study: Basic Science Study, Between Groups Trial Aim: To investigate if previous
      sound conditioning reduces susceptibility to TTS and tinnitus when comparing to those without
      prior exposure.

      Purpose: To increase understanding on the effects of noise exposure. Duration: Data
      collection will be completed by February 2020 Participants: 40 normal hearing young (18-35)
