      treatment option for diseased aortic valves and offers benefits compared to conventional
      valve replacement. At the moment no prospective randomized trials evaluating the role of the
      TriRec procedure are available and factors contributing to long- term durability are unknown.

      The investigators want to examine aortic flow patterns with 4D- Flow- Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) in patients after the TriRec procedure or biological prosthetic valve
      replacement in a prospective randomized trial. Flow patterns in the ascending aorta, examined
      with 4D- Flow- MRI, show nearly laminar flow patterns and no outflow obstruction in healthy
      subjects with tricuspid aortic valves. In contrast, helical flow patterns, turbulences and
      increased flow velocities are observed in diseased valves and also after valve replacement
      with mechanical or biological prostheses. These helical flow patterns seem to influence
      aortic wall remodeling and may contribute to structural valve dysfunction of biological
      prosthesis.

      The investigators hypothesize that after TriRec procedure more physiological flow patterns
      will be observed, compared to biological valve prosthesis. The results can contribute to
      understand mechanisms for long- term performance of this technique and determine the role of
      this novel technique for treatment of aortic valve disease.
