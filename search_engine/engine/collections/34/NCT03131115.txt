    
      Patients with lateral nasal wall collapse who are eligible for surgical repair will be
      presented with the opportunity to participate. Once consented, standard pre-operative
      evaluation will be performed including evaluation of degree of lateral nasal wall collapse.
      They will also be screened with validated quality of life screening tools for nasal
      congestion, which include the NOSE scale and a visual analog scale. They will then be
      randomized to treatment either with Lateral crura strut graft or bone anchored suture
      suspension, in combination with likely other areas of functional rhinoplasty such as
      septoplasty and turbinate reduction. All of our patients will be seen 1 week, 2-3 month and 1
      year after surgery
