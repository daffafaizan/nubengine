      total hip arthroplasty (THA) with the use of a dual mobility bearing versus a single bearing
      design with the use of a large femoral head (36mm or 40mm). We hypothesize the use of
      dual-mobility components in revision THA will be associated with a lower dislocation rate in
      the first year following surgery.
