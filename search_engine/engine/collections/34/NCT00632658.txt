      painful chronic illness with the side effects of long term steroid use. The number of stem
      cell transplants done in children is only growing given that we are now transplanting
      patients with a variety of nonmalignant disorders and given the use of alternative donor
      sources. The broad categories of limited and extensive cGVHD are recognized by clinicians,
      but are not particularly useful in clinical practice. Since cGVHD may involve almost every
      organ system adn since cGVHD constitutes a waxing and waning nature, cGVHD makes clinical
      management very difficult and complicated. Currently, there is a symptoms scale used in the
      adult population for measuring symptom burden for adults with cGVHD. This scale is called the
      "Lee Symptoms Scale". The purpose of this project is to develop a scale that is similar in
      design to the Lee Scale, but it is specifically designed to measure the burden of cGVHD in
      the pediatric population
