    
      This is a phase II trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a drug-free run-in phase
      (phase 1), followed by a placebo controlled double-blind phase (phase 2). Patients will
      receive either R093877 0.5 mg o.d., 1 mg o.d. or 2 mg o.d. or placebo for a period of 4
      weeks.

      Phase 1 is a run-in period of 4 weeks duration, during which the bowel habit is documented
      and the existence of constipation confirmed. At the start of this period all existing
      laxative medication is withdrawn but patients will be instructed not to change their dietary
      habits, in particular their fibre intake during the trial. Patients will enter the
      double-blind phase if constipation has been shown to be present during the run-in period.

      If the definition of constipation was not met during the 4 weeks of the run-in period,
      double-blind treatment will not be started.

      Phase 2 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase, in which patients will be
      treated for 4 weeks with either 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg of R093877 or placebo given once daily
      (one capsule is taken before breakfast).

      Patients admitted to the double blind treatment period will be randomly allocated to one of
      the 4 treatment arms.
