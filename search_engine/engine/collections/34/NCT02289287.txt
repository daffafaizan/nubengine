      Standard Care group. Within 3 weeks after enrollment all participants will undergo baseline
      assessment using a predefined set of scales and questionnaires (intervention group will
      additionally undergo a semi-structured interview). The group-intervention (SM program) will
      begin after enrollment of at least 4 participants to the intervention group, and within no
      longer than 5 weeks since enrollment. The intervention will include 12 weekly sessions, each
      session 2.5 hour long, and will be based on well-known SM interventions that were found
      effective for stroke patients in the U.S. Standard care will include 'one-on-one' sessions in
      each paramedical discipline as given regularly in this setting (average of 15-20 sessions per
      patient). Follow-up measures will be performed within a week after the end of the
      intervention, and 6 months thereafter, in order to examine long term effectiveness. Outcome
      measures are questionnaires; change will be assessed by the difference in total score between
      T1 |(pre-intervention), T2 (post-intervention) and T3 (after 6 months)
