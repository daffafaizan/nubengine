      versus online CBT-I, versus a wait-list in reducing symptoms of insomnia (assessed
      subjectively by self-report and objectively with actigraphy) experienced in pregnancy. The
      investigators hypothesize that participants who receive a 6-week program of either in-person
      CBT-I or online CBT-I (versus a wait-list) will report fewer insomnia symptoms and have
      improved objectively assessed sleep measured at one-week post-treatment. Based on previous
      research findings, the investigators do not expect that there will be a difference between
      in-person CBT-I and online CBT-I administration.

      The secondary aim is to investigate if CBT-I versus a wait-list will reduce symptoms of
      depression at one-week post-treatment. The investigators hypothesize that participants who
      receive in-person CBT-I and online CBT-I (versus a wait-list) will report fewer depressive
      symptoms measured at one-week post-treatment.
