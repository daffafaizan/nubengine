      Lausanne uses elastomeric pumps for continuous intravenous administration of 6 different
      antibiotics. This mode of administration is possible for all antibiotics with a
      time-dependent bactericidal effect.

      Meropenem belongs to this class of antibiotics, but is not stable at room temperature in
      elastomeric pumps. However, this antibiotic is stable at 10°C and 15°C. The investigators
      have therefore developed an isothermal pouch that allows the anti-infective solution to be
      maintained at a temperature between 10 and 15°C over 24 hours.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of meropenem administration using an
      elastomeric pump maintained at a temperature between 10° and 15°C by an isothermal pouch.

      The possibility of being able to administer meropenem by elastomeric pumps would greatly
      facilitate the ambulatory management of patients requiring treatment with this anti-infective
      drug.
