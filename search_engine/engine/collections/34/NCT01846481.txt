      clinic from the evening before Day -1 up and until the morning of Day 9. On the morning of
      Day 1, a 50 mg intravenous (IV) infusion of cocaine will be administered over 10 minutes to
      all subjects. If none of the stopping criteria were met and no intervening safety concerns,
      subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment sequences on Day 3. On dosing days, Day 3
      and Day 6, subjects will have fasted at least 8 hours before dosing of cocaine and either
      RBP-8000 200 mg, RBP-8000 100 mg or matching placebo.
