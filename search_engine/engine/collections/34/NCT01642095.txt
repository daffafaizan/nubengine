    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is expressed and if FAK is phosphorylated
      in pediatric renal tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for FAK expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
      IHC staining is compared in normal renal tissue, Wilms tumor (routine and anaplastic),
      malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, and mesoblastic
      nephroma.
