      eligibility within 28 days of dosing.

      Twelve subjects will receive single doses of the following treatments in a fixed sequence:

      Treatment A: Intravenous injection of 1.5 mg PTG-300. Treatment B: 40 mg (40 mg/mL) PTG-300
      administered subcutaneously. Treatment C: 40 mg (200 mg/mL) PTG-300 administered
      subcutaneously. Treatment D: 40 mg (40 mg/mL) PTG-300 administered intramuscularly.

      There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between Treatment A and Treatment B and at
      least 12 days between Treatments B, C, and D.

      Subjects' safety will be monitored, and blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics (serum iron, serum ferritin, serum transferrin, and transferrin
      saturation [TSAT]).
