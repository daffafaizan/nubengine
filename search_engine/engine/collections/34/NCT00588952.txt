      developing alcoholism. These individuals have been shown to decrease dysphoric responses to
      alcohol self-administration that may promote the excessive use of alcohol. Ethanol has been
      shown to be an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor. We have
      recently shown that sober alcoholics have decreased dysphoric response to the NMDA
      antagonist, ketamine. We propose to test the hypothesis that this characteristic exists as a
      vulnerability factor in those individuals susceptible to develop alcoholism. Specifically,
      the objective is to determine whether individuals with a family history positive (FHP) for
      alcoholism will experience less dysphoric, anxiogenic, and psychotogenic effects to ketamine
      infusion when compared to family history negative (FHN) control subjects.

      Male and female subjects, FHP (biological father and one other first degree relative) between
      the ages of 21-30, and matched controls (FHN) will complete 2 test days in a randomized
      balanced order under double-blind conditions. Test days will involve the 60-minute
      intravenous infusion of placebo and ketamine. Outcome measures include the Biphasic Alcohol
      Scale and visual analog scales for mood states. Secondary measures include visual analog
      scales for high, similarity to ethanol, the Sensation Scale (a validated measure of
      ethanol-like sensations) and aspects of craving for alcohol.
