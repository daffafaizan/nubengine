    
      This is a randomized, two-arm, open-label, multicenter phase II trial. Our primary purpose is
      to compare that PFS of patients with trastuzumab, AI plus pyrotinib and trastuzumab plus an
      AI for HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive MBC or locally advanced breast cancer
      (LABC).

      Eligible patients will randomized to a ratio of 1:1 to pyrotinib+ trastuzumab + aromatase
      inhibitor (experimental group) or trastuzumab+aromatase inhibitor (control group).
      Stratification factors were 1)time since adjuvant hormone therapy (<=12 months/>12 months/no
      prior hormone therapy); 2) lesion (visceral; non-visceral).

      In treatment period, patients will be administrated trastuzumab plus aromatase inhibitors,
      with or without pyrotinib, every 21 days for 1 cycle, until disease progression, toxicity
      intolerance, withdrawal of informed consent, patients judged must be terminated study
      termination.

      The imaging evaluation was performed according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria every 6 weeks.
