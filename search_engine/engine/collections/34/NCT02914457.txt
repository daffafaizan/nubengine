    
      The following pacing configurations will be evaluated.

      Biventricular pacing (BiV):

      Pacing will be performed on one LV electrode pair, (at 3 different longitudinal locations),
      and on the tip of the RV-lead. In total, three different pacing BiV settings will be
      evaluated. Configuration 1: RV + LV lateral Apex, Configuration 2: RV + LV lateral Mid,
      Configuration 3: RV + LV lateral Base (Reference: Standard CRT)

      MultiSpot simultaneous LV-ventricular pacing (MultiSpot-SYN):

      Pacing will be performed on 3 electrodes on the LV wall, placed at different longitudinal
      locations, and on the tip of the RV-lead simultaneously. Configuration 4: RV + LV lateral
      Apex + LV lateral Mid + LV lateral Base

      MultiSpot sequential LV-ventricular pacing (MultiSpot-SEQ):

      3 electrodes on the LV wall will be paced sequentially. The RV electrode will be paced
      simultaneously with last paced LV electrode.The timing-sequence and the amount of spots will
      depend on the electrical delays measured during the experiments. Configuration 5: LV lateral
      Apex => LV lateral Mid => LV lateral Base + RV
