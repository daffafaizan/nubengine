      Kenya. The results will enable us to better interpret the results of the main IPTi trial. We
      will assess the efficacy of a three day course of amodiaquine plus three days of artesunate
      (AQ3/AS3) for the treatment of symptomatic, uncomplicated P. falciparum infections. Study
      subjects are febrile children, 6-59 months old, with laboratory-confirmed uncomplicated P.
      falciparum infections. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a
      28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. Children will be followed closely for
      signs of drug failure or recrudescence, and any children failing therapy will be treated with
      Coartem or, if severe, with quinine. We will also perform drug resistance testing on parasite
      samples from children with treatment failure. The results of this efficacy trial will allow
      us to assist policymakers in deciding what drugs should be used for IPTi, should it be
      adopted into national policy.
