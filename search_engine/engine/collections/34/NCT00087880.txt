      tailors them to chronic smokers, who may have numerous previous smoking treatment failures.
      If successful it will: (1) make available a treatment intervention that produces hight long
      term abstinence rates; (2) provide information on variables that predicts success and failure
      in this population of smokers; (3) examine the cost-effectiveness of more intensive, longer
      term treatments.
