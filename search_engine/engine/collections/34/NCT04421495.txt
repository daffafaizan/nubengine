    
      This is a single-arm, multicenter, phase â…£, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of delamanid-containing regimen in men and women aged 18 to 65 years with
      microbiologically confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB in China. A target of 600 participants will be
      enrolled. The study will consist of a screening phase of up to 8 weeks, an open-label study
      treatment phase of 13-20 months, and a follow-up phase of 12-month after end of study
      treatment. During the study treatment phase, participants will receive an MDR-TB regimen
      consisting of 24 weeks of delamanid in combination with 13-20 months of a background regimen.

      Participants will be instructed to take their assigned dose of delamanid with at least 3
      additional probably effective background drugs according to national and international
      guidelines. Delamanid dosage will be 100 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 24 weeks.

      Safety evaluations will include monitoring of AEs, visual acuity testing, routine blood
      examinations (such as hematology, clinical chemistry, HIV, TSH [for subjects receiving PTO]
      measurements), urinalysis, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).

      Participants will initiate treatment with the study regimen if they meet the study
      eligibility criteria.The end of study will be considered as the last contact for the last
      participant in the study.

      A participant will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed the
      13-20 months study treatment phase and the required post-treatment follow-up phase.
      Participants who prematurely discontinue study treatment (unless they withdraw consent) will
      be followed up for 12 months after end of delamanid treatment.
