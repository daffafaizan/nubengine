    
      Urgency Incontinence (where the bladder muscles contract suddenly, causing an immediate urge
      to urinate that is difficult to prevent) is commonly experienced in patients with overactive
      bladder. New findings have discovered that urgency incontinence may be connected to the
      interactions of certain regions of the brain and the bladder. Although this is a common
      problem, researched still do not know how these interactions impact the process of urgency
      incontinence. Furthermore, there is preliminary data to suggest that interventions such as
      Mindful-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) can potentially be used as therapy for UI. The purpose
      of this study is to determine the impact MBSR training on UI symptoms, quality of life, and
      anxiety measures.

      To determine the impact of MBSR training on Urinary Incontinence(UI) symptoms, quality of
      life and anxiety measures in women affected with UI. We hypothesize that participants will
      have significant improvement in UI and anxiety related symptoms and quality of life measures.
