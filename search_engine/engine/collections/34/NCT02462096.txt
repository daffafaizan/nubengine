    
      The ReLeaf catheter system is intended for the creation of tissue leaflets in the deep veins
      where existing valve structures are no longer healthy and effectively moving blood.

      This study aims to treat subjects with a documented history of symptomatic chronic venous
      insufficiency in whom compression therapy for at least 6 months, combined with superficial
      venous and/or perforator surgery have failed to obtain clinical improvement.

      This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of the
      ReLeaf Catheter System in the creation of one or more tissue leaflets in the femoral and/or
      popliteal vein in subjects with chronic venous insufficiency and who meet the protocol entry
      criteria.
