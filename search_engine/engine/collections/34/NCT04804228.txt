      back pain. Patients in the experimental group will receive electrical dry needling at the
      active myofascial trigger points (PGM) of the quadratus lumbar, multifidus, and iliocostal
      muscles (following the PGM maps described by Travell and Simons). The technique will be
      performed using needle electrodes, the generated current will be produced by a TENS device
      with a frequency of 2 Hz and a pulse width of 250 Î¼s, during 30 min of application. The
      therapeutic intervention will be 1 weekly session for a total of 3 weeks.

      The control group will perform an ischemic compression technique in active PGM with a time
      between 20 seconds and 1 minute until pain inhibition is achieved, and finally, analytical
      stretching will be carried out on the quadratus lumbar, multifidus and iliocostal muscles.
      The treatment will consist of 1 weekly session for 3 weeks, in addition they will be provided
      with a training dossier on postural education in their activities of daily life.

      A baseline assessment of the primary and secondary outcome measures will be carried out
      before randomization of the participants to the different groups, an immediate post-treatment
      assessment (1 day after the last intervention) and an assessment one month after the end of
      the intervention ( short-term follow-up).

      The objectives of this study are to compare the repercussions of dry electropuncture versus
      ischemic compression in active PGM plus stretching in terms of pain, functionality, mobility
      of the spine, and quality of life in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain; and
      analyze the impact on active myofascial trigger points in terms of pressure tolerance
      threshold.
