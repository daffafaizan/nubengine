      Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (pProm) is a factor in 40% of preterm births. The
      earlier in pregnancy pProm occurs, the greater the potential latency period. Threats to the
      pregnancy include placental abruption, umbilical cord prolapse, infection, and insufficient
      pulmonary development, and preterm delivery. Management of pProm may include immediate
      delivery, induction, or expectant management.

      It is still unclear what is considered best practice for the course of treatment in pProm
      pregnancies and post- delivery care of pProm babies in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU),
      as well as the long term outcomes of pProm survivors. Unfortunately, there are few recent
      studies available for review and those that exist often do not reflect the current treatments
      or innovations that have taken place, especially in neonatal care. Many of the studies
      available focusing on pProm have very small sample sizes, as well as very short follow-up
      post-delivery, resulting in a wide range of reported outcomes, especially regarding the
      morbidity and mortality associated with pProm.

      The pProm registry is the first of its kind and will provide a large cohort of data for
      study. The purpose of this registry is to better understand pregnancies and births impacted
      by pProm. This includes how pProm is managed in pregnancy and in how pProm neonates are cared
      for in the NICU; identifying trends in expectant management, and to detect short term and
      long term outcomes of those affected.
