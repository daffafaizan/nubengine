      pulmonary rehabilitation is the six-Minute Walking Test (6MWT). However, the realization of
      the 6MWT requires a 30m-long corridor, according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines.
      Lack of sufficient space can prevent the realization of 6MWT, especially for private
      practitioner pulmonologists, and also in hospitals. The six-minute stepper test (ST6) which
      can be performed in a normal room, should be an interesting alternative.
