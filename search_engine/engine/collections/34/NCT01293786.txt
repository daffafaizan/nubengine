      Nevertheless, kidney function deteriorates overtime in a manner not different from CKD
      counterparts. Hypomagnesemia is prevalent in KT recipients secondary to immunosuppressive
      therapy. In addition to serum calcium, phosphate and elemental calcium intake, the
      relationship between low serum magnesium and vascular calcification (VC) has been observed in
      small studies in CKD. Whether low serum magnesium associates with VC in KT has never been
      elucidated. The present study compares vascular calcification between KT and CKD and its
      association with serum magnesium.
