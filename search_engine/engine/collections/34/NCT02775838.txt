      established in two ways. Firstly, each kidney should be measured by a common duplex
      ultrasound measurement to assess the resistance index (RI) in the three poles of the kidney
      (upper, middle, lower pole). Secondly, intraoperative fluorescence angiography is going to be
      performed. Therefore, the camera of the fluorescence angiography system (SPY Elite System,
      Novadaq, USA) is positioned over the organ, and the fluorescence dye (ICG) is applicated
      intravenously. The aim will be to correlate the fluorescence angiography findings with the
      RIs and therefore to establish valuable fluorescence parameters.
