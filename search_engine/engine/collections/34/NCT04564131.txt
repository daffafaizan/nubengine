      pain area. In order to standardize the application, the procedure will start with the left
      foot and end with the right foot. Both feet will be massaged using petroleum jelly for 5
      minutes of relaxation movements, 5 minutes of general foot massage and 5 minutes of standing
      and reflex area corresponding to the painful body area. 5 more minutes will be applied to the
      left foot in order to increase the endorphin secretion and reduce the pain by activating the
      parasympathetic system. Reflexology massage will be applied for a total of 35 minutes in one
      session. Each reflexology area will be stimulated 15 times, as less than 10 stimulation to a
      particular reflexology area does not produce any therapeutic effect and more than 20
      stimulations will be excessive. A total of 3 follow-ups will be done throughout the study. In
      the follow-up sessions; Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4), The Leeds
      Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) , Neuropathic Pain Impact on
      Quality-of-Life questionnaire (NePIQoL) scales will be applied, foot assessment and SWMI test
      will be applied. The 1st follow-up will be done before any intervention in the 1st session,
      the 2nd follow-up will be done after the reflexology application in the 5th session, and the
      3rd follow-up will be done after the reflexology application at the 10th session . There will
      be a break of at least one day between two sessions to relax the body and eliminate toxins.
