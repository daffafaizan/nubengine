    
      COPD exacerbation is a common complication that significantly contributes to the high
      morbidity, mortality and costs associated with COPD. COPD exacerbations are associated with
      heightened lung inflammation that may have systemic implications (e.g., peripheral muscle
      weakness, cognitive impairment, depression, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, and
      atherosclerosis). Statins are potent agents that significantly reduce vascular events in
      patients with increased risks due to prior cardiac or cerebral vascular events and elevated
      lipid profiles. Statins have pleiotropic effects that extend well beyond their lipid lowering
      effects and may be potent anti-inflammatory agents. Retrospective data conducted in COPD
      patients indicate that statin use is associated with markedly decreased rates of COPD
      hospitalization and stabilization of lung function. Decreases in mortality in COPD due to
      complications of flu-like illnesses and deaths due to cardiovascular events have also been
      reported. Inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein and interleukin- 6) are reported to be
      elevated in moderate to severe COPD patients who are prone to exacerbations. Inflammatory
      biomarkers (C-reactive protein and interleukin- 6) are reported to be reduced by statin
      therapy in patients with hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. Treatments that can
      effectively lessen the prevalence and severity of COPD exacerbations are desperately needed
