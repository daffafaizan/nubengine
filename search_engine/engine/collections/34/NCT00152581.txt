      be entered into this study. All 40 patients will be started on the same regimen of 180mg
      Pegylated-Interferon alfa2a (PEGASYS) weekly plus Ribavirin 1000-1200mg daily. HCV RNA in the
      serum will be monitored by qualitative PCR at treatment weeks 4, 8 and 12. Patients who
      become HCV RNA negative at any of the above time-points (4,8 or 12), will be randomised into
      one of three groups to continue the same antiviral regimen for an additional 3 month, 6 month
      or 9 month period. All these patients will subsequently be followed-up and monitored for a
      further 6 months after stopping all antiviral treatment.

      Treatment will be discontinued for patients who remain persistently HCV RNA positive at
      treatment week 12 and they will be withdrawn from the study protocol.
