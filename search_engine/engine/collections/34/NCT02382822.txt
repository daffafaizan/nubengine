      Cardiovascular disease:

      - HIV infection is independently associated with higher prevalence of coronary
      atherosclerosis (assessed by CT angiography)

      Obstructive pulmonary disease:

      - HIV infection is independently associated with higher prevalence of COPD, and independently
      associated with loss of lung function

      Liver disease:

      - HIV infection is independently associated with liver steatosis, steatohepatitis and liver
      fibrosis

      Lipid and fat metabolism:

      - HIV infection is independently associated with alterations in adipose fat tissue and
      dyslipidemia

      Secondary hypothesis:

      Cardiovascular disease:

        -  Viral load and CD4 are independently associated with coronary atherosclerosis (assessed
           by CT angiography) in HIV-infected individuals.

        -  Levels of inflammatory markers can predict coronary atherosclerosis in HIV-infected
           individuals.

        -  Microbial translocation and metabolism are associated with coronary atherosclerosis in
           HIV-infected individuals.

        -  Endothelial dysfunction (assessed by arterial elastography) can predict coronary
           atherosclerosis in HIV-infected individuals

      Obstructive pulmonary disease:

        -  Viral load and CD4 is independently associated with emphysema

        -  HIV is independently associated with pulmonary hypertension (assessed by CT
           angiography), and obstructive lung disease is independently associated with airway
           obstruction

        -  PCP colonization in HIV infected patients is independently associated with obstructive
           lung disease, emphysema and loss of lung function.

        -  Inflammatory markers in HIV infected patients are associated with obstructive lung
           disease and loss of lung function
