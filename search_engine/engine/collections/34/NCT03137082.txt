      Cahill, 2003; Heinsbroek et al., 1991) may mean that guanfacine is particularly efficacious
      in attenuating drinking in women, rather than men with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Thus, the
      investigators propose a double blind, placebo-controlled, 10-week randomized clinical trial
      to examine the effects of Guanfacine XR (3mgs/daily) versus placebo in 60 women with AUD.
      This will include twice weekly appointments comprising medical management and contingency
      management protocols, collection of urine, breathalyzer screens, and vitals. Measures of
      craving and mood will also be assessed. Parallel laboratory challenge studies will also be
      conducted both on admission to out-patient treatment and again following 4 weeks of
      treatment, in order to better elucidate the potentially therapeutic mechanisms of guanfacine.
      Participants will be exposed to a personal stress versus relaxing imagery condition, 1
      condition per day, in a randomized order. Craving, anxiety, mood, cognitive control, heart
      rate and blood pressure (HRBP), and biological stress system markers will be assessed at
      baseline, following imagery and at various recovery timepoints.
