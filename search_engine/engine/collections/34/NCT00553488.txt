      rapid onset of action in comparison to subcutaneous (SC) administration as measured by
      glucose infusion rate (GIR) under glucose clamp conditions.The aim of this study is to
      investigate whether ID administration of regular human insulin or rapid-acting insulin
      analogue leads to reduced postprandial glycemic excursions in comparison to SC application
      under highly standardized experimental conditions. Effects on the occurrence of hypoglycemia
      will also be investigated, as well as pK and pD comparisons between different insulin
      formulations administered ID. This is a mono-center, open-label, randomized, 5-period
      crossover study in patients with type 1 diabetes
