      of this disease, cure rates have remained the same since the introduction of rituximab to
      CHOP chemotherapy, and R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy remains the standard of care. Over the last
      years many phase III trials investigating new agents added to R-CHOP have been performed but
      they have all invariably failed to improve treatment outcomes. Importantly, three of the most
      recently completed phase III trials that were developed based on the cell of origin
      distinction of DLBCL and aimed to improve treatment outcome in the ABC (or non- Germinal
      center B-Cell (GCB)) subtype by adding a targeted agent to R-CHOP have also failed. This
      provides clinical evidence that cell of origin may not be an accurate biomarker for treatment
      decisions. The R - CHOP + investigational drug approach has thus failed either when broadly
      applied to unselected DLBCL patients or when applied to DLBCL patients selected according to
      inaccurate biomarkers such as COO.

      Within this exploratory multicohort phase II trial, SAKK aims to evaluate a PET_CT and ctDNA
      oriented therapy in DLBCL in order to test the following working hypothesis.

        -  acalabrutinib-R-CHOP may improve the progression free survival in genetically defined
           DLBCL harboring the MYD88 L265P and/or CD79A/B mutations;

        -  treatment escalation to acalabrutinib-R-CHOP in DLBCL patients who have positive PET/CT
           (with residual disease scored as Deauville score 4) and no molecular response (<2log10
           reduction of ctDNA) after two courses of R-CHOP could improve the anti-tumour activity
           of R-CHOP;

        -  treatment de-escalation to 4 total R-CHOP courses plus 2 rituximab single agent
           infusions does not compromise the outcome in patients lacking both MYD88 L265P and
           CD79A/B mutations and quickly obtaining both negative PET/CT (Deauville score 1-3) and
           molecular response (>2log10 reduction of ctDNA) after two R-CHOP, and further improve to
           Deauville score 1-2 and absence of ctDNA after two more R-CHOP courses.

      Primary objectives:

        -  Assessing the efficacy of acalabrutinib-R-CHOP in DLBCL harboring MYD88 L265P and/or
           CD79A/B mutations (cohort A)

        -  Assessing the activity of treatment escalation to acalabrutinib-R-CHOP followed by
           acalabrutinib monotherapy in DLBCL patients who are double positive: PET/CT positive
           (Deauville score 4) and no molecular response (<2log10 fold reduction) after two courses
           of R-CHOP (cohort B)

        -  Exploring the feasibility of treatment de-escalation to 4 total R-CHOP courses plus two
           infusions of single agent rituximab in patients lacking both MYD88 L265P and CD79A/B
           mutations and quickly obtaining both negative PET/CT (Deauville score 1-3) and molecular
           response (>2log10 reduction of ctDNA) after two cycles of R-CHOP, which further improve
           to Deauville score 1-2 and absence of ctDNA after two additional R-CHOP courses (cohort
           C).

        -  Exploring clinical implications of having a negative PET/CT (Deauville score 1-3) but no
           molecular response (<2log10 reduction of ctDNA) vs a positive PET/CT (Deauville score 4)
           but molecular response (>2log10 reduction of ctDNA) after two R-CHOP courses (cohort D)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Safety and tolerability of acalabrutinib-R-CHOP

        -  Assessment of prognostic value of baseline PET radiomics indexes, alone or in
           association with other parameters
