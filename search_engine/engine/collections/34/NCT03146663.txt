      study, 24 patients in the 500 mg/m2 arm and 27 patients in the 750 mg/m2 arm. Eligible,
      consenting patients received NUC-1031 by IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day
      cycle. Patients continued to receive NUC-1031 until the occurrence of disease progression and
      underwent imaging every 8 weeks. After disease progression, patients were followed for
      overall survival.

      Part II of the study was designed to select one of the treatment dose levels for further
      evaluation based on clinical and laboratory assessments of patients recruited in Part I.
      Despite promising efficacy and a good tolerability profile in Part I, it was decided not to
      initiate Part II as the pre-specified boundary for efficacy was uncertain to be met in this
      heavily pre-treated population with significant co-morbidities.
