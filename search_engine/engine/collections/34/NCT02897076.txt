      non inferiority trial comparing a standard dose regimen (24 mg) to a reduced dose regimen (12
      mg) of betamethasone given to prevent the neonatal complications associated with very preterm
      birth.A betamethasone course consists in 2 injections of 12 mg betamethasone 24 hours apart
      for a total dose of 24 mg.

      The first injection will be unmasked in both group. In both group, women will receive a first
      12 mg injection of betamethasone according to local protocols.

      Randomization will be performed after the first injection. Women will then receive either a
      placebo injection (reduced dose regimen, 12 mg only from the first injection) or a second 12
      mg betamethasone injection (standard dose regimen, 12 mg from the first injection and 12 mg
      from the second injection=24 mg). This protocol allows women sent from level 1 and 2 to level
      3 perinatal centers after having already received their first injection to participate.

      In case of multiple antenatal betamethasone courses, women will receive their second course
      according to the same design as in their first course.
