      of intracranial arterial stenosis in two years. Dyslipidemia patients with intracranial
      arterial stenosis will be enrolled under informed consent in this study. Rosuvastatin (5mg)
      will be orally administered once daily. Dose of rosuvastatin will be adjusted to control
      serum LDL-c level under 1.8mmol/L. Primary outcome is the progression of intracranial
      stenosis on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) after two years.
