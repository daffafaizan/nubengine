    
      Phase 1 (Part A):

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses
      of GH001 (containing 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine; 5-MeO-DMT) in patients with TRD.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the effects of single doses of GH001 on
      various measures of depression, and on dose-related psychoactive effects.

      Phase 2 (Part B):

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of an individualized dosing
      regimen of GH001 on the severity of depression.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the safety and tolerability of an
      individualized dosing regimen of GH001 in patients with TRD and its effects on the severity
      of depression, other measures of depression, and on dose-related psychoactive effects.

      Study design: Phase 1/2 study in two parts.

      Intervention: In the Phase 1 (Part A), a single dose of GH001 will be administered per
      patient. Two different dose levels will be investigated with four patients at each dose
      level. In the Phase 2 (Part B), an individualized dosing regimen will be administered.

      In both parts, GH001 will be administered via inhalation.
