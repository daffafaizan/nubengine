      I. To evaluate the hypothesis that there are more hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2)+ cells in
      patients with bone metastasis compared to patients with only local disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the hypothesis that cells with HAS2+ and cancer stem cell (CSC)+ (cluster of
      differentiation [CD]24-/CD44+/epithelial specific antigen [ESA]+) cells will have the most
      aggressive growth in the bone, using an animal model.

      OUTLINE:

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected and analyzed via flow cytometry and polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). Cells are also transplanted into mice and studied.
