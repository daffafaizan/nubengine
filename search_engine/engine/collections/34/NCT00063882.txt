        -  Compare the 5-year freedom from progression in patients with intermediate-risk prostate
           cancer treated with interstitial brachytherapy with or without external beam
           radiotherapy (EBRT).

        -  Compare biochemical (i.e., prostate-specific antigen) failure, biochemical failure by
           the Phoenix definition, disease-specific survival, local progression, and distant
           metastases in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare morbidity and quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting Medicare data in a large Radiation Therapy
           Oncology Group (RTOG) prostate cancer clinical trial for cost effectiveness and cost
           utility analysis of combined treatment with interstitial brachytherapy and EBRT.

        -  Prospectively collect diagnostic biopsy samples from these patients for future biomarker
           analyses.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (T1c vs T2a or T2b), Gleason score (â‰¤ 6 vs 7), prostate-specific antigen (< 10
      ng/mL vs 10-20 ng/mL), and prior neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Within 2-4
           weeks of radiotherapy, patients undergo interstitial brachytherapy with iodine I 125 or
           palladium Pd 103 seeds.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo interstitial brachytherapy only, as in arm I. Quality of life
           is assessed at baseline, at 4, 12, and 24 months, and then annually for 3 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-5 weeks, at 4, 6, 9, and 12
      months, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.
