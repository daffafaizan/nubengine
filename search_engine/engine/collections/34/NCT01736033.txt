      prostate volume, Prostate Specific Antigen(PSA) level, symptom score and maximum uroflow,
      recently the combination therapy of alpha-blocker and 5-alpha reductase inhibitor has been
      tried imprudently in Korea.

      As a result of several clinical trials which had conducted overseas for releasing the
      combination drug of alpha-blocker and 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, the superiority of the
      combination therapy has been proved, however, plenty of patients still don't derive
      additional profit from it.

      Therefore, in this study, the investigators anticipate to meet with meaningful results on the
      clinical efficacy of alpha-blocker monotherapy and alpha-blocker + 5-alpha reductase
      inhibitor combination therapy in Korean benign prostate hyperplasia patients, and provide
      guidelines of the combination therapy.
