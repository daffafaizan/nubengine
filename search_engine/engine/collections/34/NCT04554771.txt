    
      Randomized phase II proof-of-concept study with tocilizumab and standard of care paclitaxel,
      carboplatin and radiation followed by surgical resection of the oesophagus for patients with
      surgically resectable adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus or oesophageal junction. Patients
      will be grouped for serum ADAM12 with a cutoff of 203 ng/mL. Patients in both groups will be
      randomized to receive tocilizumab 8mg/kg on day 1, 15 and 29 or not in addition to paclitaxel
      50mg/m2, carboplatin dosed with area under the curve (AUC) 2 on day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 and
      radiation 41.4 Gy in 23 fractions. Surgery will be planned approximately in week 13-15, which
      is 8 to 10 weeks after the end of chemoradiation.
