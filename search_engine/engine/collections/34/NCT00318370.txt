      epithelial ovarian cancer (including primary fallopian tube and peritoneal adenocarcinoma)
      either alone or in combination with other drugs. MORAb-003 works by a different mechanism
      from other cancer therapeutics and has been shown to be well tolerated. This study allows the
      opportunity to determine if MORAb-003 can work either as a single agent

        1. to treat a CA125-only relapse, or

        2. in combination with standard platinum and taxane chemotherapy to treat a symptomatic
           relapse, and

        3. to prolong a second response to chemotherapy.
