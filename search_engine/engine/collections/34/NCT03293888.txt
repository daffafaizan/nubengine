      to identify Glioblastoma (GBM) cancer cells in patients undergoing standard surgical
      resection. Eligible patients who have consented to the use of the Chaos Wand will be
      scheduled for surgery as standard cancer care for GBM. During the surgical procedure, the
      Chaos Wand Spectral Diagnosis Probe will be utilized. Fifteen intraoperative readings and
      signal recordings of GBM tissue will be taken. The wand will only be used in areas that have
      already been deemed in need of resection due to GBM disease. Each site identified for
      spectral analysis will be marked. The wand does not come into contact with the brain at any
      point during this procedure. Following surgical resection of the GBM tumor, tissue will be
      collected from the same 15 sites where the Chaos Wand was used. The pathology report will be
      compared with the results of spectral analysis.
