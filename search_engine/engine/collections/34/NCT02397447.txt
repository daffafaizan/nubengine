    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial is carried out in 24 patients
      with diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2 according to the criteria of the American Diabetes
      Association. Patients are assigned to two different arms: one group receives Momordica
      Charantia, 2 capsules with 500 mg twice daily before breakfast and dinner for 90 days or
      placebo, under the same scheme of treatment.

      An oral glucose tolerance test is performed before and after the intervention. Matsuda index,
      Stumvoll index and Insulinogenic index are calculated to assess insulin sensitivity and
      insulin secretion.

      Other clinical and laboratory parameters that are evaluated include: Body weight, body mass
      index, waist circumference, blood pressure, body fat percentage, fasting plasma glucose, A1C,
      creatinine, lipid profile and liver transaminases.
