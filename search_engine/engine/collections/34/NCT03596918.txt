      I. To evaluate the longitudinal quality of life of participants with human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV)-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) during treatment with bleomycin sulfate
      (bleomycin) and vincristine sulfate (vincristine) at a single institution in East Africa.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. To explore baseline and time-dependent correlates of improvements in quality of life
      (QOL).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      III. To assess quality control (completeness and accuracy) in data capture of adverse events,
      clinical benefit, and objective response for site evaluation and training purposes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vincristine intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes and bleomycin IV over 10
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 12 weeks.
