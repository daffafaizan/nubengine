      have provided substantial evidence of an excess mortality and of a substantially higher
      prevalence of physical co-morbidity as compared to the general population. These findings
      have been related to a higher prevalence of risk factors like high blood pressure, high
      plasma cholesterol and obesity, unhealthy lifestyles, medication side-effects.

      The number of clinical trials and intervention studies in this area is still scanty and their
      scientific strength is relatively modest. The present research project aims at implementing
      preventive strategies related to dietary habits and physical exercise, and studying their
      efficacy with a randomized controlled study.
