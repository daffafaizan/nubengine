      combination modulated by amifostine and filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with recurrent or
      metastatic cancer. II. Define the dose limiting toxicity of this combination in these
      patients. III. Observe any antitumor responses in patients treated with this combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive a 10 minute infusion
      of amifostine followed by paclitaxel given intravenously over 3 hours followed by carboplatin
      given over 30 minutes. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is given subcutaneously daily for up to 10 days by
      self administration starting the following day. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least
      3 courses unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients who develop
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) on a given course receive one dose level lower on the next and
      subsequent courses. Patients with stable disease may continue treatment for as long as
      benefit is shown. In the absence of DLT in the first 3 patients treated, subsequent cohorts
      of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of paclitaxel on the same schedule. If DLT occurs
      in 1 of 3 patients at a given dose level, then 3 additional patients are added at that dose.
      If DLT occurs in 1 additional patient, this dose is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD); if DLT
      occurs in more than 2 patients, then 3 additional patients are added at the previous dose. If
      DLT occurs in no more than 2 of 6 patients, this dose is considered the MTD. At any dose, 3
      cases of DLT leads to discontinuation of recruitment at that dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
