    
      A phase II randomized placebo controlled trial will be done with following 3 groups. Each
      group will have 10 participants, so, the total patients will be 30 people.

        1. High concentration of Allo-ASC group: stem cell 0.5cc (Total: 10 million cells) + Fibrin
           glue 0.5cc

        2. Low concentration of Allo-ASC group: stem cell 0.5cc (Total: 1 million cells) + Fibrin
           glue 0.5cc

        3. Placebo Comparator (Fibrin) group: Normal saline 0.5cc + Fibrin glue 0.5cc The
           investigators will compare the efficacy difference with visual analogue scale (VAS)
           during activity (primary outcome), VAS at rest, Mayo elbow performance index (MEPI),
           grip strength, ultrasonographic assessment at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12
           months and 24 months after injection. Shear wave elastography (SWE) and magnetic
           resonance image (MRI) will be done at baseline, 12 weeks, 12 months and 24 months after
           injection
