      PARP enzyme and effectively traps PARP on DNA. Talazoparib has shown promising single-agent
      anti-tumor efficacy in several BRCA1/2 mutation-associated advanced cancers. The efficacy of
      PARP inhibition in BRCA1/2 wild-type TNBC with homologous recombination (HR) defects and in
      breast tumors with mutations in other non-BRCA1/2 HR pathway genes is currently unknown.

      This phase 2 trial explores the activity of single agent talazoparib in BRCA1/2 wild-type BC
      patients using an optimal Simon two-stage design. Eligible subjects will be assigned to one
      of two parallel cohorts: 1) Cohort A: Subjects (n=29) with advanced TNBC with underlying HR
      defects as assessed by the HRD assay and, 2) Cohort B: Subjects (n=29) with advanced
      HER2-negative BC with a somatic or germline mutation in a non-BRCA1/2 HR pathway gene. Gene
      mutations of interest are: PTEN, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, NBN, BARD1, BRIP1, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D,
      MRE11, ATR, Fanconi anemia complementation group of genes (FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE,
      FANCF, FANCG, FANCL).
