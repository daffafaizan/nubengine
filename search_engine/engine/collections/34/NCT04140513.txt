      I. To evaluate the utility of early (i.e. during treatment) digital positron emission
      tomography (dPET) as a diagnostic tool to predict local control 6 months after definitive
      chemoradiation for patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the association between dynamic dPET parameters taken at early time points (i.e.
      during treatment) and CR on PET after definitive chemoradiation.

      II. To study the association between dynamic dPET parameters taken at early time points (i.e.
      during) treatment and 2 year local control after definitive chemoradiation.

      III. To assess the ability of dynamic dPET compared to conventional PET or
      conventional-equivalent dPET reconstruction to identify tumor volumes with greater
      sensitivity at the time of before (dPET1), during (dPET2, dPET3) and after (dPET4, dPET5)
      chemoradiation.

      IV. To generate preliminary data for future methodology or clinical trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 via injection and undergo dPET over 20 minutes after
      standard of care computed tomography (CT) imaging (week -2), after receiving 20-26 Gy and
      40-46 Gy of radiation (weeks 3 and 5), and 3 months after completion of treatment. Patients
      with concern for residual disease may receive an additional dPET 6 months after treatment.
