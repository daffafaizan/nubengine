    
      D-PLEX is a new formulation of extended controlled release Doxycycline.

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and provide signed informed consent, will be
      enrolled into the study and will be treated with D-PLEX concomitantly with standard of care.

      D-PLEX will be administered as a single application during a cardiac surgery (index
      procedure) immediately prior to sternal closure, as an adjunct to the standard care.

      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of the controlled release antibiotic
      (doxycycline) by the reduction in the number of sternal infections observed during the
      treatment period in any subject above the age of 18 years, including patients with high risk
      for infection.

      Additional follow up for prolonged safety assessments only, will be done as follows until 24
      weeks.
