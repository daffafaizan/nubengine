      regimen, 2) a weekly dosing regimen, or 3) an on-demand regimen. Treatment continued for 28
      (±2) to 52 (±2) weeks. PK assessments for all participants are conducted on varying
      schedules, according to participants' group assignments. Additionally, two subgroups are
      defined. One subgroup of participants undergo PK profiling with a single dose of the
      comparator Advate®. A second subgroup consists of participants from any of the treatment arms
      that required surgery during the study. Depending upon country location, participants might
      have the option of continuing treatment within study 8HA01EXT (NCT01454739).
