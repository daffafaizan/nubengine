      Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) conditions. During the session, participants are
      presented with these randomly ordered conditions: menthol cigarettes and five flavored
      e-cigarettes (menthol/mint, fruits, sweets, alcohol, snacks/meals), menthol cigarettes and
      both unflavored and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, non-menthol cigarettes and five flavored
      e-cigarettes, and non-menthol cigarettes and both unflavored and tobacco-flavored
      e-cigarettes. Participants' visual attention is evaluated by eye-tracking equipment.
