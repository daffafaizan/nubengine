        1. A titration phase of two weeks, during which of the doses of the treatments will be
           gradually increased in three steps:

           Level 1 (from D1 to D5):

             -  Oxycodone: 10 mg PR/day bid (5 mg PR/5 mg PR)

             -  Levodopa: 100 mg/day bid (50 mg/50 mg)

           Level 2 (from D6 to D10):

             -  Oxycodone: 20 mg PR/day tid (10 mg/0 mg/10 mg)

             -  Levodopa: 150 mg/day tid (50 mg/50 mg/50 mg)

           Level 3 (from D11to D15):

             -  Oxycodone: 40 mg PR/day tid (20 mg/0 mg/20 mg)

             -  Levodopa: 200 mg/day tid (100 mg/50 mg/50 mg)

        2. A fixed dose period: the level 3 dose will be maintained for 8 weeks (from D16 to D71).
           The study treatment will be administered as an add-on therapy, with the usual
           antiparkinsonian treatment. If patients have side effects at the level 3 dose, a return
           to the level 2 dose will be authorized.

        3. A withdrawal period: The dose of the study treatment will gradually be reduced, over an
           eight-day period:

      For patients treated with the level 3 dose for 8 weeks: decrease to the level 2 dose over the
      first 3 days (from D72 to D74) ; then a decrease to the level 1 dose over the next 3 days
      (from D75 to D77). The treatment will be stopped completely on D78. The last visit will take
      place on D79, 2 days after the end of treatment.

      For patients treated with the level 2 dose: decrease to the level 1 dose over the first 3
      days (from D72 to D74), with stopping of the treatment on D75. The last visit will take place
      on D79, 5 days after the end of treatment.
