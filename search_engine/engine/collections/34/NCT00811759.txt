      Primary

        -  Determine the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate and
           temozolomide in patients with stage III-IV melanoma. (Phase I)

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival at 12 weeks. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate tumor response according to RECIST criteria.

        -  Evaluate overall and progression-free survival.

        -  Evaluate the effect of treatment on tumor vascularization.

        -  Compare the pharmacokinetic profile of temozolomide with and without sorafenib tosylate.

        -  Evaluate the number and the role of lymphocytes.

        -  Correlate tumor response rate with BRAF mutation status.

        -  Correlate response rate with MGMT activity.

        -  Compare the efficacy of genomics and proteomics as a means of discovery of serum
           biomarkers.

        -  Study the prognostic and predictive value of circulating endothelial cells and
           circulating endothelial progenitors.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28 (days 8-28 of course 1) and
      oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with accessible tumors (cutaneous or sub-cutaneous) undergo biopsies at baseline and
      day 28 for analysis of BRAF mutations and MGMT expression.
