      followed by surgery has been recommended as the optimal therapeutic strategy.Patients who
      achieved pathologic complete response(pCR) after receiving neoadjuvant therapy were more
      likely to have better survival. And the pCR rates was 43.2% reported in NEOCRTEC5010 trial,
      49% with ESCC in the CROSS trial and 33.3% in FFCD 990130.

      In Phase Ib PALACE-1(NCT03792347), the investigators firstly present that preoperative
      pembrolizumab combined with chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery is safe.All 20 patients
      have received PPCT successfully, except 1 patient who missed the last dose of chemotherapy
      due to leukopenia. Grade 3 and higher adverse events (AEs) were observed in 13 patients
      (13/20, 65%), and 1 patient had a grade 5 AE. The most frequent grade 3 AE was lymphopenia
      (12/13, 92%). Eighteen patients underwent surgery within 4-9 weeks after PPCT and the pCR
      rate was 55.6% (10/18).

      This study (PALACE-2) will evaluate the efficacy of preoperative pembrolizumab with
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma in multicentres.
