      transplantation of HLA haploidentical bone marrow preincubated with alloantigen and CTLA4-Ig
      ex vivo in patients with hematologic malignancies. II. Determine the engraftment rate with
      this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the safety of this treatment regimen
      in these patients. IV. Determine the incidence of infection and relapse after this treatment
      regimen in these patients. V. Determine whether host specific tolerance develops in these
      patients after receiving this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood
      cells which are incubated with donor bone marrow cells in the presence of CTLA4-Ig for 36
      hours. Patients undergo total body irradiation on days -7, -6, -5, and -4 and receive
      cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, prior
      lymphoid blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia, high grade non-Hodgkin's leukemia (NHL),
      intermediate grade NHL with prior marrow or extramedullary disease, or prior CNS leukemia
      receive 2 doses of methotrexate intrathecally prior to bone marrow transplantation, and 4-6
      doses following. Patients receive bone marrow transplantation on day 0; methotrexate IV on
      days 1, 3, 6, and 11; and cyclosporine IV on days -1 to 50. Patients are followed weekly for
      1 month, monthly for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 1-2 years.
