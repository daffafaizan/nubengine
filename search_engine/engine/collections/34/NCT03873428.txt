      receptor expression in different metastatic lesions in patients with first metastatic
      recurrence of breast cancer initially expressing estrogen receptors.

      Secondary objectives are:

        1. To study the influence of the FES PET could have for possible modifications of
           therapeutic management in these patients.

        2. Determine the rate of patients with additional positive FES lesions but without positive
           FDG lesions.

        3. Evaluate the response to chemotherapy at 3 months after using FDG-PET in clinical
           routine.
