    
      Methodology/Study Design: After all pre-injection procedures are completed on Day 1, eligible
      men and women will receive two concurrent injections AA4500 (AA4500/AA4500) into cord(s)
      affecting MP and/or PIP joints on the same or different fingers in the selected hand. A
      finger extension procedure to facilitate cord disruption will be performed (after
      administration of local anesthesia, if needed) 24 to 72 hours after injection in those
      subjects who do not have spontaneous disruption of their cord(s).

      Follow up visits for the evaluation of safety and efficacy will be required for all subjects
      24 to 72 hours after injection, and on Days 15, 31, and 61.

      Upon completion of the day 61 follow-up visit (end of study visit), subjects who require
      additional treatment in the treated hand may receive up to three additional injections of
      AA4500 according to the XIAFLEX package insert. Subjects may receive up to a total of five
      injections and individual cords may receive up to a total of three injections. Subjects who
      require additional treatment will be followed for safety.
