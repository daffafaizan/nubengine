    
      A non-randomized, prospective study of recruited subjects with diabetes. Subjects will
      include those with type I or type II diabetes of various duration and those who are naive to
      self-testing of blood glucose. Subjects will use provided instructions-for-use to undergo
      self-training on the use of the device and will then self-test their blood glucose level.
      Results will be compared to those obtained by a lab glucose analyzer.
