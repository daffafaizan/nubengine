    
      A Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) called MY RELIEF, have been developed. MY-RELIEF is built
      on best practices in e-learning, e-health and multimedia-based learning. The training package
      will be available on mobile devices such as a mobile phone or a tablet. The training is
      designed in short modules (10-12 minutes per module), possible to complete during a break in
      work. The MOOC will include short videos with older workers (aged 55+ years) with low back
      pain and professional experts, as well as knowledge tests and short factual texts. In
      addition, the target audience will have access to a serious game on their mobile phone that
      will track their health, and provide feedback on their potentially changing health status,
      and their engagement with the MOOC units.

      The aim for this study is to determinate usability, acceptability and feasibility of a
      digital education program (MY-RELIEF) delivered via a MOOC for people aged 55+ years with
      persistent low back pain who are in sedentary or physically demanding jobs, and need advice
      on ergonomics, self-management of pain and healthy behavioral strategies.

      The usability of the intervention will be measured with an industry standard tool to
      understand peoples ease of interaction with the MOOC and acceptability of the content and
      format of the MOOC will be measured via qualitative feedback from users.

      Feasibility will be informed by the data on likely recruitment and follow up rates in each
      country for a main trial, floor and ceiling effects and completion rates on outcome measures,
      and likely within group effect sizes in response to the MOOC.

      MY-RELIEF will help to improve and expand the range of high quality learning opportunities
      tailored to the needs of people over the age of 55 years.
