    
      Study entry is open to patients regardless of gender or ethnic background.

      The intent of this study design is for all patients to receive and complete one course of
      therapy. Patients who exhibit signs of disease progression or experience an unacceptable
      toxicity will be discontinued from treatment.

      There will be no dose delays or dose reductions of study drugs for hematologic toxicity
      during Consolidation "Bridging" therapy (Day 1 through Day 30); however, prolonged
      hematopoietic recovery or bone marrow aplasia during the first 42 days may meet a study
      stopping rule.
