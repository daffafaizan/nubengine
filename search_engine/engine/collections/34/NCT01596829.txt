      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). The study will be conducted as a two-arm, parallel
      groups, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, stratified by age,
      gender and number of days on antibiotics. The duration of patient participation in the study
      will be up to 7 weeks (up to 3 weeks supplementation, 4 weeks follow-up). The overall
      duration of the study is expected to be approximately 8 months. Adult males and females that
      are prescribed antibiotic therapy for minimum of 3 and a maximum of 14 days will be included
      in the study. The incidence of AAD will be evaluated as the primary end-point. The stool from
      patients presenting diarrhea will be tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile and if
      negative for C. difficile, also for the presence of other common pathogens causing diarrhea.
      The overall microbiota will be analyzed from fecal samples taken regularly during each phase
      of the study.
