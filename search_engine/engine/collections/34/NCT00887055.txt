      (LV) at different AV delays and LV offsets and during exercise. These EGM signals will be
      used to design and develop improved automatic threshold and automatic capture algorithms for
      CRT defibrillators (CRT-D). As well, the data collected from the study will be used to to
      develop other automatic algorithms for CRT-D, such as pacing parameter optimization.
