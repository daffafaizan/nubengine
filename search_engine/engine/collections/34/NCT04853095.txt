      lymph node involvement in prostate cancer. As urologist perform this procedure more often
      now, thanks to the shift to more advanced and aggressive stages, the role of ePLND is
      expanding. The main complication of PLND is development of a collection of lymphatic fluid
      called a lymphocele. Lymphoceles can be associated with abdominal pain, lower urinary tract
      symptoms, bladder outlet obstruction, penile or scrotal edema, infection/sepsis, lower
      extremity swelling and deep vein thrombosis. They necessitate intervention in up to 10% of
      patients treated with RARP + ePLND which includes drainage or surgery. Radiologic incidence
      can be as high as around 50% of operated patients with unknown clinical relevance. Many
      interventions aimed at reducing the rate of lymphocele formation with limited success so far.
      Several retrospective studies suggested using peritoneal flap fixation technique which could
      direct the lymphatic fluid to the peritoneal cavity out of the pelvis and its ensure its
      reabsorption there. We hypothesize that peritoneal fixation can potentially lower the
      incidence of symptomatic and radiologic lymphocele formation. By preventing this potentially
      very dangerous complication, it could be very beneficial for a large group of patients
      suffering from aggressive localized prostate cancer who are scheduled for RARP + ePLND.

      Our goal is to is to test this hypothesis in a randomized trial comparing the fixation
      technique to standard of care, i.e. no fixation.
