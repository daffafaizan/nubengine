      patients with CSPN. While the pharmaceutical industry has focused attention on drugs for
      treating diabetic sensory neuropathy (DSPN), and two drugs are now FDA approved, there have
      not been any prospective trials in CSPN. And, because there are no studies with CSPN
      patients, insurance carriers often reject authorizing prescriptions for some drugs for
      patients with CSPN.

      There are four drugs that will be tested in this study: nortriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin
      and mexiletine. These drugs are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of CSPN and are
      considered "investigational" in this study.

      There are two periods in this study: Screening/Baseline and Study Drug. During the
      Screening/Baseline period the researchers will determine eligibility for potential subjects.
      During the second period, eligible patients who consented to participate will take the study
      drug. Participants will be randomized to receive one of the four drugs in this study.
      Participants will know which drug they are taking. Participants will not be allowed to switch
      groups and receive a different drug during the study.

      This study uses an adaptive study design. This means the study can enroll less participants
      and provide better conclusions. The study design allows the researchers the ability to make
      changes to the approach of the study or to stop the study early if there are strong results.
