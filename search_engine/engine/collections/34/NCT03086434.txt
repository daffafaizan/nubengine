      strengthening and extending community partnerships in each community and collecting data that
      will inform the cultural adaptation and tailoring of the intervention; Years 2, 3, and 4 will
      entail implementation by using a two-condition controlled study in which the culturally
      competent intervention is compared to standard care; and Year 5 will consist of final data
      collection, analysis of results, dissemination of results to local communities, and
      finalization of a sustainability plan for each Tribe.

      Participants in the proposed study will consist of 540 male and female American Indian 6th
      grade students who represent at least three different Tribes - Choctaw, Ojibwe/ Chippewa, and
      Lumbee, in three different regions of the U.S. Participants will also include 70 tribal
      personnel (adults 18 and over) who be trained to implement the intervention in Years 3 & 4 of
      the project. Finally, 15-20 stakeholders and community partnership members will be
      interviewed at various stages of this project.
