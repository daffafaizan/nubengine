      previous studies have demonstrated interventions that include cognitive-behavioral strategies
      can enhance long-term, independent physical activity. In addition, there are episodic charity
      events, such as charity walks, that attract large numbers of participants of all age ranges
      to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity. These actions are a form of prosocial
      behavior, defined as voluntary, intentional behavior that results in benefits for another.
      The opportunity to help others seems to be a motive in inspiring these individuals to at
      least engage in one session of moderate physical activity. Thus, the current research project
      contemplates whether prosocial behavior may be implemented as a viable behavioral incentive
      for long-term physical activity.

      Participants in the Prosocial Behavior Physical Activity (PBPA) intervention will receive a
      cognitive-behavioral intervention to teach participants the behavioral skills necessary to
      engage in long-term (12-month) independent physical activity. Participants in the Healthy
      Aging (HA) intervention will receive excellent educational sessions based on a number of
      topics of relevance to older adults. Both programs will provide supervised stretching
      sessions so that participants learn how to safely and effectively improve flexibility, which
      helps reduce the likelihood of falls and disability. However, the PBPA intervention will also
      allow participants to earn food for donation to Second Harvest Food Bank based on their
      regular physical activity and volunteer time.
