      potent means of augmenting the effectiveness of threatening health communications.
      Individuals tend to be defensive against information suggesting their behavior puts them at
      risk for disease or negative health. Previous evidence suggests that self-affirmation may
      reduce defensiveness to threatening health information, increasing openness to the message
      and resulting in increased disease risk perceptions, disease-related worry, intentions to
      engage in preventive behavior, and actual behavioral change. One mechanism by which
      self-affirmation may be effective is by reducing self-focus and expanding self-concept. If
      this is the case, self-affirmation may not be effective in reducing defensiveness against
      information that is threatening to one s close other. We are proposing two studies to examine
      whether self-affirmation is equally effective at reducing defensiveness against threatening
      information for the self and for a close other. These studies will not only highlight
      conditions under which self-affirmation is effective, but also shed light on mechanisms
      underlying the effect.
