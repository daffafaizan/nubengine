    
      In collaboration with investigators of the Hemophilia Inhibitor Genetic Study (HIGS)
      multicenter study and the University of Lund, University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden, we propose
      to assess the role of genetic variants in the process of developing inhibitors to Factor VIII
      in persons with hemophilia. The discovery of genetic associations offers the potential to
      direct clinical management in order to prevent inhibitor development and improve clinical
      care in patients with inhibitors.
