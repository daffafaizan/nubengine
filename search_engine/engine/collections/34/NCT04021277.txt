      significant problem in many solid tumours, as it compromises the effectiveness of established
      therapeutics. If the amount of drug that reached any tumour could be increased without
      changing the amount administered systemically, it should be possible to increase the
      effectiveness of the treatment without adding to systemic toxicity. Acoustic Cluster Therapy
      (ACT) can potentially increase the uptake of an anticancer agent over the US targeted area.
      The preclinical development of PS101 mediated ACT suggests that this therapy may be of
      meaningful benefit while significant additional toxicity is not anticipated.
