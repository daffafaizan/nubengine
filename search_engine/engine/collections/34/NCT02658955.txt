      practice in models and receive a certification previously to implement in their surgical
      practice the new technique.

      Results will be monitorised and compared with previous cohort of patients. A protocol of
      closure will be implemented. Patients without risk factors will receive a laparotomy closure
      with "short stitch" technique and patients with risk factor for developing incisional hernia
      or burst abdomen and aditional profilactic suprafascial mesh.
