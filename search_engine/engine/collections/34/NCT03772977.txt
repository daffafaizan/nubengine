    
      This is a 6-month, randomized, controlled investigation measuring the effect of increased
      clinical contact and personalized recommendations from a health coach, compared to standard
      physician counseling on adherence to consensus-based, brain health recommendations, including
      80 patients with either subjective cognitive decline, MCI, or early dementia enrolled from a
      hospital-based memory disorders clinic, or, with risk factors for dementia enrolled from a
      hospital-based primary care clinic. Participants and caregivers in the health coach arm work
      with a health coach within their respective practice, called the a "brain health champion"
      (BHC), through weekly motivational phone calls every 6 weeks. In the encounters and visits,
      BHCs and patients/caregivers work together to establish, update, and achieve personalized,
      attainable lifestyle goals. Participants in the control arm receive standard counseling and
      education from providers during routine clinic visits. Changes in physical activity, dietary
      pattern, and social and cognitive activities are measured using questionnaires validated in
      cognitively impaired and normal populations. Other outcomes include measures of quality of
      life (QOL), cognitive function, neuropsychiatric status, sleep quality, and behavior.
      Follow-up assessments are also completed at 6 months post-intervention, with some patients
      receiving "booster" encounters to assess the maintenance of behaviors.
