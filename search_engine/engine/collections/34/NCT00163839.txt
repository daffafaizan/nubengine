      subject. 'Dietary Pseudoallergy' refers to the mimicking of IgE symptoms (such as rash, itch
      and swelling) by components of food in the absence of a true IgE mediated response (as
      diagnosed by RAST and skin prick testing).

      The pseudoallergen-free diet excludes a range of naturally occuring chemicals (including
      salicylates, amines and brewers yeast) in addition to a range of artificial preservatives and
      additives (for example sulphites and glutamates). The control diet is based on the general
      dietary guidelines for the management of diabetes (including the principles of healthy
      eating, low glycemic index choices and a reduced saturated fat intake).

      Subjects recruited into the study will have a 3 month history of CIU and/or Angioedema and
      will be randomly assigned to either the active or control arm of the study in a single
      blinded fashion. All subjects will be advised to cease antihistamine medication and will
      receive one-on-one dietary counselling by a Dietitian. The diet to which each subject has
      been assigned (ie either active or placebo) is to be followed for a 4 week duration. The
      frequency and severity of CIU and/or Angioedema as well as adherence to the diet are to be
      measured on both a daily and weekly basis by the subject via the completion of a clinical
      score card. The results of the score cards will be collated to determine the relative effects
      of each diet on these conditions.
