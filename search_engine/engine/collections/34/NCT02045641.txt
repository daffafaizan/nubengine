      Knowledge concerning the impact of pleural and pericardial effusions on physical performance,
      recovery-time, cardiac and respiratory complications, and quality of life after open cardiac
      surgery is scarce. A more aggressive approach towards effusions has been suggested, but
      further studies are needed.

      Objectives:

        1. to determine the size of pleural and pericardial effusion that results in at least 30%
           reduction of physical performance in the 6-minute walk test.

        2. to compare the improvement in physical performance between the intervention group and
           the control group, measured from baseline to day 30 after surgery.

      Materials and methods:

      A randomised controlled intervention trial. Patients admitted for open cardiac surgery
      (aortic valve surgery, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and combinations) will be
      randomised into either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will
      be followed with physical tests and ultrasonic examination the month following surgery.
      Pleural or pericardial effusion of a predefined size will be drained. The control group will
      follow the current postoperative regimen.
