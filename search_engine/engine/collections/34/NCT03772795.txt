      using clear aligners (second aligner) and fixed orthodontic appliance at different time
      intervals of orthodontic force application.

      Materials and Methods: A total of 45 subjects were subdivided in two groups: group 1: 25
      subjects treated with pre-adjusted edgewise fixed appliance with 0.014 inch NiTi as the
      alignment arch wire and group 2: 20 subjects treated using clear aligner. In both groups, PBF
      was measured for the upper right and the lower left using Laser Doppler Flowmetry at
      different time interval (20 minutes, 48 hours, 72 hours, 1 month) after the fitting of the
      arch wire in group one and after the delivery of the second aligner in group two.
