      sclerosis disease-modifying therapy exposure, immunodeficiencies, and infection risk in
      subjects living with MS. By understanding this relationship future studies can be designed to
      create a model of immunosenescence in multiple sclerosis, which could help healthcare
      providers to predict and assess health risks. Preventative strategies can then be tested to
      look for ways to prevent these immune-related risks.
