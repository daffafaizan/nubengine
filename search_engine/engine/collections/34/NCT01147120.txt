      by primary care physicians for CLBP, and explore selected elements in the decision process to
      recommend or not recommend one of two CAM treatments.

      Patients and primary care physicians (PCPs) will participate from metropolitan and
      nonmetropolitan central Kentucky practices of the Kentucky Ambulatory Network (KAN),
      Kentucky's statewide primary care practice-based research network (PBRN). Each practice will
      have a patient participant enrollment period of four weeks. Patients with CLBP who have a
      visit during the enrollment period in a practice may be eligible to participate in the study,
      and participating PCPs will be invited to recommend as many eligible patients as they feel
      comfortable. During patient visits, the PCP may offer a recommendation to the patient to
      receive PMR or CMT. Patients who agree will be recruited by the KAN/CAM project team staff.
      Patients who enroll in the CAM recommendation study will receive a 12-week course of PMR or
      CMT treatments. Outcomes will be measured at three time points: baseline, 12 weeks, and 24
      weeks.
