      abdomen caused by superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism. All patients underwent
      laparoscopy to explore the intestinal blood supply and whether there was intestinal necrosis.
      If intestinal necrosis occurs, we will perform open surgery, mesenteric artery embolectomy
      and necrotic bowel resection, Intestinal fistula. If there is no intestinal necrosis,
      minimally invasive intravascular thrombus aspiration treatment will be performed, and a
      second laparoscopy is performed after the operation to determine whether the intestinal blood
      supply is improved.

      The main endpoints are the survival rate of bowel function preserved at 30 days, and the
      secondary endpoints: mortality, short bowel syndrome rate, and open surgery rate. The
      secondary observations were the success rate of end-point vascular patency, the rate of
      transition to laparotomy, the 30-day and long-term patency rate of blood vessels.
