    
      18 patients admitted successively for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement and 18
      patients admitted for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) (9 transfemoral and 9
      transaortic) are included.

      A plasma sample is obtained at defined timepoints before, during and after surgery. At each
      time points the following biomarkers are analyzed:Concentrations of the complement activation
      products C3bc and the terminal C5b-9 complement complex (TCC), the neutrophil release product
      myeloperoxidase (MPO), the cytokines IL-6, eotaxin, MCP-1 and MIP-1Î² (12). As marker of a
      myocardial cellular injury troponin T levels will be analyzed. The following clinical
      outcomes will also be monitored: Death (in hospital, 30 day and one year), blood transfusion,
      stroke, myocardial infarction.

      A dedicated registry will be established at the hospital according to the hospital's standard
      for storage of patient data. The registry will be deleted after completion of the study.
