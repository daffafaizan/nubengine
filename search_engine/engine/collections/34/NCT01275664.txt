      I. To determine the frequency of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting based on complete
      response (no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy) during the 6 days following
      intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy for the 3-day regimen of aprepitant (both injection and
      capsules) in combination with granisetron transdermal system and dexamethasone in ovarian
      cancer patients receiving IP cisplatin OR IP carboplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate possible endpoints for the chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,
      including:

        -  Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire scores

        -  Mean vomiting, nausea and total FLIE scores and changes from baseline in FLIE scores

        -  Percentages of patients with no impact on daily living (NIDL), i.e. > 108/126 total FLIE
           score II. To describe the timing of nausea and vomiting that may guide modifications to
           the standard regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients apply one patch of granisetron transdermal system to the upper outer arm on day 0
      (at least 24 hours before intraperitoneal [IP] platinum therapy). Patients then receive
      dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1-4, aprepitant IV over 15 minutes on day 1 (30 minutes
      before IP platinum therapy), and aprepitant PO on days 2-3.

      Patients complete the Functional Living Index--Emesis (FLIE) and a symptom diary at baseline
      and on days 3 and 6.
