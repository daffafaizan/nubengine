    
      REMOQOL-Poumon is an interventional, prospective, randomized study, conducted in Besan√ßon
      University Hospital. Patients are randomized whether in the experimental arm or in the
      control arm. Intervention in experimental arm consists of administration of HRQoL
      questionnaires (QLQ-C30 & QLQ-LC13) using the CHES software (Computer-based Health Evaluation
      System) and presentation of the HRQoL scores to physicians via colored graphics.

      In control arm, HRQoL questionnaires (QLQ-C30+LC13) are administered in a paper-pencil way,
      without transmission of results to physicians.

      Patients are followed for four encounters with HRQoL collection. The primary outcome,
      measured with the AREP questionnaire, is assessed after those four encounters.

      At the end of the follow-up, a semi-structured interview with a researcher in psychology and
      concerning the care relationship is proposed to a sub-cohort of patients (around ten patients
      in each arm).

      After each encounter, physicians are asked to answer a questionnaire on viewing and use of
      HRQoL scores. Every physician will be interviewed on care relationship by a researcher in
      psychology.
