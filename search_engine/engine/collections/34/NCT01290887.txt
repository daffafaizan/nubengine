    
      Study patients deemed eligible based on activities from the preceding Teva sponsored double
      blind study of reslizumab in eosinophilic asthma. Specifically, as per inclusion criterion c,
      patients must have either completed treatment in a previous Teva-sponsored study or have
      received at least 2 doses of study drug treatment in a pulmonary function study.

      Eligible patients could enroll in this study only after completion of the end of treatment
      visit in a Teva sponsored, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study of reslizumab
      in eosinophilic asthma, which served as the screening/baseline visit for participation in
      this open label extension study. The use of systemic corticosteroids for asthma in any of the
      previous Teva sponsored double blind studies of reslizumab did not exclude patients from this
      study. The previous Teva studies were C38072/3081 (NCT01270464), C38072/3082 (NCT01287039),
      and C38072/3083 (NCT01285323).
