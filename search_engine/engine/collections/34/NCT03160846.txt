      Registry at the time of referral for home care. Clinical data, including dosing, symptom
      severity, lab values, and hospitalizations, along with data on quality-of-life and patient
      compliance with treatment, will be collected by the home care nurses and pharmacists. The
      Registry's goal is to significantly contribute to the medical understandings of heart failure
      treatment and to improve the quality of care for heart failure patients in the United States
      through active publication of registry findings and disease management approaches.
