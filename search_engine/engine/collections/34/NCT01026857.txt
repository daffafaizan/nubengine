    
      The trial foresees the administration of 2 different dosages of Propionyl-L-carnitine (ST261)
      colon release tablets, 1 g/die and 2 g/die. The primary objective of this trial is to
      evaluate the clinical/endoscopic response defined as a lowering of the Disease Activity Index
      (DAI score) of at least 3 points ot the reaching of remission, the clinical/endoscopic
      remission (DAI score <= 2 with no individual subscore > 1) and histological efficacy of the
      two combined dosages of PLC (i.e. PLC 1 g/die + 2 g/die) in comparison to placebo, defined as
      an improvement of the Histological Index (HI) of at least 1 point at the end of the study (a
      final HI score of <= 1 will be defined as an histological remission).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical/endoscopic and histological efficacy of
      the two dosages of PLC individually considered in comparison to Placebo, in order to gather
      information on the dosage to be used in subsequent trials. The safety and tolerability of the
      regimens studied will also be objectives of the study.
