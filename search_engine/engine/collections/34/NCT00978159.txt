    
      The objective of this double blinded randomized controlled study is to compare the efficacy
      of esomeprazole with famotidine in the control of dyspepsia in patients with aspirin related
      nonulcer dyspepsia NUD.

      Method

      The study shall be applied for approval from the Ethic Committee of Hong Kong West and East
      Cluster and shall be registered to the Clinical Trial Governance before the recruitment of
      the first patient.

      Measuring instruments & Definitions

      Hong Kong Dyspepsia Index (HKDI)

      The presence or absence of dyspepsia was measured by the validated Hong Kong index of
      dyspepsia . This questionnaire could be used in epidemiological studies assessing the
      frequency and severity of dyspepsia in patient populations and also in interventional studies
      in functional dyspepsia.This index consisted of 12 questions on the severity of
      gastrointestinal symptoms, graded according to a five-point Likert scale (1- 5, from
      asymptomatic to very severe symptoms). A cut-off score of equal to or greater than 16 was
      determined to discriminate between controls and dyspeptic patients.

      Global Dyspepsia Score

      The global severity of dyspepsia will be measured by the Global Dyspepsia Score, which was a
      four-point scale in which a score of 0 indicated no pain or discomfort, a score of 1 mild
      pain or discomfort, a score of 2 moderate (annoying but not interfering with the daily
      routine) pain or discomfort, and a score of 3 severe (markedly interfering with the daily
      routine) pain or discomfort over the last 7 days . This scale is reliable, valid, and
      responsive and provides global assessment of symptoms in the western population . Significant
      dyspepsia was defined when Global Dyspepsia Score was more than or equal to 2 moderate.

      Definition of significant endoscopic finding

      Significant finding was defined as the presence of reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus,
      gastric or duodenal ulceration, duodenal or esophageal erosions, or cancer and those with
      more than five gastric erosions on upper endoscopy. (Tally N, NEJM 1999)
