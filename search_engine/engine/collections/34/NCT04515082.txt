      Digestive Disease (Shanghai) (Department of Gastroenterology, Changhai Hospital, Navy/Second
      Military Medical University), which is conducted at about 30 digestive endoscopy centers
      nationwide in China, with the expectation of including approximately 4,800 patients. Subjects
      willing to conduct colonoscopy examination will be asked to collect stool sample prior to
      bowl preparation for stool DNA test and commercially available FIT assay. The basic
      characteristics of subjects, bowel preparation method and quality, and related information of
      colonoscopy are recorded in detail. Colonoscopy and histopathologic examination are used as
      reference.
