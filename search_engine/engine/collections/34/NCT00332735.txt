      outpatient lower limb surgery.

      Faster onset and shorter elimination time favours a short-acting local anaesthetic for spinal
      anesthesia for out-patient lower limb surgery, e.g. knee arthroscopy, foot and varices
      surgery. Patients will recover faster and less complications will be expected.

      Articaine is said to act faster and shorter than a low dose of bupivacaine. There are not
      enough data available to establish that articaine is as safe as and more effective by
      outpatient lower limb surgery than bupivacaine.

      Spinal anesthesia with articaine will be compared to spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine in a
      randomized double blind clinical trial.

      Endpoints are:

        -  onset of sensory and motor block

        -  maximum spread of sensory level

        -  recovery from sensory and motor block

        -  time to micturition

        -  complications
