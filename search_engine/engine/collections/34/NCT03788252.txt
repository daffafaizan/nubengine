      accompanied in chronic kidney disease patients during disease progression. Decreased physical
      performance derived from sarcopenia precipitates poor prognostic influence in the clinical
      outcome, as reported in previous studies showing correlations between poor physical
      performance, poor quality of life, poor renal prognosis, and mortality. Therefore,
      maintaining physical performance is mandatory to improve the prognosis of chronic kidney
      disease patients.

      AST-120 is an oral absorbent capsule designed to remove circulating indoxyl sulfate, a uremic
      toxin. As indoxyl sulfate is reported to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle,
      AST-120 contributes to the recovery of mitochondrial function by reducing indoxyl sulfate. In
      addition, AST-120 is reported to delay the initiation of dialysis and the decrease of
      glomerular filtration rate and the increase of serum creatinine level. However, the effect of
      AST-120 on sarcopenia in pre-dialysis patients have not been reported. This study is to
      investigate the effect of AST-120 on sarcopenia prevention in pre-dialysis chronic kidney
      disease patients.
