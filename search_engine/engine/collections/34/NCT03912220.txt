      unmyelinated fibers, including both somatic innervation of the skin and autonomic nerves.
      Although diabetes and prediabetes are the two most common causes, up to 50% of all SFN remain
      idiopathic. Currently there is no effective treatment that prevents it or reverses it through
      regeneration of nerve fibers.

      Recent advances in understanding the molecular machinery that mediates Wallerian degeneration
      (i.e. degeneration of nerve fibers after physical transection) showed that key molecular
      players in this pathway and nicotinamide (NAD+) metabolites play a similar role in
      degeneration of axons in a distal-to-proximal manner seen in many peripheral neuropathies
      including SFN. Pre-clinical studies have shown that rapid depletion of NAD initiates a
      cascade of molecular events that leads to axon degeneration and that supplementation of a NAD
      precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR) can prevent this degeneration.

      In this study investigators plan to evaluate the ability of NR to prevent degeneration of
      small somatic sensory axons innervating the epidermis as well as its ability to promote
      regeneration of these same fibers in a human experimental model of nerve degeneration and
      regeneration. This experimental human model has been used previously to evaluate the rate of
      nerve degeneration and regeneration in several peripheral neuropathies and in healthy
      subjects.

      Since NR is available as a nutritional supplement, if successful, this research can lead to
      development of a therapy for a variety of peripheral neuropathies very rapidly.
