      inhibits the replication of JC virus (the virus that causes PML) in vitro, at concentrations
      that are not toxic to human cells. Topotecan also inhibits the replication of HIV-1 and the
      function of Tat (which upregulates the replication of JC virus).

      Patients are randomized to be treated immediately with topotecan or to have treatment delayed
      for 8 weeks. The dosing schedule for patients receiving immediate or delayed treatment is
      topotecan as a continuous 21-day intravenous infusion every 28 days. All patients must have
      received optimal, stable antiretroviral therapy for 3 weeks prior to entry and preferably
      will continue that therapy during the study.
