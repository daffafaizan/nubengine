      be treated nonoperatively. Due to the anatomy of the radial nerve and the entrapment between
      fragments in spiral fractures of the humerus, these injuries are associated with primary
      radial nerve palsy in up to 18%.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the influence of injury mechanism,
      fracture type, and type of surgical treatment on time to onset of nerve recovery and time to
      full nerve recovery in patients with humeral shaft fractures and concomitant primary radial
      nerve palsy.

      A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for all patients treated with
      humeral shaft fracture and primary radial nerve palsy at an academic Level-I trauma center
      was performed. Between 1994 and 2013 a total of 615 patients with traumatic humeral shaft
      fractures were treated at the department. The dataset was examined for completeness and
      accuracy. Patients with an incomplete dataset, those with a pathologic or periprosthetic
      fracture, patients with non-surgical treatment, or who were younger than 18 years of age were
      excluded from this series. According to these criteria, a total of 50 patients with a humeral
      shaft fracture and primary radial nerve underwent surgical treatment
