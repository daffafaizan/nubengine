    
      This current Phase II trial is a randomized, open label, controlled, multiple dose,
      multi-centre study to study the clinical efficacy and safety of Neihulizumab vs "Conventional
      Treatment" to treat steroid-refractory acute graft-vs-host disease (sr-aGvHD) in patients
      undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      This study will enroll a minimum of 90 patients, approximately 60 in Neihulizumab treatment
      arm and 30 in Conventional treatment control arm.

      The primary objectives is to evaluate the efficacy of Neihulizumab treatment in patients with
      steroid-refractory acute GvHD compared to "conventional treatment." The secondary objectives
      are to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of Neihulizumab
      administration in subjects with steroid-refractory acute GvHD.

      For safety evaluation, the parameters to be assessed are adverse events (AEs),
      discontinuation of therapy due to AEs, safety laboratory analysis, ECG, vital signs, physical
      examination, and immunogenicity.
