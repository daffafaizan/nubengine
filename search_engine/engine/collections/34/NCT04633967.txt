    
      This observational study will evaluate and anaylse primary data investigating the effects of
      a novel peri-infusion regimen in MS patients in a Candian clinical setting infused with
      Alemtuzumab.

      This observational study has been developed by a Canadian neurologist with the intent to
      treat MS patients receiving Alemtuzumab in order to mitigate infusion associated reactions
      (safety) by utilizing an alternative peri-infusion protocol which is a deviation from the
      recommendation in the Canadian Product Monograph.

      All the patients' recruited for this observational study were informed and consented for this
      novel peri-infusion regimen and were clinically followed by the neurologist for the two
      Alemtuzumab infusion cycles and for any subsequent Alemtuzumab infusions for potential
      mitigation of infusion associated reactions associated with Alemtuzumab.
