      teicoplanin is 2 mg/L. Due to its time-dependant bacteriocidal effect, the trough level
      should exceed 10 mg/L, particularly in the elderly, for MRSA bacteremia. However, it is known
      that standard dosage of teicoplanin often produces inadequate serum trough levels, and MRSA
      infections may recurred. Therefore, to evaluate the loading dose required to achieve
      therapeutic concentration timely, we compare the trough levels between those given standard
      dose (6 mg/Kg) and those given increasing loading dose (12 mg/Kg). We also monitor the
      occurrence of adverse drug effects and clinical response.
