      participated in qualifying/index JIA studies of tofacitinib. Those who have already completed
      such participation and enroll outside the 14 day window following completion of the End of
      Study (EOS) Visit of the qualifying/index study will participate in a screening Visit to
      determine eligibility. A Baseline Visit will then occur within 28 days after the Screening
      Visit. For subjects who are completing participation in a qualifying study of tofacitinib and
      enrolling on the same day of the EOS Visit of the qualifying/index study, the EOS Visit of
      the qualifying/index study can be combined with the Screening and Baseline Visits for this
      study. The subjects who enroll within the 14 day window following completion of the EOS Visit
      of the qualifying/index study will participate in a combined Screening and Baseline Visit for
      this study. After the Baseline Visit, visits will occur at 1 month (1 month=30 days) and 3
      months, then every 3 months thereafter as long as the subject remains in the study.

      Approximately 340 participants are projected to enroll into this open label extension study
      after completing a qualifying/index study in the JIA program.

      This study (A3921145) is planned to run until the first global marketing approval of
      tofacitinib for the treatment of JIA. The total duration of an individual subject's
      participation may vary depending upon when they enter the trial.
