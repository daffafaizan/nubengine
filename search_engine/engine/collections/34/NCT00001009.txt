      severe ARC, it has significant blood toxicities. It would be beneficial to combine AZT with
      another antiviral agent that does not have the same toxicity. DS might be a suitable drug
      since it has shown antiviral activity against HIV in the laboratory, and in preliminary
      studies it has shown little toxicity. Also, the combination of DS with AZT has been shown to
      be more effective than either alone.

      The study will begin with 10 patients with AIDS, 10 with ARC, and 10 with asymptomatic HIV
      infection taking DS by mouth 3 times a day for 24 weeks. If the initial dose of DS is
      tolerated without significant side effects, the next group of patients will receive a higher
      dose. A third group of patients will be given either a higher or lower dose depending on the
      results of the earlier groups. Patients will be evaluated every other week for 12 weeks, then
      monthly for the remaining 16 weeks. Patients will have the option of continuing DS until the
      entire study is completed if the drug is well tolerated. Inhaled pentamidine for the
      prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is allowed, but other investigational drugs are
      not. Drug effects on the HIV virus, immune function, and clinical condition will be monitored
      during the periodic evaluations.
