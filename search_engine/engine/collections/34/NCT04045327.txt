    
      Approximately 105 patients will be randomized 2:1 into 2 treatment groups after meeting the
      eligibility criteria. Total 70 patients will be enrolled in PMZ-2010 group (Group 1) and in
      Normal Saline group (Group 2) total 35 patients will be enrolled.

        -  Group 1: PMZ-2010 (Dose: 0.01 mg/kg) + Standard of care

        -  Group 2: Normal Saline (Dose: Equal volume) + Standard of care In both treatment groups,
           patients will be provided the standard of care. PMZ-2010 or Normal Saline will be
           administered intravenously after randomization to hypovolemic shock patients with
           systolic arterial blood pressure â‰¤ 90 mmHg at presentation and continue to receive
           standard Shock Treatment. In PMZ-2010 group, dose of PMZ-2010 (0.01 mg/kg) will be
           administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour in 100 mL of normal saline.
           Second dose of PMZ-2010 will be administered if SBP falls below or remains below or
           equal to 90 mmHg but not before 4 hours of previous dose and total doses per day (in 24
           hours) will not exceed 3 doses. PMZ-2010 administration if needed will continue for two
           days post randomization. Minimum 1 dose or maximum 6 doses of PMZ-2010 will be
           administered within first 48 hours. post randomization. In Control group, single dose of
           equal volume of Normal Saline will be administered as intravenous (IV) infusion over 1
           hour in 100 mL of normal saline post randomization. Condition of administration will
           remain same as for PMZ-2010 group. Each patient will be monitored closely throughout
           his/her hospitalization and will be followed until discharge from randomization. Each
           patient will be assessed for efficacy parameters over 28 days from randomization to a
           clinic visit.
