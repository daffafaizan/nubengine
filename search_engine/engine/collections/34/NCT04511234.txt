      problem is set to worsen globally. Treatment of PAD primarily involves revascularisation of
      the limb. Angioplasty as a first line strategy of revascularization over surgical procedures
      has been adopted by most vascular centers. Local drug delivery using drug coated balloons
      (DCB) during angioplasty for PAD can successfully deliver effective local tissue
      concentrations of anti-proliferative drugs to the lesions in the artery involved in the PAD.
      This offers the potential for sustained anti-restenotic efficacy.

      Randomized trials have shown superiority of Paclitaxel DCBs over just plain-balloon
      angioplasty for treatment of PAD, and DCB is now considered the standard of care. However a
      recent meta-analyses which showed increased mortality at two years in patients treated with
      paclitaxel DCBs have called into question the safety of paclitaxel based DCBs.

      Alternative drugs for DCBs are therefore urgently needed and sirolimus offers an attractive
      alternative. Compared to Paclitaxel, sirolimus is cytostatic in its mode of action with a
      high margin of safety. It has a high transfer rate to the vessel wall and has been shown to
      effectively inhibit neointimal hyperplasia in the porcine coronary model. In the coronary
      artery interventions, preliminary clinical studies using Sirolimus DCBs have also shown
      excellent procedural and 6 month patency.
