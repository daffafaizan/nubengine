    
      Study participants will be pregnant women (gestational weeks 24 to 31+6 days) who present
      with preterm contractions. In the triage room, the study participant will be connected to the
      external tocometer from at least 19:00h (7 PM) to the following morning at 07:00h. Room
      lighting will be kept dim.

      Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to blue light or red
      light. Baseline contractions will be measured. The allocated light mask will be applied for 2
      intervals of 60 minutes each.There will be a 60 minute rest period after every 60 minute
      intervention period for comparison.

      Other than the application of the light mask, all routine standards of care deemed warranted
      by the obstetric provider for proper treatment of preterm labor will be followed. (ie
      antenatal steroids, tocolytics).
