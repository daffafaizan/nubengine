      year. If the titer is < 10 IU/L, a booster dose will be administered. The humoral (anti-HBs)
      and cellular immunity (by ELISPOT to assay T and B cell specific proliferation) and cytokine
      assay will be done in these patients before and after the booster dose. A three-year
      follow-up will be performed to monitor the HBV infection in these patients.
