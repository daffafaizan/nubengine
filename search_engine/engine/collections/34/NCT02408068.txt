      suppress their natural cortisol production. 18 will be consented for the study. They will
      have had a history and a physical examination, blood tests for routine safety, hepatitis C
      and HIV, drug abuse and ECGs. Following the results of these tests and the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study, they will be admitted to the phase I unit on the
      first afternoon (Day -1). They will be given dexamethasone at 22.00hrs that evening, and
      remain in the unit until the end of the period. Further dexamethasone doses will be given at
      06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 hours on Day 1 (plus at 22:00 hours in patients given the modified
      release study drug). Each volunteer will be admitted for 3 periods of approximately 1.5 days,
      with a washout of 7 days between periods, and they will be randomised to either fast and take
      a single 20mg dose of immediate release hydrocortisone, to fast and take a single 20mg dose
      of the study medication, (a modified release hydrocortisone), or to the "fed" group, where
      they take a single dose of 20mg study medication, and have a highly calorific standardised
      breakfast. The volunteers will have cannulae to enable one pre-dose blood sample to be taken
      followed by 24 hour PK sampling (modified release) and 12 hour PK sampling for the immediate
      release period. After these samples have been taken the volunteers will be able to leave the
      unit. There will be another assessment 3 to 5 days after study period 3 with further blood
      tests, assessment of any adverse events etc.
