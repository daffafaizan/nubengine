      reconstruction, patients often complain of posterior knee pain, which can be treated with a
      sciatic nerve block. In a prospective randomized study, we compare preoperative femoral nerve
      block to a combined femoral and sciatic block in patients undergoing ambulatory ACL
      reconstruction. We hypothesize that the combined femoral/sciatic nerve block patients would
      have improved analgesia, fewer opioid-related side effects, and shorter PACU length of stay
      and improved patient satisfaction.
