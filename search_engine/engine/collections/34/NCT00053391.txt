        -  Compare the efficacy of vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor
           and influenza antigen peptides treated with vs without ex vivo CD40-ligand, in terms of
           tumor-specific T-cell response, in patients with HLA-A1 and/or HLA-A2.1 positive stage
           III or IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of these vaccinations in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response and recurrence rates in patients treated with these
           vaccinations.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label non-randomized study.

        -  Phase I: Patients undergo leukapheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells (PBMC). PBMC are cultured with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 to generate
           dendritic cells (DCs) on day -9. DCs are pulsed separately with HLA-A1 and
           HLA-A2.1-restricted flu matrix peptides derived from melanoma-associated tumor antigens
           (MAGE-10.A2, Melan-A, MAGE-3, NY-ESO-1, gp100 antigen, and tyrosinase peptide). Half of
           the DCs are treated ex vivo with CD40-ligand. Patients receive the peptide-pulsed DC
           vaccinations subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 14, 42, and 70 in the absence of disease
           progression.

      Patients who show tumor response (at least stable disease) at day 98 progress to phase II of
      the study.

        -  Phase II: Patients undergo leukapheresis as in phase I on days 102, 352, and 688.
           Patients receive up to 6 additional booster vaccinations SC as in phase I on days 126,
           184, 268, 356, 520, and 692.

      Patients are followed for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
