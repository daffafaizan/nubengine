    
      Nocturnal Enuresis is a very common and difficult to treat problem in the pediatric
      population which can have significant negative impact on a child's quality of life. Apart
      from medications which can have significant side effects limiting the use, there is a lack of
      effective and safe treatment options for children with frequent nocturnal enuresis. If foot
      stimulation prior to bed does indeed improve the frequency of nocturnal enuresis, it may
      provide a safe and non-invasive therapeutic option.

      To achieve the aims Dr. Tai will work closely with Dr. Sun and Dr. Jia to design and develop
      a small, inexpensive, and easy-to-use stimulator for foot neuromodulation, and test its
      safety and usability in 5 healthy subjects for a 2-week period. . The straps in the design
      have three functions: 1) making an electrical connection to electrode, 2) securing the insole
      and the electronic unit, and 3) facilitating observation and hand access to the top panel for
      adjusting the stimulation strength.
