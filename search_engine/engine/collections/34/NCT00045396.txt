      I. To determine the duration of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) when
      ZARNESTRA is administered after intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy to adults
      with poor risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplasia (MDS) in first
      complete remission (CR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability and toxicities of ZARNESTRA when administered in a chronic
      dosing schedule over a 48 week period to adults in first CR following intensive cytotoxic
      chemotherapies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-15
      months.
