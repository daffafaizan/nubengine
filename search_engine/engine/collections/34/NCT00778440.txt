      Design: Observational, transversal, and multicentric research

      Field of study: 20 PHC users from urban areas

      Population of study: random consecutive sampling of â‰¥ 16 years old drivers with open medical
      history.

      Measure's tools: Two means for data collection: survey among health professionals with
      medical history and structured telephonic survey about behaviours and risk perceptions in
      drivers.

      Variables: Sociodemographic data, chronic pathologies related to TI, consumption of
      medications ,Alcohol consumption (AUDIT-C test), Psychoactive substances consumption (self
      declared), Level of perception of risk according to professionals.

      Telephone survey: Class and age of driving license, Type of roads, Weekly driving time,
      Safety behaviours, Record of collisions/injuries in last year,Self perception of health
      level(SF-12) andSelf perception of risk level.

      An descriptive analysis of population will be performed, a distribution of risk elements
      associated to TI will be described through bivariant analyses, and for describing the factors
      associated to perceived risk levels a linear regression multiple model will be built.
