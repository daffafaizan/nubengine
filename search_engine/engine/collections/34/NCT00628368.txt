      Primary

        -  Analyze various biological factors that can be used as markers to predict response to
           treatment and correlate with the signaling pathway of EGFR.

      Secondary

        -  Establish a tissue bank to store information about the response to treatment and
           survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo endoscopy, 11 biopsies of tumor tissue, and 3 biopsies of healthy
      mucosa. Blood samples are also collected. Samples are analyzed for the expression of 4
      receptors in the EGFR family, polymorphisms at intron 1 of the EGFR gene, and gene mutations
      in downstream signaling pathways.

      After surgery, patients are followed every 3 months.
