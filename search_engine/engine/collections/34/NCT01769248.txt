      the gastrointestinal tract. EUS allows for the acquisition of cellular (fine needle aspirate
      - FNA) or tissue biopsy (fine needle biopsy - FNB) for diagnostic purposes. This has
      traditionally been done with fine needle aspirate where a needle is inserted into the tumor
      and potentially malignant cells are extracted for microscopic analysis. More recently, a
      needle that allows a tissue biopsy for histologic analysis has been FDA approved.

      We will compare tissue samples obtained by standard FNA to FNB with a sample size of 140
      patients with the primary outcome being diagnostic yield. Each patient will be randomized to
      FNA or FNA. If after 3 passes the on-site evaluation remains inadequate, the endoscopist will
      crossover to the other arm.
