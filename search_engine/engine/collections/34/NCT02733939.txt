      mobile devices and smart phones, in the reach of many, innovators in dementia care are just
      starting to explore the full potential of these developments to transform them into valuable
      products and services for users. There is indeed a lack of studies that evaluate the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these new technologically-enriched interventions
      targeted at people with dementia. Previous large scale evaluations of the impact of
      telemedicine and telecare, such as the Whole Demonstrator System in the United Kingdom, did
      not include people with dementia despite Alzheimer's disease being one of the most burdensome
      diseases in Europe.

      This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effects of new technologies on
      caregiver burden by reducing the time spent in supervision. The trial builds on previous
      promising results from the UP-TECH project in Italy
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01700556) . The technologies used in TECH@HOME will
      include similar, but improved, home monitoring kits potentially leading to a greater impact
      on caregivers' caring conditions. In addition, while the UP-TECH study did not allow the
      researchers to estimate the impact of the technology as a "stand-alone" intervention (the
      monitoring kits were only given in combination with case-management support), TECH@HOME will
      overcome this limitation thanks to the possibility to compare a group of technology users vs.
      non-users. Results from this intervention in dementia care in Sweden hold the potential to
      inform regional and national policy makers in Sweden and beyond.
