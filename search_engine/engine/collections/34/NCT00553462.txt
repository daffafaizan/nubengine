      Primary

        -  To determine the activity of induction chemotherapy comprising carboplatin and
           paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation followed by concurrent thoracic
           radiotherapy and erlotinib hydrochloride in patients with poor-risk, unresectable stage
           IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate and progression-free survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patient with rapid disease
      progression outside of the chest after induction therapy are removed from study. Patients
      with intrathoracic disease progression within the potential radiation field may continue
      protocol therapy at the discretion of the Study Chair. Patients with no disease progression
      outside the planned radiation field (either regional or distant) proceed to concurrent
      erlotinib hydrochloride and radiotherapy.

      Beginning on day 43 (week 7), patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily.
      Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week for up to 7 weeks (33 fractions)
      in the absence of rapid disease progression outside of the chest or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, and then
      every 6 months for up to 2 years
