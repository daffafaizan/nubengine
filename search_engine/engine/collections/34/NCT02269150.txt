    
      This is a randomized, open-label, controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of
      autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (auto-FMT) for prevention of Clostridium
      difficile infection (CDI) in patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (allo-HSCT). Patients will be enrolled prior to allo-HSCT; feces will be
      collected and stored from all participating subjects prior to the initiation of conditioning
      regimens, analyzed by deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and tested by assay for intestinal
      pathogens including Clostridium difficile. Later in the course of transplantation, following
      engraftment (defined as the first day of three consecutive days, that the absolute blood
      neutrophil count is at above f 500 mm3), subjects will undergo fecal testing for presence of
      Bacteroidetes by 16S PCR. Subjects will be eligible for study if they have a
      microbiologically diverse pre-transplant colonic microbiota, and if the post-engraftment
      specimen contains Bacteroidetes at a prevalence equal to or below (0.1%)
