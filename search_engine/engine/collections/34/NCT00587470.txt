    
      Patients with MR organic (intrinsic valve disease), isolated (no other valve disease),
      moderate or more severe (regurgitant volume *30 mL/beat). A Clinical trial, randomized,
      placebo controlled, double-blind, without cross-over, of 1 year oral treatment with potent
      angiotensin-II receptor blockade using 32 mg Candesartan daily. The trial is preceded in all
      patients by an acute open-label study to determine tolerance and immediate response. The
      methods used to measure the end-points will be: a) Doppler-Echocardiography for quantitation
      of the degree of MR (measurement of regurgitant volume) using a combination of three
      simultaneous methods (quantitative Doppler, quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography,
      proximal flow convergence) and b) of left ventricular remodeling (end-diastolic volume index
      measured by echocardiography and by electron beam computed tomography). This single center
      study seeks to enroll a total of 90 patients. The analysis will be based on intention to
      treat and compare the regurgitant volume and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index
      measured after one year of treatment with the active drug or placebo. The results of the
      trial should provide strong evidence regarding medical treatment of patients with organic MR.
