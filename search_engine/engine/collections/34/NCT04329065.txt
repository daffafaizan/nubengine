      Patients receive WOKVAC intradermally (ID) on day 13. Treatment repeats for up to 3 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive paclitaxel
      via infusion on days 1, 8, and 15, and trastuzumab intravenously (IV) and pertuzumab IV on
      day 1. The chemo and trastuzumab and pertuzumab will most likely be given by their own
      oncologist per standard of care. Treatment repeats for up to 4 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for up to 5 years from
      enrollment.
