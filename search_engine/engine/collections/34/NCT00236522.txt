      therapy is between 10 and 14 days. In this randomized, double-blind study, 5 days of 750
      milligrams of levofloxacin given once daily will be compared to 10 days of 500 milligrams of
      levofloxacin in the treatment of non-hospitalized adult patients who have acute bacterial
      sinusitis. To prevent the study doctor, study staff and patients from knowing which study
      drug they are taking, all study drug will manufactured to look the same and patients on the
      5-day regimen will be given placebo for the last 5 days of their participation in the study.
      Patients will have a sinus specimen collected at the first visit. Safety evaluations will be
      conducted. The objective of the study is to demonstrate that, in the treatment of acute
      bacterial sinus infections, a 5-day course of 750 milligrams of levofloxacin given once daily
      is at least as effective as a 10-day course of 500 milligrams of levofloxacin given once
      daily and is well tolerated.

      Patients will take by mouth 750 milligrams levofloxacin capsules once daily for 5 days
      followed by placebo capsules once daily for 5 days, or 500 milligrams levofloxacin capsules
      once daily for 10 days.
