    
      This is an open-label, safety study in healthy volunteers. Two cohorts, of 6 subjects each,
      will be enrolled (total subjects = 12). Each subject will have test areas identified on the
      back and receive a single LTS, vehicle solution and red light (PDT) applied to the test areas
      on the back. Subjects will be followed for safety at study visits occurring on Day 1
      (baseline and treatment), Day 2, and Day 7.
