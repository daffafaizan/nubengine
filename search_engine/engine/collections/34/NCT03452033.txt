    
      Study ALY337-201 will be a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-response study
      assessing the safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of H-1337 ophthalmic solution in
      subjects with ocular hypertension (OHT) or open angle glaucoma.

      During screening, subjects who meet the preliminary inclusion/exclusion criteria will
      discontinue use of their ocular hypotensive therapy during the washout period. The washout
      duration will be dependent on the subject's pre-study ocular hypotensive therapy. Starting on
      Day 0, those who continue to meet the inclusions/exclusion criteria and the diurnal IOP
      criteria will be randomized into one of the treatments arms and dosing will be initiated,
      continuing for 28 days.
