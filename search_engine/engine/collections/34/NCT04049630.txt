      adaptative randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Levamisole will be tested at 1 and 1,5
      mg/kg, and compared to placebo (36:36:36); or 2,5 mg/kg compared to placebo (36:36) in case
      of adaptation of the dose for cohorts II and III.

      We will perform three cohorts of patients according to the microfilarial density : 1-1,999
      mf/ml, 1-14,999 mf/ml, and all microfilaremic individuals; in order to respect the safety
      potentially related to loiasis.

      The first cohort was to evaluate the most appropriate dose of levamisole, with a possibility
      to increase (to 2.5 mg/kg) the dose of levamisole for the cohorts II and III in case of lack
      of efficacy and in case of good safety profil.
