    
      An open-label randomized controlled clinical trial, two cohort. Patients who met the
      inclusion criteria is planned to be enrolled into the trial. On enrollment, all patients will
      have screening, a set of clinical examination, instrumental investigations and laboratory
      tests, including dental CT of the affected jaw with the assessment of alveolar ridge width
      and height.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be subjected to guided bone regeneration surgery of
      the upper or lower jaw with the use of investigational bone substitutes mixed with shredded
      autobone harvested during the surgery. If the height of alveolar ridge needs to be augmented,
      the non-resorbed systems for granular material fixation will be used.

      The clinical study results will be evaluated at the time points of 1, 2, 10, 30, 90, and 180
      days with clinical examination, instrumental investigations and laboratory tests. A control
      dental CT will be carried out before dental implantation for the primary outcome measure, at
      180 days after surgery. The clinical trial completion date is the day of the second surgery,
      a dental implant placement. During the procedure, trephine biopsy samples will be harvested
      from the bone grafting area addressing the secondary outcome measure.
