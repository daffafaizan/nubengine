    
      The Primary Objective of the study is to compare the research participant's GM [Gray Matter]
      CBF [Cerebral Blood Flow] by ASL [Arterial Spin Labeling] techniques before and after
      reaching a stable hydroxyurea MTD [Maximum Tolerated Dose] (12Â±3 months after starting
      hydroxyurea).

      This is an observational study. Participants receive hydroxyurea as part of their standard of
      care treatment. This study will observe the above measures prior to beginning hydroxyurea and
      after participants reach the maximum tolerated dose in order to describe the effect of
      therapy on the participants' functional response.
