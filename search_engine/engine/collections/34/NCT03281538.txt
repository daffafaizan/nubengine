    
      This is an open-label multicenter, long-term extension safety study to evaluate the safety of
      IV CR845 administered after each dialysis session over a Treatment Period of up to 52 weeks.
      This study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 52 week Treatment Period, and a Follow-up
      Visit. Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures.
      All patients will have a Screening Visit, which can be performed anytime within 14 days prior
      to the first dose of study drug, to confirm eligibility.

      Clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, adverse events, and
      concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study. Blood samples for
      inflammatory biomarkers will be collected from all patients prior to dialysis on Day 1 and
      periodically until the End of Treatment or Early Termination Visit. Blood samples will also
      be collected periodically for clinical laboratory tests.
