        -  Compare survival of patients undergoing surgical resection for recurrent high-grade
           malignant supratentorial astrocytoma treated with intraoperative high vs low light dose
           photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive porfimer sodium IV. One day later, patients undergo craniotomy and tumor
      resection.

        -  Arm I: During surgery, patients receive low light dose photodynamic therapy.

        -  Arm II: During surgery, patients receive high light dose photodynamic therapy. After
           completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 day, 6 weeks, and 3 months and
           then every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5
      years.
