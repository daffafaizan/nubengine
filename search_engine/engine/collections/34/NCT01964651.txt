    
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled
      (an inactive substance is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a
      real effect in a clinical study) trial that will be conducted in two parts. Thirty two (32)
      healthy participants are planned to be included in total, in four cohorts (groups).
      Participants in each cohort will receive JNJ-42165279 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) once-daily for
      10 consecutive days. In Part 1, two cohorts of healthy male participants, 18 to 55 years of
      age, will be enrolled. Cohort A will receive 50 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days, and
      Cohort B will receive 30 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days. In Part 2, Cohort C will
      consist of 8 healthy female participants of non-childbearing potential (surgically sterile or
      postmenopausal), 18 to 58 years of age, who will receive 100 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for
      10 days. Cohort D will consist of 8 healthy elderly male or female participants, from 65 to
      85 years of age, who will receive 100 mg JNJ-42165279 or placebo for 10 days. The dose may be
      adapted before each cohort starts based on available data. The maximum dose will not exceed
      100 mg once-daily. For all participants, this study will consist of an eligibility screening
      examination (between 28 and 3 days prior to the first dose administration), a double-blind
      treatment phase consisting of 2 days before dosing, 10 dosing days (Day 1 to 10), 4 days
      after dosing (Day 11 to 14), and a follow-up examination (within 7 to 14 days after last dose
      administration). The total study duration for each participant will not exceed 8 weeks.
