      coronary intervention (pPCI) is currently the most effective treatment strategy in acute
      myocardial infarction. However, a sizable number of patients fail to restore optimal
      myocardial reperfusion, mostly because of the 'no-reflow' phenomenon. Glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that regulates plasma glucose, and recently GLP-1 analogues
      have been introduced for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. In experimental studies, GLP-1 or
      its analogues protect against reperfusion injury-induced cell death. Exenatide reduces
      reperfusion injury in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.
      Liraglutide(GLP-1) is safe and effective to reduce weight,serum lipid levels and blood
      pressure. Liraglutide can reduce cardiac rupture (12 of 60 versus 46 of 60; P=0.0001) and
      infarct size (21±2% versus 29±3%, P=0.02) and improved cardiac output (12.4±0.6 versus
      9.7±0.6 ml/min; P=0.002) in normal and diabetic mice. The investigators planned to research
      the cardioprotective effects of intravenous liraglutide administered prior to reperfusion and
      continued after restoration of coronary blood flow in patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI.
