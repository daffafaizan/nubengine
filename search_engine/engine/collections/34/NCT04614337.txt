    
      This trial will have two screening visits over about a month with tests to assess if subjects
      are eligible to start study therapy. Once subjects have completed screening, and if they are
      determined to be eligible, they will be randomized to receive one of three oral daily doses
      of LUM-201 or daily injections of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). All subjects will
      have an equal chance of being placed in any of the four groups.

      The trial consists of 6 months of treatment. After screening, subjects will return to clinic
      for 5 visits. At each clinic visit subjects will have a physical exam, blood and urine
      collections. There will also be 3 phone calls with study staff that will take place between
      the clinic visits.
