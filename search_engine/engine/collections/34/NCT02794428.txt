      eflornithine (500 mg) versus placebo for an 18 month treatment period. Gastric precancerous
      lesions are defined as chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM).
      Patients will be clinically assessed with endoscopy and gastric biopsy at four time points:
      0, 6, 18, and 24 months. The assessments at 0 and 24 months are considered part of usual
      clinical care in subjects with precancerous lesions in high risk regions. Overall, the
      efficacy of eflornithine is assessed by its effect on: 1) DNA damage, and 2) histology
      scoring.
