      the inclusion criteria being closed fractures, no concomitant skin loss, fracture related
      compartment syndrome and fasciotomy within 36 hrs. The fasciotomy incision will be either
      closed in a single stage by loop suture technique or gradually by dermotaxis once the edema
      settled between 3-5 days. The results will be graded as excellent if approximation could be
      achieved, good if sutures have to be applied for protective care and poor if they have to be
      grafted. In dermotaxis (Singhs skin traction) method two parallel kirschner wires (1.5mm)
      will be passed through the dermis on either side of the wound margins and interconnected by
      compression device consisting of threaded rod having two blocks and compression knob. Gradual
      compression will be applied daily at the rate of 1 turn/12hours on both sides of the wound.

      The loop suture technique involves using corrugated drains and Ethilon no.1. It is an
      extension of the purse string suture technique where a surgical suture is passed as a running
      stitch in and out along the edge of a wound in such a way that when the ends of the suture
      are drawn tight the wound is closed. Two corrugated drains (1 & 2) will be anchored to the
      skin adjacent to the fasciotomy incision using Ethilon no.1. Then the sutures will be passed
      from one edge of the wound through the skin and corrugated drain to the other in an
      alternating fashion.
