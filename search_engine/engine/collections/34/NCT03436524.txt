      from the CLL databases of the Institute of Oncology Research and of the Division of
      Hematology of the University of Eastern Piedmont.

      The adjusted association between exposure variables and time to first treatment will be
      estimated by Cox regression. This approach will provide the covariates independently
      associated with progression free survival that will be utilized in the development of a model
      to predict time to first treatment.

      Model performance (c-index and net reclassification improvement) in discriminating patients
      who will eventually be treated vs patients who will not be eventually treated will be
      compared with that of already existing prognostic model that have been validated to predict
      overall survival but not time to first treatment in CLL (i.e. CLL-IPI, MDACC score,
      Barcelona-Brno score).
