      morbidity (e.g. fall), especially amongst elderly. However, little has been studied about the
      efficacy of a regular multidisciplinary round in deprescribing predefined medications in
      Singapore rehabilitative hospitals.

      AIM: This study aims to evaluating the effects of a weekly multidisciplinary team(MDT)
      de-prescribing round on the reduction on total daily dose, cost of medications, its safety
      and feasibility in a Singapore rehabilitative hospital.

      Methods: A total of 260 newly admitted patients will be randomised to a de-prescribing
      intervention (n= 130) or control (usual care) group (n= 130), using GraphPad randomization
      sequence software Â©2017. The 5 steps of deprescribing process will be used and the targets of
      deprescribing are Beer's list of potentially inappropriate medications (AGS 2015 version),
      predetermined supplements and symptomatic medications. Predetermined medications were
      deprescribed following initial MDT assessment, discussion with attending doctors and
      consideration of patients' preferences regarding discontinuation or dose reduction. Total
      daily dose reduction, cost and side effects of deprescribing were monitored on admission day
      14, 28, discharge day and post-discharge day 28. Time required for such rounds are also
      measured.

      IMPACT: Once proven successful, this effective model of deprescribing could safely help to
      cut down caregiver's medicine administrative burden, improve compliance and reduce national
      healthcare cost. This model could also be easily replicated in all Singapore rehabilitative
      hospitals.
