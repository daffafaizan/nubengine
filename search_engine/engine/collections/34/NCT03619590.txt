      Pharmacovigilance. Enrolment in the Registry will begin at the time of commercial launch of
      Twinrix in the United States (US). At the time of initiation of the Registry, pre-existing
      reports of pregnancy from clinical trials will be evaluated and enrolled when the criteria
      for registration are met. Reporting of exposed pregnancies is voluntary. Pregnancies will be
      registered following maternal exposure to Twinrix within 28 days prior to conception or
      during pregnancy. Registration of pregnancies is prospective, i.e., reported during pregnancy
      before the pregnancy outcome is known. Retrospective reports, in which the pregnancy outcomes
      are known at the time of reporting, will also be reviewed to assist in the detection of any
      unusual patterns that may exist among the reported birth defects. However, because there is
      no denominator from which risk can be calculated, these reports will be excluded from the
      analysis.
