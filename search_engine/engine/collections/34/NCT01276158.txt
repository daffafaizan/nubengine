      have been using Doppler guided radial artery cannulation technique to improve success rate
      for more than 20 years. Recently, Ultrasound sonography has been utilized for central line
      placement in pediatrics. The purpose of this study is whether ultrasound guided radial artery
      cannulation technique improves the success rate compared to traditional doppler guided
      technique.
