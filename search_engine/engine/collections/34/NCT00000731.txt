      discomfort associated with their disease, and APAP is often prescribed. AZT is being used to
      treat AIDS patients. It is important for doctors to understand how AZT and APAP may interact
      when given to the same patient, because other studies have suggested that the dosage of AZT
      may have to be adjusted when given with APAP in order to avoid or minimize adverse effects.

      Persons who are infected with HIV and have symptoms (fever, fatigue, weight loss) of AIDS are
      eligible for the study. They will be given AZT orally every 4 hours or APAP orally every 8
      hours alone or in combination for 4 days while at home. On the 4th day, participants will be
      admitted to a clinical research center for studies to determine how they are tolerating the
      medicine. On the 5th day, any scheduled 8 am doses of AZT will be given intravenously, while
      the scheduled doses of APAP will still be given orally. Repeated blood samples will be taken
      over the next 12 hours and urine will be collected for 24 hours. The process will be repeated
      at weekly intervals for 3 weeks, so that each patient receives AZT alone, APAP alone, and the
      combination of AZT and APAP.
