    
      Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a syndrome characterized by ventricular
      dilatation due to disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, accompanied by gait
      disturbance, dementia and/or urinary incontinence without causative disorders. With the aging
      of Japanese society, the number of patients is increasing, requiring diagnostic and
      therapeutic guidelines for the improvement of the patients' quality of life and social care.
      Under such conditions, this project was made as the prospective study of iNPH on Neurological
      Improvement (SINPHONI ). This study aims 1) to establish methods for non-invasive diagnosis
      of iNPH, and 2) to demonstrate therapeutic outcome of shunting operation by Codman Hakim
      programmable valve (CHPV). In this protocol, the evaluation of validity on MRI, tap test, CT
      cisternography, and CBF (3D-SSP) will be done in the diagnosis, and manual of initial setting
      pressure in CHPV for prevention of overdrainage problems will be estimated by modified Rankin
      scale (as primary endpoint) and some another scales during 1 year.
