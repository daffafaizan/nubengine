      technique effectively improves the long-term postoperative rehabilitation of adolescents and
      reduces the incidence of CPSP. A prospective French multicentre study on this topic is
      currently not feasible, as other multicentre studies (pain monitoring by the ANI, blood
      saving strategy) would interfere with potential recruitment.
