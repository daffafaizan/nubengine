    
      Experimental Design: Cross-sectional study, with prospective inclusions, single center.

      Investigations:

        -  Realization of bronchoscopy according to the indications (with or without
           bronchoalveolar lavage with or without bronchial biopsy, participation in research that
           do not modify patient's care)

        -  samples are sent to the laboratory, centrifuged and stored at -80Â°C until they were
           assessed.

        -  samples were used to specific analysis in this study:

        -  Study of qualitative expression of collagen IV and XIX by Reverse transcription
           polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blot

        -  Study of quantitative variations of these collagens by ELISA

      Statistical analysis planification:

        -  description of the data (mean and standard deviation),

        -  comparison of different groups (non-pathological vs pulmonary disease) by Student's t
           test, Wilcoxon, Chi2 or Fisher test.

      Expected results and prospects:

      The investigators should be able to demonstrate the presence of collagen IV and/or collagen
      XIX or different fragments in biological samples. The investigators would then be able to
      show variation in expression of these collagens according to different pathological
      situations. In the longer term, the objective is to validate these collagens as a markers of
      pulmonary pathologies or as therapeutic agents.
