      are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment sequences. During each treatment period, subjects have
      three lidocaine topical systems applied to their back for 12 hours with 7-day washout between
      treatments. In each treatment period, the subject will either exercise (Treatment A), apply a
      heating pad (Treatment B), or refrain from these activities (Treatment C) while wearing the
      topical system. Blood samples for lidocaine PK will be collected pre-dose until 48 hours.
      Adhesion will be monitored throughout the wear time and skin irritation will be assessed the
      topical system is removed.
