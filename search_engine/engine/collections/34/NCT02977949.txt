      with osteoporosis and the responses to osteoporosis treatment. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is
      considered to be the best estimate of body stores of vitamin D and the seasonal variation of
      25OHD is well known. But there are few reports concerning to the seasonal variation of
      osteoporosis treatment. In this study, we plan to compare clinical efficacy and safety by
      seasons in patients treated by raloxifene.
