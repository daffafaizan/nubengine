      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of blinatumomab in patients B-cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia in complete morphologic remission with positive minimal residual disease (MRD) in
      terms of relapse-free survival (RFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and MRD negativity rate by
      flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overall and after the first cycle, as
      well as safety of blinatumomab in this setting.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who do not proceed with stem cell transplantation may receive blinatumomab
      IV maintenance therapy with one cycle every 3 months for up to 4 cycles. Patients who remain
      in MRD remission for 3 months and then become MRD positive again can be retreated following
      the same treatment plan previously received.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
