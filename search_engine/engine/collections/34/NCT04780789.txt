      chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads are included in the study. The investigators
      assess the response to the treatment by standard methods (RECIST, mRECIST) as well as by
      volumetric analysis. The size of tumor is evaluated on CT/MRI by two investigators prior to
      first TACE and then on all the check-ups (routinely every three months) until 31 December,
      2019 or the patients' death.
