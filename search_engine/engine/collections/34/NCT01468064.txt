      with acute cerebral infarcts within the middle cerebral arterial territory and with severe
      neurological deficits will be enrolled and randomly allocated into 3 groups: autologous BMSCs
      transplantation group, autologous EPCs transplantation group and Placebo control group.
      Randomization codes were established by the study statistician and were revealed only to the
      stem cell laboratory technician responsible for separating the cells into aliquots or
      preparing the placebo material. All patients will undergo a Bone Marrow aspiration procedure
      at 7 days after symptom onset. BMSCs and EPCs will be expanded ex vivo and then intravenously
      infused into own body, respectively. The control group will not receive cell therapy. Observe
      will followed for up to 1 year after the onset. Neurological score, neuroimaging, mortality
      of any cause, side effects, and new-onset comorbidities will be monitored and compared
      between each groups.
