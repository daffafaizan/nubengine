        -  To document the toxicity and feasibility of reduced-intensity conditioning regimen
           comprising carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab followed by
           allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with primary refractory
           or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  To document the survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive BEAM chemotherapy comprising carmustine IV over 2
           hours on day -6, etoposide IV over â‰¥ 1 hour on days -5 to -2, cytarabine IV over 15
           minutes twice daily on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients also receive
           alemtuzumab IV on days -5 to -1.

        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): Patients undergo allogeneic
           HSCT on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV (or
           orally once tolerable) beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 60, followed by a
           taper in the absence of GVHD.

        -  Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI): Patients with mixed chimerism or stable residual
           disease at 6 months after HSCT or disease progression or relapse at any time after HSCT
           may receive DLI in the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.
