      pupil diameter, astigmatic value, and axis when visual stimuli were applied under binocular,
      monocular (dominant eye, non-dominant eye, ipsilateral, and contralateral), and pinhole
      conditions using the WAM-5500 binocular autorefractor/keratometer (Grand Seiko Co. Ltd.,
      Hiroshima, Japan).
