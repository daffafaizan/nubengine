      (conducted in more than one center) study of combination of tramadol hydrochloride and
      acetaminophen in treatment of participants with pain of fibromyalgia. The duration of this
      study will be 56 days per participant. The study consists of 2 parts: Screening (that is, 3
      weeks before study commences on Day 1) and Treatment (that is, up to Day 56). All the
      eligible participants will receive oral tablet for combination of tramadol hydrochloride and
      acetaminophen. Rescue medication (a medication intended to relieve symptoms immediately) of
      tylenol (500 milligram, up to 6 oral tablets daily) will be permitted throughout the study
      duration. Efficacy of the participants will primarily be evaluated by Pain Visual Analog
      Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
