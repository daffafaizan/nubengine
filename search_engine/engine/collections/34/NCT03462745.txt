      one of two groups using a randomization program that assigned research participants into
      group A (AccuVein AV300 assisted intravenous catheter insertion) or group B (standard
      technique of insertion of the intravenous cannula). After pre-anesthetic evaluation, the
      research participant was brought to the operating room and standard monitoring were applied
      (EKG, SpO2, BP) if tolerated. Anesthesia was induced via face mask with sevoflurane in 100%
      O2. The anesthesiologist and resident decided on a site believed to be the best for
      cannulation and on the size of the venous cannula as 22g or 24g. When the supervising
      anesthesiologist deemed it appropriate, the venous cannulation was attempted, according to
      the randomization groups, either with the AccuVein device (group A) or blindly (group B). A
      rating of the vein attempted as either difficult or easy was established by the attending
      anesthesiologist.
