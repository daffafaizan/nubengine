      meeting any exclusion criteria, and signing the informed consent, could they be enrolled in
      the group to receive ENB-guided ablation therapy combined with VATS. The primary endpoint is
      objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints include progression-free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.
