    
      Purpose: we will examine feasibility, tolerability, utilization, and effectiveness of using
      the SupportTeam mobile application in the context of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for
      veterans with PTSD.

      Participants: (N=100) 50 veterans who have served in the military since October 2001 and have
      PTSD with anger problems; and 50 collateral family members/close friends above the age of 18.

      Procedures (methods): All Veterans with PTSD will receive a 12 session standard CBT for
      anger. Veterans in the intervention group will additionally receive instructions for using
      SupportTeam with a family member or friend that will provide data for the CBT clinician.
      Veterans in the control group will receive the CBT sessions, but will not receive the
      SupportTeam mobile application.
