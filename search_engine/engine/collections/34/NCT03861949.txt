      receiving preoxygenation in conventional technique, Group S receiving preoxygenation with 5
      cmH2O CPAP and Group H receiving preoxygenation in 25Â° head-up position with 5 cmH2O CPAP.
      After 3 min of preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced and trachea intubated. After confirming
      the tracheal intubation by direct visualization, all patients were left apneic in supine
      position with the tracheal tube exposed to atmosphere till the SpO2 dropped to 92%. The
      primary outcome compared between the groups was the non-hypoxic apnoeic period (time to fall
      SpO2 to 92%).
