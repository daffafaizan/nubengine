    
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) designed to
      collect patient outcome data on a commercially available human autologous homologous skin
      construct (SkinTE™) with SOC dressing compared to SOC dressings alone in the treatment of
      Venous Leg Wounds (VLU) .The trial will be single blinded in regard to wound healing
      assessment (another clinician, other than the investigator at each site will assess wound
      healing) and confirmation of wound healing will be overseen by an independent adjudication
      committee made up of wound care experts. The study will last thirteen weeks, with a two week
      screening period prior to enrollment.

      There are two arms in the study:

      Arm 1: The Experimental Arm , that will include SOC Therapy. SOC therapy in this study is
      appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in
      conjunction with debridement) and the experimental wound care covering with human
      autologous,homologous skin construct (SkinTE™) followed by a moisture retention dressing and
      a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compression wrap
      (DynaflexTM or equivalent).

      Arm 2: The Standard of Care Arm. The SOC therapy in this study is appropriate sharp or
      surgical debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in conjunction with
      debridement) and wound care covering with calcium alginate Fibracol dressing followed by a
      moisture retentive dressing and a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft
      roll and compressive wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent).
