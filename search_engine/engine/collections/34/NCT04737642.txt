      (ERC) with sphincterotomy. Those interventions are performed either before or after
      gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy), thus, requiring at least two interventions. Moreover,
      ERC with sphincterotomy is associated with a considerable rate of short and long-term
      morbidity. The main complications are pancreatitis (2-7%), post sphincterotomy bleeding
      (1-2%), impaired function of the sphincter with reflux of duodenal content to the bile ducts
      and a consecutive risk for cholangitis, stone recurrence and even a potential higher risk for
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate an alternative surgical approach of bile duct clearance
      at the time of cholecystectomy. Literature of this approach is scarce; however, it has shown
      a trend to lower postoperative complications if compared to ERC. The technique of sphincter
      of Oddi balloon dilatation and bile duct clearance from stones via cystic duct at
      cholecystectomy has been described in a few case series. These small case series have shown a
      good success rate of bile stone clearance and low complication rates when applying the
      balloon dilation technique for smaller stones.

      The investigators have used this technique in selected cases with good success as well.
      However, the technique needs to be assessed regarding feasibility and safety in a consecutive
      group of patients.
