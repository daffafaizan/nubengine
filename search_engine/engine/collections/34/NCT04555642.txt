      FDG, FAPI-04 using multimodality PET/MRI. Previous studies have shown that increased cardiac
      uptake of FDG on PET may be an indicator of myocardial injury after chemotherapy. Cardiac
      magnetic resonance (CMR) allows for multiparametric evaluation of cardiac morphology,
      ventricular function, myocardial perfusion, and viability. The combination of PET with MR
      (PET/MR) is therefore an alternative attractive pairing for diagnostic imaging. The aim of
      this study is to find noninvasive and effective method for early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity
      after chemotherapy or immunotherapy
