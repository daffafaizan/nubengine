    
      This double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over study on healthy participants will
      evaluate the perceptual differences of pain and changes in mood in response to peripheral
      nerve stimulation over two regions of the left external ear. A series of short and long
      duration heat stimuli will be applied to the participants forearms and they will be asked to
      rate their current mood state, the intensity of the pain, and whether it was pleasant or
      unpleasant. The series of heat stimuli will be applied before, during, and after mild
      electrical stimulation of the left external ear using a commercially available TENS unit.
      There are two study sessions. Session 1 involves eligibility screening, a brief practice
      session, followed by the testing session. In Session 2 (no more than 7 days later), the
      testing session will be repeated with the exception of the location of ear stimulation. Up to
      76 people, ages 18-50 years old, will be enrolled in the study.
