      Kippur Headache' and ' First- of - Ramadan Headache.' The Cox2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, has been
      reported effective in preventing perimenstrual migraine and in preventing recurrence of
      migraine. Given its 17 hour half-life, we undertook this study to see whether 50mg rofecoxib
      taken just prior to the 25 hour Yom Kippur fast would be effective in preventing headache.

      Methods: We performed a double blind randomized prospective trial of rofecoxib 50mg vs
      placebo, taken just prior to the onset of fasting, Yom Kippur 2004. Healthy adults aged 18 -
      65 were enrolled from the community and from hospital staff. Subjects completed a demographic
      data form and questions regarding headache history and a post-fast survey on headache during
      the fast, headache intensity, general ease of fasting and side effects.

      Results: We sent out 170 forms of which 105 were completed and returned. Of those subjects
      receiving rofecoxib (n=53), ten or 18.9% vs 34 or 65.4 % of the placebo group (n=52) had
      headache at some point during the fast (p<.0001). Severity of headache in the treatment group
      was significantly less for the treatment group (3.45 vs 6.29 on a visual analog scale of 10
      (p = .009)). None of those receiving rofecoxib reported a 'more difficult than usual fast'
      whereas the distribution of difficult to easy fast among the placebo group was more even.

      Conclusion: Rofecoxib 50mg taken prior to a twenty five hour ritual fast prevents and
      attenuates fasting headache.
