      I. To estimate the objective response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      II. To estimate the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate of patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer treated with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      III. To examine the adverse event profile of combining pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the PFS of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
      pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      II. To determine the objective response rate by immune-related response criteria (irRC) of
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      III. To examine the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated
      with pembrolizumab and cetuximab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify tumor and peripheral blood biomarkers of response and/or resistance to the study
      treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes on day 1, 8, and 15 (as
      monotherapy for cycle 1 only) and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients may continue pembrolizumab treatment for up to 1 year if they experience
      disease progression.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
