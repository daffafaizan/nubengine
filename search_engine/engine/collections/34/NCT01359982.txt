      approach to temporarily change tumor blood flow and oxygenation. Blood supply to most tumors
      is poor, causing parts of tumors to have a low oxygen content which promotes aggressiveness
      and metastasis. The DINAMIC trial uses specific imaging techniques (including ultrasound),
      biopsy, and breath analysis to provide an early assessment of therapeutic activity.
