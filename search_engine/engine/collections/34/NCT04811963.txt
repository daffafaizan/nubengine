      prospective, observational studies. The goal is to enroll a minimum of ten subjects. Subjects
      may be of any race, ranging in pigmentation from light to dark to meet the study design
      requirements.

      The general purpose of Invasive Controlled Desaturation Studies is to validate the SpO2 and
      pulse rate accuracy in comparison to reference-standard measurements of blood SaO2 by a
      CO-oximeter during low saturation conditions. This is achieved through paired observations of
      SpO2 and SaO2 values over the specified SpO2 accuracy range of 60 % to 100 % SaO22 of the
      prototype pulse oximeter on a group of healthy adult volunteers. The fraction of inspired
      oxygen (FiO2) delivered to test subjects is varied to achieve a series of targeted
      steady-state saturation periods. Arterial blood samples are periodically taken from an
      indwelling arterial catheter for use in the comparison.

      Pulse rate accuracy will be evaluated during the same data collection period as SpO2. Pulse
      rate will be compared to reference ECG heart rate. In the unlikely event that the ECG monitor
      malfunctions, the Pulse rate reference may be taken using the average pulse rate value from
      the transfer standard pulse oximeters. This study is designed to support an FDA submission
      for pulse rate and saturation accuracy in a diverse subject population during low saturation
      conditions over a specified saturation range for the OxySoftN pulse oximetry system.
