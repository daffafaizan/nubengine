    
      Methods:

      It is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial where subjects are healthy volunteers from
      the city of Toledo between 18 and 40 years.

      There will be an intervention group (dry needling into the medial MTrP of soleus muscle) and
      a control group (dry needling distal to the MTrP but into the taut muscle band of soleus
      muscle). The intervention will be a unique session.

      Intervention:

      Dry needling technique will be performed by locating the taut band and the Myofascial Trigger
      Point. After that, a thin needle (0,32x40mm) is introduced directly into a Myofascial Trigger
      Point with the aims to generate a "local twitch response" that are involuntary contractions
      of the muscle fibers. This puncture may reproduce patient's symptoms, and causes muscle
      relaxation to achieve at the same time the relief of muscle tension and pain and also to
      recover the metabolism of the muscle.

      Assessment:

      The mechanical and the neural properties of muscle tone were evaluated using an isokinetic
      dynamometry and H-reflex test measurement, respectively Isokinetic dynamometric technique is
      considered a valid biomechanics method to measure muscle tone in non-injured subjects.

      The H-reflex has been utilized as a probe to study neurophysiological phenomena. This
      measurement can be used to assess the response of the nervous system to various neurologic
      conditions, musculoskeletal injuries, application of therapeutic modalities, pain, exercise
      training, and performance of motor tasks.

      Outcome measures:

      Outcome measures will include passive resistive torque to ankle dorsiflexion, dorsiflexion
      passive range of motion (PROM), maximal isometric voluntary force (MIVF) and H-reflex and
      M-response measurements and they will be evaluated before, at 10 min and 1 week after the
      intervention.
