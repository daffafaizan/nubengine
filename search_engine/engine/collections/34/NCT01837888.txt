      self-efficacy enhanced wheelchair training intervention (WheelSee) for manual wheelchair
      users who are at least 19 years of age. Self-efficacy for wheelchair use is an important
      construct, which may influence wheelchair mobility and participation. Pilot data obtained
      from this study will inform the design of an experimental trial and refinement of the
      WheelSee intervention and protocol.

      This study will use a randomized controlled, single blind design with a sample of 24 (12
      intervention, 12 control). Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention or
      control group using a computer generated table of random numbers. Participants allocated to
      the intervention group will take part in WheelSee in groups of 2-4. The WheelSee intervention
      consists of 6 (twice weekly, minimum 3 days apart) x 1.5 hour sessions. Participants will be
      encouraged to bring a family member to each session, who may act as a spotter during the
      practice of wheelchair skills. If no family member is available, a student volunteer spotter
      will be available to ensure a 1:1 spotter: wheelchair user ratio. All spotters will be
      trained in appropriate spotting techniques.
