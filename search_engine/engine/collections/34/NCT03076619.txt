    
      An observational study in which the patients for the study are selected from antenatal
      clinic, antenatal ward and "preeclampsia and eclampsia room" in Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology and general Ophthalmic Out Patient Department(OPD) in case of ambulatory patients
      during the period of November 2003 to June 2006 randomly.In every case, detail obstetric
      history including a detail antenatal history was taken. General examination and relevant
      pathological investigations like routine blood count, HIV, HBsAg, renal function tests, TORCH
      complex etc., were carried out. In every case, pupil was dilated with homatropine (2%) eye
      drops. Then detailed ophthalmic examination was carried out with special emphasis on direct
      ophthalmoscopy apart from visual acuity of both eyes and anterior segment examination. Fundus
      findings were noted in detail, changes in the color of the disc, disc margin, physiological
      cup, changes in retinal blood vessels especially caliber of vessels, arterio-venous (AV)
      ratio,changes in vessel wall, blood column, appearance of vascular light reflex, changes at
      AV crossings, changes in macular area and changes in background, overall appearance, presence
      of hemorrhages, exudates or any pathology were recorded.

      Fundus changes were graded as per modified Keith, Wagner and Barker classification.Assessment
      of prognosis as regards to vision and life (mortality) was made.
