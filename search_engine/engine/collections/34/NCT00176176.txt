      programmed electrophysiological study (EPS). To investigate the hemodynamic effects of
      ventricular arrhythmia to cerebral circulation an EEG and transcranial ultrasound are
      conducted simultaneously during the EPS. Before and after the EPS a neuropsychological test
      and an investigation of a specific blood sample (Neuron Specific Enolase, NSE) is done.
