      I. Determine capacity of pathology practices within National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community
      Oncology Research Program (NCORP) components/subcomponents for testing guideline-recommended
      biomarkers, including whether these biomarkers are tested, and how, i.e. what technologies
      are used and what ordering and testing processes / protocols have been implemented.

      II. Determine capacity for testing for novel biomarkers and tumor molecular profiling, i.e.
      whether these biomarkers are tested and how, i.e. what technologies are used what ordering
      and testing processes/protocols have been implemented.

      III. For findings in Objectives 1 and 2, determine factors influencing the heterogeneity of
      capacity for biomarker testing, particularly those factors that are modifiable (based on the
      conceptual framework above), such as cost, complexity, technologic complexity, lack of
      familiarity, physician and patient demand.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a self-administered web-based Biomarker Survey and may also complete an
      Outcome Validation Survey.
