      represent a public health problem.

      Prognosis depends on greater and lesser tuberosity status, where rotator tendons of the
      shoulder have their insertion site.

      Surgical treatment is recommended in case of tuberosities displacement. Goals are their
      anatomic reduction and stable primary fixation that will allow good bone healing and early
      mobilization. It has been demonstrated that an extended immobilization can result in
      stiffness by capsular retraction. On the contrary a too early mobilization can lead to
      secondary displacement of tuberosities and malunion.

      These sequelae can be responsible for real disability when occuring in active patients, in
      particular when dominant limb is affected.

      Internal fixation by locking intramedullary nails is currently the first choice technique
      because less invasive. However it doesn't always provide a good bone fixation, leading to
      tuberosities displacement or longer immobilization that decrease shoulder function prognosis.
      Locking plates represent a good alternative to avoid these complications by offering a better
      fixation of tuberosities in osteoporotic bone.

      Though there is no existing randomised study comparing these techniques regarding functional
      outcomes, complications rates, and patient satisfaction.
