      backed tibia components to determine whether there are differences in migration, if present,
      across the tibial components.

      The original protocol intended to perform clinical assessment using the Nottingham Knee Score
      and the Knee Society Clinical rating system pre-and post-operatively, at six months, 1 year,
      and annually thereafter. Per Protocol Amendment 01 (effective June 18, 1999) clinical data
      would also be collected via the SF-12 questionnaire. Radiological evaluation would also use
      the Knee Society scoring system at the same time points. However, data collected included
      only the SF-12 and Oxford Knee Scores, comparing change from baseline at 6, 12, and 24 months
      after surgery.
