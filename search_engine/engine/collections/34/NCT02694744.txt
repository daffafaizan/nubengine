    
      Approximately 110 eligible participants with hyperkalemia will be randomly assigned to
      receive a patiromer starting dose of 8.4- g/day, either with or without food.

      All participants will undergo a screening period (1 day) to determine eligibility for study
      entry. Eligible participants will be treated for 4 weeks and followed for 2 weeks after
      completing the patiromer treatment. There are six planned clinic visits during the Treatment
      Period and two planned visits after the last dose of patiromer during the Follow-up Period.

      The dose of patiromer may be increased or decreased (titrated) based on participants'
      individual potassium response.
