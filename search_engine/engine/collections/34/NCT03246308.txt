      effect profile compared to systemic alternatives. One rarely mentioned issue related to
      phototherapy is the question of whether it holds potential to decrease folate serum levels,
      which is of particular interest to women of childbearing age, as birth defects, such as
      neural tube defects (NTD), cardiac defects, and facial clefting have all been noted to be
      increased in women with folate deficiency. Several studies, involving different patient
      groups and modes of phototherapy, have investigated the changes of folate levels throughout
      therapy showing mixed results. While two small open studies from Egypt showed a significant
      reduction of folate levels after 24 and 18 / 36 exposures (1-2), several other studies failed
      to show a significant change (3-6). In addition, there are also conflicting data on the
      influence of UVB phototherapy on vitamin D, vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels. Therefore,
      the presented prospective trial aims at investigating the changes of these vitamins during a
      routine course of phototherapy. The study will focus on the following specific aims: Measure
      the levels of folate as well as the levels of further vitamin parameters (including
      homocysteine, 25-OH-vitamin D3, 1,25-OH-vitamin D3, holotranscobalamin and methylmalonic
      acid) before and during phototherapy (at baseline, after 12, 24 and 36 exposures and/or at
      the end of treatment)
