      modalities for liver cancer is TACE. Patients always scare of the first TACE due to their
      lack of knowledge and inadequate comprehension of the procedure. Hence, they crave to have a
      good quality in nursing service. Researcher would like to compare the effectiveness knowledge
      between Video and Handbook regarding patients' health education.

      Objective: To compare the effectiveness between Video and Handbook on providing knowledge of
      TACE.

      Study Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

      Setting: Chulabhorn Hospital, Bangkok, THAILAND.

      Methods : Eighty liver cancer patients are included in the study. They are systematically
      computerized and randomized into two groups - an experiment or video group (N 40) and a
      control or Handbook group (N = 40). A 40-item exam is performed to test the patients'
      knowledge before (x score), after (y score) and 60 days (z score) after the procedure. The
      15-min study was taken in an isolated room. The points of interest are the effectiveness of
      medias on learning achievement and relative growth of knowledge. The relative growth of
      knowledge (G1, G2 score) was calculated as follows:

      G1 = 100 (Y-X)/(F-X) % ; G2 = 100 (Z-X)/(F-X)%

      Retention of knowledge (R) = 100 - (G1 - G2) %

      Where G = Relative growth of knowledge R = Retention of knowledge X = Pre-test score Y =
      Post-test score Z = Final-test score F = Total score
