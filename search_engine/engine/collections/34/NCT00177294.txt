      Psychotherapy) to antidepressant medication (escitalopram), will be more effective in
      reducing lingering symptoms of depression and decreasing the burden of these symptoms, when
      initial treatment with just antidepressant medication alone has led to only a partial
      response. Participation in the study will last up to 22 weeks.

      Because fewer than 50% of elderly depressed patients achieve remission and recovery in
      response to first-line antidepressant pharmacotherapy, the majority of patients are left with
      significant symptoms and functional impairment, putting them at risk of chronic, relapsing
      illness, non-adherence to other medical treatment, suicide, and family caregiver burden. We
      will recruit and treat 320 patients with unipolar major depression aged 60 and older, using
      clinical management with escitalopram 10 mg/day for six weeks. Patients who are partial
      responders to escitalopram plus clinical management will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of
      extension therapy with either 20 mg escitalopram plus clinical management or 20 mg
      escitalopram plus Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT, 16 sessions). Changes over time in
      measures of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, disability, and family
      caregiving burden will be assessed. This study will answer the question of how best to treat
      partial responders-by simply extending pharmacotherapy at higher doses, or by also adding
      psychotherapy-to remission and recovery.
