    
      Treatment-naive patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic (Stage III to IVB) squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are candidates for concurrent chemoradiotherapy as
      primary therapy with curative intent will be enrolled. Patients will be genotyped for
      germline variations at four SNP loci in three genes involved in DNA nucleotide excision
      repair (ERCC1, ERCC2, and XRCC1). Patients with 3 to 8 variants will receive cisplatin (Arm
      A). Patients with 2 or fewer variants will receive cetuximab (Arm B).

      The hypothesis of the study is that prospectively testing patients for variations in DNA
      repair enzymes to determine whether to use cisplatin or cetuximab in locally advanced head
      and neck squamous cell cancer is feasible.
