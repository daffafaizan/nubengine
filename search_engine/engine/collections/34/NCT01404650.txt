      tract. Sunitinib (Pfizer) and imatinib (Novartis) are FDA-approved for treatment of patients
      with GIST. However, patients with advanced or refractory GIST who are resistant to these
      agents eventually experience disease progression or death. Heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) is a
      substance found in various malignancies that encourages tumor cells to grow and survive. As
      an inhibitor of Hsp90, AUY922 may decrease growth of tumor cells that were resistant to prior
      therapies. This study investigates AUY922 monotherapy as treatment for patients who either
      progressed on, or were resistant to, imatinib and sunitinib.
