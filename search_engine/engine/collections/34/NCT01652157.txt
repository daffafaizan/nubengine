    
      This is a prospective, observational, population-based cohort study in US cystic fibrosis
      patients participating in the Cystic Fibrosis Patient Registry in order to assess the
      incidence of and risk factors for fibrosing colonopathy. Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients
      participating in the registry from participating sites, as well as new CF patients enrolled
      in the registry at these sites over a 2-year period, will serve as the base study population
      (estimated to include 24,500-25,000 cystic fibrosis patients between the first patient
      encounter documented in the registry from any participating site and the 31st of July 2014).
      Cystic fibrosis patients in the base study population will be followed at their regular
      clinical care visits and, any patients presenting over a 10-year period with signs and
      symptoms of suspected fibrosing colonopathy, based on a prospective definition, will be
      approached to obtain a study-specific informed consent for collection of additional data
      outside the standard registry data collection form in order to augment surveillance. Data
      routinely collected via the standard CF registry will be used to determine exposure to any
      specific pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and to assess potential risk factors for the
      outcome of confirmed fibrosing colonopathy. An independent adjudication panel will be
      utilized to validate the diagnosis of fibrosing colonopathy based on a prospective case
      definition as well as decision rules.
