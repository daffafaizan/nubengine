      (HRQL) of patients' whether related to surgical intervention or not. The primary objective of
      this study is to measure the change in HRQL in Dupuytren's contracture patients who do and do
      not undergo palmar fasciectomy. Health related quality of life will be measured using the 1)
      Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI3); 2) Short Form-36 (SF-36); and the 3) Michigan Hand
      Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ). The secondary objective is to look at the measurement
      properties, including the reliability and responsiveness, of each of the three HRQL
      instruments when they are used in patients with Dupuytren's contracture. We will also assess
      the concurrent validity of each of the HRQL instruments.
