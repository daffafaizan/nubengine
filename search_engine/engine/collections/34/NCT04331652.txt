      infertility, miscarriages and the risk of transformation into malignant pathology. The
      discovery of an endometrial polyp requires its removal.

      The treatment of endometrial polyps is conventionally carried out by hysteroscopic resection
      under general anesthesia with a bipolar resector of 22 Charri√®res (Ch) or more after dilation
      of the uterine cervix in the operating room.

      Following the recent appearance of a 15 Ch. bipolar mini-resectoscope, it seems that uterine
      dilation and anesthesia could be avoided by reducing the caliber of the instrument.
