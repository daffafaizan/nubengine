      patients with Huntington's disease, despite the evidence that these cognitive domains can be
      abnormal even before motor symptom onset. Because cognitive symptoms are highly associated
      with functional disability, treatments aimed at improving cognitive functions would be of
      significant benefit to patients in the early stages of the disease. Atomoxetine is the ideal
      choice for such a trial. It has proven efficacy in adults with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and it selectively targets norepinephrine and dopamine in the
      prefrontal cortex rather than in subcortical areas. This selectivity is an advantage for
      patients with HD, because motor side effects are less likely to be facilitated than with a
      psychostimulant. The present study is a feasibility study in which we propose to administer
      either 80 milligram (mg) atomoxetine for 4 weeks or placebo to 20 patients with early HD who
      also complain of mild cognitive symptoms. The groups will then crossover to the other
      condition (atomoxetine or placebo). Participants will be assessed on measures of ADHD
      symptoms and a sensitive battery of neuropsychological tests. Based on the shared neural
      circuitry in ADHD and HD, and the demonstrated effectiveness of atomoxetine on attention in
      adults with ADHD, improved performance on cognitive tests of attention and executive
      functions and on subjects' report of ADHD symptoms are expected in the atomoxetine treatment
      phase. No changes in motor status are predicted during the study.
