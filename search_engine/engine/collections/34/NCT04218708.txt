      smoking and very low quit rates compared to the general population. Although a primary
      rationale for conducting this study is reducing health disparities among PLWHA, there is a
      potential benefit of the proposed work from a prevention perspective given that combustible
      cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for non-adherence to ART and may decrease the
      effectiveness of HAART. Smoking-related illnesses are leading causes of non-HIV/AIDS-related
      deaths among People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) could
      help people reduce the harm of combustible cigarette (CC) through reductions in number of
      Cigarettes per Day (CPD) or quitting CC completely by addressing both nicotine and behavioral
      dependence. Unlike CC, EC are not associated with coronary heart disease or myocardial
      infarction. The purpose is to identify barriers and facilitators, as well as assess
      preliminary effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction strategy among PLWHA.
