      heart failure (HF) improve survival and quality of life, work capacity remains at a
      disappointing 50% of the expected value.

      Due to the worldwide (increasing) shortage of donor hearts, LVADs are increasingly used as
      destination therapy which makes it crucial for physicians to persistently identify
      opportunities to improve management, lower the adverse events and maximize the benefits of
      this treatment option.

      In recent years it was found that upregulation of device pump speed improves the maximal work
      capacity of LVAD recipients with no side effects. More recently it was found that the
      patients' heart rate reserve also was of importance in this regard, however, the latter was
      shown in a retrospective study and needs to be confirmed in a prospective randomized
      double-blinded intervention study. As a large portion of LVAD recipients are already
      implanted with a pacing device (and suffer from chronotropic incompetence) such a study is
      possible to conduct by controlling their heart rate during exercise by pacing (ie randomized
      crossover design).
