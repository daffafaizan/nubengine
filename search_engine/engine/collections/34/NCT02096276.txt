      pharmacovigilance. Following new European Union Pharmacovigilance legislation, pregnancy
      registries are to be considered as post-authorization safety studies (PASS). The ongoing
      Registry will therefore be converted into a PASS study in Q1 2014.

      Exposed pregnancies reported to the Registry before the transition into a PASS (between 03
      May 2005 and Q1 2014), from which data were collected and analyzed prospectively, will also
      be included in the analyses.

      Some pregnancy exposures may be reported after pregnancy outcome has been identified
      (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective reports, but these reports
      will not be included in the analyses of prospective reports.

      Pregnancy outcome data will be collected using questionnaires within 2 months of the
      estimated date of delivery (EDD) and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the EDD (for
      all live births for whom the contact details of their HCP will be available) to ascertain the
      presence of birth defects not diagnosed before, from Q1 2014 to Q3 2019.
