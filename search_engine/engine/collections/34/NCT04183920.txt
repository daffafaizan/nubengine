      metabolism and UV irradiation. Cumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes collagen
      glycation and crosslinking which are direct causes of skin ageing. Previous studies have
      shown that cranberry phytochemicals scavenge reactive carbonyls. Cranberry polyphenols have
      been reported to attenuate collagen degradation and inhibit oxidative stress in human cells.
      It is unknown whether cranberry juice consumption could protect against UV -induced erythema
      and improve overall skin health. Furthermore, if it does have effect, what will be the
      mechanism? This human intervention study will be conducted to answer these questions. We
      hypothesize that cranberry juice consumption will attenuate skin photoaging and improve skin
      health in women via alleviate oxidative stress.
