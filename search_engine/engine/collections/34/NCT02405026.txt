      the Duke ID Clinic

        -  HIV infected asthmatic subjects meeting clinical definitions for asthma compared to HIV
           uninfected asthma subjects identified at the DAAAC and HIV infected non-asthmatic
           subjects.

        -  Prospective immunological phenotyping - HIV-infected asthma subjects prospectively
           identified and clinically phenotyped compared to HIV-uninfected asthma subjects
           identified at the DAAAC and HIV infected non-asthma subjects.

      Regarding the sampling method of probability sample: All samples for HIV infected asthmatic
      patients, HIV uninfected asthmatic patients and HIV infected non-asthmatics patients will be
      analyzed.

      Retrospectively determine overall asthma prevalence and severity among HIV-infected patients.
      Retrospective immunological phenotyping (circulating cytokines) of HIV-infected patients
      utilizing available specimens in the Duke HIV Specimen Biorepository

        -  HIV-infected asthmatic subjects meeting asthma definition compared to overall asthma
           prevalence in U.S. population

        -  HIV-infected asthma subjects meeting asthma definitions compared to matched HIV-infected
           non-asthma subjects
