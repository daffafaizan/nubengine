      rehabilitation, colorectal surgery has made great progress . At the same time, the
      application of evidence-based surgery and multimodal anesthesia in postoperative
      rehabilitation has accelerated the postoperative recovery. Moreover, several previous studies
      have shown that the implementation of ambulatory colorectal surgery can reduce the incidence
      of postoperative complications and shorten hospital stay. With the continuous development of
      rehabilitation surgery, the hospitalization time of colorectal surgery has been gradually
      shortened. In addition, studies had preliminarily proved the feasibility, safety and
      repeatability of outpatient colectomy and showed that 30% of patients with elective colectomy
      can be completed in outpatient department.

      Therefore, the investigators designed the clinical pathway of day surgery for patients
      screened by outpatient department, so that these patients can complete laparoscopic radical
      resection of colon cancer or high rectal cancer in the day surgery center.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of day surgery center for
      patients with colon/upper rectal cancer (CuRC). Patients meet the inclusion criteria and
      exclusion criteria will be assigned to day surgery center to perform radically laparoscopic
      colectomy or anterior resection. Outcomes of interests including incidence of transfer to
      inpatient ward, readmission, perioperative adverse events will be recorded prospectively.
