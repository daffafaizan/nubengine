      patients with recurrent B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II.
      Determine the systemic B43-genistein exposure levels in these patients. III. Determine the
      antileukemic activity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Monitor the development of human
      antimouse antibody in these patients on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive B43-genistein immunoconjugate IV
      over 1 hour on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or until disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of B43-genistein immunoconjugate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study.
