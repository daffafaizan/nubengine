    
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a painful and stressful surgical procedure. Pregabalin is a
      lipophilic structural analogue of the inhibitory Î³-aminobutyric acid by binding to the
      presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels that are widely distributed throughout the central
      and peripheral nervous system. Pregabalin has anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sleep-modulating,
      anti-hyperalgesic, opioid-sparing6 and anti-allodynic properties through inhibition of the
      release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine, serotonin,
      dopamine and substance P. These unique characteristics make pregabalin as a useful
      therapeutic for treating neuropathic pain and acute postoperative pain in several models of
      incisional injury and inflammatory conditions including laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
