      muscles in the lower legs that will improve walking ability in those who have had a stroke
      and at the same time ensure walking stability will be achieved through an analytical approach
      comprised of computational models and gait simulations to objectively determine
      patient-specific patterns of muscle activation. The investigators will develop a computer
      simulation of the dynamics of hemiplegic gait characterized by unilateral plantarflexor
      weakness. Then, the investigators will relate the results of the computer model results to
      real data collected from subjects with known plantarflexor weakness to provide a theoretical
      basis for improving gait efficiency and stability with FES.
