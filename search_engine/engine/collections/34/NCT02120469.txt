      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of everolimus and eribulin (eribulin mesylate),
      and determine the recommended Phase IB dose (RP2D) of the drug combination in patients with
      resistant metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the
      event-free survival (EFS) rate for patients with resistant metastatic TNBC at the RP2D of
      everolimus and eribulin to determine if the drug combination is worthy of further study.
      (Phase IB)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response rate in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) II. To
      determine overall survival (OS) in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) III.
      To determine toxicity in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC. (Phase IB) IV. To determine
      pharmacokinetics (PK) for everolimus and eribulin in patients with resistant metastatic TNBC.
      (Phase IB) V. To collect blood, skin punch biopsies, and tumor biopsies before and after
      treatment from all patients and perform proteomic analysis to determine the level of
      inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway in tumor cells versus
      non-therapeutic targets. (Phase IB)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.

      Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and eribulin mesylate
      intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 21 days and then
      periodically.
