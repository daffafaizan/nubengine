      is implicated in the cognitive deficit in patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders,
      including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
      The mechanism of action, the allosteric modulation of α7 nAChR and improvement of cognitive
      and memory function both in relevant animal models and patients has been clearly described in
      recent literature. The effect of AVL-3288 strongly supports the rationale for use in
      schizophrenia given the dose effect relationship, peaking at a low dose in rats (HED 3 mg),
      in rodent schizophrenia and memory models. Phase I, single-center, inpatient, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalating study to evaluate the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetic profiles of single oral doses of AVL-3288 in healthy subjects. Subjects
      will be hospitalized in the University of Colorado Clinical Research Center (CTSA) for a 12
      hour period after the single dose. Then there will be an ambulatory 24 and 48 hour
      observation and washout period of 10. Patients will receive an evoked potential measurement,
      the P50 sensory gating paradigm, and the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of
      Neuropsychological Status.
