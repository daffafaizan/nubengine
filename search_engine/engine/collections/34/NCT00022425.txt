        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of perillyl alcohol in women at risk for recurrent
           breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral perillyl alcohol once daily on days 1-28. Treatment continues every 4
      weeks for 3 courses.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of perillyl alcohol until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 6 patients experience grade 1 toxicity or at least 1 of 6 patients experience
      grade 2 or greater toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
