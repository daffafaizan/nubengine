      inflammatory stress response. Aortic surgery is also associated with elevated troponin which
      is a sensitive and specific marker for myocardial injury. The severity of oxidative stress is
      correlated with elevated troponin. Melatonin, which is a hormone produced in brain, seems to
      modify cell damage and inflammation. On the other hand we know, that melatonin production
      first night after surgery is disturbed. The purpose of this study is therefore to determine
      whether treatment with melatonin can reduce cell damage and inflammation, and thereby
      occurrence of myocardial injury associated with abdominal aortic surgery.
