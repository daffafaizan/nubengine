      age-related cataract, and a normal ophthalmologic examination besides senile cataract.
      Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgery, central endothelial cell count less than
      2000 cells/mm2, glaucoma or intraocular pressure greater than 21 mmHg, amblyopia, retinal
      abnormalities, steroid or immunosuppressive treatment, connective tissue diseases, or an
      allergy or hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. Enrolled patients who had complicated cataract surgery
      (eg, posterior capsule rupture, vitreous loss, or an intraocular lens not placed in the
      capsular bag) were subsequently excluded.

      Study Protocol Preoperatively, patients had an extensive ophthalmologic examination,
      including measurement of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), refraction, slitlamp
      examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), fundoscopy, corneal endothelial cell count by
      noncontact specular microscopy (Noncon Robo, Konan), central corneal thickness (CCT)
      measurement (Pentacam, Oculus, Inc.), and biometry with the IOLMaster partial coherence
      interferometry device (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). The targeted postoperative refractive error
      was 0.0 D. The visual acuity measurements were recorded with logMAR UDVA and CDVA.

      In addition, a baseline spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) scan was performed before surgery and
      postoperatively after 1, 4 and 12 weeks. All SD-OCT imaging was performed with a
      spectral-domain Heidelberg Spectralis OCT devise (Heidelberg Engineering, Inc., Heidelberg,
      Germany).

      Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ration to 1 of 2 treatments groups using a computer-generated
      randomization list. The study medications were ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% (Acular LS,
      Allergan) in group 1, and nepafenac 0.1% (Nevanac, Alcon) in group 2. Patients were
      instructed to instill ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% 1 drop in the operative eye 4 times a day
      (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bedtime), and nepafenac 0.1% 1 drop 3 times a day.
