      precancerous polyps (polypectomy) reduces the incidence and mortality associated with
      colorectal cancer. However, polypectomy is associated with adverse events. Post-polypectomy
      bleeding has a significant impact on the life of the patient as it can require
      hospitalization, transfusions, repeat colonoscopy and rarely death. It is also a substantial
      cost to the health care system. Post-polypectomy delayed bleeding (PPDB) can occur up to a
      month following the procedure but is typically seen within the first week. Risk factors
      include the size of the polyp, antithrombotic or anticoagulation use, age, major
      comorbidities and proximal colon polyps. The incidence of bleeding after removal of large
      polyps is estimated to be around 2.6%-9.7%. There currently is no standard of care to prevent
      bleeding after polypectomy. Tranexamic acid reduces fibrinolysis by slowing down the
      conversion of plasminogen to plasmin which may prevent bleeding.

      This pilot study will examine factors involved in the feasibility of conducting a large-scale
      RCT. This pilot study will include 25 consecutive patients who are treated with tranexamic
      acid after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) of large non-pedunculated colorectal polyps
      (LNPCP's) to prevent PPDB.
