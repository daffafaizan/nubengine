    
      This clinical investigation is designed to collect fully anonymised perioperative blood
      pressure data from patients undergoing high risk surgical procedures.

      It is increasingly being recognised that in high risk surgery, the perioperative incidence
      and duration of hypotensive episodes (MAP <60mmHg) can adversely impact postoperative
      outcome.

      Collecting continuous perioperative blood pressure data will enable hypotensive episodes to
      be recorded. Such data will be used to aid the development and testing of algorithms involved
      in generating the guidance provided by BP Assist.
