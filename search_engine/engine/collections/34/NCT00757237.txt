    
      Number of Subjects Planned: Approximately 240 randomized patients

      Target Population: CF patients >= 6 years of age with stable pulmonary disease, who at study
      entry had a recent positive sputum culture for PA and had been previously treated with
      aerosolized antibiotics without demonstration of drug intolerance.

      The randomized phase of this study, used for hypotheses testing, enrolled participants from
      both the United States (US) and EU. An open-label, single-arm extension was available for
      participants in the EU who completed at least one course of AZLI or TIS during the randomized
      portion of the study. These participants were eligible to receive 3 additional cycles of AZLI
      in a 28-day, intermittent, repeating treatment regimen. Results of the extension phase will
      be available the first quarter (Q1) of 2012.

      Randomized Phase Study Design (US and EU): This was an open-label, multicenter, randomized,
      parallel group study. The study design consisted of 2 treatment arms of 28-day, intermittent,
      repeating treatment regimens: aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI) or tobramycin
      inhalation solution (TIS). The total study period was 26 weeks. The study schedule included 9
      visits - Screening, Baseline, Day 14, Day 28, followed by visits every 28 days through the
      end of the study.
