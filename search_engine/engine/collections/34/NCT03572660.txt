      endpoint will be a change in LVEF from baseline measured by a CT scan of the heart at 3
      months. The secondary endpoints include change in LVEF from baseline measured by a CT scan of
      the heart at 12 months, in-hospital procedural related morbidity / mortality and assessment
      of major adverse cardiac events (MACE; death, heart attack, need for repeat heart
      revascularisation), change in exercise capacity and NYHA class at 3 months and 12 months
      respectively. The NYHA classification is a quantitative way of assessing a patient's heart
      failure symptoms. It places patients into one of four categories (I - IV).
