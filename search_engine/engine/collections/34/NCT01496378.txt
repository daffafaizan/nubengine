      quality of life for these youth. Parents play an important role in how their children cope
      with chronic pain, and can also experience their own distress related to their child's
      illness. Parental psychological distress is widely recognized to be associated with poorer
      child adjustment. However, no interventions have been developed specifically to treat
      psychological distress in parents of children with chronic pain. Problem-solving skills
      training (PSST) has been shown to result in significant reductions in parental distress among
      caregivers of children with other types of chronic illness such as cancer. The purpose of
      this study is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PSST for parents of youth
      with chronic pain.
