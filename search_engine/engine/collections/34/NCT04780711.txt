      Incomplete clarification of the etiology and pathogenesis, the lack of standard diagnostic

      anomaly cause temporomandibular joint diseases. It also causes a wider group of non-specific
      TMB originating from the musculoskeletal system.When the literature was reviewed, no
      publications on the frequency of TMJ joint disease were found in medical faculty students.
