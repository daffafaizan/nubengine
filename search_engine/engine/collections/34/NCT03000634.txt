      disease (as determined by gene array studies - studies that look at specific genes using
      special equipment) respond very well to treatment. However, about 15% of low-risk patients
      still relapse during the first three years of treatment, which means that better treatments
      are still needed.

      This study will compare the effectiveness and safety of maintenance therapy with continuous
      bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) compared to maintenance therapy that
      alternates VRD with Elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Elo RD) every eight weeks.

      Elotuzumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone are all approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. VRD is the standard maintenance regimen
      prescribed at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Myeloma Institute for
      patients with low risk disease. The investigators want to learn if alternating VRD with Elo
      RD during maintenance therapy will result in better outcomes.
