      participants different dose levels of the study drug. Three to six participants will receive
      the starting dose of the drug. If the side effects are not too severe, the next group of
      participants will take the study drug at a higher dose level. Up to 3 dose levels of the
      study drug will be tested, but once each participant has been assigned a dose level, the
      participant will always receive the same dose. The highest dose that people can be given
      safely is called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the MTD is determined, up to 10
      additional participants will receive that dose to further study the drug.

      Participants between the age of ≥18 months (540 days) and ≤ 21 years with relapsed (second or
      subsequent relapse) or refractory ALL or AML will be eligible to enroll. KPT-330 will be
      administered twice a week on Days 1 and 3 for four weeks (a cycle is 4 weeks). All
      participants will receive intrathecal chemotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle. Participants with
      CNS-2 disease will receive additional doses of IT chemo. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be
      collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1-3 and 15. PK samples will be collected during Cycle 2 on
      Day 15. Pharmacodynamic (PD) samples will be collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1-3. PD samples
      will be collected during Cycle 2 on Day 15. Additional optional correlative biology sample
      will be collected. Participants are monitored closely for adverse events. Participants will
      have physical exams and blood work more than once a week during all cycles.
