      Carboplatin) could have a higher Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate than the control
      group (Trastuzumab+Docetaxel+ Carboplatin) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      It is proposed that 268 participants will be enrolled in this study. The target population is
      women with early breast cancer (stage of T2-3N0-3M0) who are eligible for primary systemic
      therapy.

      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the pCR rate. The secondary objective of
      the trial is to determine the Event-free survival(EFS), Disease-free Survival (DFS), Distance
      Disease-free Survival (DDFS), Objective Response Rate (ORR) rate.
