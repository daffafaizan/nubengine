      adolescents. Students spend long period of time seated, which is being associated with
      reports of musculoskeletal discomfort and pain. The high level of mismatch between students
      and school furniture is being associated with adolescent lower back pain. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the level of mismatch between students and school furniture and to
      assess the effects of adjustable furniture on sedentary behavior, physical activity levels,
      and sitting posture in students. Before the experimental part of the study, we will obtain
      the anthropometric measures of all students participating in the study to calculate the
      mismatch between the students and the school furniture. In the next step, the participants
      will be separated to the experimental or the control group. The experimental group will use
      adjustable school furniture for one week whereas the control group will use the conventional
      school furniture. All the participants will wear an accelerometer for five consecutive days.
      The participants will also complete questionnaires about the sedentary behavior and physical
      activity levels. The sitting posture will be evaluated with Rapid Upper Limb Assessment tool
      (RULA). Moreover, at the baseline and on the last day of measurements we will measure the
      classroom environment factors (light, noise, air flow, temperature). The results obtained
      will indicate the furniture mismatch prevalence and demonstrate the effects of adjustable
      furniture on health-related parameters in students.
