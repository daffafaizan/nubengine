    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the separation of men and women in the
      metro of Mexico City leads to an improvement in the violence and perception of violence
      towards women.

      The separation of men and women will take place in the Line 5 of the metro system. The
      separation will operate between 6:00am-10:00am and 2:00pm and 10:30pm. Line 4 and 6 will be
      used to estimate the counterfactual.

      Women eligible to participate in the study will be those aged 18 and 65 years who use lines
      4, 5, and 6 between 7am and 9am or between 11am and 1pm before the separation between men and
      women is implemented. Eligible women must reside in Mexico City or the metropolitan area of
      the Valley of Mexico (60 municipalities agglomerates in the State of Hidalgo and Mexico
      State).

      Women will be recruited in the metro before the separation between men and women is
      implemented. They will be asked for their name, e-mail and telephone number. Also before the
      separation is implemented, they will be asked to answer a telephone survey to collect
      baseline information. The same women will be contacted again in the following 12 to 15 months
      to collect the endline survey, also by phone. The implementation of the separation will take
      place after the baseline survey has been collected.
