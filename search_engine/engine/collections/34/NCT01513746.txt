      than the general population. Yet what accounts for the increased prevalence of ED in T1D, and
      how to effectively treat these patients is unknown. ED in T1D is dangerous. T1D patients with
      ED not only engage in behaviors common among non-diabetic ED patients (like binge eating),
      but also might omit insulin to prevent weight gain. The goal of this study is to understand
      the psychophysiological precipitants to ED behavior among T1D patients.
