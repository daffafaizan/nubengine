      However, the delivery of appropriate amount of tidal volume by ordinary manual bag
      ventilation may be difficult. In addition, it require adequate training to rescurer.

      We hypothesised that an Amflow assist ambu bag may be helpful to delivery accurate tidal
      volumes to the patients.

      Participants performed bag-valve ventilation to manikin by ordinary technique and Amflow
      assist technique in our simulation centre. We measured each ventilation rate and ventilation
      volume in simulated scenario and we compare those between two technique.
