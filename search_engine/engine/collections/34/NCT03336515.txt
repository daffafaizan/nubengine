    
      PURPOSE:

      The objective of the study is validity of the effectiveness of a vibrating postural device in
      reduce the respiratory events (Apnea-Hypopnea Index-AHI) in patients with positional
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

      The postural device is a vibratil device of 5x3 cm and a weight of about 30 grams integrating
      an accelerometer, a vibration and other sensors. The device is placed on the patient's
      forehead and when the device detects that the patient is in the supine position for 30
      seconds or more, it starts a vibration, with increasing intensity, which ceases when the
      patient moves to lateral.

      METHODOLOGY: DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized parallel study controlled by placebo. It will
      include patients with diagnosis of positional OSA in the Sleep Units of the Hospital
      Universitario Araba and Hospital Arnau de Vilanova de Lleida. These patients will be
      randomized to three groups: Group A: General recommendation not sleeping in supine position;
      Group B: General recommendation not sleeping in supine position and the device without any
      activation (placebo); Group C: General recommendation not sleeping in supine position and the
      device activated (intervention group).

      Patients will undergo a basal conventional polysomnography (PSG) and after 12 weeks of
      treatment. In addition all patients will be visited at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.

      PRIMARY OUTCOME: Validity of the effectiveness of a vibrating postural device in reduce the
      respiratory events in patients with positional Obstructive Sleep Apnea . SECONDARY OUTCOMES:
      To determine the effectiveness of the device for: 1) To reduce the time spent in supine
      position; 2)To maintain the quantity and the quality of sleep; 3) The side effects ; 4)
      Reduction of snoring; 5) Cost-effectiveness analysis.
