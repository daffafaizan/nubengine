    
      All subjects with suspected Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) scheduled for diagnostic
      polysomnography (PSG) will be invited to participate in the study to be tested to determine
      if they have Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), using the ApneaLink (AL) Sleep Screener.
      Subjects initially will be tested for SDB in the home environment. Following an AL home test,
      subjects will undergo a simultaneous, attended diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) sleep study
      and ApneaLink test for the purpose of confirming and comparing the results between diagnostic
      PSG and the AL device.
