      in the study.

      Each subject will participate in 3 kinetics of 5 hours with a different product test each
      time, in a randomized order. A wash-out period of at least 7 days will be respected between
      each kinetics. The products to be tested will be in the form of a powder (25g individual
      sachet, including 20.1g of protein) which will be reconstituted in 250ml of water and to
      which 100mg of 13C sodium acetate will be added.

      For each of the kinetics, blood samples, expires gasses, will be collected at different time
      during the kinetics. A urinary collection throughout the day of kinetics will also be
      performed to allow the determination of urinary nitrogen Indirect calorimetry measurements
      will be performed 45 minutes every hour in the postprandial period and a measurement of 45
      minutes will be made when the subject is fasting. Six measurements of indirect calorimetry
      will be performed for each kinetic.

      Finally subjects will be asked to evaluate their satiety on a visual analog scale, 15' before
      taking the product, then every 15' the first hour in the postprandial period and every 30
      'from the 2nd hour.

      The subjects will also have a tolerance questionnaire to complete with each kinetic.

      At the end of the kinetics, a standardized meal, single menu, consumption ad libitum measured
      in double weighing will be proposed to the volunteers to evaluate their satiety

      During the 3 days preceding each kinetics, the protein intake of the subjects will be
      controlled. The meal of each night in the evening of kinetics will be standardized and
      identical for each kinetics. The volunteers will complete a food survey on the 3 days of
      control of their diet that precede each kinetics.
