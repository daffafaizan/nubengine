      developed as an innovative treatment for substance dependence. This study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, blood concentrations and effect following repeated oral doses of
      GSK618334 in healthy male and female volunteers. The effect of food on a single oral dose of
      GSK618334 will also be evaluated. Another portion of this study will investigate dopamine
      type 3 receptor binding in the human brain by PET scan before and after repeated doses of
      GSK618334.
