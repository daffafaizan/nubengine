    
      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, adaptive, parallel groups, placebo
      controlled 3-stage study in patients with SMA type 2 or non ambulant type 3.

      Stage 1 DMC 3-month safety assessment: An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)will
      assess the safety of olesoxime every 3 months.

      Stage 2 Efficacy/futility analyses at one year: A first interim efficacy analysis will be
      performed after all patients have been treated for one year (52 weeks) in order to assess the
      need to continue the study to reach the planned objective. In the event of positive and
      significant results in favor of olesoxime, the study will be considered as successful and all
      patients will be switched to olesoxime to allow the assessment of the sustainability of the
      treatment effect and safety. If the results are significantly in favor of placebo, the study
      will be discontinued for failure (futility).

      Stage 3 Efficacy and safety analysis at two years: The expected study duration is of 2 years
      (104 weeks) to show efficacy. If the study is not discontinued for futility or medication
      regimen is changed due to success, the study will therefore continue until planned completion
      i.e. 104 weeks.
