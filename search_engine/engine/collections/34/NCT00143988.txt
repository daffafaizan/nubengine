    
      Physical exertion will be measured by a standardized treadmill test. Sexual activity will be
      performed in the study subject's home with his/her spouse or regular partner. Each study
      subject will wear a blood pressure and heart rate monitor at home during their sexual
      activity and will be asked to complete a one page diary upon completion of the activity.
      Normotensive and subject with mild hypertension will be studied to determine if hypertensive
      subjects have a relatively greater increase in their blood pressure during either physical
      exercise or sexual activity.
