      developing severe, disseminated disease. Widespread immunization with Bacille-Calmette-Guerin
      (BCG) vaccine has not been effective in preventing primary TB infection or in halting the
      progression from latent to active disease. Poor vaccine efficacy has prompted investigators
      to develop novel TB vaccines and to experiment with enhancing the immune response to the
      current BCG vaccine.

      Increasing data indicate that children with low vitamin D levels and specific genetic
      variants that lower functional levels of vitamin D are at increased risk for severe
      tuberculosis. Elegant studies investigating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection have
      shown that mycobacteria are able to reside in endosomes within macrophages by preventing
      endosome-lysosome fusion; a critical step in autophagy, a cellular process used to recycle
      cytoplasmic organelles and proteins, and to degrade microbial organisms including Mtb.
      In-vitro studies have shown that vitamin D increases autophagy and triggers the production of
      antimicrobial peptides including cathelicidin. This leads to increased intracellular killing
      of Mtb and increased Mtb antigen presentation to the immune system. Anti-tuberculous vaccines
      that over-express Mtb antigens generate a stronger immune response than wild type BCG
      vaccine.

      The investigators hypothesis is that a single oral dose of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) given
      to infants prior to BCG administration will enhance the immune response to vaccination
      through improved MHC class I and class II presentation of the vaccine.
