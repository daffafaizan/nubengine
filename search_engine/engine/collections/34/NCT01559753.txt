    
      This is a prospective, randomized, open, multi-center study.

      3.1 Primary Objective

      Show that antibiotic therapy of 8 or 15 days is equivalent in terms of clinical cure rates in
      the treatment of early onset nosocomial pulmonary infection in patients under mechanical
      ventilation.

      3.2 Secondary Objective

        -  Study of nosocomial infections: assessing the influence of the duration of antibiotic
           treatment on the rate of fatal pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infection (definition of
           nosocomial infections: annex XIII).

           â€¢ Study of bacterial Ecology: research of changes in the flora of the gut under
           treatment and analysis of pathological samples (antibiotic resistance phenotypes
           +/-genotypes).

        -  Economic Survey: analyze the costs related to the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and
           its complications in two study groups.
