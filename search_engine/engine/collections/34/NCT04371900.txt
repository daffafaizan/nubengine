      contraception to mothers on their children born before the intervention. The population
      subject to intervention is fecund women age 18-35 years at risk of pregnancy and who are
      clients at Planned Parenthood clinics of Michigan (PPMI), who meet income eligibility
      criteria, and who would otherwise pay out-of-pocket for services on the day of recruitment
      (i.e., lacking insurance coverage for received service). The experimental (treatment)
      condition is a mother's receipt of a voucher providing access to no-cost contraception (up to
      the price of a name-brand intrauterine device) for 100 days. The control group of mothers
      receives no voucher. All enrolled women complete a two-part baseline survey and consent to be
      re-contacted for two follow-up interviews in outgoing years. They also complete a two-part
      baseline survey and consent to be re-contacted for two follow up interviews in outgoing
      years. In addition, mothers consent to linkages to their own and their children's
      administrative data from records held by state and federal health, education, criminal
      justice, and tax records. Consent covers children already born to women at the time of
      intervention and children born after intervention. Survey and administrative data provide
      outcome measures to assess children's well-being and development up to age 18. The study will
      compare children of mothers who receive the intervention to those who did not.
