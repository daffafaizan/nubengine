    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the safety of the GardasilÂ® quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6, 11,
           16,18) virus-like-particle vaccine with vs without prior exposure to one or more of the
           HPV types in the vaccine in HIV-positive women in Chennai, India.

        -  Determine the effect of the vaccine on HIV viral load and CD4+/CD8+ levels in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the proportion of these patients who respond serologically to the HPV vaccine
           and the kinetics of their response.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the prevalence and incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the spectrum of cervical HPV types in these patients at baseline, 9 months,
           and 1 year after vaccination.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant
      vaccine intramuscularly on day 0 and once in weeks 8 and 24.

      Patients undergo cervical cell, buccal cell, and blood sample collection at baseline and
      periodically after vaccination for immunologic and virologic studies. Cervical cytology
      specimens are examined by polymerase chain reaction to detect HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 DNA, as
      well as 35 other HPV types. Blood samples are analyzed for CD4+/CD8+ cell count, plasma HIV-1
      RNA levels, and serum HPV antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Some plasma
      samples will be stored for future HPV pseudovirion neutralization assays.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 12 months.
