      specialty care setting from two sources:

        1. referred by family physicians with inadequate glycemic control likely requiring
           exogenous insulin therapy

        2. referred by medical staff at Vancouver General Hospital or St. Paul's Hospital during
           in-patient care & about to be discharged (Appendix 1).

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into either the NCM group
      or SC group.
