      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal inherited disease in North European
      populations, affecting approximately 1:2500 live births. It is a multisystem disorder with
      respiratory morbidity and mortality being the leading cause of death. Lung disease in CF is
      characterized by neutrophil-dominated inflammation and chronic bacterial infection of the
      airways, which results in deterioration of lung function and premature death [1]. Despite
      improved survival in successive birth cohorts, the current median survival age of patients
      with CF is about 40 years [2]. Understanding the initiating events of CF lung disease (e.g
      viral infections and microbiome) and their influence on disease progression throughout early
      childhood is essential to improve survival through targeted early interventions.

      Objectives:

      The overarching aim of this study is to identify early life predictors of disease progression
      in children with CF. Therefore, this study implies three objectives, as follows: i) to
      investigate the effect of respiratory viral infections on microbiota dynamics in the first
      year of life in infants with CF, and to examine their influence on lung function at 1 year of
      age; ii) to examine whether deficits in lung function in the first year of life in infants
      with CF persist to pre- and school age and adolescence and are associated with impaired
      functional and structural abnormalities at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 years of age; and iii) to
      determine the principal drivers of impaired lung function at 1 year and impaired lung
      function and structural outcomes at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 years of age in individuals with
      CF.

      Methods:

      Lung function, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respiratory symptoms and quality of life
      questionnaires, microbiology, medical history and clinical data will be collected during each
      phase of the study.

      Recruitment and participation:

      Infants with CF diagnosed by NBS will be recruited at the time of their first lung function
      test in Bern at the age of 4-8 weeks. As part of the protocol for the diagnosis and follow-up
      of CF infants diagnosed by NBS, which has been implemented by the Task Force for CF NBS on
      behalf of the Swiss Working Group for Cystic Fibrosis, optional infant lung function at the
      University Children's Hospital of Bern is proposed to all parents of newly diagnosed CF
      infants.

      Information collected:

      Lung function data:

        -  Tidal breathing parameters (minute ventilation, respiratory rate, tidal volume, tidal
           expiratory flow, tidal inspiratory flow, time to peak expiratory flow) averaged over 100
           breaths

        -  Multiple breath washout (FRC, LCI, moment ratios) and single breath washout (molar mass)

        -  Spirometric forced expiratory volume loops (FVC, FEV1, PEF, MEF50)

        -  Body plethysmography (airway resistance, lung volumes: TLC, FRC, RV)

        -  Respiratory Rate over 60 seconds

        -  Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (marker of airway inflammation)

        -  Resistance interrupter measurement

        -  Electric nose

        -  Forced oscillation technique

        -  Electrical impedance tomography

        -  Impedance plethysmography

      Microbiological data:

        -  Nasal swabs (respiratory virus and bacterial diagnostics, as well as host transcriptome
           analysis)

        -  Pharyngeal swabs (bacterial colonization and microbiota analysis)

        -  Sputum (to analyse the neutrophils)

      Blood count (hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, leukocyte number, lymphocyte number,
      lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, basophil count, monocyte count, promyelocyte count,
      myelocyte count, platelet count, immunoglobulin E level, interleukins,
      Granulocyte-Monocyte-Colony Forming Unit, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha, Interferon gamma and
      Interferon lambda)

      Urine (to estimate the tobacco exposure during pregnancy (amount of Cotinine) and the content
      of caffeine and steroid profile)

      Lung MRI:

      Functional and structural images of the lung

      Skin-Prick Test (test for pollen, trees, house dust mite, cat and dog)

      Questionnaires (to assess quality of life)

      Medical history (information on respiratory symptoms, pulmonary exacerbations,
      hospitalisations and regular therapy)

      Study database:

      All study data is recorded in an Access-database with SQL Servers by electronic Case Report
      Forms. The database is accordant to the HFG and was adapted together with the CTU.
