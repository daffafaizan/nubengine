    
      This study is an open, dose escalation/dose regimen finding study to assess the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of donor-derived CD20-directed CAR-T cells administered with
      lymphodepletion, and to obtain the preliminary efficacy results in subjects who have been
      diagnosed with relapsed or refractory CD20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma or small lymphocytic lymphoma. The allo-CAR-T cells will be
      infused in split-dose.
