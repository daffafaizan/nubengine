      above baseline values. PRP is made by centrifugation of whole blood (drawn from a peripheral
      vein and stored in an acid citrate dextrose solution A (ACD-A) anticoagulant), which
      separates the various components of blood by their specific weight and increases the
      concentration of platelets.

      Platelets are a rich source of the complex group of proteins called growth factors (GFs)
      involved in natural wound healing and in regeneration of injured tissues. GFs are active
      signals for attracting stem cells into the site of injury and triggering proliferation of
      these cells. PRP limit inflammation, interacting with macrophages to improve tissue healing
      and regeneration, promote new capillary growth, and accelerate epithelialization. Platelets
      in PRP also play a role in host defense mechanism at the wound site by producing signaling
      proteins that attract macrophages; PRP also may contain a small number of leukocytes that
      synthesize interleukins as part of a non-specific immune response. Previous studies of PRP
      have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus,
      including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus
      neoforma. So, PRP is effective in soft tissue healing, having no side effect and showed
      excellent healing score in skin wound healing.
