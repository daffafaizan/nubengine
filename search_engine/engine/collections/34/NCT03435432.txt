      liquid formula. 5 hours later, they drink 50 grams of glucose in 50 ml of water in one visit
      and 50 ml of water in another. The 2 visits are randomized. Blood samples are taken before
      and after they drink the high fat liquid formula, and continued until 3 hours after they
      drink glucose or water. Lipid levels in the blood samples are measured in the lab.
