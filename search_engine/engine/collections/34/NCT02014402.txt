    
      This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, Phase II study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols as an adjunct to hemostasis during
      vascular (IG1202-A), hepatic (IG1202-B), soft tissue (IG1202-C), and spinal (IG1202-D)
      surgical procedures. Approximately 180 subjects were randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups
      in a 2:1 ratio: Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols (120 subjects) or Bovine Thrombin JMI (60
      subjects) among the 4 types of surgeries. Randomized subjects were evaluated for
      identification of a target bleeding site (TBS) in which control of bleeding by conventional
      surgical techniques (including suture, ligature and cautery) was ineffective or impractical
      and required an adjunct treatment to achieve hemostasis. The Investigator rated the intensity
      of bleeding at the TBS. Topical Thrombin (Human) Grifols or Bovine Thrombin JMI was applied
      to the TBS and the time to hemostasis was assessed at various timepoints during a 5-minute
      observation period.

      Subjects were evaluated by surgery type and by integrated analysis of clinical studies
      IG1202-A, IG1202-B, IG1202-C, and IG1202-D.
