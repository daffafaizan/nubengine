      At time of diagnosis, 20% of patients present with a resectable tumour, 40% with an
      irresectable locally advanced tumour (without metastases) and 40% with metastatic disease.
      The median survival of patients with irresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer is only
      6 months. Currently, there is no effective treatment for these patients. Therefore, there is
      an urgent need for new therapies. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a technique that has been
      demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of several irresectable tumours. RFA produces
      local tumour destruction through high frequency alternating current flowing from an electrode
      implanted directly into the tumour and causing frictional heating. The purpose of this study
      is to determine the safety of RFA-pancreas in patients with non-metastasized, irresectable,
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
