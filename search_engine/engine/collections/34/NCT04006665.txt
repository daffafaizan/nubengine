      Ultrasound Imaging in patients undergoing pelvic robotic surgery. (ii) To demonstrate a link
      between lung aeration score and Alveolar- Arterial Oxygen gradient . Methodology -In the
      Operation Room 5 lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) , Pulse Oximetry (SPO2 ) , Noninvasive blood
      pressure (NIBP), End tidal carbon di Oxide (ETCO2 )and core temperature will be monitored ,
      intravenous assess will be established with large bore cannula ,under local anesthesia radial
      artery cannulation will be performed , standard general anesthesia with oral cuffed
      Endotracheal tube and Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV ) will be provided to
      all patients.Anaesthesia will be induced with Fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg-1 , Morphine 0.5mg/kg-1
      ,Propofol sleeping dose and Atracurium 0.5mg/kg-1,and maintained with Air/O2 Sevoflurane ,
      Propofol infusion @100- 150 mcg/kg-1 to maintain Bispectral Index (BIS) between 40 -60 and
      atracurium infusion to maintain Train -of - Four (TOF Ratio) < 0.5 Baseline Lung Ultrasound
      Imaging will be performed to record 4 point Lung aeration score ( 0= Normal lung , 1=
      moderate aeration loss, 2=severe aeration loss ,3=complete aeration loss and consolidation )
      at T1 - 5 minutes after induction of anaesthesia and before docking robotic instruments in 6
      basal zones in both lungs ( 3 zones in each lung ) and labelled as Zone I (Right anterior
      basal ) Zone II ( Right lateral basal) and Zone III (Right posterior basal) . Zone IV ( Left
      anterior basal) , Zone V (Left lateral basal ) , Zone VI ( Left Posterior basal ).T2 - Lung
      Ultrasound Imaging will be performed to record aeration score after removal of robotic arms
      at the end of robotic surgery and before extubation in 6 basal zones in both lungs.Ti
      Arterial blood gas 5 minutes after induction of anesthesia and before docking robotic
      instruments.Tii -Arterial blood gas 5 minutes after the end of robotic surgery and de docking
      robotic instruments.All patients will receive Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) 5 cms
      of water (H2O) intraoperatively . Intraabdominal Pressure will be maintained at 15 cms H2O.
      Any decrease in Oxygen saturation < 96 % and intervention required will be noted. At the end
      of surgery , neuromuscular blockade will be reversed , trachea extubated and patient shifted
      to Postanaesthesia Care Unit.
