      malnutrition, or both appear to be the underlying problems. In fact, lean body mass per body
      weight better predicts prognosis than creatinin based models (NDT, 2004.19:1182). In
      addition, comorbidity such as HIV infection may exacerbate cachexia found in ESRD. Whether or
      not daily supplemental, high-caloric nutrition in ESRD corrects a catabolic state in ESRD is
      unclear.

      Hypothesis to be tested:

      Daily supplemental high-caloric nutrition beneficially affects cytokine stimulation (TNF
      alpha, IL 1beta, IL 6, CrP) and nutritional state (cross sectional area of triceps m. in
      mid-humerus position (MRT), plasma albumin) in in HIV-positive hemodialysis patients and in
      chronic hemodialysis patients compared to chronic hemodialysis patients without supplemental
      nutrition.
