    
      Rucaparib (CO-338; formerly known as PF 01367338 and AG 14699) is an orally available, small
      molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being
      developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated with homologous recombination [HR] DNA
      repair deficiency (HRD). The safety and efficacy of rucaparib has been evaluated in several
      Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.

      An oral formulation is the focus of current development efforts. Rucaparib is currently being
      investigated as monotherapy in patients with cancer associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
      For this study, it is anticipated that rucaparib will promote cell death in the
      BRCA-deficient tumor cells of ovarian cancer patients with evidence of a germline mutation,
      thereby limiting tumor progression and providing therapeutic benefit.
