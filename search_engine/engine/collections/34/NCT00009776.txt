        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 in
           combination with paclitaxel and cyclosporine in patients with recurrent or refractory
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 (Y90 MOAB
      Lym-1).

      Patients receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -2 to 14. Patients receive
      unlabeled MOAB Lym-1 IV followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 MOAB Lym-1 IV on day 0. On
      day 7, patients receive unlabeled MOAB Lym-1 IV followed by Y90 MOAB Lym-1 IV. Patients in
      cohorts 2-4 also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 9. Courses repeat every 8 weeks
      for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB Lym-1 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 21 months, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.
