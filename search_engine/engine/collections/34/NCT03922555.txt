      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ASTX727 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      ASTX727 is made up of the 2 study drugs cedazuridine and decitabine. Cedazuridine is believed
      to work by slowing down how fast decitabine is broken down by the body. Decitabine is
      believed to work by blocking abnormal cells or cancer cells from growing.
