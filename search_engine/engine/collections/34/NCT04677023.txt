      Dentistry, Cairo University; the operator in charge Safinaz Hussien ,The subjects fulfilling
      the eligibility criteria of the trial will be selected from the regular attendees at the
      clinic of Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.Patient
      examination will be done including medical history, dental history, extra-oral examination
      and intra-oral examination. A periapical radiograph will be taken prior to restorative
      procedures to assess the degree of approximation of caries to pulp, intactness of lamina dura
      and/or presence of any periapical radiolucency to exclude the case.The field of operation
      will be isolated with the application of a rubber dam if possible. Otherwise, cotton rolls
      and the saliva ejector will be used for moisture control. For cavity preparation, local
      anesthetic (Mepecaine-L, Alexandria Company, Egypt) solution will be administrated to control
      patient discomfort during the procedure.The cavities will be prepared by using cylindrical
      #314 (Komet®, Germany) in a high speed handpiece (Sirona, Germany) rotating at high speed
      with copious coolant. Remaining soft caries -if present- will be removed using sharp
      excavator (Maillefer, Dentsuply, Switzerland).After the cavity preparation is finished, it
      will be thoroughly air-water cleaned. The bonding system; FuturabondU(Voco, Germany) will be
      applied according to the following instructions recommended by the manufacturer: Futurabond
      M+ will be applied to prepared tooth structure and cured for 20 seconds using Elipar™ S10 LED
      curing light (3M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) with light intensity of 1200 mW/cm2. The prepared
      cavities will be restored with Admira fusion X--tra® bulk (VOCO, Cuxhaven in layers that are
      a maximum of 4 mm thick then cured for 20 seconds using usingElipar™ S10 LED curing light (3M
      ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) with light intensity of 1200 mW/cm2. and for the control group
      cavities will be restored with GrandioSO x-tra(VOCO, Cuxhaven) in layers that are a maximum
      of 4 mm thick then cured for 20 seconds using usingElipar™ S10 LED curing light (3M ESPE, St
      Paul, MN, USA) with light intensity of 1200 mW/cm2.
