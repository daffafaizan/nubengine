      a screening to determine eligibility for study entry and giving written informed consent.

      We will include 20 participants who have pitch 100 times with dynamic taping or shame taping
      in randomized sequence. There must be more than 2 weeks resting between 2 test. We will test
      maximal force in shoulder flexion, extension, abduction and adduction before and after test.
      We also record spins and speed of baseball for performance outcome.

      To our hypothesis, we suggest dynamic taping could decrease the arm fatigue after long-term
      pitching.
