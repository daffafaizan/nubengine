    
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of autologous chimeric antigen receptor-B-cell maturation antigen (CAR-BCMA T cell;
      CT053) in patients with relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma.

      Part A of the study will be Dose Escalation followed by Part B, an expansion cohort.
      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (CT053).
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepletion prior to
      CT053 infusion. All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the
      study after receiving CT053 for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination
      criteria, will be asked to continue to undergo long-term follow-up in a companion study.
