      mm in depth) in molars were recruited. Dental caries was removed and the prepared cavity was
      restored with resin composite using one of two restorative procedures: (1) without GIC
      lining; (2) with (resin-modified) GIC lining. Restored teeth were evaluated for any pulpal
      complications (subjective symptoms, objective signs or loss of tooth vitality) at one month
      (baseline), one year and two years after restoration.
