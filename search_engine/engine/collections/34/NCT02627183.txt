      interventions (catheter ablation and exercise training) on circulating BDNF concentrations in
      patients with atrial fibrillation. It also seeks to determine if there is a relation between
      circulating BDNF concentrations and mental health (depression severity, quality of life and
      symptoms) among those undergoing interventions for atrial fibrillation catheter ablation or
      exercise training. Using a pre-post study design, the investigators will explore
      interventions in two subsets of patients at the opposite end of the atrial fibrillation
      clinical spectrum. Arm 1: patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will undergo catheter
      ablation (n=100). Arm 2: patients with permanent or persistent atrial fibrillation will
      perform exercise training 2 times weekly for 12 weeks (n=100). Total sample size will be 200
      participants. All measurements will be performed at baseline and follow-up.
