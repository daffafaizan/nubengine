    
      This is a multicentre, prospective longitudinal observational cohort study in patients with
      high grade glioma, who have surgery planned to remove >90% of the tumour, and subsequent
      radical radiotherapy with concomitant tomozolomide. The purpose of this study is to establish
      a model using DTI that can accurately predict the site of where glioblastomas will progress
      after treatment. This study aims to validate the use of DTI as a biomarker across multiple
      centres to develop analysis methods that could be used in the future to personalise
      radiotherapy treatment volumes, and potentially surgical targets.

      Patients will be given a DTI-MRI both prior to the operation and prior to radiotherapy.
      Clinical MRIs will take place according to standard guidelines. Whilst the study is open
      patients will participate in the study until death. Once a total of 70 patients from the
      first 90 have shown true progression patients will participate in the study for a minimum of
      6 months from the beginning of radiotherapy.

      This study will be conducted in 6-10 NHS centres, where 120 patients will be recruited,
      patients who are withdrawn will be replaced.
