      Grade C, previous buckle surgery and pseudophakia. A good and correct assessment of the
      detached retina was done. Investigator followed the Lincoff rules to find the retinal breaks.
      Investigator performed a three-port vitrectomy: one infusion trocar and two instruments
      trocars. Non-contact wide-angle viewing systems (Resight- Biom) have a viewing field of
      60-130° was used. Investigator used Perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) for attaching the retina
      with its gravity. Then performing PFCL against air exchange.The retina will be attached under
      air tamponade. Laser photocoagulation was performed in the air-filled eye.

      Investigator applied the laser effects confluently surrounding all retinal breaks. Then
      silicone oil (1000 centistokes) was injected as a final step and permanent tamponade.After
      3-6 months investigator removed the silicone and examined the retina for 6 weeks after
      surgery to detect the recurrent cases.
