      autoimmune diseases, JAK3 is an essential component of the immune signaling cascade. This
      cascade ultimately contributes to abnormal immune response that results in chronic
      inflammation and, in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), irreversible damage to cartilage
      and bones. Selective inhibition of JAK3 offers a new disease modifying approach to the
      treatment of RA.

      This study will follow a "treat to target" (T2T) paradigm. T2T strategies have been followed
      in non-rheumatologic fields for decades. T2T trials have been conducted for RA from the late
      1990's, and have substantiated the concept that treating to a target is associated with a
      better outcome than standard of care treatment. This has led to recommendations by experts to
      use T2T strategies in clinical practice.
