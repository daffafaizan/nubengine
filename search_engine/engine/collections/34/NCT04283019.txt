    
      Participants (N=60), will be randomized to 1 of 3 oral dosing conditions that include: 100mg
      CBD/3.7mg THC (0.39% THC), 100mg CBD/2.8mg THC (0.3% THC), or 100mg CBD/0mg THC (0.0% THC).
      Participants will first complete an 8-hour drug administration session and after this initial
      session, participants will take participants' assigned study drug for the next 14 days at
      home, twice daily (participants will visit the lab on days 2, 7, and 14). Participants will
      return on day 21 (after 1 week washout) for a final visit. During the 8-hour session and
      visits occurring during the following 21 days, participants will provide biospecimens (urine,
      blood, oral fluid, hair) which will be tested for cannabinoid concentrations. Pharmacodynamic
      assessments (subjective and cognitive effects) will also be assessed during these visits.
