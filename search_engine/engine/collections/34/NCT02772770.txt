    
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are being seen with increased frequency in
      pediatric and adolescent patients. The management of these injuries is controversial and
      includes nonoperative treatment and operative treatment with various surgical techniques.
      Pediatric ACL: Understanding Treatment Outcomes (PLUTO) is a multi-center, prospective cohort
      study. Specific aims of PLUTO are to evaluate the safety and comparative effectiveness of
      non-operative treatment, as well as four operative treatments including (1) transphyseal ACL
      reconstruction (2) partial transphyseal ACL reconstruction, (3) physeal-sparing epiphyseal
      ACL reconstruction using the Anderson technique, and (4) physeal-sparing ACL reconstruction
      using the Micheli/Kocher technique in prepubescent and pubescent skeletally immature
      patients. Accrual will take place over eight years at 9 pediatric sports medicine centers.
      Post-treatment outcome assessment will be performed at 6-9 months, 1 year, and 2, 5, and 10
      years after treatment , including functional outcome, activity level, health-related quality
      of life, graft survivorship, knee stability, knee motion, and growth disturbance.
