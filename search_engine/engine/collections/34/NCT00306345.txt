      university hospital.

      The INTERVENTION consists of three parts:

        1. The introduction of a hospital-wide intensive care unit based medical emergency team to
           evaluate and treat patients deemed at risk for developing an adverse outcome.

        2. Education and training of ward staff in the recognition and basic management of patients
           developing a critical illness.

        3. The development of an intensive care (nurse and physician staffed) consultancy service
           for general wards.

      STUDY POPULATION: The population for this study consists of patients undergoing major general
      surgery with an admission stay of more than 48 hours. It includes patients undergoing central
      or peripheral vascular surgery, major oncological surgery, lung surgery, major abdominal
      surgery and trauma surgery.

      MEASUREMENTS AND OUTCOMES: In total, 1500 patients will be included. (750 Patients in the
      control period and 750 patients in the intervention period). Measurements include the
      incidence of Serious Adverse Events, HRQoL (Quality of life EQ-5D), costs of care and ICU
      logistics.

      TIME-SCHEDULE: Data collection starts January 1, 2006 and stops no later than three months
      after the inclusion of 1500 patients or April 1, 2008. The final report of the study will be
