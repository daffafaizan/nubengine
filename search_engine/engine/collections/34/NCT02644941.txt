    
      This is a Phase 3, prospective, multicenter, multinational, open-label, randomized, two-arm,
      comparative study. Subjects who sign informed consent would undergo study-specific screening
      assessments within 35 days from the day of informed consent.

      On the day of surgery (Day 0), subjects could still be undergoing screening assessments, such
      as confirmation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, to determine their eligibility before they
      are randomized in the study. Eligible study subjects will be randomized to receive either a
      HAV or one of two commercially available ePTFE grafts and followed to 24 months
      post-implantation at routine study visits regardless of patency status. After 24 months,
      subjects with a patent study conduit will be followed (while the study conduit remains
      patent) for up to 5 years (60 months) post implantation at routine study visits.
