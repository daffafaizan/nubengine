      Additionally, since optimal therapy usually includes the combined use of 2 or more
      antiretroviral agents in advanced patients, other novel antiretroviral therapies may be
      accessed through commercial means or via compassionate use programs. NOTE: 1592U89 should not
      be administered as a single new agent added to a failing treatment regimen.
