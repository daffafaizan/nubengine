      of acute kidney injury (AKI). New biomarkers indicate kidney damage in an early stage before
      developing acute kidney injury according to AKI Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
      (KDIGO) Definition is detectable. The investigators want to test if it's possible to prevent
      AKI based on elevated urinary biomarkers. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to two
      groups, a control and an intervention Group by an early nephrologic consultation. The
      interventional group will receive an early preventive nephrologist consultation additionally
      to standard care.
