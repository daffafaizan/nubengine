      procedures in Plastic Surgery and Otorhinolaryngology. Nasal obstruction is one of the majors
      concerns in this procedures, because it affects quality of life and surgical outcomes. Nasal
      surgeons have paid much attention to nasal valve area to prevent nasal obstruction and some
      assert reconstruction of the middle vault after dorsal reduction with grafts. The gold
      standard for middle vault reconstruction after dorsal reduction has been the spreader graft,
      first advocated by Sheen. Studies in surgical techniques for the treatment of nasal valve
      collapse focus much more in techniques than in evidence of its efficacy.
