        -  Compare overall survival in patients with resected gastric adenocarcinoma treated with
           epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional fluorouracil (5-FU) vs 5-FU bolus and leucovorin
           calcium before and after 5-FU plus radiotherapy.

        -  Compare disease-free survival and local and distant recurrence rates in these patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate the expression of putative prognostic markers (including TS, ERCC-1, MSI,
           E-cadherin, EGFR, p27, COX-2, and c-erbB-2) with overall survival of patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Correlate specific germline polymorphisms related to chemotherapy metabolism and
           resistance (including UGT2B7 [epirubicin], GST [cisplatin], ERCCI [cisplatin], XRCC1
           [cisplatin], TS [5-FU], DPD [5-FU], and EGFR polymorphisms) with treatment-related
           toxicity and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Correlate serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF-2, and IGF-binding
           protein 3 with overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to depth
      of tumor penetration (T1 or T2 vs T3 vs T4), lymph node involvement (0 vs 1-3), and extent of
      lymphadenectomy (D1 or D2 vs D0 or unknown). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil (5-FU) IV on days 1-5 of
           courses 1, 3, and 4. Courses repeat every 28 days. During course 2, patients undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week and receive 5-FU IV continuously for 5 weeks. Patients rest
           for 28-35 days between course 2 and 3.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive epirubicin IV over 3-15 minutes and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on
           day 1 and 5-FU IV continuously on days 1-21 during course 1. Beginning 1 week later,
           patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week and receive 5-FU IV continuously for 5
           weeks. Patients rest for 28-35 days before beginning course 2 of chemotherapy. Patients
           then receive epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU as in course 1. Treatment repeats every 21
           days for 2 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 2 years, and then
      annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 824 patients will be accrued for this study.
