      fibrinogen level. Given the effective factors of RPR in repairing damaged tissues, its
      application in the field of regenerative medicine has widely been interested over the last
      three decades. According to the literature, PRP is an effective and safe treatment in the
      fields of orthopaedics, dermatology, ophthalmology, and repair of neurological, vascular, and
      connective tissue damage, but its application in the field of infertility is limited to a few
      pilot studies in which the effects of PRP on endometrium and recurrent implantation failure
      (RIF) were investigated. Given the importance of endometrial compliance and according to
      molecular studies, which indicate that endometrial growth factors in women with a history of
      RIF are lower than normal fertile women, PRP, along with other existing strategies, can be
      used to improve endometrial compliance in patients with a history of RIF. The present
      randomized, controlled clinical trial is proposed to determine the efficacy of PRP in the
      treatment of patients with RIF in the cycles of IVF-ICSI and frozen embryo transfer at Royan
      Institute.
