    
      This is a 2-treatment, randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial in adult patient with
      COPD.

      Each dose of tiotropium or placebo will consist of one capsule self administered from the
      HandiHaler device once daily during the treatment period (tiotropium or placebo). Each dose
      will be taken at the same time each morning between 08:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.

      Each dose of ipratropium MDI or placebo MDI will consist of 2 puffs; patients will inhale 2
      puffs four times daily. The first dose will be taken at the same time each morning between
      08:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.; subsequent doses will be taken at lunch, at dinner and when going
      to bed.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in mean response between tiotropium and
      ipratropium.

      The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in mean response between tiotropium
      and ipratropium.

      Comparison(s):

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group trial to
      compare the bronchodilator efficacy and safety of Tiotropium (18 mcg once a day) and
      ipratropium Metered Dose Inhaler (2 puffs of 18 mcg four times a day).
