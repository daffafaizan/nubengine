      implementation of current methods and development of new methods are based on the solid
      ground of large and reliable clinical data. Furthermore, clinical findings assume even more
      significance when detected in study populations from different institutions with
      heterogeneous referral pathways, baseline clinical characteristics and perioperative
      treatment strategies. The rationale of this European multicenter study is therefore to
      prospectively collect data on baseline characteristics, operative and anesthesiological
      methods and postoperative outcome of patients undergoing CABG in eleven cardiac surgery
      centers from five European countries. This multicenter prospective registrywill provide data
      to evaluate the prognostic impact of a number of patients' risk factors as well as the
      efficacy and safety of operative methods and drugs used during the pre-, peri- and
      postoperative period.
