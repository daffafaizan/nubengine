      ranging from 0-43% in various cancers. Monthly bolus 5-FU + interferon-alfa-2b has not
      undergone formal phase II testing. In a small pilot study, a 5 consecutive day schedule of
      5-FU and interferon-alfa-2b resulted in the limiting toxicities of diarrhea and mucositis. A
      more limited schedule was recommended. Therefore, it is reasonable to examine such a
      schedule. In the current study, 5-FU will be followed by interferon-alfa-2b daily for 3 days
      to attempt to benefit from both the biochemical and immunologic mechanisms described above.
