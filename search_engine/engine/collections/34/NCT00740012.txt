      challenge. Nocturnal glucose profiles are an important tool to secure adequate glycemic
      control during the night. Often, patients are asked to perform self-monitoring with the help
      of an alarm clock. Such a recommendation depends on the accuracy of glucose concentrations
      determined this way. We hypothesized that alarm clocks may trigger a stressful arousal that
      might be accompanied by rises in glucose concentrations, consecutively leading to nocturnal
      glucose profiles that are not representative for undisturbed conditions.

      We want to prove this hypothesis with 30 patients over three nights.

      Night (a) with an alarm clock set at 2 h intervals (midnight, 2 a.m., 4a.m. and 6:45 a.m) for
      glucose self monitoring,

      Night (b) with a nurse performing blood glucose determinations at the 2 h intervals
      (midnight, 2 a.m., 4a.m. and 6:45 a.m), and

      Night (c) with the patients left undisturbed.

      All the patients are going to use a continuous glucose monitor and half of the patients
      (uneven numbers) are going to have an indwelling venous cannula during night (a) and (b.

      During night (a) and (b) 5-7 minutes after the scheduled times for glucose measurements the
      doctoral candidate is going to take the pulse, another capillary blood sample for a
      laboratory glucose determination (EBIOS, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Also the doctoral
      candidate is going to take a venous blood sample in half of the patients (uneven numbers),
      blood from the indwelling venous cannula for the determination of epinephrine,
      norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon, growth hormone, and prolactin (determined by specific
      immunoassays at Biocientia laboratories, Jena, Germany).
