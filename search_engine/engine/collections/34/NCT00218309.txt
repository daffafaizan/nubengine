      controlled by other reinforcers. Learning to understand, predict, and control this
      maladaptive choice behavior may lead to improved prevention and treatment strategies. HYD is
      a drug currently used as a cough suppressant and to relieve pain. The purpose of this study
      is to determine the extent to which opioid drug seeking behavior in heroin dependent
      individuals can be reduced by environmental factors, including supplemental opioid drug
      availability, drug price, and non-drug alternative reinforcers. Specifically, this study will
      determine whether pre-session opportunity to take "free" supplemental HYD influences HYD
      seeking by using a choice progressive ratio schedule as well as by varying the dose of HYD.

      Participants in this observational study will undergo multiple test sessions in which they
      will select between acquiring drug or money. Because participants may choose money on all 12
      trials of test sessions as a way to avoid receiving an injection, a placebo injection will be
      given when money is chosen. Prior to each test session, participants will receive a sample of
      the drug dose. During each test session, participants will have 12 opportunities to select
      either drug (administered as HYD) or money. Prior to each individual choice trial,
      participants will receive supplemental HYD. Participants will use a computer to earn choices.
      Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored
      throughout choice trials. Pupil diameter will be measured with a digital camera. Participants
      will complete self-report questionnaires at different times during the study. Participants
      will be maintained on buprenorphine throughout the study, with a fixed 3-week detoxification
      after study completion.
