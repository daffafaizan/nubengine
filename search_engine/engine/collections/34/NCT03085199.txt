      gastrectomy has been accepted by one of standard treatments for early gastric cancer in
      Korea, Japan and China.

      However, duodenal stump leakage remains one of the fetal complications after gastrectomy
      until now. The incidence of duodenal stump leakage is reportedly between 1.6% to 5% in
      Billroth II or Roux en Y reconstruction after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. According to a
      recent multicenter study, the laparoscopic approach increased the risk of duodenal stump
      leakage development comparing to open approach.

      Until now, no prospective clinical trial for duodenal stump leakage after laparoscopic or
      open gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients has been conducted. I already introduced a
      technique of laparoscopic reinforcement suture (LARS) on staple-line of duodenal stump using
      barbed suture for prevention of duodenal stump leakage. Therefore, a prospective phase II
      study was designed for safety of this technique.
