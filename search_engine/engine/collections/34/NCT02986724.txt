      Vedolizumab (Entyvio) is being used to treat people who have CD or UC. This study will look
      in the routine use of vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel disease therapy in participants with
      CD or UC who did not receive a biologic treatment before. The study will enroll approximately
      150 participants. All participants enrolled in this will belong to one observational group:
      Vedolizumab.

      Participants taking vedolizumab as per physician's prescription in routine clinical practice
      will be observed.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Austria. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 2 years. Participant taking vedolizumab in routine clinical practice will make
      multiple visits to the clinic at Baseline, Week 20 and 52. Once a participant is switched to
      subsequent biologic treatment upon failing treatment with vedolizumab, the switching date
      will be considered as new baseline followed by visits at Week 20 and 52.
