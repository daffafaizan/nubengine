      treatment includes application of cold water or other plant origin preparations. However non
      of these treatments was shown to be efficacious.

      Animal studies have demonstrated the pronounced protective effect of povidone-iodine ointment
      against thermal burns. Moreover, anecdotal, uncontrolled studies in humans have shown the
      efficacy of povidone-iodine ointment in human skin burns, provided the preparation was
      applied shortly after the exposure to the heat source. The proposed study will conduct a
      controlled study in which the effect of povidone-iodine ointment will be tested in large
      group of patients and will be compared with standard cold water treatment.
