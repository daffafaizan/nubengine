      the face or affected area to treatment and the contralateral side as control. Random
      allocation of the treatment side will be performed using randomization software. Participants
      will be treated twice a week for 12 weeks with low irradiation 650 nm +/- 5 nm red light and
      followed up 4 weeks after completion of treatment. A trained blinded evaluator will assess
      clinical outcomes on week 4, week 8, week 12 and at follow up at week 16, using validated
      scores.
