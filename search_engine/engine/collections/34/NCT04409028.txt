      University and conducted both at its Endodontics and Restorative Departments of Dentistry
      Faculty. A query of the Nucleus database (a patient management software) was performed to
      identify dental charts of patients who received endodontic treatment between December 2018
      and January 2020. We searched only for primary endodontic treatment of vital tooth codes, and
      then selected the same endodontic specialists' patients. A total of 400 teeth were identified
      for screening. Next, a specified restorative dentistry specialist's patient searched within
      these patients, and 150 patients were obtained. The study was completed with 68 participants
      (n=34 each). Then data and radiographs of patients were checked out for the eligibility
      criteria.
