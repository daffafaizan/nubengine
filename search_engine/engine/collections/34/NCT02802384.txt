      and are limited to genes that affect osteoclast differentiation and function. These mutations
      alone are insufficient to explain the full phenotype, particularly hypervascularity and
      increased bone formation. Through a series of basic science studies, the investigators have
      recently found that preosteoclasts secrete chemokines to promote migration of various stem
      cells, which then differentiate into osteoblasts and endothelial cells to support
      osteogenesis and angiogenesis, respectively.

      The investigators will perform a cross sectional study of patients with active Paget's
      disease of bone compared to similar people without Paget's disease of bone. The goal is to
      enroll 10 patients with Paget's disease of the bone (cases) and 10 healthy, age- and
      sex-matched people (controls) whom meet similar exclusion criteria. Participants who consent
      to the study will undergo a brief history and physical exam, allow review of medical records
      relevant to their disease, and have one blood (5 tablespoons) sample drawn.

      The investigators hypothesize that specific chemokine concentrations are increased in people
      with Paget's disease of the bone compared to controls. The investigators also hypothesize
      that these levels correlate with severity of disease. Therefore, the investigators primary
      objective is to determine if serum chemokine levels are increased in patients with Paget's
      disease of the bone. The secondary objective is to evaluate if the serum chemokine
      concentrations correlate with various markers of disease activity. Findings could aid in the
      clinical monitoring of patients with Paget's disease of the bone and could provide an
      additional therapeutic target to improve treatment of this painful disease.
