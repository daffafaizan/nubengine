      lesions is technically challenging with a forward-viewing endoscope. There are limited data
      in the relevant literature regarding the effectiveness of the Cap assisted forward viewing
      endoscope for accurate evaluation of the ampulla de Vater. Therefore, the aim of this study
      is to compare the visualization rates of the ampulla of Vater using forward-viewing
      endoscopes with or without cap attached to the distal end in the same patient.
