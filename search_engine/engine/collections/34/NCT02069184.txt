      most common adverse reactions related to systemic administration of opioids are sedation,
      itching, constipation and less commonly, respiratory depression. One of the other management
      strategies for the pain control is the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).
      Frequent use of NSAIDS is also associated with complications, such as gastric ulcer and
      platelet dysfunction. When compared to other non-NSAIDS, IV acetaminophen is a relatively
      safer drug with quicker onset of action. In an earlier conducted study, the onset of action
      of analgesia for a bolus dose of IV acetaminophen is 3 minutes. IV acetaminophen is FDA
      approved for management of mild to moderate pain. An adverse reaction associated with the
      prolonged usage of IV acetaminophen is hepatic injury. The most common adverse events
      encountered during previous clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, headache and insomnia.
