      (neurofeedback) training on EEG topography and symptomatology of patients suffering from
      anorexia nervosa (AN).

      There is evidence that alpha-neurofeedback leads to an increase in positive therapy outcome
      in clinical populations by changing long-lasting EEG frequency patterns. The use of an
      EEG-guided relaxation paradigm has been shown to be associated with well-being and
      improvements in pathology of psychiatric patients.

      In the present study the effects of alpha-training on EEG activity, mood, personality,
      well-being, blood parameters, and heart frequency will be evaluated in a sample of anorectic
      girls (12-18 years).

      The subjects are trained with at least 10 sessions alpha-neurofeedback, in order to enhance
      individual alpha frequency, with spectral resting EEG, EKG, blood samples, ERP-measures and
      psychometric measures assessed before and after training. Neurofeedback is conducted over a
      period of five weeks, with each participant receiving two training sessions per-week.
      Neurofeedback is administered using USBAmp-EEG system.

      For better surveillance of training effects there are two non-treatment control groups. A
      patient group receiving conventional therapy programme of the Psychosomatic Division of the
      Pediatric Department at the University Hospital Graz and a healthy control group.

      A twelve-week follow-up study is carried out in order to document long-term effects of
      alpha-neurofeedback training in AN patients.
