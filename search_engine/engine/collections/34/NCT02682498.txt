      last 15 years. Because of this, opioid tolerance in the general population has grown
      markedly, and opioid tolerant patients can be especially difficult to manage in the
      perioperative period. In general, they require much higher doses of opioids to obtain similar
      levels of pain-control compared to opioid-na√Øve patients and are susceptible to respiratory
      depression and other adverse events. This study seeks to determine whether a new
      sustained-release local anesthetic solution (Exparel - Liposomal Bupivacaine) injected into
      the soft tissues around the joint after surgery will decrease opioid consumption and adverse
      events in opioid-tolerant patients presenting for total knee arthroplasty.
