      functional activities especially during climbing stairs, walking uphill.

      The six minute level walk test has been a gold standard in the assessment of functional
      capacity in cardio respiratory conditions like, coronary heart diseases , valvular heart
      diseases, chronic respiratory illness.

      Moreover, six minute walk test has been framed to assess the functional capacity in level
      walking.so far, no test have been developed to assess the functional capacity of the patients
      during uphill walking and stair climbing.

      Though ramp walking ( uphill walking) can be trained using treadmill, it is not feasible for
      the indian patients as they are not familiar in the treadmill and their fear may also show
      variation in the functional assessment.

      Hence this study has been proposed..
