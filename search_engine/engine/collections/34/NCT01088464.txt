      maximum. The actual size will vary depending on the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed
      and the resultant sizes of the cohorts. Participants will receive IMC-11F8 administered
      intravenously, once every 2 weeks or on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 6 weeks (1 cycle). All
      infusions can be administered within Â± 1 day of the scheduled administration date. After 1
      cycle of treatment, participants who have an objective response or stable disease may
      continue to receive IMC-11F8 at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or other
      withdrawal criteria are met.

      A minimum of 3 participants will be enrolled in each cohort. Dose escalation in successive
      cohorts will occur once all participants complete 1 cycle of therapy.

      Participants will be enrolled sequentially into each cohort. A completed participant will be
      either a participant who completes the initial 6-week treatment period (Cycle 1) or a
      participant who discontinues therapy for an IMC-11F8-related toxicity during Cycle 1.
      Participants who do not complete the first 6 weeks of treatment for reasons other than an
      IMC-11F8-related toxicity will be replaced. Toxicity data for each cohort will be reviewed
      prior to dose escalation. Upon completion of all required safety evaluations during the
      initial 6 weeks, the next cohort of new participants will be treated at the next higher dose
      level using a dose escalation scheme.
