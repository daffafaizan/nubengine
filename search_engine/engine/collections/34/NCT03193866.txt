    
      This is a prospective non-intervention observational prospective cohort study assessing the
      long-term safety and efficacy of RTX treatment in MS compared with other common MS DMTs
      regarding both clinical and radiological parameters in a real-life population of patients
      with MS.

      A number of parameters will be assessed annually. These include baseline demographics,
      previous drug history and reasons for discontinuation, disability status (expanded disability
      status scale), relapses, safety and adverse events (AE), contrast enhancing T1 and newly
      appearing T2 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as a panel of patient reported
      outcome measures: Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT); MS impact scale-29 (MSIS-29) Fatigue
      Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), the MS check
      scale and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire 9 (TSQM-9).

      Retrospective data entered in medical charts and the Swedish MS registry will be included
      together with prospective annual structured follow up from inclusion into the study for a
      minimum of three years (three to nine years).

      In a substudy - Covid Enhancement study - analyses will be performed regarding the effect of
      COVID-19 on people with MS as compared to non-MS individuals and also if there is any
      indication that a particular DMD is associated with a risk to contract a more severe
      COVID-19. The analyses will primarily be performed in official health care databases.
