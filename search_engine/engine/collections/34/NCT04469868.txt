      prescriptions given by medical providers are a major contributor to the opioid abuse
      epidemic. Nearly 40% of opioid overdose-related deaths occur due to prescribed opioids. Among
      patients diagnosed with opiate dependence, 80% had received an opioid prescription prior to
      their abuse diagnosis and 51% had a family member who had an opioid prescription, Thus,
      opioids prescriptions, which are often in excess of the need by the patient, are a major
      contributor to this public health crisis.

      The investigators devised a prospective intervention study to eliminate or significantly
      reduced the use of opioids prescribed at hospital discharge after major urologic surgery.
