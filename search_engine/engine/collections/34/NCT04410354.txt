      adult patients with advanced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Approximately 80 patients
      will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral administration of MMPD + remdesivir or placebo +
      remdesivir. The first 40 patients will have a score of 3 or 4 on the National Institute of
      Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) 8-point ordinal scale and at least one of the
      following: fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, shortness of breath at
      rest or with exertion, confusion or symptoms of severe lower respiratory symptoms; the final
      40 patients will have a score of 3 on the NIAID scale.

      Study subjects will undergo screening evaluations prior to the first dose of study drug.
      Study drug treatment (MMPD or placebo) will continue for 10 days, unless the patient is
      discharged from the hospital before completing the 10-day randomized treatment period. Both
      treatment arms will also receive remdesivir per the Emergency Use Authorization labeling.
      Evaluations will be performed on Days 0-10 and every day thereafter until the subject no
      longer requires any form of respiratory support or they reach the last planned day of
      in-person study assessments and still require respiratory support. The final in-person study
      evaluations will be performed 4 weeks after completion of study drug (MMPD or placebo)
      treatment (Day 37). The final study evaluation will be a telephone call on Day 56.
