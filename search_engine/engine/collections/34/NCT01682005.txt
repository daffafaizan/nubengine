      {MarketScan Commercial (2000-2011[Q2])} and the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database
      {Marketscan Medicaid (2002-2010)} will be analyzed separately; no merging of the databases
      will occur.

      The claims data extracts are fully de-identified and compliant with the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (U.S.) (HIPAA).

      For children who received at least 1 RV vaccine dose within the Advisory Committee on
      Immunization Practices (ACIP)-specified vaccination window of 6 weeks to 8 months old, their
      observation time will be divided into three RV-vaccinated cohorts: any RV vaccination before
      8 months (i.e., during the vaccination window between 6 weeks and 8 months old); complete RV
      vaccination (i.e., after 8 months old); and incomplete RV vaccination (i.e., after 8 months
      old). For children who did not receive any RV vaccine dose within the vaccination window,
      their observation time will be divided into four control cohorts: historical (i.e., before RV
      vaccines were available) unvaccinated on/before 8 months old; contemporary (i.e., after RV
      vaccines were available) unvaccinated on/before 8 months old; historical unvaccinated after 8
      months old; and contemporary unvaccinated after 8 months old.
