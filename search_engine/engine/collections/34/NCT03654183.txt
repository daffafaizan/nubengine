      hemi-hepatectomy or lateral segmentectomy. ICG clearance measurements will be performed both
      preoperatively and intraoperatively under partial blood blocking of resecting segments. This
      study will use PHLF, C-D grade, MELD grade and postoperative hospital stay to evaluate and
      compare the potential of these measurements to predict postoperative liver function.
      Accordingly, we are supposed to demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative
      ICG clearance measurement in detecting postoperative liver failure. Furthermore, cut-off
      values would be defined to identify high, medium or low risk patients.
