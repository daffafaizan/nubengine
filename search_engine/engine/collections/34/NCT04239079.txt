      how and if this results in cell death is unknown. This study is being conducted to better
      understand the role of inflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Both AD and PD have long been known to feature prominent neuroinflammatory components.
      Preliminary studies have found autoimmune features in several patients including recognition
      of self-antigens by specific T cells. This study will test the hypothesis that AD and PD are
      associated with self-derived antigens (alpha-syn and tau protein) that become recognized by T
      cells during aging and disease. The overall aim is to identify antigenic responses associated
      with PD and AD. The specific aims include:

        1. Identify the protein(s) or protein segments that may trigger inflammation

        2. Identify the T cells (immune cells) that may recognize and kill brain cells (neurons and
           astrocytes)

        3. Identify the genetic profile associated with this immune response (genetic analysis of
           the immune system)
