        -  Determine the response rate of pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's
           lymphoma treated with gemcitabine and vinorelbine.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes and gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on days
      1 and 8. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 9 and
      continuing for at least 7 days and until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with responding disease after 2 courses may proceed directly to stem cell
      transplantation off study OR receive 2 additional courses. Patients with stable disease after
      2 courses receive at least 2 additional courses. Patients with continued stable or responding
      disease (with no disease progression) after 4 courses may continue to receive study treatment
      for up to 1 year or discontinue study for alternative therapy at the discretion of the
      treating physician.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-26 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
