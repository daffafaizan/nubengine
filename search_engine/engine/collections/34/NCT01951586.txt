    
      This is a global randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in patients with Stage IV
      untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with or without bone metastasis. Eligible
      participants are to receive 4 to 6 cycles of a standard of care platinum-doublet chemotherapy
      regimen. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive denosumab or matching
      placebo with the first investigational product dose coinciding with participant's first cycle
      of chemotherapy and continuing until the primary analysis, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal
      of consent, death, or lost to follow-up. Participants who discontinued the investigational
      product early (ie, before primary analysis) were followed for disease status and survival.
      The primary analysis took place when 149 events of death had been reported. All participants
      were followed for 2 years after the last dose of blinded investigational product.
