      basis for up to 20 weeks) with additional outcome measures to be completed at each session.
      Therapists will receive a research pack which will outline when, and what, measures to
      administer and complete. To ensure anonymity and confidentiality of data collected,
      participants will be given identification numbers before data is submitted to a spread sheet
      for analysis.

      9 CBASP therapists have been identified as suitable for participation in this study.
      Therapists will have the option to choose whether to take part in the research. Similarly,
      clients will be given the choice to take part in the research. To ensure at least one set of
      outcomes are achieved it is an aim of the study to provide the therapist with a minimum
      caseload of 2.
