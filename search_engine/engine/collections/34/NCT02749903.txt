      enzalutamide in patients with AR-positive salivary cancers. Given that this will be one of
      the first prospective studies ever conducted for AR-positive salivary cancers, and there are
      currently no standard therapies known to be effective for this disease, the investigators
      will adopt a best overall response (BOR) of 5% as the null hypothesis and BOR of 20 % as the
      alternative hypothesis. In addition to response, this study will also evaluate the
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), adverse events, and will also try to
      identify molecular predictors of response by examining genomic and transcriptional elements
      of androgen receptor biology.

      The primary and secondary objectives of the study:

      Primary objective

      To evaluate the rate of best overall response associated with enzalutamide in patients with
      AR-positive salivary cancers

      Secondary objectives

        1. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of AR-positive salivary cancer patients
           treated with enzalutamide

        2. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of AR-positive salivary cancer patients treated
           with enzalutamide

        3. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of enzalutamide for patients with AR-positive
           salivary cancer

      Patients are followed up to 3 years after study enrollment.
