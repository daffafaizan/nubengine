      randomly allocate to the group receiving the supervised PBCST and the home exercise group.
      While the supervised exercise group receives PBCST for 2 days and 8 weeks in the clinic, the
      home exercise group will perform the same exercises at home for the same time as the
      brochures prepared for them. The exercise program will show progression at 2-week intervals.
      A session will be held for both groups to teach the basic principles of pilates and will not
      be counted in the 8-week program. At the beginning and end of treatment, individuals will be
      evaluated for isokinetic muscle strength, balance and postural sway, fatigue level, quality
      of life and functional capacity parameters. PBCST is thought to reduce postural sways and
      increase lower extremity muscle strength by increasing core stability with the effect of
      kinetic chain and increased stabilization.
