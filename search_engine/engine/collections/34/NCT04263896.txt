      control arm. All subjects will be asked to complete a baseline demographic form and three
      questionnaires (PAC-SYM, PAC- QOL, Wexner Constipation score). Additional demographic
      information will be obtained from chart review. This information will include past medical
      history, use of constipating medications, use of daily pain medications, chronic pain
      history, use of daily fiber supplementation.

      Subjects in the intervention arm will be given 10-day supply of Miralax and instructed on its
      use. They will take this medication for the 10 days prior to surgery. Subjects in the control
      arm will continue with standard care prior to surgery.

      Post operatively, all subjects will complete a diary for 7 days. In this diary they will
      record details about their bowel movements (time of movement, discomfort, texture of stool).
      They will also report average daily pain levels ( with a visual analog scale), daily pain
      medication use (time, medication, total number of pills).

      At the end of the 7th day all subjects will complete the same PAC questionnaires as they did
      pre-operatively.
