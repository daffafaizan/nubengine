      88 to 96%. However, excision of large lesions in sensitive locations such as the face and
      scalp may result in disfigurement and impairment of function. Neoadjuvant drug treatment
      given before surgery aims to reduce tumour size so that surgery and recovery is easier. In
      this study, patients with BCC will be given neoadjuvant treatment with a drug called
      sonidegib. Sonidegib is a daily tablet usually given for BCC that cannot be removed by
      surgery or that has spread through the body. The study aims to see if sonidegib given for 12
      weeks will reduce the size of tumours so surgery results in less scarring or may be avoided,
      with only short term topical treatment required to treat remaining tumour. This approach may
      also reduce the risk of recurrence. To assess response to treatment, we will use a new
      technology for skin tumours called optical coherence technology (OCT). This is like an
      ultrasound scan and is non invasive. OCT can detect the extent and nature of the tumour and
      build a 3D image with great accuracy. OCT will be used together with pathological analysis of
      tumour tissue to determine response to sonidegib.
