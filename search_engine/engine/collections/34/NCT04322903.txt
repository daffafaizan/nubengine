      effectiveness of the Passport to Freedom (P2F) Program, an intervention for formerly homeless
      women currently housed through a supportive permanent housing program. P2F involves: three
      2-hr sessions to promote physical and emotional wellbeing through mindfulness techniques and
      health promotion activities; two home visits to provide individualized sessions with a nurse
      and a community health navigator; and a follow-up session 4 weeks after intervention to
      discuss the women's perception of the intervention. By the end of the program, women will
      have improved emotional self-regulation in response to everyday stress, positive perception
      of managing women's overall health, and increased confidence in maintaining stable housing.
