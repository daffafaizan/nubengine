      institution showed that 23/66 (34.7%) hemodialysis patients were aspirin resistant. In a
      recent systematic review, renal impairment was associated with aspirin resistance . This
      association was seen in only two out of the twenty studies used in this meta-analysis . Both
      these studies are from the same center with a predominant Asian population. In this study we
      will try to evaluate the prevalence of aspirin resistance in CKD patient without being
      limited to a specific ethnicity.
