      metabolism, physical and mental health and quality of life in polycystic ovary
      syndrome(PCOS).

      PCOS is characterized by menstrual deregulation, high testosterone, mail hair growth and
      increased stress hormones from the adrenals. Furthermore there are changes similar to those
      seen in diabetes.

      Cipralex is known to decrease stress hormones. But no investigations are on the effect of
      cipralex on PCOS, or how the increased stress hormones affect the PCOS condition.

      We will examine 2x20 women with PCOS. They will be randomized to Cipralex or placebo.
      Treatment duration is 12 weeks.
