      in ACR 1990 FMS diagnostic criteria set was evaluated. In 2010, ACR published new criteria,
      which may be an alternative method in clinical practice, without sensitive points, including
      the common pain index and symptom severity scale. It is evaluated with the common pain index
      and symptom severity scale. This new set of criteria alone is not affected by pain, it is
      based on patient reporting. Therefore, it seems clinically more significant in determining
      the origin of pain in autoimmune diseases. There was only one study in the literature in
      which SSc patients are evaluated with the 2010 FMS criteria set . Therefore, the aim of our
      study was to evaluate the frequency of FMS according to 2010 FMS criteria and to investigate
      its effect on quality of life in our study.
