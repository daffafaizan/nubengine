      alternative to carbohydrate consumption could avert hypoglycemia or treat it effectively in
      type 1 diabetes patients who choose to fast during Ramadan in observance of their faith. This
      treatment method could also avert any negative psychological emotions Muslim people with
      diabetes may experience by ingesting carbohydrates to control hypoglycemia, thereby breaking
      their fast. Furthermore, it could improve ability to self-manage fasting, which is an
      important action for their spiritual and overall wellbeing.

      There will be two phases included in this study:

        1. Pre-crossover Phase:

           Before starting the crossover trial, a pre-crossover phase will conduct to evaluate
           hypoglycemia eligibility, frequency and compliance.

        2. Crossover Trial Phase:

      The Crossover Trial Phase will include 20 participants and consist of two (2-weeks) periods.
      Participants who don't develop any hypoglycemic event or failed to complete both periods will
      be excluded.

      Participants will be randomized into two groups:

        1. Group A in periods one will use MDG and glucose tablets in period two according to the
           protocol.

        2. Group B in periods one will use glucose tablets and MDG in period two according to the
           protocol.

      The primary outcome will be the number of treated fasting induced hypoglycemic events.
