      are taken into account in daily care this could result in improved treatment satisfaction,
      compliance, asthma control and, ultimately, improved HRQL. The Pelican instrument we have
      developed has the essential features to be useful in daily care. In this study, the
      effectiveness of implementing the Pelican instrument in medical care is assessed. An
      intervention study with 9 months follow-up in primary and secondary care will be carried out.
