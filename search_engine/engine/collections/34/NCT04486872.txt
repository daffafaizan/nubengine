      leukemia, but 30% of patients still have antigen escape, which may be related to variants in
      tumor cells and the expansion of CD19-negative tumor cells after treatment with CD19 CAR-T
      cells. CD19/CD20 bispecific CAR-T cell targeting multiple antigens can attack tumor cells
      while overcoming tumor antigen escape caused by a single target, maximizing efficacy and
      duration of treatment, and can also solve the problem of uneven distribution or low
      expression of single target on the tumor surface.
