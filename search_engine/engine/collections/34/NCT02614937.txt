    
      At baseline, all eyes underwent ETDRS visual acuity measurements at 4 meters, a complete
      ophthalmological evaluation, SD-OCT imaging of the macula, and fluorescein angiographic
      assessment of capillary perfusion in the macula and peripheral fundus. All eyes received an
      initial 10 week mandatory loading period of topical squalamine therapy.

      All eyes received mandatory intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.5mg at the conclusions
      of weeks 2 and 6. At the conclusion of week 10, eyes were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      continue squalamine drops bid or discontinue squalamine drops in the study eye. All eyes were
      examined every 4 weeks through the week 38 endpoint and were eligible to receive additional
      as needed ranibizumab 0.5mg injections starting at the conclusion of week 10 and every 4
      weeks thereafter through week 34 depending upon prespecified visual acuity and OCT
      retreatment criteria.

      Any eye with a decrease of 5 or more ETDRS letters or increase in CST on OCT of 50uM or more
      from their best previous measurements automatically received an additional ranibizumab 0.5mg
      injection beginning at the conclusion of week 10.

      Eyes randomized to continue squalamine drops did so through the week 38 endpoint. SD-OCT
      measurements of the macula were obtained at every study visit. Fluorescein angiograms were
      performed on the study eye at baseline, weeks 10 and 38.

      Safety endpoints included all adverse events spontaneously reported, elicited or observed
      were documented by the investigators at any visit.
