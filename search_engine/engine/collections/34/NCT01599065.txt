      subjects will be randomized to either a control group (ICD "off-on" group) or to the
      experimental group (magnet group) within blocks of type of procedure and site.

      Subjects will be enrolled at the time of their procedure and will remain in the study until
      their post operative device interrogation. This could take place that same day ("off on"
      group or registry) or at their next ICD clinic visit or remote transmission (no more than 3
      months from the procedure).

      The study duration from first enrollment to closure is expected to last approximately 12
      months. There will be only two enrolling centers and the target sample size is 150 subjects
      from various manufacturers. No specific sample size was calculated as this is a pilot study.
