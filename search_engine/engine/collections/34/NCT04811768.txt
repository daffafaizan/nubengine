      evaluation. Both groups received bone grafting by a xenogeneic bone substitute (BSM,
      cerabone, botiss biomaterials GmbH, Zossen, Germany) using the lateral approach. In the bony
      wall group (BW), following piezosurgery the retrieved bony wall was repositioned. In the
      collagen membrane group (CM), the lateral window was created by rotary instruments, covered
      via a native collagen membrane (collprotect, botiss biomaterials GmbH, Zossen, Germany).
      After 6 months, biopsies were taken to analyze both approaches in terms of new bone
      formation. Duration of treatment, the number of perforations, postoperative patient
      discomfort were registered. Established histopathological analysis and histomorphometrical
      measurements to analyze the tissue reactions and the tissue distribution, i.e., the fractions
      of newly formed bone tissue (NB), of remaining bone substitute material (BSM) and connective
      tissue (CT), were conducted.
