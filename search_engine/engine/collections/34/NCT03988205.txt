    
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study of a non-drug intervention in subjects receiving
      CPX-351 as their usual medical care administered according to its FDA approval. The study
      intervention is the application of a prescribed outpatient care model, including a nurse
      teacher educational program and quality of life surveys for both subjects and caregivers, in
      subjects who meet medical and logistical criteria. Induction therapy and medical follow-up
      are performed without prophylactic admission to an inpatient facility.
