      (ERα) activity. This longstanding relationship has been recently challenged and instead of
      being merely an ERα-induced gene target, PR may be a critical determinant of ERα activity.
      The functional significance of this steroid receptor crosstalk is regulation of a gene
      expression program associated with low tumorigenicity; hence, better disease outcome. Genomic
      alterations in the PR genomic locus seem to be a relatively common mechanism for reduction of
      PR expression, which may consequently lead to altered ERα chromatin binding and target gene
      expression patterns that increase breast tumorigenicity and confers a poor clinical outcome.
      This ERα-PR crosstalk may be directly influenced by many variables, including the relative
      receptor levels and the hormonal milieu.

      ER-positive advanced breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases with considerable
      variability in outcome to a range of treatments. Prior response predicts the likelihood of
      subsequent benefit from another endocrine agent and this should be taken into account in the
      treatment decision process when assessing whether to prescribe a subsequent endocrine
      therapy. Despite the enormous progress made regarding the elucidation of breast cancer
      subgroups and their molecular drivers, most information comes from primary tumors. MA lacks
      cross-resistance and is active after acquired resistance to potent AI. This pilot trial
      evaluates in vivo MA modulation of steroidal receptors in advanced breast cancer.
