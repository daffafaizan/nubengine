      support for targeting the microbiota includes several studies demonstrating that antibiotics
      might be helpful for severe refractory colitis. Antibiotics may work by reducing pathobionts,
      by causing niche expansion of beneficial bacteria , and may harm if they do not reduce
      pathobionts or reduce beneficial commensals Recently, a triple antibiotic therapy with
      amoxicillin, metronidazole and tetracycline was developed for UC. However, a recent study on
      the effect of 11 different oral antibiotics on gut bacteria found that seven of them
      including metronidazole might cause lbacterial translocation . Anaerobes are critical for
      butyrate production. .

      Based on these recent studies, it would appear that tetracycline and amoxicillin are more
      likely to cause the beneficial effect, while metronidazole might actually be detrimental.
      Thus by removing metronidazole the investigators might actually have a better effect both for
      efficacy and safety.
