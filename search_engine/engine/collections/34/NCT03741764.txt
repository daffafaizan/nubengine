           option for treating finger deformity caused by Dupuytren's disease. The main goal is to
           evaluate the efficacy and performance of this flexible bioresorbable polymer film
           (VIVOSORB®) Expected outcome is significant correction of the finger extension lack with
           preserved active finger flexion, without amputation risk or neurovascular damage due to
           more invasive surgery.

        -  Primary endpoints The device will be considered efficient if the pre-operative lack of
           finger extension (TPED) compared to the extension at two years post-operative improves
           by 46°.

        -  Secondary endpoints

      Patient scores will be evaluated:

        -  Dash score

        -  EQ-5D-3L

        -  VAS pain & satisfaction Amputation is a final endpoint for this study. Secondary a
           comparison will be made between the population of this study and the population of a
           previous study in this center³ . In concrete terms this means that the improvement in
           finger extension will be compared between the VIVOSORB® group, the control³ and the
           cellulose group³.
