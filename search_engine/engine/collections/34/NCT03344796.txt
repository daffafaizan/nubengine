      "sticker." The key innovations of the system are automated personalized intervention
      messaging triggered by the exposure levels measured by a novel charge accumulation device
      applied to ultraminiaturized circuit forms. The research will validate the system's accuracy
      and acceptability to users, refine the device, and prove its robustness and efficacy in real
      world use cases. Focus groups and structured interviews will develop sun protection
      strategies to be communicated by text messages to participants. Successful completion of the
      research will yield a system to prevent excessive UV exposure and sunburn, thus reducing the
      incidence of skin cancer by equipping large numbers of general-population consumers and
      at-risk people to practice digitally-informed healthy sun behavior.
