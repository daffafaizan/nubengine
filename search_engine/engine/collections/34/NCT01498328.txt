      never been treated with bevacizumab. These patients will be randomly assigned to receive
      either rindopepimut/GM-CSF or KLH, each along with bevacizumab. Treatment assignment for
      Group 1 will be blinded. Group 2 and Group 2C patients are those who are refractory to
      bevacizumab (experienced recurrence or progression of glioblastoma while on bevacizumab or
      within 2 months of discontinuing bevacizumab). These patients will all receive
      rindopepimut/GM-CSF along with bevacizumab. Patients will be treated until disease
      progression or intolerance and all patients will be followed for survival. Patients may be
      treated with other therapies that are not part of the study after discontinuing treatment
      with the study vaccine.
