      saline will be abdominally delivered by Subjects via a reusable insulin pen device. All pen
      needles will be attached by Study Staff and pen needle outer cover and inner shield will be
      removed for subjects. Subjects are to perform 12 injections into the abdomen (6 pairs of
      injections). Pairs of injections will be evaluated and each pair will contain one BD Nano™
      PRO and one Terumo Nanopass® pen needle. The order of the two pen needles in each pair will
      be randomized.

      The intent of this comparative use study is to determine whether Japanese American patients'
      experiences are different when using the BD Nano™ PRO 4mm x 32G extra thin wall, 5-bevel pen
      needle vs the Terumo Nanopass® 4mm x 34G pen needle in the Japanese American population.
      These experiences include the perceived force to deliver dose, the ability to deliver the
      full dose (measured by leakage), injection pain and bending.
