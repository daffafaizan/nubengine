    
      This is a phase I/II study of ceritinib and trametinib in Stage IIIB or IV ALK rearranged
      NSCLC.

      The phase I portion is a standard 3+3 dose escalation study starting at dose level 1 and will
      be open to any patient with ALK-rearranged, or ROS-1 rearranged NSCLC.

      The phase II portion will consist of 3 single arm cohorts in ALK-rearranged NSCLC:

        -  Cohort A (ALKi Na√Øve): 20 evaluable patients

        -  Cohort B (Post-crizotinib PD): 21 evaluable patients

        -  Cohort C (PD second line ALK TKI (e.g., alectinib, ceritinib, PF-06463922 or - AP21163):
           10 evaluable patients.

      The aim will be to enroll up to 69 patients. Patients may continue treatment for up to 24
      months from the time of study entry, and will receive 12 months of follow-up following
      completion of the drugs.
