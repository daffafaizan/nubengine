      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of neoadjuvant boost intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy when combined with capecitabine before surgery in patients with locally
           advanced rectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathologic tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

      Patients undergo neoadjuvant IMRT with incorporated boost once daily 5 days a week for 5
      weeks. Beginning on the first day of radiotherapy, patients receive oral capecitabine twice
      daily 7 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients undergo surgical resection 4-8 weeks after
      completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients undergo escalating doses of boost IMRT until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at week 5 of chemoradiotherapy, before surgery, and
      then at 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-15 patients will be accrued for this study.
