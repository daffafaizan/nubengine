    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single arm efficacy and safety study in patients with
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, who have failed at least one prior system
      therapy.

      Approximately 140 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with fenretinide
      (4-HPR) intravenous emulsion administered as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5 days,
      once every 3 weeks until there is disease progression or unmanageable treatment-related
      toxicities.

      The primary study endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Responses will be categorized
      using criteria established by the International Harmonization Project on Lymphoma. Safety
      will be evaluated during the study and for 30 days after the last administration of study
      drug. Adverse events and laboratory studies will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.03.
