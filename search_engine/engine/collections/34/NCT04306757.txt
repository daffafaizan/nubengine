      surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. Previous preclinical trials have already shown
      improved oxygenation and CO2 removal within a significantly reduced respiratory minute volume
      as an expression of more efficient gas exchange with FCV compared to volume controlled
      ventilation (VCV). Preliminary data of our own animal study comparing individualized FCV by
      compliance guided pressure settings with state-of-the-art low tidal volume pressure
      controlled ventilation (PCV) confirmed previous findings with a significantly improved
      oxygenation by 20% while reducing respiratory minute volume. We therefore assume that FCV may
      be a more lung protective ventilation method.

      Open heart surgery requires bridging of the heart and lung function with a cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB) performed by a heart-lung machine. During this time the lung is most frequently
      not ventilated at all and lies collapsed in the chest for several hours. After weaning from
      CPB, the lungs must be recruited and ensure sufficient gas exchange of the blood. Not
      surprisingly, the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) at 20-30% is
      comparatively high after cardiac surgery and is the leading cause of perioperative mortality.
      Based on previous trials we expect improved oxygenation and thus arterial partial pressure of
      oxygen (pO2) is the main primary outcome parameter of this study. Furthermore, we expect
      improved recruitment of lung tissue due to controlled expiratory flow in FCV without the need
      of recruitment maneuvers, which may cause deleterious effects on lung tissue. Thus, lung
      tissue aeration assessed by Hounsfield units analyses of a postoperative computed tomography
      will be a secondary outcome parameter.
