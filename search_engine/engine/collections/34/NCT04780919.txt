    
      This study is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which we monitor
      the effects of low-energy focused extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in patients with
      Achilles tendinopathy (AT). Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. ESWT
      according to selected parameters will be applied to Group A. Group B will receive sham ESWT.

      Patients in both groups will have the same program. The research for one patient lasts a
      total of 8 weeks (2 months) from the initial to the final examination. In the initial
      session, there will be a clinical examination by a physiotherapist, which includes case
      history questions, measuring range of motion (active range of motion measured by goniometry,
      weight-bearing lunge test), functional loading tests (1-leg heel rise test, 1-leg hop test)
      and an ultrasonographic examination (tendon cross section area and width at the maximal
      tendon antero-posterior width place). In addition, the patient will complete a VISA-A
      questionnaire. At the end of the initial session, the patient will be randomly assigned to
      group A or B and receive the first application. For the next 4 weeks, additional applications
      will be performed once a week. The interval between individual applications should be at
      least 7 days. Thus, a total of 5 applications of ESWT or sham ESWT will be performed. The
      final examination will take place 3 weeks after the last application and will include the
      same procedures as for the initial examination.
