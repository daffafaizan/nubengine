      invasive cardiac catheterization represents the "gold standard" for assessment of the
      hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions. As we know, the major disadvantage of
      FFR is that it has to be measured invasively. CardioSimFFRct Analysis software is a
      non-invasive method to determine FFR which computes the hemodynamic significance of Coronary
      Artery Disease (FFRCT) from coronary computed tomography angiography（CCTA）data of the subject
      by using computational fluid dynamics.The FFR derived from FFR-CT will be compared with
      invasive FFR as gold standard.Moreover CardioSimFFRct also simplifies the coronary artery
      into a one-dimensional piping model, omits grid engineering, and greatly reduces the
      complexity of pretreatment.Based on the pressure loss along the pipe flow and the local
      pressure loss, a fast method for FFR calculation in engineering is proposed. The calculation
      time can be reduced to several minutes.

      FFRct from CardioSimFFRct Analysis software is mainly based on CCTA images to image the
      coronary arteries. Through three-dimensional reconstruction of the coronary arteries and
      computational fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology, the simulation of blood flow in the blood
      vessels is realized to extract the coronary blood flow reserve score (FFR).FFRct has the
      following characteristics such as the FFR value can be measured noninvasively, without
      additional damage to patients, avoiding the risks brought by invasive surgery, and the side
      effects brought by drugs during invasive surgery.FFRct can realize the examination quickly,
      save the time of doctors' coronary functional assessment, and simplify the process of
      coronary functional assessment.It also has the function of three-dimensional reconstruction
      of blood vessels, which makes it convenient for users to view the whole structure of coronary
      arteries and make artificial correction.The results of FFRct have high repeatability and are
      easy for users to evaluate.
