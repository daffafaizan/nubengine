    
      Aim 1 (N=180)will examine relationships between the levels of the inflammatory markers and
      current clinical state (depressed, manic or euthymic) with the hypothesis that Inflammatory
      markers will be higher in depression and mania relative to the euthymic state.

      Aim 2 (N=180)will examine relationships between inflammatory markers and BMI in bipolar
      patients with the hypothesis that inflammatory markers will correlate positively with BMI.

      Aim 3 (N=180)will examine the relationship between depression, obesity and inflammatory
      markers with the hypothesis that depressed (or manic) bipolar patients who are also obese
      will have higher inflammatory markers than either obese euthymic patients or non-obese
      depressed or manic patients.

      Aim 4. (N=50) The pilot study will be to conduct a proof of concept add-on treatment study of
      the antibiotic minocycline for bipolar patients who are depressed, likely to be obese and
      likely to have elevated inflammatory markers and increased risk of heart disease. This is a
      proposal to conduct a 2-site trial of 50 subjects to examine the value of minocycline
      augmentation in bipolar depressed patients who are incompletely responsive to initial
      treatment with anti depressants and/or mood stabilizers. The investigators will compare two
      subgroups of depressed patients, those who have high (N=25) versus those who have low (N=25)
      levels of C-reactive protein (CRP).
