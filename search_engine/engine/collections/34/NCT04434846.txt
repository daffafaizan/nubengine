      2015-16 Zika epidemic resulted in a high case number in Thailand, but not in neighboring
      Cambodia. It is known that nonhuman primates (NHPs) are important reservoirs of arboviruses,
      but the importance of their epidemiological role in the transmission of arboviruses is not
      clearly understood. While transmission dynamics are complex and require consideration of many
      variables, primate reservoirs are not routinely sampled, particularly in Southeast Asia,
      because of the level of operational complexity and skill required.

      Here, we propose a serological survey for evidence of Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV),
      and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) exposure in long-tailed macaques and human adults who live or
      work in close proximity to these monkeys in Thailand and Cambodia. We hypothesize that ZIKV
      seroprevalence in both humans and macaques will be higher in Thailand than Cambodia. With the
      current rise of arboviral diseases around the world, we hope the results of this study
      contribute to better understanding of the epidemiology and burden of arboviral diseases in
      this region.
