      system has faced challenges in delivering specialty services that are timely, geographically
      equitable, and coordinated in a patient centered manner. Recently, LACDHS improved
      infrastructure through implementation of eConsult, a web-based consultation and communication
      portal for Primary Care Providers (PCPs) and specialists, improving access for patients in
      greatest need of specialty care. The study investigators will conduct a pragmatic randomized
      trial with the goal of increasing the efficiency, quality, and timeliness of care for LACDHS
      patients by nudging specialists toward more effective use of eConsult. If successful, these
      nudges may reduce the number and increase the value of face-to-face consults.
