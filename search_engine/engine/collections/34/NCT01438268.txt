      Ontario, and the only hospital in Ontario with a primary focus on women's health. Patients
      undergoing breast reconstruction following breast cancer at our institution are now
      undergoing expedited discharge at 18 hrs postoperatively. To facilitate next day discharge, a
      multidisciplinary group was formed to determine the best evidence for perioperative care to
      ensure patient safety and excellent postoperative recovery. Minimizing length of stay has
      obvious cost savings for hospitals, but for patients the advantages include minimizing
      exposure to hospital-acquired infections and an earlier return to their more familiar home
      environment. The need to balance the advantage of early discharge to patient complications,
      however, must be addressed. As other hospitals across the country face the same length of
      stay constraints as has been our experience, this study will provide important data on the
      quality of recovery of patients undergoing early discharge following breast reconstructive
      surgery.
