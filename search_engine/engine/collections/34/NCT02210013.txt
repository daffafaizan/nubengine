    
      A total of 200 Caucasian patients and 200 Indian patients who will attend the first or second
      IVF cycle will be included.

      The date we will collect in both groups include the age, the body mass index, and the ovarian
      reserve markers like the antral follicle count (AFC), the follicle stimulation hormone (FSH)
      and antimullerian hormone (AMH) serum levels.

      The investigators will also determine the number of oocytes retrieved and the metaphase two
      oocytes in both groups after IVF stimulation.
