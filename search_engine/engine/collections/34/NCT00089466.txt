    
      AMD11070 is an oral HIV-1 entry inhibitor that targets the CXCR4 receptor on T cells.
      AMD11070 has been shown safe and well-tolerated in Phase I clinical trials in HIV uninfected
      people. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of eight
      dose levels of AMD11070 in HIV infected adults with X4-tropic virus. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      AMD11070 will also be studied.

      This study will last 90 days. All participants will receive medication for 10 days. There are
      eight cohorts in this study, with a maximum of six participants per cohort. Cohort A will
      receive 200 mg AMD11070 every 12 hours; Cohort B will receive 400 mg AMD11070 every 12 hours;
      Cohort C will receive 600 mg AMD11070 every 12 hours; Cohort D will receive 800 mg AMD11070
      every 12 hours; Cohort E will receive 1000 mg AMD11070 daily; Cohort F will receive 1500 mg
      AMD11070 daily; Cohort G will receive 1000 mg AMD11070 every 12 hours; and Cohort H will
      receive 2000 mg AMD11070 daily. Cohorts B, C, D, and E will open sequentially, provided no
      more than one of six participants in the preceding cohort experiences dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT) based on safety evaluations through Day 17. Cohort G will open to enrollment when
      Cohort E is filled; Cohort H will open to enrollment when Cohort F is filled. Cohort F will
      open to enrollment provided no more than one of six participants of Cohorts E and G
      experiences DLT. All study participants will be offered to receive open-label AMD11070
      through a separate long-term safety study.

      Participants will either be admitted to the general clinical research center (GCRC) for the
      dosing period or have dosing, PK testing, and other study monitoring done on an outpatient
      basis, depending on the study site. Participants admitted to the GCRC for the dosing period
      will be allowed daytime passes from the GCRC on Days 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. During the study,
      participants will have continuous heart monitoring, serial electrocardiograms (EKGs), and
      vital sign checks. Fasting blood collection will occur on Days 5 and 10. Trough PK testing
      will occur at entry and on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 11. Intensive 24-hour PK testing and
      24-hour urine collection will occur on Days 10 and 11. After treatment, targeted physicals
      and urine collection will occur on Days 17, 30, and 90, and additional blood collection will
      occur on Days 17, 21, 30, and 90. Participants will undergo an EKG on Days 17 and 90.
      Participants will also undergo an opthalmologic evaluation and questionnaire sometime after
      receiving AMD11070.
