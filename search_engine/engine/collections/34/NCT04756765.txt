    
      Primary Objectives: To evaluate whether talazoparib monotherapy can induce a 30% rate of
      objective response in subjects with advanced breast cancer associated with a PALB2 mutation.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        1. To evaluate the safety of talazoparib in subjects with advanced PALB2 mutation
           associated breast cancer

        2. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of talazoparib monotherapy in subjects
           with advanced PALB2 mutation associated breast cancer

        3. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of talazoparib monotherapy in subjects with
           advanced PALB2 mutation associated breast cancer

        4. To evaluate the ability of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to identify and characterize
           the nature of PALB2 mutations at baseline and upon progression in subjects with advanced
           PALB2 mutation associated breast cancer treated with talazoparib monotherapy

        5. To evaluate patient reported quality of life on talazoparib monotherapy
