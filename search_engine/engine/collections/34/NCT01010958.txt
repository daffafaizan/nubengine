      that approximately 50% of patients receiving optimum treatment will recur in three years and
      die of recurrence within five years, smarter adjuvant options are needed. One such treatment
      option would be to "differentiate" the high grade sarcoma into a low grade sarcoma upon
      recurrence. This differentiation effect will reduce the risk of subsequent death by 50% as
      determined by the overall survival difference between high grade/poorly differentiated and
      low grade/ well differentiated sarcomas. Given that differentiation takes place on a time
      scale that is significantly longer than cytotoxic effects, the optimum time to initiate
      differentiation therapy is in the adjuvant setting; when the time to disease recurrence is
      measured in months to years.

      The histone deacetylase inhibitor, Valproate, has been shown to promote differentiation in
      myeloid malignancies when administered in standard dosing regiments. We have recently shown
      that sarcomas are conceptually similar to hematopoietic malignancies, in that both represent
      diseases of aberrant development in which developing cells along their respective lineages
      arrest and transform at various points of differentiation. We have recently shown in vitro
      that, as for acute promyelocytic leukemia, sarcomas can be reprogrammed to reenter normal
      differentiation via epigenetic modulation using histone deacetylase inhibitors. It is
      therefore appealing to study Valproate based differentiation therapy in the adjuvant setting
      for sarcomas.
