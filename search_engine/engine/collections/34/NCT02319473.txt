      enroll ACS patients who admitted to the emergency department (ED) of all health centers in
      Jakarta and the surrounding area. The registry has been collecting data since 2007, and used
      extensively since 2014.

      Currently, the JAC registry is the main source of data for measuring the performance of the
      STEMI network in the region, namely Jakarta Cardiovascular Care Unit Network System. The
      STEMI network in Jakarta has been introduced as an integral part of the government project
      since 2010/2011.

      STEMI was diagnosed based on the typical chest pain and ST segment elevation on two or more
      contiguos leads. The number of primary PCI, fibrinolytic therapy and non-reperfused patients
      were recorded.
