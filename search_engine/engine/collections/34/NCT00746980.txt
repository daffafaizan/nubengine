    
      This is a Phase II trial (single-center, open-label, prospective study) where subjects with
      severe forms of alopecia areata, namely alopecia totalis, universalis, and severe ophiasis,
      will be treated with efalizumab (Raptiva), a humanized monoclonal anti-CD11a antibody that
      reversibly inhibits T cell activation and migration, weekly for 48 weeks. We will assess for
      effect on hair and body re-growth as well as record any serious adverse events such as
      serious infections, thrombocytopenia, development of malignancy, and severe arthralgias to
      monitor for safety outcome data. Subjects will have regular physical examinations and
      laboratory studies throughout the study, as well as telephone interviews.
