      1:1. The treatment will consist of WBRT given in a dose of 30 Gy in ten fractions.
      Lucanthone/placebo will be given as an adjunct to the WBRT on days that WBRT is administered.
      Tumor assessments will be done with a brain MRI. Radiological assessments on the tumor will
      be made periodically throughout the study and will be discontinued at the time of tumor
      progression. Safety will be evaluated for one year during the study period and survival data
      will be collected thereafter.
