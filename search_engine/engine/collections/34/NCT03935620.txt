           parents of children with DS to use EMT language support strategies. The investigators
           hypothesize that parents will learn to use EMT language support strategies from the
           personalized instruction provided during 36 intervention sessions.

        2. Aim 2: To examine the effect of delivering EMT using a telemedicine service delivery
           model to improve the spoken language and social communication skills of children with
           DS. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in child communication and language
           skills will result from increasing parents' use of EMT language support strategies
           during everyday parent-child interactions such as play with toys, singing songs, book
           reading, and mealtimes.
