      systemic therapies for recurrent disease (without cetuximab or othr EGFR inhibitor). One
      prior curative regimen (induction, primary or postoperative chemoradiotherapy) should have
      been given AND all patients should have been exposed to cetuximab as part of prior
      potentially curative treatment.Those who have received a prior Src kinase inhibitor or EGFR
      inhibitor other than cetuximab are not eligible.

      Patients will be tested for serum IL-6. If IL-6 is detectable, the patient will be
      ineligible. If IL-6 is not detected, the patient will be eligible for the study. Subjects
      more than 2 weeks post last dose of Cetuximab will receive an initial loading dose 400 mg/m2
      on cycle 1, day 1. Subjects who have received Cetuximab within 2 weeks of starting study will
      start Cycle 1 with dose of 250 mg/m2. Dasatinib will start 3 days after initial cetuximab
      study dose on cycle 1 (i.e cycle 1, day 4), and continue without interruption.
