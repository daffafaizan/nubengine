      emollients with or without keratolytics agents) and commonly focused on reducing scaling
      and/or skin lubrication with both systemic and topical treatments. A first-line therapy
      includes hydration and lubrication accomplished by creams and ointments containing low
      concentrations of salt, urea, or glycerol, which increase the water-binding capacity of the
      horny layer. Addition of keratolytics agents are used to decrease corneocyte cohesiveness, to
      promote desquamation, and to dissolve keratins and lipids (e.g., Î±-hydroxy acids, salicylic
      acid, high dose urea, propylene glycol, N-acetylcysteine, and retinoids). Systemic retinoid
      treatment is reserved for those patients refractory to topical agents because of long-term
      adverse effects and teratogenicity.

      This is a two part, Phase 2, multicenter, proof-of-concept (POC) study of the safety and
      tolerability of PAT-001 for the treatment of Congenital ichthyosis (CI) in patients ages 12
      years of age and older. Part 1 will be a double-blind, randomized, vehicle controlled,
      bilateral comparison of two treatments (PAT-001 [0.1% or 0.2%] vs. vehicle) for eight (8)
      weeks.

      Part 2 will be a double-blind, active only treatment comparison of the two PAT-001
      concentrations (0.1% or 0.2%) for an additional four (4) weeks. Subjects will have the option
      to participate in the pharmacokinetics (PK) portion of the study.
