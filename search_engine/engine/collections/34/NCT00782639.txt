      iopamidol-370 and iodixanol-320 in patients at high risk for CIN, i.e., patients with:

        -  Stage 3 or 4 CKD (SCr level of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL for men and ≥1.3 mg/dL for women or eGFR
           between 15 and 50 mL/min, and

        -  Diabetes mellitus who would undergo clinically indicated cardiac angiography procedures.
           Approximately 10 investigative centers were to participate in this study. This study was
           to enroll approximately 220 patients to ensure that 200 evaluable patients were able to
           complete the study according to this protocol.

      Patients were to be randomized to receive either iopamidol-370 or iodixanol-320. Each patient
      was to be evaluated for the occurrence of CIN within 48 to 72 hours postdose.
