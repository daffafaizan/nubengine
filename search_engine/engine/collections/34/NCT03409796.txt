      immune response to gluten in participants with CeD. The study will enroll approximately 20
      participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) in a
      1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Group A: Gluten 3 gm

        -  Group B: Gluten 10 gm

      All participants will be asked to take an oral dose of gluten at the same time on Days 1 to
      14 throughout the study. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The
      overall time to participate in this study is 10 weeks. Participants will visit to the clinic
      on Day -45 and will be contacted for follow-up assessment on Days 15 to 42.
