      a variety of gastrointestinal parasites. This protocol primarily allows evaluation and
      treatment of patients with any intestinal parasite that requires a medical evaluation. The
      treatment and evaluation consists of standard of care. Research aspects include the
      collection and study of different parasite populations, analysis of the immune responses of
      the host, a correlation between parasite burden in the host and disease. These patients also
      serve as a source of reagents such as feces, white blood cells, and serum. The off-label use
      of FDA approved drugs is employed to treat symptomatic giardiasis in patients who cannot be
      cured otherwise and to determine empirically which regimens are effective and safe.
