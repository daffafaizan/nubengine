      been exposed develops the ability to infect man and spread from person to person. Some
      pandemics can have very severe health impacts and be widespread. This study will evaluate
      PowderMed's Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED) DNA vaccine for pandemic influenza as
      a potential alternative to other vaccine technologies. This study represents the first study
      with this vaccine and will provisionally assess its safety and immunogenicity (ability to
      generate an immune response) at four different dose combinations. The vaccine will be given
      as a prime-boost regimen with vaccination on Days 0 and 28
