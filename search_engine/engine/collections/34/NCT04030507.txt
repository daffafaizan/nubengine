      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention, in this case magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) of the brain, to learn whether it is helpful in managing a specific disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are utilizing screening MRIs of the brain to
      evaluate breast cancer patients for metastases to the brain. The investigators hope to
      understand whether screening MRIs of the brain can be implemented into the standard of care
      to earlier detect brain metastases in a population where screening MRIs of the brain are not
      currently recommended or systematically performed.

      This trial will contain 4 cohorts:

      1. Those with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will undergo screening MRI of the brain as
      part of a single arm, non-comparative study

      2+3. Those with hormone receptor positive/(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
      negative (HR+/HER2-) and HER2 positive (HER2+) subtypes will be randomized to receipt of
      screening MRI of the brain or no screening MRI of the brain to definitively test the value of
      MRI screening.

      4. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer being treated with curative intent will undergo
      screening MRI of the brain as part of a single arm, non-comparative study.
