      Title EVALUATION OF THE SAFETY OF NEUROSTIMULATION IN PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC HEART FAILURE
      FEASIBILTIY STUDY

      Description A feasibility trial of the use of neurostimulation in chronic advanced refractory
      heart failure.

      Objective To determine the safety of neurostimulation in patients with chronic advanced
      refractory heart failure and to generate initial observations with regards to its potential
      effect on ventricular function and quality of life.

      Design The trial will be a randomized double blind crossover feasibility trial with 2 week
      and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 month clinical follow-up.

      After device implantation, patients enrolled in the trial will have been randomly assigned to
      have device programmed to deliver impulses, active, or to have the device programmed not to
      deliver impulses, inactive, for 3 months.

      After the 3 month initial phase, the devices will be inactivated and a 4 week washout period
      will convene.

      At the end of washout period, patients that were inactive during initial phase will crossover
      to active and similarly patients that were active during initial phase will crossover to
      inactive.

      Patient Population Patients with non-ischemic or ischemic cardiomyopathy with a length of
      illness of at least 6 months who have met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Enrollment Enrollment of a total of 10 intent-to-treat patients Investigational Sites Up to 2
      investigational sites in the US Data Collection Data collection will be obtained in three
      categories: markers of cardiovascular safety, markers of device-device interactions and
      markers of efficacy.
