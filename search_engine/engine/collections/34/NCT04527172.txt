      to be approximately 30%.

      The term peripheral neuropathies include symmetric polyneuropathy, single and multiple
      mononeuropathy, and radiculopathy.

      There has been increasing interest in using ultrasonography (US) to aid peripheral neuropathy
      diagnosis and studies have shown good correlation with other imaging modalities. US is a
      non-invasive and inexpensive imaging device that has become widely available as a diagnostic
      tool at many fields.

      so systemic lupus patients were enrolled in the study , performed nerve conduction study and
      neuromuscular ultrasound for bil. median, ulnar, peroneal, tibial and sural nerves , on
      statistics the cross sections were compared in neurophusiologically affected and non affected
      nerves, also the sensitivity and specifity of NMUS in comparison to the traditional NCS was
      calculated
