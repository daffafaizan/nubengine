      the: Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial
      fibrillation (NVAF) with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure,
      hypertension, age â‰¥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack
      (TIA). Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of
      recurrent DVT and PE in adults.

      In order to understand the risks and benefits of edoxaban use in a real-world clinical
      setting in the NVAF indication, Daiichi-Sankyo proposed this non-interventional study (NIS)
      to gain insight into the safety of edoxaban use in non-preselected patients with NVAF.

      Real world evidence from routine clinical practice using edoxaban up to 2 years will be
      collected and evaluated in approximately 200 patients, treated by specialized as well as
      non-specialized physicians in hospital centers.
