      as measured by total plaque volume (TPV) assessed by 3-dimensional (3D) carotid ultrasound in
      patients with metabolic syndrome? We hypothesize that L-C will regress atherosclerotic plaque
      formation.

      To assess our primary outcome of L-C induced atherosclerosis regression, we anticipate a
      significant percent (%) difference in carotid total plaque volume (TPV) over six months of
      L-C treatment, compared to placebo. For our secondary outcome, we expect to show that L-C
      therapy compared to placebo, induces a reduction in the proportion of small-sized LDL and an
      increase in large LDL particles. As small dense LDL particles are more atherogenic than large
      buoyant ones, this would suggest a mechanism contributing to the atherosclerosis reduction
      induced by L-C therapy.
