      neurosensory retina. The pathophysiology of CSC is not certain and various theories are
      proposed including impaired function of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), choroidal ischemia
      and choroidal hyperpermeability leading to RPE damage. Acute CSC with monofocal or paucifocal
      changes of RPE usually shows spontaneous resolution and has a favorable visual outcome.
      Chronic CSC is characterized by multifocal or diffuse decompensation of RPE associated with
      persistent detachment of neurosensory retina. This might lead to cystoid macular
      degeneration, foveal atrophy and damage to the foveal photoreceptor layer, consequently
      resulting in irreversible significant visual loss. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was proposed
      for the treatment of chronic CSC. Modified parameters of PDT such as shortening of the time
      of laser emission and reduction of a total light energy have been suggested to reduce the
      irreversible damages induced by conventional PDT. Recently, intravitreal injection of
      antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) was proposed as a new treatment option
      based on the effect of anti-permeability. Several reports demonstrated acceptable outcomes
      after intravitreal bevacizumab injection, one of anti-VEGF agent. But the clinical results
      with ranibizumab are not reported yet. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy
      and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab injection versus low-fluence PDT in the treatment of
      chronic CSC.
