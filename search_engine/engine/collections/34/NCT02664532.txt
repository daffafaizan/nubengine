      into two groups. After induction of anaesthesia laryngoscopy was performed with respective
      blades and trachea intubated. Parameters monitored were: glottis view obtained during
      laryngoscopy (Cormack Lehane grade), ease of intubation, intubation attempts, total duration
      of laryngoscopy in seconds and encountered complications.
