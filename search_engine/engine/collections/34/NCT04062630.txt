    
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled, postmarket clinical study to determine the
      differences between subjects undergoing standard MLF surgery with S2AI fixation in the pelvis
      vs the additional placement of iFuse 3-D in the bedrock configuration during MLF surgery.
      Subjects will be monitored for sacroiliac (SI) joint pain and at two years post surgery a CT
      scan will be taken to assess S2AI screw loosening or any other findings.
