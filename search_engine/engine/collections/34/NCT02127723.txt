      buttocks reshaping and contouring. Although treatment with Macrolane VRF is well documented
      in breast enhancement, there is limited documentation on the use in buttocks reshaping. Based
      on these clinical impressions, this study aims at acquiring information on the efficacy and
      safety of Macrolane VRF30 in this particular indication. As a result of the reshaping of the
      buttocks, it is expected that improvement of skin laxity will result in contouring and
      reduction of cellulite. By using standardised evaluation tools, the results of buttock
      reshaping reported anecdotally can be confirmed by accurate measurements.
