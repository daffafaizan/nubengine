    
      STK-001 is an investigational new medicine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. STK-001 is
      an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is intended to increase the level of productive SCN1A
      messenger RNA (mRNA) and consequently increase the expression of the sodium channel Nav1.1
      protein. This RNA-based approach is not gene therapy, but rather RNA modulation, as it does
      not manipulate nor insert genetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      STK-001 is designed to upregulate Nav1.1 protein expression from the nonmutant (wild-type)
      copy of the SCN1A gene to restore physiological Nav1.1 levels. Nav1.1 levels are reduced in
      people with Dravet syndrome. Stoke has generated preclinical data demonstrating
      proof-of-mechanism for STK-001.
