      urinary tract. Intracorporeal lithotripsy is an integral part of PNL. Commercially available
      intracorporeal lithotripsy modalities include ultrasonic, pneumatic, and combined ultrasonic
      and pneumatic models. Each modality has its inherent advantages and disadvantages. Ultrasonic
      lithotrites are capable of fragmenting stones while concomitantly suctioning out fragments.
      Unfortunately some stones are hard enough to resist fragmentation from ultrasonic
      lithotripsy. Pneumatic lithotrites are able to fragment all stones regardless of hardness,
      but this modality is unable to suction out stone pieces at the same time fragmentation is
      occurring. The newest lithotrite which combines both ultrasonic and pneumatic components is
      capable of fragmenting any stone, but also has some inherent limitations. The handpiece of
      the lithotripsy device is somewhat cumbersome, the suction component can clog, and the device
      has overheated at the maximal settings (Kuo et al). Current intracorporeal lithotrites, while
      functional, can certainly be improved.

      Recently, a novel dual probe design has been introduced by Cybersonics of Erie, PA. This dual
      probe intracorporeal lithotrite is called the Cyberwand and is composed of a fixed inner
      probe vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency with an outer probe vibrating at about 1,000 Hz.
      As this new design has the potential to revolutionalize intracorporeal lithotripsy, we intend
      to compare this novel technology to currently available lithotripsy technology in a
      randomized clinical trial.
