      treatment. In Korea, atrial fibrillation is a common disease predicted to affect more than 5%
      of the population over 65 years of age and more than 10% over 80 years.

      Totally thoracoscopic ablation has been adopted and performed successfully on February 2012
      at Samsung Medical Center for the first time in Korea. More than 120 operations have been
      performed up to date.

      In Korea, treatment for atrial fibrillation is still dependent on percutaneous RFCA, and
      life-long medication and anticoagulation is needed when recurrent atrial fibrillation occurs.
      The investigators expected thoracoscopic ablation to be an alternative to overcome this
      limitation. Also, thoracoscopic ablation and RFCA are recently being performed simultaneously
      or stage by stage as a hybrid procedure, and the results are being reported.

      In this study, the investigators therefore comparatively analyzed the mid-term results (at 1
      year) including electrocardiogram and 24 hour Holter monitoring of thoracoscopic ablation and
      RFCA performed individually or as a hybrid procedure in patients with long-lasting persistent
      atrial fibrillation. Antiarrhythmic medication, discontinuation of anticoagulation
      medication, and echocardiographic findings were also analyzed.
