    
      This assessment will be done using the following elements:

        -  The score of the Quebec sleep questionnaire (QSQ), developed in 2004 by Lacasse Y. et
           al. This questionnaire is specific to sleep apnea and may be self-administered. The main
           interest of this questionnaire is to measure the change in quality of life over time.

        -  The Epworth Scale Score, developed in 1991 by Murray W. John. This is a
           self-administered questionnaire developed to measure daytime sleepiness.

        -  Gender, age group, BMI

        -  The radiological assessment

        -  The results of polysomnography

      Patients will be followed for a period of 1 year and one month after surgery. The protocol
      visits correspond to the rhythm of post-surgery follow-up consultations in current practice.

      These patients are followed by Dr. PÃ©telle at Saint-Antoine Hospital. During these visits,
      they will complete the Quebec sleep questionnaire and the Epworth scale, at baseline, at 3
      months and then at 1 year.
