      acamprosate or placebo. We hypothesize that symptoms and cognition will improve following two
      weeks of acamprosate. We will also use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to
      examine the effect of acamprosate on glutamate & glutamine (Glu&Gln) brain levels in people
      with schizophrenia. We hypothesize that Glu&Gln concentrations in people with chronic
      schizophrenia will increase following two weeks of treatment with acamprosate.

      The proposed study will consist of 50 individuals with chronic schizophrenia/schizoaffective
      disorder, 18-55 years old, from in/outpatient programs at the Maryland Psychiatric Research
      Center (MPRC). The dose of acamprosate will follow manufacturer recommendations with two
      333mg tablets given three times per day. MRS will be acquired from areas involved in
      schizophrenia [dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] at
      baseline and week two. Symptom ratings and cognitive testing will occur at baseline and be
      repeated at week two.
