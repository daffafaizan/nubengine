      carriers with breast cancer is not well described

        -  The efficacy and safety of olaparib included in a standard of care regimen like
           paclitaxel weekly followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (Pw-->EC) is unknown

        -  Carboplatin increased the pCR rate in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
           in two randomized phase II neoadjuvant studies when added to an anthracycline,
           cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel (GeparSixto, CALBG 40603). pCR rates were even higher in
           patients with germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutations (ypT0/is ypN0 65%) and with HRD score high
           (ypT0/is ypN0 63%).

        -  The TNT study showed a doubling in response rate for patients receiving carboplatin vs
           docetaxel in patients with germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutations.

        -  There is a high correlation between tumor and germline BRCA 1/2 mutations.

        -  Data from Geparsixto study showed that triple negative breast patients have an HR
           deficiency in about 70% (67% have a high HRD and 30% have a tBRCA mutation)

        -  About 5% of tBRCA patients have a low HRD score

        -  gBRCA2 patients are older when diagnosed and are more likely to have an HRpos tumor.

        -  The GeparOLA study aims to support the decision for a phase III study exploring the
           addition of olaparib to a Pw-->EC schedule by providing an estimate on the pCR rate in
           the targeted population but also by providing estimate comparison to paclitaxel and
           carboplatin followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (PCb-->EC) as carboplatin is
           more and more considered a standard option of care in HR deficient patients (tBRCA 1/2
           mutations and/or HRD score high).
