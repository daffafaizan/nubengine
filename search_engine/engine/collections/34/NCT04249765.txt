    
      Objective: To investigate correlation between grip force, pinch strength and hand reaction in
      a group of post-millennial in Central Anatolia, and also to provide a comparison to
      previously available results on millennial.

      Methods: Experimental data were collected by healthy subjects, who are university students.
      The sample comprises females and males, consented to participate in the study. The ages of
      the subjects will range from 18 to 25 years. Grip strength will measure with hand dynamometer
      and pinch strength will measure with pinch meter. Hand reaction will test with the Ruler Drop
      Test.

      For each subject, body mass, height and hand preference will be record. The study will be
      completed in accordance with the norms of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
      ethics committee of the University of Atilim (Turkey).

      The collected data will be undergone statistical analysis to extract any feasible
      conclusions. First, the correlation coefficients will be found to determine whether there is
      a noticable relationship between the independent variables grip strength and pinch strength
      versus the dependent variable ruler drop test. The calculated sample correlation coefficients
      have been tested for the significance.
