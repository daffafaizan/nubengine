      depression, and coping strategy in association with short-term quality of recovery from
      surgery in 100 patients scheduled for early gastric cancer surgery (laparoscopic
      gastrectomy).

      The following items are investigated before surgery; Age, sex, BMI, level of education,
      occupation, marital status, ECOG performance status, ASA physical status, Apfel score,
      history of mental disorder, type of surgery, past surgical history, the number of days from
      diagnosis of cancer to surgery, clinical stage of cancer, histological type of cancer,
      presence of chronic pain, Quality of Recovery-15 (QOR-15), Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale (HADS), Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS), Coping and
      Adaptation Scale-Short Form (CAPS-SF).

      The QOR-15 is investigated for 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. The severity of
      postoperative pain by the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is concurrently measured at
      24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. In addition, the researchers measure postoperative
      complications, particularly nausea/vomiting, at 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery and length
      of stay by counting the number of days from the day of surgery to discharge.
