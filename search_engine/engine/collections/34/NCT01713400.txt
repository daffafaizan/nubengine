      ustekinumab when given in concert with our established regimen of SIR/TAC. Patients will be
      randomly assigned between the standard regimen of tacrolimus/sirolimus (TAC/SIR + placebo)
      vs. the investigational regimen of tacrolimus/sirolimus/ustekinumab (TAC/SIR/U) in a 1:1
      scheme.
