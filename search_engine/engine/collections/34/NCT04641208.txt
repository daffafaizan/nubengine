      To investigate the electrical muscle activity during used mobile phone

      -Back ground :

      Using a smart phone while adopting a poor posture can cause various physical problems. The
      neck and shoulders are particularly vulnerable to pain due to smart phone use, with the
      muscles showing a high level of muscle fatigue, resulting in exhaustion and pain, Therefore,
      determining the durable time to use the smart phone will protect us from abnormal posture and
      protect our muscle and ligaments.

      Furthermore avoid the incorrect position of use smartphone position.

      -Hypotheses:

      There are no statistical significant relation between time of used smart phone and muscle
      fatigue.

      -Subjects:

      One hundred fifty healthy children of both genders will participate in this study.

        -  Inclusion criteria:

             3. Worker children.

        -  Instrumentation:

           â€¢Surface Electromyography (EMG)

      All subjects shouldn't use the phone for an hour before the measurement Each child setting in
      a chair with their feet on the floor and the elbow slight flexion, holding a smartphone in
