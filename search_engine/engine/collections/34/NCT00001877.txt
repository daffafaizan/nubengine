      are used to prevent relapses in many patients with stable disease. The pulmonary
      manifestations of sarcoidosis are heterogenous and not all patients require corticosteroid
      therapy. Corticosteroids often produce undesirable side effects and, therefore, other
      therapies that can reduce or replace corticosteroid use are being sought. As tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a pivotal role in the formation of granulomata (the
      pathological hallmark of the disease), drugs that inhibit its production/release may prove
      effective in the treatment of this disease. Pentoxifylline (POF), a xanthine derivative used
      for many years in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease, is known to inhibit TNF-alpha
      release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and alveolar macrophages from patients
      with active sarcoidosis. To evaluate whether this drug is beneficial in the treatment of
      sarcoidosis, we propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with
      POF in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis on corticosteroid therapy. The primary objective
      of this study is to determine whether POF treatment can be beneficial as an adjunct to
      corticosteroid therapy in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The role of TNF-alpha and
      other cytokines (released from alveolar macrophages) in explaining treatment responses
      defined by whether or not a patient improved will be assessed by testing whether the effect
      of treatment on the probability of improvement varies with cytokine levels.
