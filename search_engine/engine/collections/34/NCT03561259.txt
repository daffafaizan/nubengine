    
      OPTIMUM (MIBG 2014-01) is a Phase II, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label study of
      therapeutic 131I-iobenguane (131I-MIBG) for the treatment of neuroblastoma. The study will be
      conducted in male and female subjects, greater than 1 year of age, with iobenguane avid,
      relapsed, high-risk neuroblastoma.

      Subjects will receive 18 mCi/kg of 131I-MIBG intravenously, and if the subject qualifies, the
      subject will receive the second 18 mCi/kg 131I-MIBG treatment (no sooner than 6 weeks
      following the first therapeutic 131I-MIBG treatment). Subject must have an overall response
      of stable disease or better, as assessed by the Investigator, and meet certain predefined
      criteria to receive the second treatment.

      Following a screening period of up to 4 weeks, the duration in the study treatment phase for
      an individual subject, who receives two treatments, is up to 22 weeks. For an individual
      subject, who receives one treatment only, the duration of the treatment phase is 16 weeks. In
      addition, there is a 2-year follow-up after the treatment phase, during which assessments
      will be performed to assess disease progression, as well as record adverse events.
