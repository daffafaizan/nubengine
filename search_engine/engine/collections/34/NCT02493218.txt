      violent neighborhoods, failing schools, and interpersonal conflict. Effective strategies to
      ameliorate the negative effects of stressful urban living are greatly needed.

      D-Stress Baltimore (DSB) is an evidence-based mindfulness-based instructional program of
      stress-reduction techniques which has been found to be beneficial for adults in decreasing
      anxiety and depression, improving positive emotions, and reducing anger.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the 12-week
      school-based DSB program compared with a 12-week school-based health education control
      program at Elev8 schools among 5th-8th graders. The investigators hypothesize that the
      D-Stress Baltimore Program will reduce negative emotions, including hostility, and improve
      coping.
