      lymphocytes subtypes involved in the early and late surrogate outcomes of patients with acute
      myocardial infarction, their characterization (B1, B2 and T lymphocytes) in cell culture and
      by flow-cytometry, and immune responses (IgM and IgG for oxLDL and specific epitopes of
      apoB). In addition, the project will evaluate new biomarkers identified by studies of
      metabolomics, as well as the corresponding signaling pathways. Therapeutic pharmacological
      strategies and changes on intestinal microbiota will be evaluated since the acute phase of
      myocardial infarction up to 6 months.

      In the study, the investigators will compared four arms of combined therapy: clopidogrel with
      rosuvastatin; or clopidogrel with simvastatin; or ticagrelor with rosuvastatin; or ticagrelor
      with simvastatin. The investigator's hypothesis is that the improvement of microcirculation
      with rosuvastatin and ticagrelor (synergic pleiotropic effects) may decrease the infarcted
      mass area, resulting in better left ventricular ejection fraction when compared to the other
      combined therapies.

      The monitoring and genotype of microbiota will be examined together the metabolomics and
      cardiac MRIs obtained at the acute phase of MI and after 1-mo and 6-mo FU.
