      Recently, the majority of ocular surgeries performed by regional rather than general
      anesthesia, because of the regional anesthesia is more economic, easy to perform, and the
      risk involved is less. Orbital regional anesthesia can be done using a retrobulbar
      (intra-conal) block, peribulbar (extra-conal) block or sub-Tenon's block.

      The STBs or episcleral block was first described by Turnbull in 1884 and it was repopularized
      in the 1990s as a simple and safe alternative to needle-based eye blocks. The STB becomes the
      most widely practiced regional technique for cataract surgery, because it produces
      satisfactory anesthesia for most intraocular procedures, and avoids the inherent risks of
      needle-based blocks, such as globe perforation and optic nerve injury.

      Dexmedetomidine is a selective Î±-2 receptor agonist that produces sedation and analgesia
      without causing respiratory depression. It also allows patients to respond to verbal commands
      during the sedation; easy conversion from sleeping to awakening is possible. Therefore,
      dexmedetomidine has been used as sedative in various clinical fields in intensive care unit
      and surgery and an adjuvant to local anesthetics.

      Many studies were done to evaluate its effect as sedative or anlgesic when administered
      either intravenously or when added to local anesthesia in ophthalmic block. But no one, till
      now comparing its effect when used as adjuvant to local anesthetics or administered
      intravenously in subtenon block.
