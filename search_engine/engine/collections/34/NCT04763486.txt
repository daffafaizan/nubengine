      in Israel. Women who had first and second-degree tear (or after episiotomy) after delivery at
      37 weeks or greater gestation, with no indication for ongoing prescription of antibiotics in
      the post-partum period and no contraindications to prophylactic Cefamezin (cefazolin), were
      randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single intravenous dose of prophylactic antibiotic or
      not.
