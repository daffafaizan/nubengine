      I. Evaluate whether use of prophylactic MuGard (mucoadhesive oral wound rinse) in
      participants being treated with everolimus will reduce the rate of stomatitis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare symptoms from mouth sores in patients receiving MuGard compared with those
      receiving best supportive care.

      II. Evaluate the rate of everolimus dose adjustment or therapy discontinuation as a result of
      stomatitis in participants treated with MuGard prophylaxis versus best supportive care.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive mucoadhesive oral wound rinse orally (PO) as a gentle swish for 30-60
      seconds 3-6 times daily beginning on day 1 of everolimus therapy and continuing for up to 6
      months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive no intervention.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 7 days.
