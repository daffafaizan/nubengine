      have a capillary finger-prick blood test to assess fasted blood glucose levels and then
      consume a 50 gram glucose solution. Blood test will be repeated at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120
      minutes post consumption of the glucose solution. This test will be repeated on a spate
      occasion at least a week later than the first test. Participants will only take part in the
      experiment after singing informed consent and agreeing to take part in the study and after a
      medical screening questionnaire assessing that they are non-diabetic or haemophiliac or have
      blood born infections.
