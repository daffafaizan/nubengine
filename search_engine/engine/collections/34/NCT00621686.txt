      Primary

        -  Identify the clinical efficacy of bevacizumab and sorafenib, as measured by 6-month
           progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      Secondary

        -  Assess time to progression of this patient population.

        -  Assess overall survival of this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib once daily on days 1-14 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes
      on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood and plasma sample collection at baseline and then periodically during
      study treatment for translational research studies. Translational research studies include
      analysis of circulating endothelial cells and circulating endothelial progenitor cells by
      flow cytometry and measurement of angiogenic proteins in plasma by ELISA. DNA and buffy coat
      are extracted and collected from the blood samples for pharmacogenetic studies.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to every other treatment course, and at the
      end of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28-42 days, every 3 months for
      5 years, and then annually for 10 years.
