    
      Primary outcome: To assess the safety and tolerability of BT-11 after single and multiple
      ascending oral dose administration in healthy volunteers

      The safety and tolerability profile of BT-11 as evidenced by the occurrence, timing,
      frequency, and severity of adverse events (AE) and clinically significant:

        -  laboratory abnormalities Haematology, Coagulation, Serum Chemistry, Urinalysis, HIV,
           HBsAg, HCV

        -  physical exam findings Complete physical exam include, at a minimum, assessment of the
           following systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, nose and throat, respiratory system,
           cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, neurological condition, blood and
           lymphatic systems, and the musculoskeletal system

        -  12-lead ECG aberrations ECG data (RR, PR, QRS, QT and QTcF intervals and pulse rate)

        -  and/or vital signs abnormalities Vital signs assessments will include systolic and
           diastolic blood pressure, pulse, tympanic body temperature, and respirations

      Timepoint: Adverse events will be recorded from the time of first dosing through to end of
      study date.

      Laboratory abnormalities at the screening visit, up to 28 days prior to the first dose of
      study medication then up to end of study visit.

      Physical Exam findings will be collected at screening, Day-1 and Day 2 for the single
      ascending dose. For multiple ascending dose it will be collected at screening, Day-1, Day 3,
      Day 5 and Day 7

      12-lead ECG aberrations will be collected from Screening then on Day -1 and Day 2 for the
      single ascending dose. For MAD it will be collected at screening, Day-1, Day 3, Day 5 and Day
      7

      Vital signs abnormalities collected from Screening then on Day -1 and Day 2 for the single
      ascending dose. For MAD it will be collected at screening, Day-1, Day 3, Day 5 and Day 7

      Primary outcome: To assess the safety and tolerability of BT-11 after single and multiple
      ascending oral dose administration in healthy volunteers.

      Timepoint: For single ascending dose blood samples for PK analysis will be collected pre-dose
      and at 15, 30, 45 minutes, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post-dose

      Urine samples for PK analysis will be collected pre-dose and 0-24 hours post-dose;

      For multiple ascending blood samples for PK analysis will be collected pre-dose and at 15,
      30, and 45 min and 1, 1.25 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 18 hours post Day 1 dose. Pre-dose
      on Day 2

      Urine samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1, pre-dose and at 0-24 hours
      post-dose

      On follow up period, Day 3 to Day 6, Plasma samples for PK analysis will be collected
      pre-dose on each day.

      Secondary outcome: The following PK parameters will be determined:

        -  Time to maximum concentration (tmax);

        -  Maximum concentration (Cmax);

        -  Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to last measurable time-point
           (AUC0-tlast);

        -  Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf);

        -  Terminal Elimination Rate Constant (kel);

        -  Terminal half-life (t1/2);

        -  Terminal clearance (CL/F);

        -  Volume of distribution (Vd/F).

      Timepoint: The following PK parameters will be determined for single ascending dose:

      Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours from start of first dose
      (AUC0-24h);

      â€¢ Amount of drug excreted in urine in each collection interval

      For the multiple ascending dose:

      Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours from start dosing (AUC0-24h)
      on Day 1 and 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) following the last dose on Day 7;

        -  Pre-dose trough on Days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6;

        -  Amount of drug excreted in urine in each collection interval;

        -  Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F).
