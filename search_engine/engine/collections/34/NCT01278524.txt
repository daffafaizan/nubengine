      independently associated with cognitive impairment at hospital discharge and with
      significantly higher 6-month mortality. Furthermore, ICU delirium is associated with more
      days requiring mechanically ventilation, longer ICU length of stay, and longer hospital
      length of stay. More recently a study by Pisani and co-workers' could show an association
      between days of delirium and mortality; - each additional day spent in delirium is associated
      with a 20% increased risk of prolonged hospitalization - translating to over 10 additional
      days - and a 10% increased risk of death.The reported prevalence of delirium in critically
      ill patients ranges widely from 11% to 87%. The aim of our study is to investigate the
      implementation rate of routine delirium assessment in European ICUs.
