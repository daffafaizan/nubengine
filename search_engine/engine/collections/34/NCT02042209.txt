      benefit from the sending of an UMH. Our assumption is that this situation could be improved
      if telephone triage physicians were guided by recommendations or consensual algorithms of
      decision. The telephone triage doctor will manage a single questionnaire with the patient,
      with demographic and simple clinical data. The construction of the score will be done by the
      analysis of these data confronted with the final diagnosis (effective ACS or not). The
      effective existence of an ACS among patients with thoracic pain will be affirmed by an expert
      committee after collection of the intra-hospital patient's data and the follow-up at one
      month.
