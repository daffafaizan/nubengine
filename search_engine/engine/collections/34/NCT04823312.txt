      (ADA), with at least 15 subjects meeting the eligibility criteria. Eligibility criteria will
      be assessed at the screening visit and confirmed prior to Visit 2. At Visit 2, subjects will
      be provided supplies, including the DUO device, and will be trained on insertion. Each
      subject will wear their own MiniMed 670G insulin system including Guardian sensor (new sensor
      with transmitter will be provided for the study) and a DUO Extended set. The infusion set in
      the DUO Extended will be used for insulin infusion and the sensor in the DUO Extended will be
      blinded with a specific recorder connected to each sensor.

      Guardian Sensor (3) and the SMBG measurements will be used for making therapy decisions as
      approved for the 670G system. Subjects will upload their pump, Contour meter and GS3 sensor
      data each week, which will be reviewed by an investigator. Subjects will wear the DUO device
      for a total of four weeks. At Visit 6, subjects will come to the site to have devices
      uploaded, to return the investigational devices, to have a skin assessment and for labs to be
      drawn.
