    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the feasibility and safety of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given in combination
      with irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) to patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 when given in combination with
      irinotecan to patients with advanced solid tumors and to recommend a phase II dose for the
      combination.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy for this combination. III. To compare the
      pharmacokinetics of SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) with and without concurrent
      administration of MLN8237 in an expanded cohort of patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8
      and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3 and 8-10. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
