      in the first few weeks of life. The disease is characterised by obstruction and damage to the
      intra and extrahepatic parts of the biliary tree. Within the liver there is also a pronounced
      inflammatory response. The initial treatment is an attempt, by surgery, to restore bile flow
      by excising the obliterated extrahepatic bile ducts and joining part of the intestine to the
      bile "root" of the liver (the porta hepatis). This is known as the Kasai procedure. This is
      successful in ~50% of cases in reducing the level of jaundice to near-normal values. The use
      of steroids post-operatively has been suggested as improving outcome by diminishing the
      inflammatory response.
