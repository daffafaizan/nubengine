      myocardial infarction and stroke . The incidence of PE has been increasing ,with significant
      associated mortality; a recent registry of PE patients reported a mortality rate > 10% at 30
      days. There are a number of emerging contemporary PE therapies, including thrombolysis,
      catheter intervention and surgery. Early and accurate identification of PE in patients is
      therefore critical. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) may help when there is a clinical
      suspicion for PE, and its use in confirmed PE is widely recommended . A number of right
      atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) parameters have been shown to be abnormal in patients
      with PE . In addition, RA and RV enlargement portends a worse prognosis in these patients .
