    
      Aim 1: To evaluate the rates of referral of tobacco users visiting primary care clinics to
      the WTQL, comparing those who were referred via an EHR-based electronic referral system vs.
      those referred via a manual paper fax referral system. Analyses will address the change in
      rates of referrals from pre- to post-intervention and the trajectory of referral
      post-intervention and will reflect per clinic rates.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the rates of quality referrals of tobacco users visiting primary care
      clinics to the WTQL, comparing those who were referred via an EHR-based electronic referral
      system vs. those referred via a manual paper fax referral system (quality referrals are
      defined as ones that result in individuals who enroll in and receive WTQL counseling and/or
      medication treatment services). Analyses will address the change in referrals from pre- to
      post-intervention and will reflect per clinic rates.

      Aim 3: To examine variation in referral rates across clinics to test the hypothesis that the
      eReferral system will result in greater consistency in referral in addition to higher rates
      of referral. Qualitative methods will be used to understand the sources of variation.

      Aim 4: To assess clinician and staff satisfaction with the eReferral and paper fax referral
      systems via self-report questionnaires.

      Aim 5: To evaluate smoking abstinence rates of tobacco users who were referred to and
      accepted services from the WTQL, comparing those who were referred via an EHR-based referral
      system vs. those referred via a manual paper fax referral system.
