      congnitive-neural mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. Cognitive behaviour
      therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) is considered as an evidence-based treatment for insomnia.
      After 5 consecutive sleep interventions is a 2-year following up study, the above issue is
      further tested with emphasis on progressive trajectory from a developmental perspective. we
      examine the influence of sleep disturbance on face processing and neural response during
      naturalistic social behavior of ASD children using synchronized eye-tracking and functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to uncover the neural mechanism for that sleep disturbance
      influences social deficit.
