      Primary: What is the effect of SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using
      insulin on Glycemic control (as measured with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c)?

      Secondary: What is the effect of SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using
      insulin on the following parameters:

        -  Health status

        -  Diabetes related complaints

        -  Patient satisfaction

        -  Cumulative incidence of (necessity to start) insulin therapy / maximum dosage of oral
           blood glucose lowering drugs

        -  Dosage of oral blood glucose lowering drugs

        -  Bodyweight (BMI)

      Two treatment protocols are proposed. Treatment A consists of self-monitoring of blood
      glucose and treatment B consists of usual care. Patients in the A-group are instructed to
      measure their blood glucose values 4 times a day (1 fasting plasma glucose concentration and
      3 post-meal glucose concentrations), two times a week, on one week day, and one weekend day
      (no more, no less). Patients should record these glucose values in a diary. Patient will get
      one page with information in Dutch. No further education than for handling the device and
      interpreting the values is given, so that besides this intervention, there will be no
      differences compared with the control group like other forms of education.

      The duration fo the trial will be 12 months.
