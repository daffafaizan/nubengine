      fibrillation. However ablation in the posterior wall of the left atrium can cause thermal
      injury to the esophagus. When significant thermal injury to the esophagus occurs, two
      significant complications can occur: 1) the formation of an atrio-esophageal fistula, and 2)
      gastrointestinal dysmotility. While the former is rate, it is an important complication since
      it can be fatal. The frequency of the latter complication is less well appreciated, but
      probably occurs in the range of 1:100 to 1:500. Currently luminal esophageal temperature
      monitoring is the most commonly employed modality to prevent such injury. However, there are
      limitations to its use, and atrio-esophageal fistulas have been reported even when using
      esophageal temperature monitoring. Esophageal deviation using either a TEE or EGD probe has
      been described in the literature, but the effectiveness and practicality of these techniques
      are suboptimal, and have therefore precluded their use in routine clinical practice.
      Recently, we have demonstrated that esophageal deviation is indeed possible using
      off-the-shelf equipment (a soft thoracic tube and endotracheal stylet) in patients undergoing
      AF ablation. In this randomized double-blind study, we will compare standard practice (i.e.,
      use of luminal esophageal temperature monitoring) to esophageal deviation during AF ablation.
      We hypothesize that the strategy of esophageal deviation will result in safer ablation
      strategy with a reduction in the incidence of esophageal injury as assessed by endoscopy.
