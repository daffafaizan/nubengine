      FDA-approved agents, nicotine patch and lorcaserin, for smoking cessation treatment. The
      nicotine patch which provides a sustained low dose of nicotine is a nicotine receptor
      agonist. Lorcaserin, a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (5-HT2C) agonist, is a drug
      that is FDA-approved for weight loss, and has also recently been shown to be efficacious for
      smoking cessation. Given that these drugs act through distinct mechanisms it is hoped that
      the combination will prove more efficacious than either drug alone. It is also hypothesized
      that the combination will reduce weight gain commonly seen after smoking cessation.
