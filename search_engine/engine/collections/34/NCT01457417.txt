      patients with multiple myeloma or advanced solid tumors. Patients must be refractory or
      intolerant to all standard/approved therapy(ies). At each dose level, 3 subjects will be
      treated. If none of the 3 subjects develop a dose limiting toxicity after a minimum of 4
      weeks of treatment, subsequent dose escalation will proceed according to the same schedule.
      Part B consists of dose confirmation in patients with NSCLC. Patients must be refractory or
      intolerant to all standard/approved therapy(ies). Approximately 15 patients may be enrolled
      in Part B.
