      women face different psychosocial issues than men, and their bodies may react differently to
      HIV treatment. However, most of the data on the safety and efficacy of antiretrovirals (ARVs)
      used in the treatment of HIV infection are from studies conducted primarily in men. LPV/r in
      tablet form was approved by the FDA in October 2005. This study will determine the
      differences in pharmacokinetics (PK) in men and women taking a soft gel capsule and a tablet
      formulation of LPV/r.

      No ARVs will be provided by this study. In Step 1, participants will receive soft gel
      capsules of LPV/r. All Step 1 participants will be asked to join Step 2 of the study upon
      completion of Step 1. In Step 2, participants will receive tablets of LPV/r. During the
      study, participants in both Step 1 and 2 will take a treatment regimen of LPV/r twice daily
      and one or more of the following: a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI),
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or enfuvirtide. Medical and medication history, blood
      collection, and clinical assessments will occur at study screening for both Steps 1 and 2.
      Participants in both steps will be asked to complete a medication diary from study entry to
      the day of the PK visit. The PK visit will occur within 30 days of study screening; blood
      collection for PK analysis will also occur at this visit.
