      to participate in fall prevention workshops.

      The study covered three different French departments. A total of 19 semi-structured
      interviews were conducted over a period of 5 months.

      The analysis of reports revealed there were multiple motives for not participating in the
      balance workshops. The current means of promoting these fall prevention workshops are not
      adapted. Finally, the social experience provided by the program was identified to be the
      principal motivator for encouraging the interviewed subjects to participate.
