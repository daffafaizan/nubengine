      compared to a waitlist control group. Briefly, participants (healthy persons, age 65-80 years
      old) will participate in an online group exercise program (designed to meet Canada's Physical
      Activity Guidelines) via Zoom delivered by Registered Kinesiologists and Physiotherapists for
      a total of 8 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to the exercise group or the
