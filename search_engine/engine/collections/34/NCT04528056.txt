      artery pressure owing to continuous progression of pulmonary vascular resistance and can
      ultimately cause right heart failure even death. At present, the treatment of pulmonary
      arterial hypertension is mainly the application of specific drug therapy. Specific drug
      therapy involves the three major pathways of endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin. The
      main mechanisms of vasodilation and anti-proliferation are used to treat pulmonary arterial
      hypertension. However, the price of specific drug therapy is too expensive, which puts huge
      financial pressure on patients. Evidence shows that inflammation exists in the early stages
      of pulmonary arterial hypertension and anti-inflammatory treatment is effective in animal
      experiments. Under placebo control, the investigators intend to evaluate the effectiveness
      and safety of anti-inflammatory therapy and/or targeted drug therapy for early treatment of
      patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
