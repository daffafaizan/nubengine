      progressively and results in visual impairment by inducing irregular astigmatism and corneal
      opacities.

      Collagen Cross-Linking (CXL) is widely used in progressive keratoconus. The cornea is soaked
      with a riboflavin solution and then being exposed to ultraviolet-A radiation. The performance
      creates links between collagen fibrils in order to rigidify the corneal stroma and slow down
      the progression of keratoconus. However, the effectiveness is not satisfied and accompanied
      with risks of side effects and serious complications, such as pain for the first two
      post-operative days, temporary loss of visual acuity during the first three months, infection
      and stromal opacity due to corneal scarring.

      Epi-keratoplasty is a reversible technique in which a corneal graft is transplanted on the
      recipients' eye with only removal of the epithelium of the receptor cornea. The procedure was
      assisted by femtosecond laser which allows precisely and neatly cutting. The graft strengths
      the whole host corneal rigidity and roughness and therefore renders the progression of
      keratoconus.
