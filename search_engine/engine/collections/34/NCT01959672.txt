    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (gemcitabine [gemcitabine
      hydrochloride], leucovorin [leucovorin calcium], fluorouracil [5-FU]) with or without
      oregovomab, followed by hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) concurrently with
      nelfinavir (nelfinavir mesylate) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that is
      cancer antigen (CA)125 positive (>= 10) or CA125 negative (< 10).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (gemcitabine, leucovorin, 5-FU) with or
      without oregovomab, followed by SRT concurrently with nelfinavir in patients with locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer that is CA125 positive (>= 10) or CA125 negative (< 10).

      II. To assess the cellular and humoral immune responses to active immunotherapy with
      oregovomab/monoclonal antibody in patients with pancreas cancer with CA125 level greater than
      10 undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate tumor and organ motion with 4-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) and
      respiratory gating system.

      II. To evaluate the effect of tumor/organ motion on the dosimetry, local control and
      survival.

      III. To evaluate inter- and intra-fractional target motion with Calypso system.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV), leucovorin
      calcium IV over 30 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 7 courses.

      IMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients with CA125 level >= 10 receive oregovomab IV over 15-30 minutes on
      day 15. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 1, 4, 7) and post- radiation
      therapy for 1 course (week 14). Patients may receive an additional 3 courses concurrently
      with chemotherapy upon recovery from surgery based on CA125 level. Patients also receive
      nelfinavir mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 5 weeks beginning on day 15 of week 9.

      STEREOTACTIC RADIATION THERAPY: Beginning in week 11, patients undergo SBRT in 5 fractions
      over 5 consecutive days. Upon completion of radiation therapy, patients resume nelfinavir
      mesylate for 14 days (week 12-13). Patients without metastasis and with resectable disease
      undergo surgery in week 17-18.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
