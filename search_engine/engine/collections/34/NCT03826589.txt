      metastasis or recurrence, platinum-based chemotherapy is the usual treatment option. Once
      this first-line chemotherapy fails, the prognosis is dismal. Various second-line agents
      including second-line chemotherapy agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors have
      unsatisfactory response rate.
