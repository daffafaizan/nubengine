    
      Primary objective

      â€¢ To investigate the association between the estimation of insulin resistance and beta cell
      function through homeostasis model assessment with HbA1C among oral anti-diabetics treatment
      non-responder.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To compare the insulin resistance and beta cell function between the OAD treatment
           responders (negative control) and non-responders

        -  To investigate the relationship between plasma level of metformin and gliclazide with
           the estimation of beta cell function and insulin resistance

        -  To identify the proportion of patients with high insulin resistance and proportion of
           patients with low beta cell function

        -  To identify difference in insulin resistance and beta cell function of different ethnic
           groups in Sarawak

        -  To compare insulin resistance with cardiovascular disease risk using Framingham Risk
           Score and ASCVD risk estimation
