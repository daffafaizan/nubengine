      parallel-design, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of prazosin
      for decreasing alcohol use in 200 active duty Service Members who served in the conflicts in
      Iraq and/or Afghanistan who are receiving standard outpatient treatment for alcohol use
      disorders at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Treatment groups will be stratified by presence or
      absence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and by assignment to the 6-week or 12-week
      Army Substance Abuse Program. The hypotheses are that: 1) prazosin is more effective than
      placebo for alcohol use disorders in these Service Members; and 2) that prazosin effect size
      will be greater in Service Members with PTSD than without PTSD.
