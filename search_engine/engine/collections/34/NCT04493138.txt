      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of quizartinib in
      combination with azacytidine.

      II. To assess overall response (ORR) rate to quizartinib in combination with azacitidine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival (OS), duration of response, leukemia-free survival (LFS),
      relapse-free survival (RFS) and safety profile.

      II. Correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of quizartinib followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over about 30 minutes
      on days 1-5 and quizartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
