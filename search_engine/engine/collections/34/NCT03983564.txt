      score.

      Firstly, the investigators will use a retrospective cohort of 400 patients to determine this
      combination. It will allow classifying patients in 3 groups: 1) patients for whom OSA can be
      excluded with certitude, 2) patients for whom OSA can be diagnosed with certitude, and 3) an
      intermediate group.

      Secondly, the 100 patients included in this study will serve to validate the cutoff of the
      abovementioned combination into a new population.
