      stress and vascular complications. Despite the importance of therapeutic strategies in
      reducing the cardiovascular risk among HIV-infected patients (HIVP), exercise-related effects
      upon macro-and-microvascular endothelial function and oxidative stress in HIVP have not been
      previously reported.
