    
      This is a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy,

      randomized, parallel group, placebo and active controlled phase II proof-of concept study.
      Patients are enrolled into a single-blind, 2-week placebo run in

      period after which they are randomized to 4 weeks of double-blind

      treatment with YM178 (low dose and high dose), placebo or tolterodine. Subsequently patients
      will be followed for an additional 2 weeks

      with single-blind placebo treatment. There are 6 visits in total: visit 1 at

      enrolment, visit 2 (baseline) after the 2-week placebo run-in, visits 3, 4 and 5

      after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of double-blind treatment respectively, and visit 6

      after a 2-week follow-up.
