      proportion of surgical and type 1 diabetic subjects receiving an islet allotransplant who
      achieve and maintain full or partial islet graft function during the first year
      post-transplant will be determined to assess the efficacy of hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala)
      administration. Successful completion of the proposed clinical trial will increase our
      understanding of the safety, efficacy and underlying mechanisms of selective immunotherapy
      with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody hOKT3gamma1 (Ala-ala) for the maximization of
      engraftment and functional survival of allogeneic human islets in surgical and type 1
      diabetic recipients.
