      thyroid surgery. Surgical exposure and visual identification of the nerve during thyroid
      surgery has been shown to provide the best rates of normal postoperative vocal fold function.
      Nevertheless, identification of the nerve sometimes can be difficult in patients who are
      heavily scarred or who have undergone previous surgery. Moreover, an anatomical intact nerve
      does not always correlate with normal vocal fold function. So it is mandatory to identify the
      nerve and to establish its function. Two techniques are described to facilitate
      identification of the nerve and to test its function. One is the neurostimulation with
      laryngeal palpation which is an intermittent monitoring techniques that permits to evaluate
      the contraction of cricoarytenoid muscle (laryngeal twitch ) after stimulation of RLN or
      vagal nerve with an electric stimulator probe. More recently some authors have suggested a
      continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring which provide audio and visual feed back when the
      nerve is electrically or mechanically stimulated during thyroidectomy. However controversy
      remains as to whether intraoperative neuromonitoring confers any significant benefit in
      injury prevention of recurrent laryngeal nerve.
