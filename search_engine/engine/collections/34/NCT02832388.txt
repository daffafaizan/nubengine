    
      From June 2013, all newly diagnosed patients with primary aldosteronism (PA) either diagnosed
      at Haukeland University Hospital (HUS) or admitted to HUS for subtype testing with adrenal
      vein sampling, have been asked for inclusion in the study. All included patients have a
      base-line study visit where clinical information is registered, and baseline blood and urine
      samples are collected. Echocardiography will be performed in a subgroup of patients before
      and 1 year after start of specific PA treatment. After start of definite medical or surgical
      treatment the patients are followed up with regularly new study visits. From 2020 onwards, PA
      patients diagnosed or subtyped with adrenal vein sampling at Oslo University Hospital will
      additionally be included in the study, thereby providing a national registration of PA
      patients.

      A subgroup of the included PA study patients also perform a Cardiac MRI. Cine-MRI,
      velocity-encoded MRI, MRI images during continuous adenosine infusion and MRI images after
      gadolinium contrast injection are performed, and compared to a group of age- and sex-matched
      healthy controls.
