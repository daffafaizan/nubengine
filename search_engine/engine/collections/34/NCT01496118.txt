      carfilzomib and panobinostat were evaluated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to
      administer. The MTD was not reached so patients in Phase II received treatment at dose level
      4 to further assess efficacy. Response to treatment was evaluated after each 4-week cycle.
      Those having an objective response or stable disease are continuing treatment until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      As the MTD in the 4 planned dose levels were not reached, a parallel Phase I study was
      initiated to examine additional dose levels using a traditional 3+3 design. If these dose
      levels are tolerable, then more patients will be recruited into an expansion cohort to assess
      efficacy at the new dose level(s).
