      extraction in preventing infections and to evaluate the effect of probiotic in reducing the
      possible antibiotic side effects. In order to analyze the effect of the antibiotic in terms
      of patient's general discomfort, a tailored form was prepared (Appendix A). The local signs
      and symptoms to evaluate are swelling, pain (assessed by the Visual Analogic Scale), presence
      of abscess, fever, post-extraction dental alveolitis (dry socket) and presence of trismus
      assessed as maximal mouth opening variation (mm). In addition adverse post-extraction events
      will be evaluated as follows: chewing impairments (assessed by the Visual Analogic Scale),
      speaking impairments (assessed by the Visual Analogic Scale), daily oral hygiene maneuvers
      impairments (assessed by the Visual Analogic Scale) and daily activities alterations
      (days-off from job/study). Moreover, the patients will be provided with a painkiller's
      prescription and they are required to take note of the painkillers needed during the first 7
      days, i.e. until the first time point recall. The prescribed painkillers will be Ibuprofen
      600 mg or naproxen sodium 500mg for those patients who reported allergy to ibuprofen.
      Finally, it will be a researcher duty to ask the patients if they needed to assume
      painkillers beyond the 7th day. Since the post-surgical sequelae depend also on the
      difficulty of extraction, the Appendix A provides a table in which the surgeon can take note
      of the type of extraction.
