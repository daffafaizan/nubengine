      problem in obesity treatment. This study will compare the effectiveness of two different
      weight loss maintenance strategies used as part of the Counterweight Plus weight management
      programme. This study will also evaluate the behavioural impact of the Counterweight Plus
      interventions and include process evaluations and cost analysis.

      Methods: 80 patients and 10 practitioners will be recruited into the study. Main inclusion
      criteria for patients are:

      Completed Counterweight Plus, which includes 12-20 weeks total diet replacement (TDR), 8
      weeks food reintroduction (FR) and achieved >10kg weight loss. All participants will be
      followed up for 18 months in total.

      Results: The primary outcome of this study is the difference in weight change between the two
      groups at 6 months. Frequency of use of behavioural strategy will be quantified for both
      practitioners and patients during voice recorded consultations. The relationship between
      weight change and the use of behavioural strategy will be assessed.

      Hypothesis: This study will establish if the novel intermittent use of formula diet strategy
      is more effective at preventing weight regain in comparison to usual care. It will also
      provide evidence of the frequency of use of behavioural strategies within routine
      Counterweight Plus delivery, as well as establishing the cost of the intervention.
