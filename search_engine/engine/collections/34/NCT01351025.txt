      serious diseases like heart disease (heart attacks) and certain kinds of cancer have
      increased. HIV causes inflammation (irritation) inside the body that cannot be felt but can
      be measured by levels of certain inflammation blood tests. Inflammation may contribute to
      diseases (such as heart attacks) that have become some of the leading causes of death in
      people with HIV. HIV therapy can partially lower levels of inflammation measured in blood,
      however, levels of inflammation in people who have HIV who are taking certain kinds of
      anti-HIV drugs may remain high compared with those found in people not infected with HIV.
