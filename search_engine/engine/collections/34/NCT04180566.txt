      reproductive age. It is well known that obesity has been associated with increased risk of
      antenatal complications, maternal and perinatal morbidity, including higher risk of
      stillbirth. Studies including obese women without other antepartum comorbidities have shown
      that up to 11% of pregnancies are complicated with fluid and fetal growth abnormalities.
      According to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines,
      antepartum surveillance has not been proven to improve pregnancy outcomes in such cases and
      no specific recommendations for antepartum surveillance in obese women have been established.
