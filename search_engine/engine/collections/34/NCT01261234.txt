      restenosis after interventions in coronary or femoropopliteal arteries. The investigators
      confirmed and published periprocedural cilostazol administration reduced incidences of
      in-stent restenosis (ISR) or target vessel revascularization (TVR) after CAS,
      retrospectively.

      CAS-CARE study is Multicenter Prospective Ranodomized Controlled Study. Patients, scheduled
      for CAS within 30 days, 50% or more symptomatic carotid stenosis or 80% or more asymptomatic
      carotid stenosis, will enroll and randomize by cilostazol/non-cilostazol group. 900 patients
      will be enrolled for 2 years and followed 2 years with in-stent restenosis after CAS,
      evaluated by carotid ultrasound and angiography. And, evaluate cardiovascular events,
      including stroke, myocardial infarction, and hemorrhagic events in periprocedural period and
      followed period. In this study, ISR is diagnosed by ultrasound and DSA/CTA. Equivalence of
      CTA to ultrasound will be studied.
