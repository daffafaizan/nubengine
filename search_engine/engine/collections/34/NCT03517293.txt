      heart disease (cholesterol, blood pressure, adiposity) in young children. We have previously
      found an association between self-reported exercise during pregnancy and improved heart
      measures of the fetus and neonate. In addition, a limited number of studies in which exercise
      was self-reported have demonstrated improved heart and adipose measures in the fetus or
      neonate with effects that persist into childhood. Previous prenatal exercise intervention
      studies using a prescribed exercise regimen have demonstrated the feasibility of such an
      approach; however, these studies have focused on maternal health and pregnancy outcomes such
      as birth weight. At this point, there is a gap in our understanding as to how carefully
      controlled, regular maternal aerobic exercise programs may lead to improvements in
      cardiovascular and adiposity risk factors in utero and in neonates.

      The central hypothesis of this project is that maternal exercise during pregnancy will
      improve the health of the offspring. Specifically, the objectives of the research proposed in
      this application are to determine the effects of regular maternal exercise on heart function,
      adiposity, and neur0motor function of offspring

      The data gathered will be the first documentation, by direct measurement, of the effects of
      maternal aerobic exercise on selected heart and obesity outcomes during the prenatal and
      postnatal periods. The potential impact of the proposed research on public health education
      regarding heart disease and obesity prevention is of public import.
