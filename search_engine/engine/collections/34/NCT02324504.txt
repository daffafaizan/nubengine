      medical care for a variety of patients. Current practice requires radiographic confirmation
      of catheter tip placement prior to use of the line for administration of medications. Often
      the final catheter tip position may be uncertain based on radiographic imaging. Other times,
      the catheter is malpositioned and requires adjustment and repeat radiographic imaging. In
      adult patients, a system of confirmation that is based on electrocardiographic activity has
      been implemented and is FDA approved. This study will enroll up to 192 children less than 18
      years of age who will receive electrocardiographic guidance for placement of a PICC, in
      addition to radiography done as standard care. The investigators will determine the location
      of the PICC tip from both ECG and radiograph, and then measure the degree of correlation
      between the two methods.
