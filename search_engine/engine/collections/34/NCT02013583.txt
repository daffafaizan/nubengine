    
      This is a registry for patients diagnosed with G1D, or experiencing symptoms G1D but not yet
      diagnosed. The registry will be available online for patients to provide consent, register,
      enter data, and modify data as necessary. The registry will be programmed by programmers at
      UT Southwestern Medical Center. The registry will provide the opportunity for patients to
      enter a comprehensive medical history, from symptoms to lab results to medications and other
      treatment regimens.

      This registry is entirely patient-driven; no medical records will be requested by the
      investigator, nor are visits with the investigator or any other research personnel required.

      The registry database will be periodically "cleaned"; that is, records will be reviewed for
      duplication of entries and consistency of data. Many data validation checks are incorporated
      into the registry. Additional data clarification may be requested from users if users have
      chosen to provide an email address for contact.
