    
      This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, LTFU study of subjects who have, in a previous
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) clinical trial, received GSK3377794 (NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T) by a process that
      utilizes lentiviral vectors. This protocol is designed in adherence with Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines. The study involves up to
      15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed to lentivirus-mediated
      gene transfer in GSK clinical studies. Subjects will undergo clinical evaluation (i.e., new
      medical history, physical exam, adverse events, and exposure to mutagenic agents, anti-cancer
      therapies and investigational products in other clinical studies) with careful attention to
      adverse events possibly related to gene transfer or lentivirus-induced diseases. Blood
      samples will be collected for evaluating persistence of cells with lentiviral vector
      sequences, the detection of replication competent lentivirus (RCL), and chemistry and
      hematology laboratory assessments. Subjects will be followed for survival.
