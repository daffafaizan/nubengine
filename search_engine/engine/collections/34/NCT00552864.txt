      undergoing cardiac surgery has become increasing popular in recent years. In fact, this
      technique is potentially beneficial because of the attenuation of the stress response to
      surgery, the sympathetic tone reduction and the excellent postoperative analgesia.Patients
      submitted to coronary artery bypass graft will be randomly allocated to receive high epidural
      block with ropivacaine (R) or levobupivacaine (L), supplemented with sufentanil, during and
      after surgery. Postoperatively, the rate of epidural infusion will be modified to maintain a
      VAS score less than 4 in the thoracic area when coughing. VAS, total amount and rate of
      epidural drug infusion, MAP, total amount and rate of norepinephrine infusion and motor block
      will be recorded on arrival in the ICU, on awakening and after 4, 8, 12, 24 hours.
      Additionally, the onset time of the epidural sensory block, the time of awakening and the
      time on ventilator will be recorded as well as episodes of postoperative nausea and vomiting
      (PONV) and pruritus.
