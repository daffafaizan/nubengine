      I. To determine if the combination of paclitaxel and efatutazone (efatutazone
      dihydrochloride) improves the confirmed response rate in patients with advanced anaplastic
      thyroid cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall survival (OS), duration of response, progression-free survival
      (PFS), and adverse event rates for the combination of paclitaxel and efatutazone.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The association of biomarkers with clinical outcome data will be assessed in an
      exploratory translational analysis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1 and efatutazone
      dihydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 28 days, every 8 weeks
      until disease progression, and then every 6 months for 5 years.
