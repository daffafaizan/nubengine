      patients with atrial fibrillation that is difficult to treat may improve the outcome of
      rhythm control therapy. Left atrial size could be a useful tool to select patients that will
      benefit from rhythm control therapy.Beside echocardiographic parameters,atrial fibrillation
      has been also associated with circulating biomarkers in blood like collagen metabolism,
      inflammatory mediators,neurohumoral factors and proteins/proteomic profiles. Beside more
      accepted risk factors (myocardial ischemia, diabetes and pulmonary disease)other less
      well-known clinical factors (sleep apnea, alcohol or other intoxication abuse, excessive
      physical activity, esophageal problems and increased body mass index) may also predict the
      outcome of rhythm control.It likes also plausible that recurrent atrial fibrillation within
      one month after start of rhythm control are associated with a different risk profile than
      late atrial fibrillation recurrence.During this study we will try to identify patients with
      atrial fibrillation who are more or less likely to respond to rhythm control therapy.
