      of head and neck cancer patients and sub scales associated with head and neck cancers
      developed in addition to these scales. In addition, scales specific to head and neck cancers
      have also been developed. However, previous research shows that even general health status
      scales or cancer-specific scales cannot determine outcomes related to many head and neck
      cancer patients. In addition, items containing multiple functions and patients' attitudes
      (behaviors) cannot be analyzed separately in any of the scales specific to head and neck
      cancer. Very few surveys contain items related to patients' attitudes (behaviors), or the
      number of items related to this topic is small because most of these scales are functional
      items. Unlike its counterparts in the literature, Head and Neck Cancer Inventory evaluates
      the attitudes (behaviors) of patients associated with various functions in daily life. Head
      and Neck Cancer Inventory is the only scale in the literature that contains the basic
      features of the health conditions declared by the patient and has been developed specifically
      for head and neck cancer.
