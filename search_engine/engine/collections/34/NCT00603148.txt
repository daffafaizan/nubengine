      αβ1 integrin expression on platelets with clinical outcome in terms of bleeding or thrombotic
      complications. The association of polymorphisms in other genes such as GPVI, PAR-1, and
      COX-2, as well as PLA ½ status, will also be examined and considered in the context of other
      factors such as medications including IIb/IIIa inhibitors, anticoagulants, type of procedure,
      obesity smoking status, etc.

      Lower levels of platelet surface expression of the α2β1 integrin are associated with an
      increased risk of bleeding complications following hybrid procedures, especially when the low
      level of integrin expression is associated with other risk factors that may exacerbate
      bleeding such as vigorous anti-coagulation, aggressive anti-platelet therapy and other
      genetic risk factors that contribute to a hemorrhagic phenotype. Conversely, higher level
      expression of the α2β1 integrin is likely associated with a greater tendency to thrombotic
      complication that is again modified by other coexisting risk factors.
