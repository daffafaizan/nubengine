      in patients with and without obstructive pulmonary disease and to describe the relationship
      between pressures and airflow obstruction. This information will provide normative data not
      currently available and would establish whether tracheal collapse is due to tracheomalacia.
      The data may lead to better ways of predicting if a patient would benefit from procedures to
      prevent tracheal collapse.
