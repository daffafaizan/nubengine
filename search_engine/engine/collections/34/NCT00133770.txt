    
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common disease that affects 20-50% of adults
      in Western Countries. The disease can be divided into three clinical categories: nonerosive
      reflux disease (NERD), erosive reflux disease (ERD), and Barrett's esophagus.

      Intravenous (IV) infusion produces a faster and steadier acid suppression than an oral
      regimen. Furthermore, some patients with severe erosive esophagitis cannot take pills by
      mouth and will benefit from an IV formulation. Recently, we observed healing of severe
      erosive esophagitis with continuous IV pantoprazole in several patients in 3 days. The safety
      of IV pantoprazole has been demonstrated in patients with GERD, with Zollinger-Ellison
      syndrome, or bleeding ulcer. This study is to define the safety and efficacy of continuous IV
      pantoprazole in the treatment of severe erosive esophagitis.

      Comparison: The continuous IV pantoprazole compared to the once a day IV pantoprazole for 72
      hours in the treatment of severe erosive esophagitis.
