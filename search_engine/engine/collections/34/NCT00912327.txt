    
      Study BT-CL-PGG-CRC0821 is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, efficacy and safety study. It
      will be conducted using a two-stage design with the intention of determining the initial
      efficacy of Imprime PGG in combination with a monoclonal antibody (MAb; cetuximab) in the
      treatment of KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC). Both stages will be conducted in subjects
      with Stage IV CRC demonstrating the KRAS gene mutation. All subjects will receive Imprime PGG
      at 4 mg/kg and standard doses of cetuximab; Imprime PGG and cetuximab will be administered in
      6-week cycles. Subjects will dose until progression of disease or discontinuation from the
      study for other reasons; e.g., safety, non-compliance. The initial cetuximab dose will be 400
      mg/m2 on Cycle 1/Day1 and subsequent doses of cetuximab will be 250 mg/m2 weekly. Imprime PGG
      will be dosed weekly at 4 mg/kg. Tumor measurements and determination of tumor responses for
      this study will be performed according to RECIST. Approximately 56 subjects will be enrolled
      at three participating centers (17 into Stage 1 and 39 into Stage 2). Final results will be
      determined from combined Stage 1 and Stage 2 data.
