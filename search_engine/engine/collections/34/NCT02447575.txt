      to deliver medicine for patients suffering from Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease, and are used for dispensing both controller and rescue medications. Despite
      well-known methods to manage Asthma and COPD, nearly 70-90% of the patients do not display
      correct technique in using an inhaler. Poor management and control of the disease due to
      inadequate inhaler usage has resulted in rising rates of hospitalizations, making chronic
      respiratory diseases among the top five causes of death worldwide. Through this study we aim
      to record the technique of MDI usage among Asthma and COPD patient and understand the errors
      in their technique. The various parameters of inhaler usage where patients can make an error
      are 1. Tidal volume, 2. inspiration flow rate, 3. Inspiration flow volume, 4. Timing of
      actuation of inhaler and 5. Breath-holding. The parameters will be recorded by the Cognita R3
      electronic flowmeter for each patient and the errors in each MDI usage will be noted. Using
      ex-vivo modelling, the patient's MDI technique recorded will be used to study the impact of
      errors in technique on efficiency of MDI drug delivery.
