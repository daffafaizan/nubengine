      mucosal prostaglandins (PG) synthesized by COX-1. However, the notion that COX-1 protects the
      stomach and COX-2 induces inflammation may be over-simplistic. In animal studies, COX-2, but
      not COX-1, is expressed in experimental gastric ulcer. Inhibition of COX-2 delays ulcer
      healing, indicating that PG derived from COX-2 contributes to restoring the mucosal barrier
      [1]. Whether this animal observation can be generalized to the human stomach is unknown. To
      date the biological functions of COX-1 and COX-2 in the healing of human gastric ulcer
      healing is unclear. Unlike experimental ulcers that only express COX-2, recently we have
      shown that both COX-1 and COX-2 are up-regulated in human gastric ulcers [2]. Furthermore,
      our preliminary results suggest that inhibition of COX-2 alone may not lead to a clinically
      significant delay in ulcer healing (refer to progress report). These observations suggest
      that peptic ulcer healing is more complex in the human stomach - both COX isoforms may be
      involved in the healing process. Inhibition of COX-2 alone may have less adverse effect than
      non-selective inhibition of both COX isoforms in ulcer healing. The current study aims to
      resolve the functional significance of COX-2 in human gastric ulcer from a biological and
      clinical perspective.
