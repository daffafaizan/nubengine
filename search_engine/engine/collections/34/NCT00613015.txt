      individuals. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the
      effects of either guanfacine (Tenex) or modafinil (Provigil) on stress and cue induced
      craving in cocaine dependent individuals. Cocaine dependence will be assessed in adults (ages
      18-65) as defined by DSM-IV criteria. If the subject signs the consent form, meets the study
      criteria and does not meet the exclusion criteria they will be included in the study.
      Subjects will report to the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at the Medical University
      of South Carolina (MUSC), for an outpatient visit and will receive their first dose of study
      medication. The following day subjects will return to the GCRC and admitted for the duration
      of the study (two days and one night). There will be a one-week and a one-month follow-up
      visit. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (guanfacine or
      placebo). Each subject will also be randomly assigned to either a stress or no-stress
      subgroup. On the test day (day 3) subjects in the stress group will be asked to perform a
      speech and a math problem in front of an audience (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST), while the
      no-stress group will be asked to sit quietly and read. Following these tasks, each subject
      will be exposed to neutral (control) cues and immediately afterwards the subjects will be
      exposed to cocaine cues (cocaine paraphernalia). Craving/mood, physiological activity, and
      endocrine responses, will be assessed at pre-set intervals throughout the testing procedure.
      The cue reactivity protocol will be repeated on the one-week follow-up visit.
