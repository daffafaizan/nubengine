      of muscle mass and remain physically independent, it is utmost important for elderly to
      maintain their body protein mass. A sufficient protein supply according to their needs is
      therefore highly important. Especially for frail elderly, it is not easy to realize an
      increased protein intake by simply eating more. It is hypothesized that protein enriched food
      products that fit in a habitual diet (dairy and bread), result in a higher protein intake
      compared to regular products.
