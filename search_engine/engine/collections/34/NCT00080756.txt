      I. Assess the effects on the breast of treatment with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      agonist (GnRHA)-based regimen in breast cancer (BRCA) gene mutation carriers, including
      correlation of changes in mammographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) densities with
      tissue morphometrics and biomarkers.

      II. Evaluate perspectives about risk reduction options and impact on quality-of-life (QOL)
      measures of participation in the chemopreventive protocol and in risk reduction surgery.

      OUTLINE:

      GROUP 1: Patients receive deslorelin, estradiol, and testosterone intranasally once daily
      (QD) for 6 months. Patients then undergo planned risk reduction mastectomy.

      GROUP 2: Patients receive deslorelin, estradiol, and testosterone intranasally QD for 10
      months. Patients then undergo continued surveillance through 10 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
