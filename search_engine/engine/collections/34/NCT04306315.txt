    
      Brodalumab is an anti-IL-17 receptor antibody and blocks the inflammatory effects of IL-17 in
      the skin. Some psoriasis patients with a higher body weight experienced a lower treatment
      effect of brodalumab in clinical studies. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
      investigate if increasing the dose of brodalumab will increase the effect of treatment for
      patients with a higher body weight. The study will run over 60-62 weeks, including screening,
      treatment period and safety follow-up, with the primary endpoint measurement at Week 40.
      Patients will receive subcutaneous injections of brodalumab at Week 0, 1, and 2, followed by
      injections every 2 weeks. Participants not fulfilling a predefined response at any time after
      Week 16 will receive a dose adjustment to 280 mg brodalumab or 210 mg brodalumab plus placebo
      every 2 weeks.
