      to a dedicated pedal desk and increasing steps/day with wearable monitors. Both components
      are incorporated into an electronically-delivered behavior monitoring and support
      infrastructure, thus enabling continuous management. The investigators will utilize
      pedaldesks manufactured and owned by Pennington Biomedical Research Center to conduct this
      study at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana offices in Baton Rouge, La. 40 individuals will
      be recruited and randomized to either a control arm or combined Walk More Pedal Desk (WMPD)
      intervention. Primary (MRI-determined visceral adipose tissue) and secondary (changes in body
      weight, total adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, blood pressure, blood lipids,
      fasting glucose and insulin, HbA1-c, free-living accelerometer-determined walking, time spent
      in sedentary behavior, exercise, and dietary intake) outcomes will be assessed at baseline
      and month 3.
