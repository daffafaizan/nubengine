      adaptation, physical therapy for airway drainage and supervised inhalation therapy and
      physical activity for at least 3 weeks are asked to participate. Weight, height, body
      composition and pulmonary function will be measured at start and end of the program. Dietary
      intake during the program is calculated based on a 2 day weighed intake diary and physical
      activity will be measured with the "SenseWear pro 3" armband.
