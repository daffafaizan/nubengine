    
      BACKGROUND:

        -  The objective of this study is to evaluate a radiolabeled urea-based small molecule
           inhibitor of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), [18F] DCFPyL (DCFPyL) PET/CT (or
           PET/MRI imaging if available) for detection of metastatic prostate cancer

        -  PSMA is a well characterized histological marker of prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness
           and metastatic potential

        -  Our preliminary first-in-human studies demonstrate high specific uptake of a first
           generation less avid compound, DCFBC, in metastatic prostate cancer and demonstrated
           feasibility for prostate cancer metastatic detection.

        -  We propose to assess the ability of DCFPyL PET to detect metastatic prostate cancer by
           visual qualitative and quantitative SUV analysis. Correlation will be made to sites of
           suspected bony metastatic disease detected by ultra-sensitive but less specific [18F]
           Sodium

      Fluoride (NaF)-PET/CT imaging and all sites of suspected disease detected by [18F]
      Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      - To compare the diagnostic sensitivity of DCFPyL-PET/CT (or PET/MRI imaging if available) to
      NaF-PET/CT for detection of prostate cancer bone metastasis based on comparison to reference
      standard of care conventional imaging modalities (CIM); such as CT

      and whole body bone scintigraphy incorporating prior and follow-up scans and histopathology
      when available.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Histological confirmation of prostate cancer

        -  Radiologic evidence of metastatic bone disease demonstrated on anatomical imaging (CT,
           MRI, or ultrasound), bone scintigraphy, [^18F] Sodium Fluoride (NaF)-PET, and/or [^18F]
           FDG PET

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 2.

        -  Confirmation of prostate cancer with identifiable metastatic disease on at least 1
           clinically indicated imaging modality. If there is only soft tissue metastasis, one
           lesion must measure at least 6 mm or greater.

      DESIGN:

        -  Two Cohort study

             -  Cohort 1: Stable/Decreasing Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA): PSA must be equal to
                or less than 0.5 ng/mL value of the last PSA obtained (at least one month apart).

             -  Cohort 2: Rising PSA: PSA must be greater than 0.5 ng/mL above the last PSA value
                obtained on at least two occasions within 1 year

        -  Patients will undergo DCFPyL PET/CT (or PET/MRI) and NaF-PET/CT FDG

      PET/CT within 21 days of each other. The order obtained does not matter.

        -  The DCFPyL PET/CT (or PET/MRI) will be compared with the NaF-PET/CT and FDG PET/CT and
           standard chest/abdomen/pelvis CT

        -  DCFPyL PET/CT (or PET/MRI) detection of metastatic disease will be assessed by visual
           qualitative assessment as positive, equivocal, or negative. Sites of equivocal or
           positive metastatic disease will have a quantitative PET assessment (SUVmax, SUVmean).

        -  A mandatory research biopsy will be performed under image guidance on a suspicious
           lesion, if feasible.

        -  The patients will be followed by chart review, phone-call, and/or email follow-up for
           PSA relapse and radiologic evidence of metastatic disease over a one-year period from
           the time of imaging.
