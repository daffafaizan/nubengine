    
      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study will assess the efficacy
      and safety of autologous ACPs administered intramuscularly into the lower extremity of
      subjects with CLI who lack surgical or endovascular revascularization options.

      A total of approximately 95 subjects will be randomized to treatment with ACP-01 or placebo
      using a 2:1 randomization scheme, respectively, stratified by site.

      The study will continue until all subjects treated experience the study event (either de novo
      gangrene, doubling of wound size, major amputation, or death) or are event-free for at least
      26 weeks. Subjects treated will be followed for no longer than 52 weeks.

      One futility analysis for potentially stopping study enrollment will be performed.

      Subjects treated at each investigative site will provide written informed consent prior to
      the conduct of any study-related procedures. Thereafter, they will be screened and those
      meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial and undergo all the
      study procedures including intramuscular injection of the investigational medicinal product
      (IMP = ACP-01 or placebo). The IMP will be administered in addition to any conventional
      treatment the subject is receiving.

      The control group will receive placebo injections into the lower extremity to ensure blinding
      of the assessors and the subjects.

      The placebo will consist of the same medium used in the ACP product suspension.

      The study consists of four periods: Screening period, Treatment period, Acute safety
      follow-up and Long term follow-up periods. The total duration of study participation,
      including follow-up, is at least 26 weeks. Subjects will be followed for up to 52 weeks and
      at least until the last subject has completed his/her 26 week visit.
