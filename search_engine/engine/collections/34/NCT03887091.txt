      Common participant misunderstandings include the idea of randomization, benefits to
      participants' health, the proven nature of the study intervention, and failure to recognize
      the primary purpose of the trial. There can sometimes be unintended miscommunication between
      the study doctor and/or nursing staff and participants. Thus, there is a clear need to
      identify ways to improve communication during clinical trials. The investigator's current
      culture of web-based information presentation, whether it takes the form of PowerPoint
      presentations, videos, websites, or audio tools, suggests that adding such technology to the
      cancer research realm may improve a participant's clinical trial experience and possibly
      improve participant understanding and safety while enrolled on a clinical trial. Video and
      web-based tools in cancer research have the potential to transform clinical trial practice.
