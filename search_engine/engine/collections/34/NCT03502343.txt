      pancreatic cancer. In early 2010s, gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) combination regimen
      have been introduced based on the results of randomized phase III clinical trial that showed
      survival benefit than gemcitabine monotherapy. Nab-paclitaxel is a nanoparticle albumin-bound
      paclitaxel that showed anti-tumor activity as well as synergistic effect in combination with
      gemcitabine.

      In the Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial (MPACT), the maximal tolerated
      nab-paclitaxel dose (125 mg/m2) was administrated with 1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine, on days 1,
      8 and 15 for 4 weeks cycle. This combination therapy showed favorable treatment response, but
      notable severe adverse events were also reported. Grade 3 or higher neuropathy and
      neutropenia occurred in 17% and 38% of patients, respectively. Also, dose reduction was
      required in approximately half of the patients.

      Recently, a retrospective study reported the efficacy and safety of modified GnP, which were
      administered biweekly (on days 1 and 15). With 79 patients of metastatic pancreatic cancer,
      this study reported similar efficacy and improved toxicity profile compared with standard
      dose GnP (OS 10 months, PFS 5.4 months, Grade ≥3 Neutropenia 19%, Grade ≥3 sensory neuropathy
      1.6%). Also, several studies reported that dose reduction of nab-paclitaxel in breast or
      pancreatic cancer treatment was not related of decreased survival, or related with prolonged
      survival and increased treatment exposure. However, this finding need to be evaluated in
      prospective clinical trial.

      This phase II trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified GnP, which omit the day
      8 administration of nab-paclitaxel, in metastatic pancreatic cancer.
