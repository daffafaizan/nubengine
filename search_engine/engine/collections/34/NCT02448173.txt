      response to autologous (patient-specific) tumor cells. It is comprised of sterile, live but

      non-dividing tumor cells obtained following standard-of-care surgical tumor resection for

      Stage II colon cancer. Within 35 days following surgery, patients are immunized with

      OncoVAX to prevent disease recurrence, which is incurable and occurs in up to 35% of

      patients. Patients are given three vaccinations once per week for three weeks, followed

      by a booster vaccination after six months. A previously completed Phase III trial

      published in The Lancet showed that OncoVAX cut the risk of recurrence by 61% in

      patients with Stage II colon cancer. The primary endpoint is Disease-Free Survival:

      defined as the time from curative surgery to the objective test confirming tumor

      recurrence or death due to any cause. The secondary endpoints are Overall Survival

      and Recurrence-Free-Interval. An interim analysis will be performed at a significance

      level of 0.005 once 2/3 of anticipated events have occurred, resulting in a significance

      level of 0.0483 at the end of the study. A total of 550 patients is planned, randomized

      1:1 to receive OncoVAXÂ® plus surgery (n=275) or surgery alone (n=275).
