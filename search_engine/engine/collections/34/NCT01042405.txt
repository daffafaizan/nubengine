      every month. Frequency and duration of hospitalizations within the 5-month collection period
      will documented, mortality will be documented as well. Effect of different nutritional
      supplementations or IDPN will be assessed. The MARK nutrition screening will be used for all
      patients at the beginning of every month. Monthly Biochemical data using a blood sample taken
      immediately before dialysis will be used to calculate a value between 0-100 showing patient's
      monthly nutritional status. Data for the SGA will be collected for the same dialysis patients
      randomly selected at the same month. The nutritional state of the patients according to the
      SGA will be assessed by two investigators. A statistical test will be held for agreement
      between observers (Cohen's k concordant coefficient).

      A sub group of 30 patients will provide blood smample to assess a Near Infra Red (NIR) method
      for Cr determination. Application of chemometric approach will serve for constructing a
      fitting curve between tradtional CR measurment with NIR method.
