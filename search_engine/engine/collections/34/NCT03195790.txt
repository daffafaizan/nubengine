      and cost-effectiveness of delivering standard family-based treatment for pediatric
      overweight/obesity in the home setting vs. traditional medical settings. In a randomized
      controlled trial involving low-income households, 266 children ages 6-11 years will be
      allocated to 12 months of family-based treatment delivered either in their home or at an
      urban academic medical center. Both arms will receive the same intervention content and
      dosage, and differ only in the location of in-person treatment sessions. Aim 1 is to test the
      hypothesis that home-based treatment produces a greater reduction in child adiposity,
      reflected in 12-month change in BMI z-score. Aim 2 is to compare the cost-effectiveness of
      home-based treatment to medical center-based treatment, and calculate the added cost of the
      incremental weight loss benefit associated with home visitation. These data will inform
      efforts to disseminate home-based interventions for low-income populations by public health
      agencies and third-party payers. Aim 3 is to explore specific mechanisms through which home
      visitation may improve weight loss outcomes.
