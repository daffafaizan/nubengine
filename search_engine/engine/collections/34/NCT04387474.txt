      it is applied in rehabilitation by stimulating peripheral nerve, such as motor, vibration,
      sensory, in combination with other stimulations, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation,
      transcranial electrical stimulation, etc.

      In traditional rehabilitation therapy, hand-holding training is completed by physical
      therapist. Rehabilitation robot is also used for auxiliary training. BCI therapy will
      stimulate patients to take part in rehabilitation training more actively and obtain better
      effects on the rehabilitation of stroke.
