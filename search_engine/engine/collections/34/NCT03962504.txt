      Guidelines as an evidence-based, recommended PTSD treatment, there are limited data
      supporting the use of WET with Veterans suffering from PTSD. Additional research is needed to
      support the use of WET for the treatment of Veterans diagnosed with PTSD. The goal of this
      study is to investigate whether WET is non-inferior in the treatment of PTSD in a sample of
      Veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Men and women Veterans diagnosed with PTSD will be randomly
      assigned to either WET (n = 75) or Prolonged Exposure (PE; n = 75). PTSD symptom severity
      will serve as the primary outcome. Quality of life will serve as a secondary outcome measure.
      Assessments will be conducted by independent evaluators at baseline, 10-, 20-, and 20-week
      post first treatment session. WET is expected to be non-inferior to PE in reducing PTSD
      symptom severity and functioning. In addition, WET is expected to have significantly lower
      treatment dropout rate relative to the first five sessions of PE (i.e., better treatment
      engagement). If WET is found to be non-inferior to the more time intensive PE treatment then
      the VA will have evidence to support the use of a brief PTSD treatment, which will assist in
      addressing the high demand for PTSD clinical services.
