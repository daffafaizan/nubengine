      of IV administered VX15/2503 in patients with advanced solid tumors. This will be
      accomplished by using a dose escalation procedure starting at low doses of VX15/2503 and will
      continue based on predefined parameters until the maximum tolerated dose is identified.

      The study drug, VX15/2503, is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D;
      CD100) antigen. Semaphorins have been shown to play an important role in certain
      physiological processes such as vascular growth, tumor progression and immune cell
      regulation. Experimental evidence suggests that SEMA4D has two mechanisms of action that
      result in angiogenesis and tumor proliferation and invasion. Antibody neutralization of
      SEMA4D thus may represent a new therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.
