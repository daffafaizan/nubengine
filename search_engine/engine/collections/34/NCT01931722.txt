      older strength-trained (ST) population will be greater than the current recommendation (RDA).
      If so, a greater intake of BCAA together with ST is necessary if one aims to maximize muscle
      protein synthesis (MPS). Currently, the BCAA requirement in the ST older population (55-65 y)
      is unknown. This is critical information especially given the value of ST for overall health.
