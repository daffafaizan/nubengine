    
      This is a multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center), double-blind (neither physician nor
      participant knows the name of the assigned drug), randomized (study drug is assigned by
      chance), active-controlled (paliperidone ER is compared to aripiprazole), parallel-group (a
      medical research study comparing the response in 2 or more groups of participants receiving
      different treatments), flexible-dose (the physician has the freedom to give different doses
      to the participant depending on how they respond to treatment) study designed to determine
      the efficacy and safety of paliperidone ER in symptomatic adolescents (12 to 17 years of age)
      with schizophrenia. The total duration of the study will be approximately 29 weeks. The study
      consists of 3 phases: a Screening phase up to 3 weeks (with a possible overlapping washout
      period), a Double-blind acute phase of 8 weeks, and a Double-blind maintenance phase of 18
      weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (paliperidone ER
      or aripiprazole flexible oral doses). Dosage will be adjusted at the scheduled visits.
      Efficacy of the participants will primarily be evaluated through Positive and Negative
      Syndromes Scale (PANSS). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
