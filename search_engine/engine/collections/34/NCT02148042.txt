      generalization of conditioned fear-potentiated startle paradigm, which has been used
      successfully to measure the sensitivity of fear networks in anxiety disorders, to adults with
      anorexia nervosa. The specific aim will be to examine whether conditioned-fear generalization
      gradients in anorexia nervosa participants differ from those in healthy controls. It is
      hypothesized that anorexia nervosa participants will display stronger generalization as
      indicated by less quadratic generalization gradients (i.e., a more gradual decline in
      conditioned fear as the generalization stimuli deviate from the conditioned fearful stimuli),
      which is indicative of a heightened sensitivity, or lower thresholds of activation, in the
      fear circuit (i.e., less danger information necessary to trigger the fear).
