      numerous poor quality embryos are clinical impractical. To ensure the successful pregnancy
      and to enhance the availability of the poor quality embryos, day-3 poor quality embryos are
      further cultured to different developmental stage and then cryopreserved. The viability of
      these embryos are tested in frozen-thawed transfer.
