    
      Screening of patients following inclusion and exclusion criteria on all units of the
      Department of Critical Care will occur on a daily basis.

      Randomization will be performed by blocks of sealed envelopes containing random numbers which
      are deposited at a central space within the Department of Critical Care Medicine.
      Randomization is performed as permuted block randomization.

      Collection of baseline parameters (last/current lung function test, last/current 6-min walk
      test, cardiac stress test - if accessible) If not accessible, current lung function test
      results (at least FEV1 and FVC) are requested from the patient's general physician or
      pulmonologist to determine GOLD stage.

      Patients randomized into the (early tracheostomy) study group, will undergo tracheostomy at
      the next possible opportunity but not later than 72 h after initiation of invasive
      ventilation. Patients of the control group will be invasively ventilated at least until Day
      10.

      Before tracheostomy a complete endoscopic inspection of the bronchial system will be
      performed routinely. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) will be obtained from sites of
      pulmonary infiltrations. In case of no radiographically or bronchoscopic detectable
      infiltrations BALF will be drawn from the Middle Lobe.

      Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed at given time-points.
