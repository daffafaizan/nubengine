      chronic pain related to their injury and underlying psychosocial factors; this predicts poor
      post-injury recovery.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a neuromodulation technique used to
      stimulate areas of the brain that may modulate symptoms of pain, depression, and
      post-traumatic stress. The FDA-approved rTMS protocol for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) for the treatment of
      depression. This methodology has been very successful in real world situations, however poses
      some limitations, including the duration of the treatment session (approximately 40 minutes
      per treatment session). Recently, researchers have aggressively pursued modifying the
      treatment parameters to reduce treatment times with some preliminary success. This study will
      use modified parameters to create a more rapid form of treatment and look at outcome changes
      in pain and depression, commonly seen in orthopaedic trauma patients.
