      All patients will be implanted and randomized to one of two groups:

        -  a group receiving VNS paired with tones and;

        -  a group that receives VNS and tones, but with different settings.

      After device use training, therapy is delivered at home by the patient for 6 weeks. Patients
      have eight baseline audiometric assessments along with two questionnaire assessments, an
      assessment after recovery before treatment starts, and tinnitus assessments every two weeks
      during therapy through the 6 week randomized portion of the study. After the randomized
      portion, all patients receive VNS paired with tones. Patients will continue to return for
      quarterly visits and tinnitus assessments through the first year after implant, regardless of
      their therapy status. Interested patients can continue to receive longer-term treatment after
      the first year. A goal of up to 30 patients enrolled and implanted across four sites is
      planned for this study.
