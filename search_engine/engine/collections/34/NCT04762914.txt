      cancer pathway and assess its clinical benefits.

      Patients underwent PH (exercise, nutrition and psychological support) before resection of
      colorectal carcinoma in a DGH over fourteen months. Patients were matched by operation, age,
      sex and ASA to non-prehabilitation (NPH) patients using a prospectively maintained database.
      Length of stay (LoS) and complication rate and 90-day readmission rates were compared using
      Wilcoxon and McNemar's methods.

      Prehabilitation significantly improved peak VO2 and AT. This corresponds to a reduction in
      predicted 30-day mortality. Despite a higher Charlson index LoS was unchanged suggesting
      prehabilitation may permit safe resection in comorbid patients.
