      test whether such classifications have a value in the prediction of clinical outcomes and
      patient reported outcome measures. The first aspect of work is to analyse existing radiology
      investigations (plain chest radiography (CXR) and derive classifications of rib fractures
      that, in the retrospective cohort of operated and non-operated cases, could have potential
      value in the guidance of management and prediction of clinical outcomes. The second aspect
      will be to evaluate the feasibility of collection of Patient Reported Outcome Measures in
      patients suffering multiple rib fractures, which will be used to assess the impact of the
      radiological classifications. The indications for surgery will remain according to current
      clinical practice and the management algorithms that have been developed previously in the
      department.
