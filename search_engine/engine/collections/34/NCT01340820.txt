    
      This is a Phase I, randomized, controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study of AERAS-422.
      This study will be conducted in 24 HIV-negative, healthy adults who are BCG-naïve and
      negative for prior exposure to Mtb at enrollment. The study will be conducted at one or more
      clinical research sites in the United States.

      AERAS-422 will be administered on Study Day 0 as a single 0.1 mL intradermal (ID) injection
      containing either >= 10^5 to <10^6 CFU (low-dose) or >=10^6 CFU (high-dose). BCG Tice® will
      be used as an active control for AERAS-422 and will be administered as a single 0.1 mL ID
      injection containing 1-8 x 10^5 CFU on Study Day 0.
