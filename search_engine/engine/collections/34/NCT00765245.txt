      Primary

        -  To assess the 1-year disease-free and relapse-free survival of patients with high- or
           high/intermediate-risk diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with
           maintenance therapy comprising lenalidomide with or without rituximab following standard
           chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the 2-year disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To define the safety and toxicity profile of these regimens.

        -  To perform antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays using peripheral blood
           mononuclear cell samples from these patients.

        -  To assess the change in the number of natural killer cells by flow cytometric analysis.

        -  To evaluate cytokines including, but not limited to, sIL-2R, IL-6, IL-15, IL-12, TNF-α,
           and IFN-γ in these patients.

        -  To study the KIR genotype receptor and FCγR polymorphisms.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive lenalidomide as in arm I and rituximab IV on day 8 of courses
           1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are collected periodically for correlative studies.
      Samples are analyzed for change in the number of natural killer cells by flow cytometry;
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by assay; cytokines; KIR genotype receptor; and FCγR
      polymorphisms.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months
      for 1 year.
