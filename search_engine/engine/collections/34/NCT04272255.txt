      (1.5 mg/72 hours; transdermal scopolamine patch [TDS], the current standard of care for the
      treatment of motion sickness). The study will include 100 subjects per arm, for a total of
      300 subjects (n=300). Multiple ships and ships' crews will be used, until the required
      enrollment is completed. The DPI-386 Nasal Gel and placebo nasal gel arms will be
      double-blinded, whereas the TDS arm will remain unblinded. Both DPI-386 Nasal Gel and placebo
      nasal gel will be administered twice daily over the six consecutive Treatment Days. The two
      daily doses of DPI-386 Nasal Gel or placebo nasal gel will be separated by a minimum of six
      hours ± 15 minutes, and will occur during the subject's on-duty period. The TDS patch will be
      administered on Treatment Days 1 and 4.
