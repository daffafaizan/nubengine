      repetitive high-dose (HD) therapy program using identical, effective drugs at highest
      possible dose and dose intensity with/without addition of rituximab (initially 4 treatment
      arms). In 2004 the first amendment had to be added in order to close two treatment arms
      without rituximab due to recent data revealing a significant advantage for rituximab-treated
      patients with CD20+lymphoma.

      A planned interim analysis in 2010 revealed inferiority of the high-dose treatment thus in
      the 2nd amendment the high-dose arm was closed and additionally the rituximab frequency was
      raised from 6 to 12 administrations as recent publications gave hint for advantage. The last
      amendment was added in 2010 to adjust for delayed recruitment mainly due to organisation
      problems.

      As the high-dose arm was closed only CD20+ B-lymphoma were included past amendment 2.
