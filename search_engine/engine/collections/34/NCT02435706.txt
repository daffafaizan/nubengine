    
      In the test group, the implant will be placed according to standard protocol at a position
      engaging the palatal wall without elevation of a mucoperiosteal flap.

      In the control group, intrasulcular incisions will be carried out from one tooth distal to
      one tooth mesial to the extraction site and full thickness flaps will be elevated with
      periosteal elevator, including the papillae. The implant will be placed according to standard
      protocol at a position engaging the palatal wall, and the flaps will be sutured using a
      combination of interrupted and mattress sutures.

      In both groups, temporary restorations will be delivered immediately after implant placement
      provided that the implant shows primary stability and has engaged in the bone with an
      insertion torque of 25Ncm or more. In case of a lower insertion torque, the protocol will be
      abandoned, a cover screw will be placed, and a two stage implant protocol will be followed.
      All patients will be advised to receive a permanent restoration 6 months after surgery, if
      the implant is deemed to be successful.
