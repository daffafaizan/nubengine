    
      This is a prospective cohort study conducted at the General Hospital of the University of São
      Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP). Male and female participants with SARS-CoV-2 and recently
      admitted to the hospital (≤ 72 hours) will be recruited at the emergency department and
      outpatient clinics at the HCFMUSP. Immediately upon recruitment, participants will perform
      the assessment of flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery and the assessment of carotid
      intima-media thickness. Subsequently, they will be followed during the entire period of
      hospitalization.

      The present study will employ as primary endpoint a composite of ICU admission, intubation or
      mortality during the period of hospitalization. Cardiovascular complications, such as
      arterial (AE), deep venous (DVP) or pulmonary embolism (PE) , acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI), stroke, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation and acute kidney injury will be considered
      secondary endpoints.

      The association between the vascular parameters and clinical outcomes will be examined by a
      multivariate logistic regression.
