    
      This is a 6-month double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of
      pharmacological treatment for acute/subacute back pain (carbidopa/levodopa and celecoxib).The
      dosage of carbidopa/levodopa is 25/100mg.After screening, all eligible patients will be
      randomly assigned to 3 different groups, with each receives a 12-week treatment of
      "carbidopa/levodopa+celecoxib (LDP+CLX)", of "placebo+celecoxib (PLC+CLX)", and of
      "placebo+placebo (PLC+PLC)". For each group, a subsequent 12-week follow-up efficacy
      evaluation will be conducted by telephone .At the end of the 24-week study, we will
      understand the durability of the treatment. During the drug treatment period for pain, all
      participants should return to the clinical follow-up center on week 0, 2, 6 and 12 to assess
      pain condition, properness of treatment and side effects .In the 24-week study of drug
      treatment and after treatment follow-up, pain and safety assessments will be conducted by
      telephone, at week 9, 16, and 20.In addition, all participants will be assessed daily with a
      mobile app for pain, mood and behavior.Participants will be scanned for brain structure
      images (T1), resting functional images (RS-fMRI) and diffusion tensor images (DTI) at the
      second follow-up visit (week 0) and at the end of study (week 24).
