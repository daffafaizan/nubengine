      intraventricular topotecan in children with neoplastic meningitis. Topotecan will be
      administered daily for five consecutive days utilizing the schema shown in the Schema below.
      Concomitant chemotherapy to control systemic disease or bulk CNS disease is allowable
      provided that the systemic chemotherapy is not an investigational agent or one of the
      following: high-dose methotrexate (> 1g/m2), high-dose cytarabine (> 1g/m2), 5-fluorouracil,
      capecitabine, thiotepa, a nitrosourea, or topotecan. The starting dose for this trial was
      derived from pharmacokinetic simulations that utilized data from a prior phase I study of
      intrathecal topotecan. The simulations were performed to estimate the length of time that
      ventricular CSF concentrations of topotecan lactone would remain above an optimal "target
      level" of 1 ng/mL. One of the primary objectives of this study is to estimate the dose of
      intrathecal topotecan that will result in CSF lactone concentrations exceeding 1 ng/mL for at
      least eight hours after an intrathecal injection. Dose escalations for patient cohorts will
      be conducted following the traditional phase 1 design in order to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD will be called pharmacokinetically optimal if that dose
      achieves the targeted PK parameter in at least 23 of 25 patients treated at that dose level.
