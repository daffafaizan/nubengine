    
      The purpose of this double-masked, randomized, controlled, multiple-dose study is to evaluate
      the efficacy, safety, tolerability and systemic exposure of sepofarsen (QR-110) administered
      via intravitreal injection in subjects with Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) due to the
      CEP290 p.Cys998X mutation after 24 months of treatment.

      At study start subjects will be randomized to one of 3 treatment groups with either active
      study drug or sham treatment.

      Sepofarsen (QR-110) will be administered via intravitreal (IVT) injection into the subject's
      treatment eye (the subject's worse eye).

      Subjects in the sham-procedure group will undergo a procedure that will closely mimic the
      active injection.

      After each dosing subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability at follow up visits.

      After the first eye has been treated for at least 12 months, treatment of the contralateral
      eye and cross-over of subjects assigned to sham may be initiated based on assessment of
      benefit/risk (including review of data from all clinical trials), and with concurrence of the
      Medical Monitor.
