      hyperstimulation which may result in significant morbidity and rarely mortality as well as
      significant financial and psychological distress. GnRH agonist trigger has been shown to be
      effective in OHSS prevention. However, the adoption of its use has not been widely accepted
      in view of concerns regarding potential impairment of implantation.

      Intensive luteal phase supplementation with estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P) is important
      due to the strong evidence of abnormal luteal phase serum E2 and P profiles. However, it has
      been shown that optimal conception rates is not achieved for high risk patients with peak
      serum E2 < 4,000 pg/ml despite aggressive steroidal supplementation. It has been proposed
      that the use of adjuvant low dose hCG at the time of GnRH agonist trigger or 35 hours later
      will rescue some of the corpora lutea and help improve corpora lutea function and improve
      pregnancy rates.

      The study will evaluate patients at high risk of OHSS development with peak serum E2 < 4,000
      pg/mL to determine whether timing of low dose hCG administration affects ongoing pregnancy
      rates or risk of OHSS. Markers of corpus luteum function such as serum 17
      hydroxy-progesterone and prorenin during the luteal phase and early pregnancy will help
      elucidate further the effect of adjuvant low dose hCG with GnRH agonist trigger on corpus
      luteum function.
