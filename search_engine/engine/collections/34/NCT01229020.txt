    
      Patients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe COPD by lung function studies and clinical
      evaluation presented in stable clinical condition and were evaluated by lung sound recordings
      and quantitative V/Q lung scintigraphy. Regional signals (percentage of lung sounds) for left
      and right lungs were compared with the corresponding regional count percentages of each
      radionuclide scan, by V/Q scan regions of interest.
