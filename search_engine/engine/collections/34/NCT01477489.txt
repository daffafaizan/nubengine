      the way that cells repair damage, veliparib may be useful in combination with radiation
      treatment because it may help make radiation work better. Veliparib is an oral medication
      that will be taken twice daily during the 6 weeks a patient is receiving radiation therapy.
      The researchers will also be analyzing blood and tissue taken from the skin of patients. The
      skin biopsies will help determine which patients are more sensitive to treatment with
      radiation combined with the study drug. While the blood sample will allow researchers to see
      if the way a person's body processes drugs affects how the patient responds to treatment.
