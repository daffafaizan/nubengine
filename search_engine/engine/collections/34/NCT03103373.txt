    
      The study is a clinical trial, prospective and randomized of 60 patients of both genders,
      aged between 18 and 80 years, underwent major abdominal surgery. This study aims to compare
      plasma lactate levels in patients underwent major abdominal surgery (colectomy, gastrectomy,
      esophagectomy, pancreatectomy, Wertheim Meigs, liver and spleen surgeries) monitored by
      echocardiography or by conventional techniques (mean arterial pressure , Central venous
      pressure).

      The investigators expect to observe a decrease in plasma lactate levels in patients submitted
      to echocardiographic monitoring when compared to patients submitted to conventional
      monitoring. In this way, to demonstrate that the routine use of transthoracic
      echocardiography in patients submitted to large surgery improves the clinical outcomes of
      these patients and presents a lower hospital cost.

      The surgical indication will obey the criteria of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora
      surgery service, after clinical examination and routine preoperative laboratory tests
      (complete blood count, complete coagulogram, plasma sodium, potassium Plasma urea and plasma
      creatinine, blood glucose and liver function test), resting electrocardiogram and chest
      X-ray. All patients who agree to participate in the study will sign an Informed Consent Term
      in the preanesthetic evaluation (Appendix 1).

      Patients will be computer randomly form by the GraphPad PrismaÂ® program into two groups with
      30 patients:

      Conventional Group, Transthoracic Echocardiogram Group, All survey data will be noted in the
      Protocol Data Sheet (Appendix 2). Patients will be anesthetized by the researcher Dr.
      Marcello Fonseca Salgado Filho, who will also be responsible for performing the
      intraoperative TTE examination.
