    
      All patients with primary squamous cell cancer of the vulva > stage Ia who were diagnosed and
      received treatment between 1998 and 2008 at the participating centres will be included in the
      study. Furthermore patients with recurrent disease diagnosed and treated at the participating
      centres during the same time period can be included given that they not only underwent
      surgical excision for treatment.

      For centers with restricted resources for data entry an alternative study collective was
      defined:

      All Patients with primary or relapsed squamous cell vulvar cancer receiving radio- and/or
      chemotherapy for treatment at the participating centres between 1998 and 2008 will be
      included in the study. This also includes node negative patients receiving radio/chemotherapy
      for other reasons.

      The participating centers themselves have to decide which study collective they are
      documenting, dependent on their available resources.
