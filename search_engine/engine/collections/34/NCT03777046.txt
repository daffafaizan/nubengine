      and a survey to screen for postpartum depression to determine if the participant will be
      enrolled. Based on the answers provided, the study team may recommend that the participant
      seek additional medical care, and may notify the participant's doctor, the child's doctor,
      and hospital officials if the study team believes that the participant needs further medical
      care for depression.

      Half of the study participants will receive a social work consult and treatment with
      psychology therapy in the hospital. The psychology therapy will be 2-3 fifty-minute therapy
      sessions while the child is in the hospital. An outpatient psychiatry/psychology follow up
      appointment will be offered if needed as per routine care.

      Discharge Follow Up:

      A discharge follow up questionnaire and survey will be completed on an electronic tablet
      around the time of the baby's discharge home from the hospital or within 1 week of being at
      home. The survey can be completed over the phone or it can be sent via email or text to
      complete the survey online.

      One Month Follow Up:

      A one-time follow up questionnaire and survey will be completed 1 month after discharge from
      the hospital. The survey can be completed in approximately 5 - 10 minutes over the phone or
      it can be sent via email or text to complete the survey online.

      The other half of the study participants will receive social work consult with information
      about follow up options for PPD per current standard of care for mothers identified as having
      postpartum depression in the hospital setting.

      As part of this study a review of the child's medical record, including data collection, will
      be performed.
