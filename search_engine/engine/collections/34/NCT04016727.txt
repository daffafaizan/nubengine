      a 6-mL homologous blood sample that was withdrawn from the donor via venupuncture. One
      milliliter of the blood sample was set apart to determine the concentration of platelets and
      leukocytes in whole blood. The remaining 5 mL was mixed with an anticoagulant (3.8%, 1-mL
      sodium citrate) to prevent clotting. The blood sample was centrifuged at 113 g for 5 minutes
      to separate the plasma containing the platelets from the red cells. The plasma was drawn off
      the top and centrifuged for an additional 2 minutes at 3772 g to separate the platelets.
      Suitable platelet concentrations were achieved by the resuspension of PRP with plasma (high
      platelet concentration, 5 times the concentration in whole blood).
