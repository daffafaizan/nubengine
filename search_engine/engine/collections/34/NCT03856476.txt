      cardiovascular disease will be recorded. Furthermore, anthropometric and clinical
      characteristics will be noted and lipid measurements will be obtained at recruitment after a
      fasting period.

      The investigators will test in children the flow-mediated dilation (FMD) which assesses the
      vasodilation due to the production of nitric oxide from the endothelium in response to
      occlusion-induced hyperaemia of the branchial artery and the carotid intima-media thickness
      (cIMT). These non-invasive ultrasound indices detect early vascular damage.

      Renal function will be assessed in children with dyslipidemia by a new marker in serum,
      cystatin C, which is more accurate and reliable than creatinine. Also, creatinine serum
      levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be evaluated. Additionally, total
      protein, albumin, electrolyte and Î²2-microglobulin excretion in urine will be measured.
