    
      This is a two part, randomized, blinded, vehicle-controlled study to determine a safe and
      tolerable dose of ASN008 TG. Part A will asses a single ascending dose of ASN008 TG in
      cohorts of healthy volunteers, while Part B will assess multiple ascending doses of TG, to be
      determined (TBD) based on Part A safety and tolerability, in patients with mild-to-moderate
      dermatitis. Results from Part A and B will characterize safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics. Part B patients will be assessed for changes in pruritus based on a
      numerical rating scale (NRS) of pruritus at baseline and on Day 15.
