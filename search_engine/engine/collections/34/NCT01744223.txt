      infused after partially mismatched, related (haploidentical), T cell-depleted HSCT. The
      purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether BPX-501 infusion can facilitate
      engraftment, enhance immune reconstitution and potentially improve the graft versus leukemia
      (GVL) effect, with the potential for reducing the severity and duration of severe acute graft
      versus host disease (GvHD). The trial will evaluate the treatment of GvHD by the infusion of
      dimerizer drug (Rimiducid) in those subjects who present with GvHD that does not adequately
      respond to standard of care therapy.
