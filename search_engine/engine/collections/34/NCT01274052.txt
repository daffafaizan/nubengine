      At the experimental days we performed a mealtest and drew blood for analyses of glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), insulin, C-peptide and
      glucagon.

      The researchers aimed to investigate whether women with gestational diabetes mellitus exhibit
      decreased postprandial GLP-1 responses, and if so, whether this deficiency ceases following
      delivery when normal glucose tolerance is reestablished.
