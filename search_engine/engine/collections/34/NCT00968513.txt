      tobacco cessation treatments of varying intensities initiated in the acute psychiatric
      inpatient setting. The three groups are:

        1. Usual Care (N=150) consisting of brief cessation advice, a quit smoking guide, and
           nicotine replacement provided during hospitalization;

        2. Brief Treatment (N=475) adds a stage-based manual, computer-delivered stage-tailored
           individualized feedback and brief cessation counseling sessions during hospitalization
           and repeated at months 3 and 6, and access to 12 weeks of nicotine replacement following
           hospitalization;

        3. Extended Treatment (N=475) builds upon our current brief treatment and provides 12
           additional weeks of nicotine replacement (24 weeks total) with individualized,
           counselor-delivered motivational and manualized cognitive behavioral cessation
           treatment.

      This study seeks to determine: (i) whether the initial successes seen in an academic-based
      psychiatric hospital can be replicated in a larger and more diverse patient population; and
      (ii) if more extended and intensive treatment combining nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
      with individualized, counselor-delivered motivational and manualized cessation-focused
      cognitive behavioral counseling (CBT) can outperform our current best practices. Ultimately,
      this research could lead to a model smoking cessation intervention for smokers with severe
      mental illness and, more generally, may provide a useful model for understanding the nature
      and complexity of intervening on comorbidities.

      We hypothesize that the extended treatment will outperform the brief treatment, and that both
      treatment groups will be more effective than usual care in producing quit attempts and
      ultimately abstinence from cigarettes. Secondary specific aims will model the
      cost-effectiveness and budgetary impacts of the treatment conditions; examine moderators and
      mediators of treatment outcomes; and prospectively examine the relation between changes in
      smoking, mental health functioning, and use of other substances over time.
