    
      This is a multi-center non-interventional retrospective study that will use data obtained
      from clinical routine. In the hospital, subjects with or without respiratory complaints
      undergo subset of (or complete) pulmonary function tests if clinically indicated. Results of
      these tests, expressed as numerical values are send to the clinical workstation (KWS) for
      immediate clinical use. These results are subsequently being interpreted by a clinician.

      A random sample of 50 lung function printouts of subjects followed at the Leuven pulmonary
      service with a final diagnosis of a respiratory disease have been randomised. These
      anonymized printouts will be given to different pulmonologists for examination in 18
      different centers and compared with the interpretation of in-house developed software.
