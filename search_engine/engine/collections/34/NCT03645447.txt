      shared by the tongue and the brain. (Heath, T.P., Melichar, J.M., Nutt, D.J., Donaldson L.F.
      (2006) Human taste thresholds are modulated by serotonin and noradrenaline). The aim of this
      study is to investigate the use of a taste test in the diagnosis of depression and to predict
      drug effectiveness.

      A device is being developed to automate the taste test with different concentrations of salt,
      sweet, bitter and sour solutions. A test is carried out before and after ingesting a probe
      drug (first prescribed antidepressant) to assess change in taste. Standard validated
      questionnaires are used to assess mood on the day the first antidepressant is ingested and
      one month later.

      The first 30 participants will have taste tests conducted out not only via the device
      described above, but also via a paper flow chart which similarly determines the order in
      which taste solutions are presented to the participant to determine taste acuity.

      The study is a single centre, open label study using the patient's prescribed antidepressant
      as a probe with the primary objective of replicating previous results obtained, without the
      use of a device, and using paroxetine. The study is powered to test 240 patients with the
      provision built in to the protocol for an interim analysis after 120 patients have been
      tested. This will lead to the generation of a robust diagnostic algorithm.

      Patients will be followed up for repeat taste testing after 28 days (Â±7 days) of usual
      clinical care, and follow up questionnaires will be completed at that visit. Patients will be
      asked to complete a feedback questionnaire about their user experience and satisfaction with
      treatment alone.
