      day will not exceed 1.5 mL (1/3 tsp) per pound of body weight. All samples will be collected
      at the same time as routine blood draws as ordered by your physician.

      Subject samples will be de-identified by the Principal Investigator (PI) and given a serial
      number. The PI will retain a secured log of the serial numbers and basic identifiers (name,
      Date of Birth (DOB0, sex, preliminary diagnosis, and test results), and the subject samples
      will be stored in a secured freezer. Only the PI will have access to the secured log book.
      All study test results will be kept on compact discs, or similar computer storage devices, in
      a secured area that will only be accessible by the PI. Study test results will not kept on
      computers accessible by other individuals. The samples will not be sold to any third party.
      The results of this research will not be conveyed to any third party. If the subject
      withdraws or is withdrawn from the study all identifiable biological samples from that
      subject will be discarded. The sample will not be available for any other type of testing
      outside of this study.
