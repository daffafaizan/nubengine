    
      SJGD2 is a Phase I dose finding study. The primary purpose of this phase I study is to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity of the humanized
      monoclonal anti-GD2 antibody, hu14.18K322A, in research participants with refractory or
      relapsed neuroblastoma or melanoma (Parts A and B) or osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma (Part C).

      Initially, in Part A, one research participant will be treated at the lowest dose level of
      hu14.18K322A antibody [2 mg/m^2 daily for 4 consecutive days every 28 days (1 course)], and
      if no toxicity is observed then the next participant will be treated at the next dose level.
      This is continued until the first instance of biological activity (in the form of grade 2
      side effects) is observed and from that point on a traditional phase I study design will be
      followed. A maximum of 4 courses may be given.

      Part B: Hu14.18K322A antibody will be administered intravenously (IV) at a starting dose of
      50 mg/m^2/dose weekly for 4 doses per course. One course is considered 28 days. A maximum of
      8 courses may be given.

      Part C: Hu14.18K322A antibody will be administered to 6 patients each with
      refractory/recurrent osteosarcoma at a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 60 mg/m^2 daily for 4
      consecutive days every 28 days (Part C1). A cohort of patients with refractory/recurrent
      osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma will also be administered hu14.18K322A antibody at starting
      dose of 40 mg/m^2/dose weekly for 4 doses per course (Part C2). Participants will continue on
      treatment for a maximum of 8 courses.

      Secondary objectives include:

        1. Estimate the response rate, within the confines of a phase I study, to the humanized
           anti-GD2 antibody, hu14.18K322A.

        2. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of hu14.18K322A.

        3. Examine whether or not human anti-human antibodies (HAHA) develop in participants
           receiving hu14.18K322A.

        4. Assess the tolerability of the hu14.18K322A at the MTD of the daily x4 and the weekly
           dosing in patients with refractory or recurrent osteosarcoma.
