      exposure to address body image and anxiety, as well as food exposure to address avoidant
      eating behavior. In food exposure therapy, individuals are exposed to feared foods in a
      clinical and/or non-clinical setting. Food exposure therapy has been effective in alleviating
      some anxiety in individuals with eating disorder behaviors and symptoms. However, the
      investigators do not yet know what characteristics predict response in food exposure therapy.
      The purpose of this study is to use EMA data and physiological data to asses a client's
      eating disorder symptoms and behaviors before and after a meal with a feared food.

      Lastly, the study would like to utilize individuals who do not meet criteria for an eating
      disorder (ED) and will act as controls in this study to address the research question: is
      there a difference between individuals with EDs and without EDs as they complete the entirety
      of the study, specifically in regards to physiological data? These controls will not complete
      the EMA data aspect of the study.

      The investigators are conducting a pilot clinical measurement study. Participants will be
      screened for eating disorder symptoms via a structured clinical interview or determined to
      not have eating disorder symptoms and will act as controls in the study. Both groups will
      also complete self-reported measures of eating disorder symptoms and anxiety. Participants
      will also complete assessments on their phone and will wear a sensor band to assess heart
      rate and galvanic skin response. However, control participants will not complete assessments
      on their phone. Both groups will wear the health-sensor band to assess heart rate and
      galvanic skin response.
