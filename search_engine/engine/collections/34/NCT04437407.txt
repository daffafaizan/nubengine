      on their backs at night in the home setting in the third trimester of pregnancy will be
      evaluated via a consecutive, six-night, in-home, controlled, cross-over sleep study in third
      trimester pregnant women where the Ajuvia Sleep Monitor is validated against infrared video
      on the first night.

      Six nights: the first night is a control night with infrared video recording where only the
      Ajuvia is worn in passive mode to collect data on the participant's body position and is
      followed by five nights with the five different prototypes.

      Randomization: The order in which the different devices will be worn on the second night
      through fourth night, inclusive, will be determined by simple randomization. This will
      minimize the potential impact of changes to sleep across the nights resulting from
      familiarization with the equipment as the sleep tests proceed through the five non-control
      nights, which could bias the results. For logistical reasons, the sixth night is
      non-randomized and will include the Ajuvia in 'active' mode Cross-over: After the first
      night, on each of the subsequent four nights, the participants will "cross over" to a
      different PB2 device (depending on their randomization order) and "cross over" to the Ajuvia
      in 'active' mode on the sixth night to allow each participant to act as her own control for
      comparison of treatment effect on outcomes.

      In home: conducting this study in the home setting will allow for a more accurate
      representation of sleep patterns as the participants will be in the comfort of their own bed.

      Sleep test: The maternal pelvis position will be recorded while the participants are sleeping
      using the Ajuvia device. Going to bed- and wake-times, as well as experience with each device
      will be recorded daily in a sleep diary.
