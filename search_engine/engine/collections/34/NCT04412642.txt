      urological procedures. Ideally these procedures may be done in the cystoscopy suite without a
      general anesthetic. Low dose methoxyflurane, (MEOF)is a inhaled, self-administered non-opioid
      analgesic and has been approved by Health Canada's for the short-term relief of moderate to
      severe acute pain, associated with trauma or international medical procedures, in conscious
      adult patients. The brand name is PENTHROX.

      This study is a single centre, pilot study to assess the feasibility of using a
      self-administrated, MEOF for pain relief during minor out-patient urological procedures.
      Eligible participants will receive a one time dose of the the study medication during a
      planned, outpatient urological procedure done under cystoscopy in the Cystoscopy clinic
