      diagnosed with urothelial cancer and candidates to undergo radical cystectomy or
      nephroureterectomy.

      At the baseline visit, a blood sample will be obtained for 25OH-VitD analysis and all
      subjects will receive first dose of 10.000 IU Vitamin D. Depending of basal plasmatic Vitamin
      D value, patients will be stratified in either 10.000 IU treatment (25OH-VitD â‰¥ 20 ng/ml) or
      either 50.000 UI treatment dose (25OH-VitD < 20 ng/ml). Treatment will consist of 4 doses
      taken weekly before their scheduled cystectomy. Last study follow-up visit will be 4 weeks
      post-surgery. Urothelial tumor tissue collected on surgery will be used to evaluate the
      expression of tumor differentiation and Vitamin D markers, using genomics and proteomics
      approaches. Blood sample will also be collect throughout the study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of Vitamin D in plasma and the expression of Vitamin D target genes in
      peripheral blood leukocytes.
