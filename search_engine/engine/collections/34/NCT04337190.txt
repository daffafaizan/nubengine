      that may, in the more severe cases, lead the patients to the intensive care unit (ICU). The
      more frequent presentation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

      To penetrate cells, SARS-CoV2 uses Angioconvertase type 2 (ACE2) as a cellular entry
      receptor.

      ACE2 belong to the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (SRAA), and ACE2 levels are directly
      modified when SRAA inhibitors are administred to patients, and ACE2 level increases
      particularely with Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARA2) use.

      The aim of our study is to determine ACE2 level and activity in patients with SARSCoV2
      infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

      COVID ARA2 is a propsective cohort of patient with blood sampling at the day of admission,
      day 3 and day 7.
