      sweetener, with more sweetness than sucrose, without any adverse effects. It also
      demonstrates multiple benefits like anti-plaque effect, anti-diabetic effect,
      anti-periodontophatics properties, anti-hypertensive properties, anti-cariogenic properties
      etc. There are many studies conducted on stevia in humans, which justifies my study.
