      participants receiving an islet-alone transplant along with alemtuzumab induction therapy
      followed by combination tacrolimus and MMF maintenance immunosuppression. Participants will
      receive 1 to 3 infusions of pancreatic islets of sufficient quantity to attain insulin
      independence.

      The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the safety of a treatment regimen
      utilizing alemtuzumab induction and a combination of tacrolimus and MMF maintenance
      immunosuppression in adult Type 1 diabetic participants receiving their first islet
      transplant.
