      18-49 years of age, if there is a preference trend for a particular route of administration,
      ID vs IM, when receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine. Uptake of influenza vaccine is
      disappointingly low in this age group, and there is the perception that aversion to IM
      injection plays a role in vaccination avoidance. The BD Micro-Injection System to be used in
      this study may offer a more acceptable alternative to the standard IM injection for influenza
      immunization and thereby promote wider acceptance of influenza vaccination.
