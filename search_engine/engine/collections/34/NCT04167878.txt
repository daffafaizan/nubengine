      non-inferior to poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) cage in single-level ACDF with the use of
      local autologous bone. 3D printed biodegradable cervical interbody fusion cage is a
      restorable cervical interbody cage for the treatment of fusion, following discectomy, of the
      cervical spine from C2/C4 disc space to the C7/T1 disc space. The material used to prepare
      the implant is a mixture of polycaprolactone (PCL) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP), which is
      called PCL-TCP. The implant has proper strength and connective porosity. The PCL-TCP cage is
      intended to be used with a supplemental fixation system.
