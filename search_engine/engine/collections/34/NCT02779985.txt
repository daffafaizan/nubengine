      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a single dose of L.
      Barbarum on postprandial energy expenditure. Secondary objectives are to investigate the
      effect of a single dose of L. Barbarum on postprandial lipid and carbohydrate oxidation and
      metabolic flexibility, on postprandial lipid and glucose metabolism and on inflammatory
      markers.

      Study design:

      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial with two test days
      separated by a washout period of at least 1 week.

      Study population:

      The study population will consist of 20 apparently healthy overweight (BMI between 25 and 30
      kg/m2) men aged 18-65 years.

      Intervention:

      All subjects will receive a mixed meal including 25 grams of dried L. Barbarum as the
      intervention product and a matched mixed meal without L. Barbarum as the placebo product. The
      meals will be matched for energy content and macronutrient composition.
