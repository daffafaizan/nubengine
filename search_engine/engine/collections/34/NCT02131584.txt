      I. To estimate the reduction in fatigue as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) of
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who do not require anti-neoplastic therapy
      according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008
      recommendations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the reduction in other symptoms using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory
      (MDASI) and to assess disease burden and response by the IWCLL 2008 response criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (approximately 12 hours
      apart) for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
