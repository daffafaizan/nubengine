      bioactivity. In this study investigators are collecting serum (and if possible, urine)
      samples from different cohorts of patients, before and/or after treatment.

      The aim is to measure androgens, estrogens and SHBG as well as in vitro bioactivity with
      newly developed cell-based bioassays, and to compare different techniques to each other as
      well as to clinical endpoints available in the patient's Electronic Health Record.
