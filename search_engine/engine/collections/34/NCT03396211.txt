    
      Primary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apatinib with nivolumab in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic cancer

        -  To assess efficacy by objective response rate (ORR), best overall response (BOR), time
           to response (TTR), and duration of response (DoR) per RECIST v1.1 and/or iRECIST

        -  To assess disease control rate (DCR), and duration of disease control (DDC) by RECIST
           v1.1, and/or iRECIST

      Secondary objectives:

      â€¢ To evaluate the efficacy of apatinib with nivolumab in patients with unresectable or
      metastatic cancer as measured by:

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  Event-free survival (EFS)

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  Tumor mutational burden and mutations at baseline and at the time of progression

        -  Changes in serum cytokines pursuant to treatment response

        -  Changes in PBMC subsets and MDSC populations as determined by flow cytometry
