      will be utilized to obtain continuous blood pressure (BP) readings throughout the surgical
      procedure or intensive care unit. This will allow us to compare BP readings between the
      non-invasive ViTrack device and the standard of care invasive intra-arterial catheters
      readings. Data collection from both the ViTrack and arterial catheter occur in the opposite
      wrists.
