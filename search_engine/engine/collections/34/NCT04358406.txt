    
      Efficacy and safety of IV rhu-pGSN on top of SOC will be evaluated initially in 60
      participants representative of the drug target population: high-risk subjects with acute
      severe pneumonia due to COVID-19. The rhu-pGSN dose will be based on actual body weight given
      at 12 mg/kg. Three doses will be given at 0, 12 and 24 hours intervals promptly after
      enrollment by IV infusion through a 0.2 Âµm filter. Participants will be randomized 1:1
      rhu-pGSN or placebo. Interim safety analyses will be conducted after enrollment of 12, 24,
      36, and 48 patients.

      The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of patients surviving on Day 14 without
      mechanical ventilation, vasopressors or dialysis. Secondary efficacy outcomes will include:
      daily change in 9-point WHO severity score through at least Day 14; all-cause mortality at
      Days 28 and 90; time to death (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis); proportion of subjects alive
      on Days 7, 28, 60, and 90 without: ongoing use of vasopressors, ongoing intubation/mechanical
      ventilation, ongoing residence in an intensive care unit (ICU), new ongoing need for
      dialysis/renal replacement therapy; proportion of subjects discharged to home or immediate
      prior residence by Day 28; days on the ventilator; length of stay in hospital and in ICU and
      re-admission to an acute-care hospital up to Day 90. Safety of administration of rhu-pGSN at
      the indicated dosage will also be evaluated.

      Baseline and sequential levels of pGSN and inflammatory biomarkers will be measured. On days
      1, 28, and 90, immunogenicity due to the formation of anti-pGSN antibodies will be assessed.
