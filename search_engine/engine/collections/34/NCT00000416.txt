      whether vocational rehabilitation (VR) provided to employed people with rheumatic disorders
      will improve their ability to remain employed. VR is applied primarily to people who have
      already lost their jobs. However, using job retention VR services may prevent, or delay, the
      onset of employment work loss among people with rheumatic disorders. Job retention VR
      services target important employment-loss risk factors. They do so by modifying jobs to
      reduce barriers posed by functional limitations and symptoms, promoting future career
      planning, and establishing an alliance with a VR counselor for ongoing assistance.

      The study is a randomized, controlled trial conducted among patients with rheumatic disorders
      recruited from the practices of rheumatologists in eastern Massachusetts.

      We will randomly assign 120 study participants to receive job-retention services provided by
      VR counselors and 120 participants (controls) to receive literature about employment-related
      resources. We will assess intermediate outcome variables (self-efficacy, work limitations,
      and job accommodation-seeking behaviors) and the endpoint outcome variable, work instability
      (a measure that includes employment loss), immediately prior to the interventions and at
      6-month intervals over a 24-month period after the interventions are carried out. We will
      compare the outcomes of the two groups to evaluate the usefulness of job retention services
      in forestalling work instability in this population.
