      following the baby's and mother's heart rates and uterine contractions during labor. We want
      to find out if the new monitor works as well as other types of monitors that are usually
      used: Doppler Fetal Heart Rate (FHR), Scalp FHR, Tocodynamometer (TOCO) and Intra Uterine
      Pressure Catheter (IUPC).

      80 patients will be monitored during the study.
