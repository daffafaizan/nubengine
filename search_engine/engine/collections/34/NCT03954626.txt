      IVT injection of brolucizumab 6 mg in patients with nAMD. Triplicate 12-lead ECG recording
      was performed at screening to determine eligibility. A second triplicate 12-lead ECG
      recording was collected approximately 2h prior to the brolucizumab IVT injection on Day 1.
      Holter ECG recording started approximately 1 h prior to the brolucizumab IVT injection and
      ended approximately 48h after the IVT injection. A third triplicate 12-lead ECG recording was
      performed after the conclusion of Holter monitoring on Day 3.
