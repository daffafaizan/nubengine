      control group, a group asked to attend to everyday memory performance, and a group asked to
      notice variability in their everyday memory performance. The researchers hypothesize that the
      experimental groups will improve on memory outcomes more than those in the control group as a
      result of participation. The researchers hypothesize that when older adults are trained over
      6 days to notice variability in memory ability the participants will report having more
      control over memory abilities then will the participants in the other two groups. The
      researchers also expect that the participants will show more improvement on a memory task
      than the participants in the other groups.

      The researchers will take measurements of memory efficacy beliefs and memory performance at 2
      timepoints (T0=baseline, T1= immediately after the 6 days of text messages). All surveys will
      be collected online via the Qualtrics.com platform.
