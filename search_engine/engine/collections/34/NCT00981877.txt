      producing a high number of admissions yearly. In children below one year of age, rotavirus
      represents the main etiologic agent, both in developed and developing countries. In Bolivia,
      acute diarrhea affects about 30% of the group below 5 years of age. Probiotics appear as one
      of the alternatives currently under discussion. Also, evidence available suggests that
      probiotics shorten the time of diarrhea and therefore the time of rotavirus excretion. In
      daily practice, we are often limited by the type and number of probiotics products locally
      available; moreover, information about combined products is scarce. With this in mind, in
      this study we compared the efficacy of two commercially available products.
