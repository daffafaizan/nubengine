      - Disease-free survival measured as a 5-year rate in patients with localized osteosarcoma
      treated, according to standard practice, with all the drugs currently registered for the
      treatment of non-metastatic osteosarcoma (methotrexate, cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide,
      MTP-PE), according to ABCB1 / P-glycoprotein expression.

      The Secondary objectives are:

        -  Evaluate overall survival in a homogeneous population of patients with non-metastatic
           osteosarcoma.

        -  Disease-free survival at 2 and 3 years.
