      global lung function. But to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications induced by
      mechanical ventilation a better monitoring of intraoperative lung function seems to be
      crucial, that provides more regional information of lung collapse or over distention.

      By application of small currents via electrodes around the thorax and measuring of the
      resultant resistance the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can determine the level of
      aeration of the lung in a cross sectional plane. The EIT device used in this study calculates
      the percentage of the investigated lung area that can be defined as over distended or
      collapsed respectively. In these sections the change of resistance within a respiration cycle
      is reduced compared to well ventilated areas are therefore called silent spaces. Silent
      spaces located ventral are termed non-dependent (NSS) and silent spaces located dorsal are
      termed dependent (DSS). Based on this information the clinician is able to set the respirator
      in a more lung protective manor.

      To better understand the influence of positive endexspiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal
      volume (Vt) on reginal lung function we are going to carry out the presented study.

      40 patients undergoing robot assisted prostatectomy should be enrolled in a study that
      consists of two phases. In the first phase 20 patients are ventilated with constant PEEP
      (10mbar) and in ten patients each the Vt is set to 5 or 12ml/kg ideal body weight. In the
      second phase in further 20 patients the Vt is set to 8ml/ kg ideal bodyweight and the PEEP is
      3 or 12mbar in one half of the patients. Under the different ventilation settings the NSS and
      DSS, the oxygenation index and lung compliance will be investigated.
