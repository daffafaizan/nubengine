      States. This problem is alarmingly higher in southern state, including Georgia. Sleep, a
      modifiable health behavior, may be a target for reducing the burden of diabetes. This
      research study will enroll adults from the community to participate in a mindfulness-based
      stress reduction program (MBSR) via an app on his/her cellular phone. Participants will also
      wear a wrist monitor to estimate activity and sleep as well as provide a blood sample before
      and after the MBSR. Following the 6-week intervention program, participants will provide
      information via focus groups to obtain feedback on his/her experiences during the program.

      This pilot study will enroll (N=20) racially diverse men and women who are 18 years and older
      and reside in Atlanta. Participants will be recruited from the community via advertisements,
      community events and existing community partnerships. Trained research assistants will screen
      potential participants. Eligible participants will be contacted via phone and scheduled to
      attend a baseline visit to collect a blood sample and attend a sleep education session.
