    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with the maximum REOLYSIN (wild-type
      reovirus) dose limited to 4.5 x 10^10 tissue culture infection dose (TCID)50 and the safety
      profile of REOLYSIN in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). (Phase 1b) II. To further explore the safety
      and tolerability of the combination and to determine the overall response rate (ORR)
      (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) to REOLYSIN in combination with bortezomib
      and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. (Phase 1b Dose Expansion)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine ORR in the Phase 1b part to the combination at escalating doses.

      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with relapsed or refractory
      MM treated with REOLYSIN in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone.

      III. To evaluate the effect of REOLYSIN in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone
      treatments on overall survival (OS).

      IV. To conduct pharmacodynamic studies as described.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of wild-type reovirus followed by a phase
      Ib expansion trial.

      Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO), intravenously (IV), or intramuscularly (IM) and
      bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) (preferably) or IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Patients also receive wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3
      months thereafter.
