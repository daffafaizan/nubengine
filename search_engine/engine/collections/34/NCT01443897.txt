      mushrooms daily for six weeks (7 days per week). With the meal, they will also need to take
      one capsule. The capsule will be either a placebo or will contain vitamin D. The purpose of
      the vitamin D in the capsule is to determine if the vitamin D from the mushrooms is absorbed
      as well as vitamin D from a capsule. The total dose of vitamin D that volunteers will receive
      each day from mushrooms and capsule together will always be the same and will be one of three
      doses: (1) little or no vitamin D (placebo); (2) 400 IU, which is near the current
      recommended intake and (3) 1,000 IU, which is up to five-fold higher than the current
      recommended intake, depending on your age. Both levels of vitamin D are safe. In addition to
      consuming the meals and taking the capsules, up to 20 mL (4 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn
      at three times during the study just before the mushroom-containing lunch is provided: (1) at
      the beginning of the study before the first meal; (3) after three weeks; (3) at the end of
      the study. The purpose of the blood draw is to measure vitamin D in your blood and to measure
      the level of activation of your immune system by measuring markers of immune activation.
