      admission to the ICU. Despite the clear benefits of mechanical ventilation, it may be
      detrimental to the patient if poorly carried out. This has led to a renewed impetus in
      employing lung protective ventilation strategies, Ventilator Associated Events (VAE)
      prevention strategies, and safe and appropriate weaning methods to reduce mortality among
      mechanically ventilated patients. However, there is paucity of data regarding these practices
      in low-income settings.

      Objective: To describe the mechanical ventilation practices, mortality rate and associated
      factors among mechanically ventilated patients in Uganda's intensive care units.

      Methodology: A prospective cohort study carried out in four ICUs in Uganda. All patients, 18
      years and above initiated on mechanical ventilation will be recruited. Patients' data will be
      collected from the files and charts at initiation of mechanical ventilation. Patients will
      then be followed up for death / discharge within 28 days in ICU.

      Data analysis: The primary outcome is all-cause mortality during ICU stay. Data will be
      summarised into means and standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges and presented
      in tables, charts, cross-tabulations and graphs. Univariate and multivariate logistic
      regression will be used to determine factors associated with mortality.

      Utility of results: The results from this study will be disseminated to the Ministry of
      Health and Makerere University in order to plan, standardise and form guidelines regarding
      mechanical ventilation practices in ICUs in Uganda.
