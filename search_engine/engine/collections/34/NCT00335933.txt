    
      The primary study objective is to assess the relative efficacy of G-ER dosed once daily (1800
      mg following the evening meal) or twice daily (600 mg AM/1200 mg PM), versus placebo in
      reducing the mean daily pain score from the baseline week to the end of the efficacy
      treatment period (Treatment Week 10) in patients with PHN.

      Secondary efficacy measures will include changes from baseline in mean weekly sleep
      interference scores, Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), the Neuropathic Pain
      Scale (NPS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and
      Investigator-Rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC).
