        -  Compare the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with newly
           diagnosed follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
           vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) with or without either rituximab or iodine I 131
           tositumomab (monoclonal antibody anti-B1). (CHOP chemotherapy alone arm closed to
           accrual as of 12/15/02)

        -  Compare the response rate of these patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the molecular remission rates of this patient population treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine the incidence and time to development of human anti-mouse antibody positivity.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      whether microglobulin is greater than upper limit of normal (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. (Arm I closed to accrual as of 12/15/02)

        -  Arm I (CHOP only): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 15 minutes, doxorubicin IV
           over 5-20 minutes, and vincristine IV over 5-15 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive
           oral prednisone daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 21 days for up to 6 courses
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (Arm I closed to accrual
           as of 12/15/02)

        -  Arm II (CHOP + rituximab): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 15 minutes,
           doxorubicin IV over 5-20 minutes, and vincristine IV over 5-15 minutes on days 8, 29,
           50, 71, 92, and 113. Patients also receive oral prednisone daily on days 8-12, 29-33,
           50-54, 71-75, and 113-117 and rituximab IV over 4-6 hours on days 1, 6, 48, 90, 134, and
           141.

        -  Arm III (CHOP + tositumomab): Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I and tositumomab
           (monoclonal antibody anti-B1) IV over 1 hour followed by iodine I 131 tositumomab IV
           over 20 minutes on days 134 and 141.

      Patients are followed on day 200, at 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 500 patients (250 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 5.5 years. (Arm I closed to accrual as of 12/15/02)
