      allergies it tends to be more persistent and also its prevalence seems to be rising.
      Currently there is no proven treatment other than strict avoidance. We are attempting to
      decrease the risk of anaphylaxis on accidental ingestion by desensitizing subjects to peanut
      using peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). We are also studying the effect of viral infections on
      the immune system in children receiving peanut OIT.

      Children ages three to sixteen years of age with peanut allergy will be given peanut OIT.
      Twenty-five subjects will also be recruited as controls. These subjects will not receive any
      peanut or placebo but only have skin prick testing and lab work in addition to a history and
      physical exam. Active subjects will undergo a double-blind food challenge at entry to verify
      that they are allergic to peanuts. If allergic, they will then have modified rush
      immunotherapy on the first day and then increase the doses at least every two weeks up to a
      maintenance dose of 4 grams (equivalent to about 13 peanuts). Doses will be taken daily at
      home except for dose increases which will be done at Children's Medical Center. Outcome
      variables of interest include response to double-blind placebo controlled food challenge,
      skin prick testing, peanut specific IgE, and adverse events. These results will be compared
      between the start and end of peanut OIT using appropriate statistical analysis.
