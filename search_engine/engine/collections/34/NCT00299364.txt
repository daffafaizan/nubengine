      with tibolone in menopausal symptoms treatment. The randomized, double-blind, controlled
      3-month study in 5 centres of 3 cities in China enrolled 244 menopausal patients aged 40 - 60
      years and with a Kupperman Menopause Index (KMI) equal or more than 15. The participants were
      assigned to either iCR corresponding to 40 mg crude drug/day (n=122) or tibolone 2,5 mg/day
      (n=122) orally. The primary endpoint is the combination of the Mann-Whitney values (MWV) of
      the KMI and the frequency of adverse events (benefit-risk balance) at end of treatment.
