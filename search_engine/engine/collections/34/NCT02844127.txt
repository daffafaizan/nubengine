      to undergo implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).

      There are two locations in the heart in which ICDs are normally implanted: the apex and the
      septum. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the ICD performs better in one
      location or the other, as measured by defibrillation threshold. In this study, both locations
      will be tested in each patient. The final location will be determined by the implanting
      physician as the location that is best for the patient.
