      tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of single ascending doses of EC-18 or placebo. If no
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in Cohort One, the dose of EC-18 will be increased
      to in Cohorts Two, Three, and Four, respectively. Dose escalation to each successive cohort
      of subjects will not occur until a review of the safety and tolerability data from the
      previous cohort is completed and the Investigator, Sponsor, and study Medical Monitor
      together confirm the safety and tolerability of EC-18 given at that dose level.
