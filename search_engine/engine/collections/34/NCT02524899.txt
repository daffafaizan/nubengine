      remediation sessions, combined with concurrent administration of 8 weeks of
      guanfacine/placebo, on performance on cognitive, functional, and social skills performance
      measures in a sample of SPD patients with proven deficits in these areas. 2) Compare the
      effect of cognitive remediation therapy + 8 weeks guanfacine with cognitive remediation
      therapy + placebo on cognition in this schizophrenia spectrum disorder population. 3) Further
      characterize cognitive impairment in SPD using specific tests of working memory to evaluate
      the relationship between working memory and functional and social skill outcomes in this
      population.

      The study hypothesizes that:

        1. While both groups (those receiving CRT + guanfacine or CRT +placebo) will demonstrate
           improvements in overall cognitive functioning, SPD participants receiving CRT +
           guanfacine will evidence greater increases in post-treatment performance on our primary
           outcome measures-MATRICS battery total score, AX-CPT, N-Back, PASAT and DOT Test-
           particularly in areas related to working memory.

        2. Participants receiving CRT + guanfacine will also demonstrate greater improvements in
           functional and social functioning exploratory measures, as evidenced by performance on
           our secondary assessments, the UPSA, SSPA, MASC, and Reading of the Mind in the Eyes.
