    
      Importance: There is a need for evidence to support occupation-based intervention (OBI) for
      older adults with shoulder osteoarthritis (OA).

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of OBI on function in older adults with shoulder OA
      compared to therapeutic exercise (TE).

      Design: Randomized controlled trial. Six-week intervention. 1-week and 4-week follow-up.

      Setting: Outpatient clinic. Participants: Ten older adults with diagnosis of shoulder OA via
      convenience sampling.

      Intervention: Participants were seen two times/week for six weeks. The OBI group completed 30
      minutes of TE followed by 30 minutes of OBI. The TE group completed 60 minutes of TE.

      Outcome and Measures: Functional outcomes were assessed at pre-, 1-week post, and 4-weeks
      posttreatment using the QuickDASH as the primary outcome measure.
