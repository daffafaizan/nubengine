      conditions. Respiratory tract infections and lung complications are the main causes of
      increased morbidity and mortality.

      The use of mechanical cough augmentation with insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) is a strategy
      to treat and prevent. Possible major benefits are described, but optimal settings for best
      efficacy and comfort in children are not established.

      The main objective is to determine the prevalence and use of MIE among children with NMD in
      Norway. All children with NMD < 18 years which has received a machine for MI-E will be
      invited to participate in the study.

      The participants will be asked to complete two questionnaires. In addition will information
      from the data card in the MI-E machines give information about use. The information will be
      linked to the National register for Long term mechanical ventilation.
