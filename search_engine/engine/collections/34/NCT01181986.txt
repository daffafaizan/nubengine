      exenatide on daylong post-meal and fasting endothelial function. We will measure endothelial
      function measured by peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT2000, Itamar Inc.). Patients with
      recent onset (<3 years) or established (>5 years, Substudy 1 only) diabetes and impaired
      sugar tolerance (Substudy 2 only) will be studied. The plan is to complete studies in 75
      patients (40 in Substudy 1 and 35 in Substudy 2).

      In Substudy 1 patients will get twice a day a skin injection of exenatide (Byetta) or
      identically looking placebo for 10 days, separated by 14-day period. On the next day after
      each treatemnt period (day 11), they get just one injection and eat a fat-enriched breakfast.
      A fatty lunch of similar caloric content will be given 4 hours following the breakfast.
      Endothelial function will be measured just prior to the injection and every 2 hours for total
      8 hours.

      In Substudy 2, patients on 3 different days will get infusion of exenatide withg or without a
      blocking drug exendin-9, and a control test with placebo without exendin-9. Endothelial
      function will be measured before the infusion and 2 hours later during the final 15 minutes
      of the infusion cocktails. Patients will not eat any meal during the test visits.
