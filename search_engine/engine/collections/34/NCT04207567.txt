      of 4 US adults do not meet current US Physical Activity Guidelines regarding RT. Studies are
      needed that assess the effectiveness and feasibility of RT programs that are time-efficient
      and simple to perform.

      This will be a randomized controlled study of a habit-based RT program consisting of one set
      each of push-ups, angled-rows, and bodyweight squats performed every weekday for 12 weeks.
      Forty to 60 office workers and osteopathic medical students, who currently do not engage in
      RT, will be recruited, assessed, and randomized (1:1) to an intervention group, which will
      perform the exercises as just described, or a waitlist control group, which will refrain from
      RT for 12 weeks. To promote consistent exercise performance, the intervention group will be
      trained in the Tiny HabitsÂ® Method (a systematic approach to adding new behaviors in one's
      daily routine) and receive digital coaching for the duration of the study.

      After the 12-week follow-up assessment, the intervention group will continue the program for
      an additional 12 weeks, and the waitlist control group will start the program and continue
      for 12 weeks, including Tiny Habits training and digital coaching. A 24-week follow-up
      assessment will then be conducted.

      The primary outcome of interest is the change from baseline to 12-weeks in physical strength
      from, as measured by the maximum number of composite repetitions (i.e., push-ups +
      angled-rows + bodyweight squats) performed under a standardized protocol. Secondary outcomes
      of interest include adherence to and satisfaction with the program, and change from baseline
      to 12- and 24-week follow-up in composite repetitions, habit strength, blood pressure, lipid
      panel, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, anthropometry, body composition, and mid-thigh muscle
      thickness
