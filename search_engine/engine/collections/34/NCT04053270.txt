    
      Afamelanotide is a man-made drug being studied for use as a preventative medication for
      Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP) sufferers. It is a synthetically produced analogue of
      human alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH).

      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be
      administered under the skin. The implant may contain the study drug afamelanotide or a
      placebo (inactive medication).

      This study aims to provide insight into the effectiveness of afamelanotide under normal
      conditions of use in EPP patients.
