      the R-L shunt is based on the newly developed precise measurement technique. Moreover, this
      measurement of R-L shunt is feasible in a case when R-L shunt is present only intermittently.

      Detection and quantification of R-L shunt will be realized by the original INNTHERM® ® system
      (Innova Medical s.r.o., Velká Dobrá). This system is based on the principle of
      thermodilution.

      The basic assumption of our study is the hypothesis, that the size of the R-L shunt (and
      especially its maximum size during intra-abdominal pressure increase) is a risk factor for
      the development of paradoxical embolism (from pulmonary to systemic circulation). The most
      critical consequence of paradoxical embolism is the development of ischemic stroke.

      Such measurement with an unequivocal accuracy has never been done so far, due a lack of
      technology precise enough.

      Precise quantification of R-L shunt will allow a more accurate prediction of high-risk
      patients, especially after correlation with commonly used methods. PFO is now an indication
      for implantation of percutaneous occlusion device only in case of secondary prevention of
      stroke, i.e. in a group of patients who have had an ischemic stroke.

      Prospectively, precise and better identification of a risk group of these patients could lead
      to cost reduction of treatment. This cost reduction is crucial for young working-age patients
      who can be treated before a major irreversible brain injury occurs.

      A parameter applicable in primary prevention saves the cost of ischemic stroke treatment and
      other systemic embolism; additionally it will contribute to cost reduction during aftercare
      treatment.
