      high doses associated with effective anti-tumor activity in the absence of adverse side
      effects.

      The study plans to demonstrate this effect in human subjects using two dose escalation
      protocols; slow and fast. It is believed that this approach will prevent toxic side effects
      to subjects.

      The route of administration has not been employed clinically and is designed to avoid the
      myonecrotic effects of intramuscular injections. The target maximum dose is almost double
      that off the previously reported MTD.

      The revised protocol incorporates continuous infusion with a mobile pump and includes active
      suppression of the allergic reaction by pre-treatment administration of antihistamines.
