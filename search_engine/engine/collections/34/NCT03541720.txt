      with 123I-mIBG is the standard test to follow and manage these patients. Because of the
      inherent imaging characteristics of I-123, there is suboptimal resolution within the images,
      causing them to appear somewhat blurry, which reduces our ability to find small areas of
      disease. A chemical that uses positron emission tomography should allow much better
      resolution of the images, which could improve patient care by allowing us to find small areas
      of disease that, if untreated, could result in tumor relapse. We have developed
      18F-fluorodopamine (18F-DA) for PET imaging in our patients with neuroblastoma.

      The primary objective is to explore the safety of 18F-DA in patients with known or suspected
      neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      biodistribution of 18F-DA in patients with neuroblastoma and compare the biodistribution of
      18F-DA with the biodistribution of 123I-mIBG.

      Patients receive an intravenous injection of a small (tracer) dose of 18F-DA. Approximately 1
      hour later, patients undergo PET scanning of the entire body to evaluate the localization of
      the tracer.
