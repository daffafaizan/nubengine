      necessary injury of the gluteus medius muscle. The consecutive decrease of contractile muscle
      substance and the substitution by scar tissue leads to functional deficits of the
      pelvic-stabilizing musculature with an insufficiency limp in a large number of patients. In
      the long run the lack of musculature leads to a decrease in bone substance at the insertion
      sites of the gluteal muscles of the proximal femur. The present study has the aim of
      establishing a new therapy for iatrogenic gluteal muscle damage. The hypothesis of the
      present proposal is that intra-muscular (IM) injection of PLX-PAD into the iatrogenically
      injured gluteus medius muscle after THA results in an improved regeneration of the skeletal
      muscle tissue and consecutively in an improved functional outcome.

      Subjects will be assigned to receive one of the two targeted doses of PLX-PAD or placebo. On
      the treatment day, after suturing the gluteus medius muscle PLX-PAD or placebo will be
      applied directly to the site of laceration.

      Patients will be followed up for efficacy assessment up to week 26 and for safety assessment
      (Adverse events, vital signs, ECG, routinf lab and immunological testing) up to week 52 after
      THA. Patients will be phoned at week 104 in order to inquire about the occurence of new
      cancer.
