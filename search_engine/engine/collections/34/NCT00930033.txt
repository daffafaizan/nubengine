      carcinoma have justified recommendation to initial nephrectomy for patients presenting with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. But these studies were performed at the time of
      immunotherapy.

      renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib (AA) Arm A : Nephrectomy followed by Sunitinib
      Arm B : Sunitinib alone Sunitinib will be administrated orally daily for 4 weeks followed by
