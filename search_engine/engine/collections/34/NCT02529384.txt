      still challenge for radiologist. This study is going to evaluate multi-b values diffusion
      weighted imaging in discrimination of breast benign and malignant lesions and explore the
      diagnostic effect of the combination of multi-parameters. At the same time, pathological
      specimens of patients will be collected. The relationship between MR parameters and pathology
      biomarkers will be evaluated. By pre-contrast and post-contrast multi-b values diffusion
      weighted imaging series, patient's Apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC),tissue diffusivity
      (D), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*), perfusion fraction (f), distributed diffusion
      coefficient(DDC) and alpha will be evaluated. Parameters of benign , malignant breast lesions
      and ipsilateral or contralateral normal breast parenchyma as a control group will be
      measured. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is used to test the ability
      of different parameters in differentiating malignant from begin lesions. After Surgical
      operation, specimen of lesion will be collected(Not every patient's specimen will be
      collected. The investigators should be approved by patient themselves). The biomarkers of
      specimen will be detected by pathological and molecular-biological methods.Then analyze the
      relation between parameters of the MR imaging and pathological/molecular-biological
      biomarkers.
