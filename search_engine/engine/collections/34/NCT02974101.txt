      subjective self-report and the more objective information from the implanted IPG
      (RestoreSensor). Such subjective information can be gathered from the AdaptivStim output.

      The main focus of this study is to explore the relationship between the subjective reporting
      of functional disability with the ODI, sleep quality with the Actiwatch and PSQI, pain
      intensity with the NRS-diary and the objective measurement of functional positions with the
      AdaptiveStim in patients receiving high density spinal cord stimulation.
