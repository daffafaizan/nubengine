      have undergo the Endoscopic Vertical Gastroplasty or Fogel Gastroplasty (FG). Fogel's
      Gastroplasty is a procedure where The subject will be placed under general anesthesia in
      accordance with the Institution's standard practice. The procedure will last approximately
      1-2 hours. Following induction of anesthesia, the overtube will be placed, a gastroscope will
      be inserted to examine esophageal and gastric anatomy and re-confirm there are no anatomical
      contraindications to the procedure. The gastroscope will also be used to record images of the
      stomach prior to insertion of the OverStitch. Once the examination is complete the
      gastroscope will be removed. The OverStitch system will then be inserted orally to the
      per-operative site. CO2 will be used rather than air for the insufflation that is required
      during the procedure to minimize abdominal distention. The physician will place an
      interrupted suture pattern in a manner which partitions the greater curvature of the stomach
      from the Angle of His to the level of the incisura, creating a tube-like passage for gastric
      volume reduction. Afterwards, the remaining gastric volume will be reduced using a
      circumferential running stitch. Once complete, the OverStitch system will be removed and a
      standard gastroscope will be inserted to record post procedure endoscopic images.

      Anthropometric measurements as Weight, Height, BMI and Waist Circumference will be collected
      at Baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months after procedure
