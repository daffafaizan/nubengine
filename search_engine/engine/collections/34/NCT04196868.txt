      treatment of RA. The main goal of its treatment is to reach disease remission but, despite
      its good efficacy, 1/3 of patients failed to achieve it. This could lead to the introduction
      of a biologic therapy which is more expensive and exposes the patient to a greater infection
      risk. Neutrophils through expulsion of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), were found to
      be important in RA pathogenesis (source of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, activation
      of fibroblast-like synoviocytesâ€¦). The formation of NETs is reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      dependent, while metformin can selectivity inhibit mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I
      and decrease NADPH oxidase activity, thus leading to a decrease in ROS production.

      Metformin is the first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes. Recently, a study presented its
      potential impact in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus according to its metabolic
      properties and the inhibition of NETosis.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of Methotrexate/Metformin vs. Methotrexate
      alone on the decrease of RA activity in MTX-naive patients, after 6 months of treatment.
