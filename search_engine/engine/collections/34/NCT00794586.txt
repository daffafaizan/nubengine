    
      Gilead is developing a broad spectrum combination antibiotic (FTI) consisting of fosfomycin
      (an antibiotic with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria) and tobramycin
      (an aminoglycoside antibiotic with potent gram-negative activity) for treatment of patients
      with CF. FTI offers a potential option for treatment of CF lung infections. It is important
      to note that the concentration of tobramycin in FTI is lower than that of the approved dose
      of inhaled tobramycin alone, thereby demonstrating the potential of FTI to minimize long-term
      toxicity from repeated exposure to aminoglycosides like tobramycin. This study will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of 2 dose combinations of fosfomycin/tobramycin for inhalation (FTI),
      following a 28-day course of Aztreonam for Inhalation (AZLI) in patients with cystic fibrosis
      and Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection.
