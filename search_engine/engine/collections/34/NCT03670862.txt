    
      Patients Patients with cerebral ischemia sympton of anterior circulation or posterior
      circulation onset in 24 hours were included. A neurological evaluation (Modified Rankin Scale
      and NIHSS); physical examination, including measurement of weight (kg) and vital signs
      (supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) ; time from sympton onset to
      enrollment were recorded.

      Imaging protocols:

      CT scan protocols: No enhancement computed tomography(NECT) , computed tomography
      angiography(CTA), computed tomography perfusion(CTP)

      Contrast agent:

      CTA: Omniscan 40-50ml, 5ml/s; saline solution 50ml, 5ml/s

      CTP: Omniscan 50ml, 5ml/s; saline solution 50ml, 5ml/s

      Imaging evaluation:

      Treatment:

      Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator(rtPA), endovascular therapy and
      conventional treatment including neuro protection, ante-platelet and statin.

      Follow up:

      Five days, one month, three months and one year after imaging follow up and clinical stroke
