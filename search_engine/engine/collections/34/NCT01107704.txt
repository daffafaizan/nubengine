      An expanding body of literature documents that physician-family communication and end-of-life
      care is poor in intensive care units. These deficiencies are associated with high rates of
      adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates, physician-family conflict, and life support
      decisions that may be inconsistent with patients' goals and preferences. There is a lack on
      information on practical, generalizable interventions that effectively improve this important
      aspect of care for elderly patients and their families.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted
      communication intervention to improve psychological outcomes among family members of
      critically ill patients, using a randomized, controlled trial design.
