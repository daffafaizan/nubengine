      motion deficits. Recent evidence has suggested that changes in lower limb biomechanical
      factors during weight bearing activities may have substantial impact on physical function and
      disease progression in individuals with knee OA. The effectiveness of exercise therapy
      programs might be improved by incorporating balance and agility training techniques (knee
      stability training). The aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness of supplementing
      traditional exercise therapy with knee stability training techniques tailored for individuals
      with knee OA.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group will participate
      in a standard rehabilitation program of traditional exercise therapy for knee OA. The second
      group will participate in a standard rehabilitation program supplemented with a knee
      stability program. Study visits will occur at study entry, 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year. At
      each study visit, changes in pain, physical function, and biomechanical factors will be
      assessed. This study will last for one year.
