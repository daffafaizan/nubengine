    
      The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the analgesic effect of oral
      phenazopyridine to that of intravesical lidocaine during intradetrusor injections of
      onabotulinumtoxinA performed for idiopathic overactive bladder. The investigators will
      achieve this by measuring the mean visual-analog pain scores (VAS) in women who are
      randomized to receive either oral phenazopyridine or intravesical lidocaine.

      Secondary aims include assessment of:

        1. Overall Patient Satisfaction: To compare overall patient satisfaction with the
           onabotulinumtoxinA injection procedure in women randomized to pre-procedure oral
           phenazopyridine versus those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation.

        2. Ease of Procedure: To compare the physician's perception of ease of onabotulinumtoxinA
           injection procedure in women randomized to pre-procedure oral phenazopyridine versus
           those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation.

        3. Office Efficiency/Total Appointment Duration: To compare total appointment time or total
           time spent in an office exam/procedure room in women randomized to pre-procedure oral
           phenazopyridine versus those randomized to intravesical lidocaine instillation.
