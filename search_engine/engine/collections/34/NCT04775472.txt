      To determine the effect of early left atrial septostomy versus conventional approach(left
      atrial septostomy only in cases of significant changes due to left ventricular end-diastolic
      pressure increase) in patients who received venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation(VA-ECMO) for the treatment of cardiogenic shock.

      Study Background:

      Cardiogenic shock is due to myocardial dysfunction from multifactorial causes, which has high
      mortality. The treatment for cardiogenic shock includes early coronary revascularization,
      inotropes, vasopressors, or mechanical circulatory support, such as intraaortic balloon
      pump(IABP), VA-ECMO. However, the routine use of IABP is not recommended for the treatment of
      cardiogenic shock in recent guidelines. VA-ECMO can be easily implanted, and can maintain
      high cardiac output. In several studies, The use of VA-ECMO was associated with lower
      in-hospital mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock.

      However, VA-ECMO has a deleterious effect for hemodynamics. It can increase left ventricular
      end-diastolic pressure(LVEDP), followed by left ventricular dilatation, abnormal opening of
      aortic valve and jeopardizes of myocardial recovery. Therefore, several methods have been
      used to reduce LVEDP. Among these, left atrial septostomy is effective, but less invasive
      than surgical left ventricular unloading. However, there is few data regarding this issue.
      Therefore, the investigators will evaluate the effect of routine, early left atrial
      septostomy in patients with VA-ECMO for the treatment of cardiogenic shock.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Early, routine left atrial septostomy for left heart unloading is superior compared to
      conventional approach to reduce in-hospital mortality and the duration of VA-ECMO.
