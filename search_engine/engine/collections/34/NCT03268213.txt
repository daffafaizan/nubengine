    
      The following hypothesis will be tested in this study:

        1. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a safe, tolerable, and efficacious procedure for C.
           difficile patients and is a safe and tolerable procedure for ulcerative colitis and
           indeterminate colitis patients.

        2. The fecal microbial diversity, composition and function in stool recipients after fecal
           transplantation will change to a similar microbial diversity, composition and
           functionality as found in donor stool.

      Primary objectives:

      1. To determine the short term safety and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation in
      patients with recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory
      Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis up to 12 weeks post-transplant.

      Secondary objectives:

      1a. To determine the long term safety and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation up
      to 1 year post-transplant in patients with recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and
      medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis.

      1b. To determine the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with recurrent
      or refractory Clostridium difficile defined as no recurrence of C. difficile within one year.

      2. To compare microbial diversity in healthy donor stools compared to pre-FMT recipient
      stools collected from patients (recipients) with recurrent or refractory Clostridium
      difficile and medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis.

      3. To compare microbial composition in healthy donor stools compared to pre-FMT recipient
      stools from patients (recipients) with recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and
      medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis.

      4. To compare microbial function in healthy donor stools compared to pre-FMT recipient stools
      from patients (recipients) with recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication
      refractory Ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis.

      5. To compare microbial diversity in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with 1
      week post-transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients) with
      recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or
      indeterminate colitis.

      6. To compare microbial composition in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with
      1 week post-transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients) with
      recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or
      indeterminate colitis.

      7. To compare microbial function in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with 1
      week post-transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients) with
      recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or
      indeterminate colitis.

      8. To compare microbial diversity in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with
      12 week post transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients) with
      recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or
      indeterminate colitis.

      9. To compare microbial composition in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with
      12 week post transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients) with
      recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or
      indeterminate colitis.

      10. To compare microbial function in healthy donor stools and pre-FMT recipient stools with
      12 week post transplant recipient stool samples collected from patients (recipients) with
      recurrent or refractory Clostridium difficile and medication refractory Ulcerative colitis or
      indeterminate colitis.

      11. Stool calprotectin levels will be measured in the recipient at baseline pre-FMT, 1 week
      and 12 weeks post FMT to determine if FMT causes a statistically significant change.
