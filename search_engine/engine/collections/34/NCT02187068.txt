    
      Twenty obese patients and 20 non-obese patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery
      will give dexmedetomidine 0.5 Î¼g.kg-1 over 10 minutes and then randomized to either
      dexmedetomidine 0.25 mcg.kg-1.h-1 or dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg.kg-1.h-1 for approximate 2 h
      (range 58-320 min). Blood samples will be taken at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 min
      after beginning dexmedetomidine administration, and at 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240
      and 360 min after stopping infusion. Population pharmacokinetic modeling will be performed
      using nonlinear mixed-effects model.
