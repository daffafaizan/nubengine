      locoregional control of clinically apparent metastases does not substantially impact survival
      due to undetectable micrometastic (clinically not visualized) disease that ultimately lead to
      treatment failure/progression. However, as more advanced systemic therapy continue to improve
      control of micrometastatic disease, failures at the original sites of disease remain common.
      Furthermore, some studies have shown locoregional treatment of limited clinical metastases to
      actually improve survival. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that aggressive treatment
      to clinically active sites of disease (alone or in addition to systemic therapy) may improve
      survival or alter the course of the disease in some patients with limited metastatic disease.
