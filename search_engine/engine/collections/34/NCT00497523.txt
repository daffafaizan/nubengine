    
      Asthma is a chronic disease which is estimated to affect over 25 million people both in the
      US and Europe(i.e. approximately 10% of the total population).There is evidence that over the
      last 20 years prevalence has considerably increased, especially among children. The diagnosis
      of asthma in children may be difficult, largely because episodic wheezing and cough are among
      the common symptoms encountered in childhood illnesses, particularly in children under 3
      years old.Although in these young children there is the possibility of over treatment, the
      episodes of wheezing may be reduced in intensity by the effective use of anti-inflammatory
      medications and bronchodilators rather than antibiotics. At present, pharmacological therapy
      is used to treat reversible airway obstruction, inflammation and hyperreactivity in both
      children and adults. Medications include preventive treatments in forms of
      antinflammatory/antiallergic agents (e.g. glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists,
      cromolyn sodium) and reliever treatments, in form of bronchodilators (e.g. Î²-adrenergic
      agonists, anticholinergics). Comparisons: Beclomethasone suspension for nebulisation (400 mcg
      U.D.V.) plus as needed salbutamol compared to placebo plus as needed salbutamol and to as
      needed salbutamol/beclomethasone fixed combination.
