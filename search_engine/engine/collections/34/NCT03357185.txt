      atheromatous occlusive disease. Current treatment options consists in femoral endarteriectomy
      or bypass. More recently, endovascular treatment of femoral tripod lesions has been reported.
      Inguinal area is prone to postoperative infection in up to 20% of the cases. Hence, the use
      of synthetic graft puts the participants at risk of dramatic consequences in case of
      postoperative infection. Besides, long term data are still required to validate the use of
      endovascular device in this very "surgical" area. The use of the eversion technique is
      possible in the majority of the lesions and offer the major advantage of open surgery in
      terms of durability, without the use of synthetic material in case of postoperative
      infection.

      The investigators herein report the detailed technique, tips and variations of the eversion
      technique as well as the clinical follow up in terms of clinical benefit according to
      Rutherford classification and restenosis evaluated by serial doppler US.
