      cancer suffering from bone metastases. The aim of this study is to collect data on Patient
      Reported Outcomes (PRO)/Quality of Life regarding bone pain and the impact of bone pain on
      quality of life and daily activities. PROs are assessed by a questionnaire consisting of a
      visual analog scale for bone pain, two questions regarding bone pain management, the bone
      pain module of FACT questionnaire (FACT-BP) and four questions addressing the impact of
      treatment on daily life (overall, social life, ability to work and ability to perform routine
      tasks)
