      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved OPDIVO® (nivolumab), YERVOY®
      (ipilimumab), and a combination of the two as treatment options for metastatic melanoma.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of nivolumab
      and BMS-986205 as a treatment for any disease. This research study is looking for more
      information on the efficacy the combination of nivolumab and BMS-986205 in the treatment of
      melanoma.

      Nivolumab, Ipilimumab, and BMS-986205 are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by
      encouraging the body's own immune system to attack the cancer cells. Nivolumab, Ipilimumab,
      and BMS-986205 work by stopping various molecules on cancer cells and body cells from working
      against the immune system's natural fight against cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are going to look at the following while the
      participants are receiving the study drug(s):

      • The effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and tolerability of Nivolumab,
      BMS-986205 and Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in people with resectable stage III or
      IV melanoma
