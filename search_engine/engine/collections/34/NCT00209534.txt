    
      Randomized, open label, multi-center, adaptive dose ranging study, in which several dose
      levels of AQUAVAN® Injection and fentanyl citrate injection will be investigated to produce a
      desired sedation level in patients undergoing elective colonoscopy. A desired sedative
      dose/dose range and dosing paradigm will be identified based on pre-set criteria using the
      Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S). The desired sedative dose/dose
      range and dosing paradigm of AQUAVAN® Injection is defined as one that consistently provides
      mild to moderate sedation (Modified OAA/S between 2 and 4 inclusive) in a majority of
      patients who are pre-medicated with fentanyl citrate injection.
