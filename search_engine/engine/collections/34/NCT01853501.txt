      cells (ADSC) transplantation for premature ovarian failure (POF) women underwent Autologous
      fat transplantation. The serum of each patient were kept and sent for laboratory test before
      the surgery. 100ml fat was harvested from the abdomen of POF patient using abdominal fat
      abortion. And ADSC were isolated and cultured in vitro using autologous serum. The biomarkers
      of ADSC, CD29 and CD44, were detected in the ADSC cultures using Flow cytometry detection.
      The ADSC were then transplanted directly into bilateral ovaries when cells reach a density of
      5-10Ã—106. The clinical conditions of patients were examined at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the
      transplantation. Ovarian functions were evaluated by follicle diameter and sexual hormone
      levels. The follicle number was counted and radiology data were kept for future analysis. To
      ensure high rate of pregnancy, intercourse under medical guidance may be suggested and
      hormone replacement treatment may be taken to help the patients conceive.

      Main Outcome Measure(s): Serum FSH,LH,E2 levels, recurrence of Menstruation, Antral follicle
      diameter,and pregnancy.
