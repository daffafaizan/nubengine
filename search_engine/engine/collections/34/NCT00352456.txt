      homogeneous population of individuals who present with marked emotional dysfunction (reduced
      empathy, guilt and attachment to others) as well as a notable propensity for goal-directed
      antisocial behavior. Identification of the neuro-biological underpinnings of their emotional
      dysfunction is of crucial importance as the level of emotion dysfunction is an important
      predictor of long term prognosis.

      Currently, there are two main positions regarding the neural systems that are dysfunctional
      in individuals with psychopathy: First, that the pathology is associated with amygdala
      dysfunction; Secondly, that the pathology is associated with orbital frontal cortex
      dysfunction. A third, more recent position, stresses the interconnections between these two
      systems and the role that development may play in the disorder.

      The current project will determine the performance of individuals with psychopathy and
      comparison individuals on measures which recruit the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex. In
      addition, a series of functional neuro-imaging studies will directly assess neural responses
      in these two systems in individuals with psychopathy. Finally, a structural imaging study
      will examine anatomical differences between the groups. The project should provide clear data
      that will constrain future theorizing on the pathology implicated in this disorder.
