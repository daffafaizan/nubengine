      study will use Health Canada approved Steriwaveâ„¢ Nasal Decolonization (ND) in patients
      infected with SARS-CoV-2 . Currrently, PDF is being used at some institutions before surgery
      to lower the risk of postoperative infection. PDF uses a Methylene Blue (MB) nasal spray,
      followed by 5 minutes of red-light exposure through a small light-diffusing applicator. This
      will need to be placed into each nostril. Participants are swabbed for SARS-CoV-2 before and
      after treatment. In addition to the patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, there will also
      be a small group of healthcare workers who have tested positive that will be included. Though
      they are not undergoing treatment, they will swab their own noses multiple times over a
      period of 5 days. This will allow us to evaluate the effect (if any) of swabbing on
      SARS-CoV-2 levels in the nose. The study hypothesis is that MB-mediated PDF will show the
      ability to kill SARS-CoV-2 which will consequently confirm its efficacy as a first line
      defense against the virus.
