    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Phase I) II. To determine treatment
      response with the addition of CPI-613 to induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of administering CPI-613 under the proposed study regimen. (Phase
      I/II) II. To assess survival endpoints of patients receiving the proposed study regimen.
      (Phase II) III. To assess the rate of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid
      followed by a phase II study.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-7,
      daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3, and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2
      hours on days 3-7. Patients then undergo biopsy on day 14. Patients experiencing significant
      residual disease receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-5, daunorubicin hydrochloride
      IV on days 1-2, and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1-5.

      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning 42 days later, patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days
      1-16 and 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 2-6. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients not undergoing transplant after consolidation receive
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 14 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
