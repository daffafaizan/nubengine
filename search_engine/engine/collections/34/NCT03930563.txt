      in healthy older adults who have 'normal' responses to acute hypoxia. Patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea have exaggerated peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity. It remains
      unknown if beetroot juice supplementation reduces peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity in
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Additionally, increasing blood flow to the peripheral
      chemoreceptors reduces sensitivity. Given that beetroot juice improves blood flow, the
      investigators will also measure common carotid artery blood flow at rest and during hypoxia.
