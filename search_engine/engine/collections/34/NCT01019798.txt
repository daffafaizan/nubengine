      analysis is adopted.The sample size in the first stage is 16 patients. The length of study is
      approximately 24 months. The targeted subject is patient with metastatic or unresectable
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      Study Endpoints Primary Endpoint Assess the response rate of sunitinib, docetaxel and
      cisplatin in the treatment of na√Øve chemotherapy metastatic or unresectable non-small cell
      lung cancer patients.

      Secondary Endpoint

        1. Time to disease progression (defined as the time period from the start of investigated
           medication to investigator assessed disease progression) at the end of study.

        2. Duration of survival (defined as the time period from the start of investigated
           medication to death).

        3. Safety profile of sunitinib in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin: cardiac
           toxicity assessed in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
           (version 3.0). The incidence of serious adverse events related to the treatment and the
           incidence of specific adverse events (serious and non-serious) such as gastro-intestinal
           perforation, wound healing complication, bleeding, hypertension, arterial thromboembolic
           events and proteinuria will be investigated. NCI-CTCAE criteria (version 3.0) will be
           used.
