    
      Clinical triple-blind randomized controlled trial.

      With two arms to the study:

        1. Mouth rinses with chlorhexidine-based solution at a concentration of 0.12%, using as a
           vehicle to 7% ethyl alcohol.

        2. Mouthwashes with solution based only 7% ethyl alcohol.

      GOAL. Assess whether there decrease in the rate of oral colonization by gram-negative
      bacteria in patients with chemotherapy by using chlorhexidine mouthwash.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

        1. The rate of the oral colonization by gram-negative bacteria initiation of chemotherapy.

        2. The rate of oral colonization by gram-negative bacteria after 10 days of initiation of
           chemotherapy.

        3. Identify microbiologically gram-negative bacteria colonizing the oral cavity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

      1. The presence of severe neutropenia and fever in each study group during the first 10 days
      of starting treatment
