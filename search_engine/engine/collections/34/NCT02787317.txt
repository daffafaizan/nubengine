      (PCI) for coronary heart disease. Prolonging infusions may decrease myocardial damage
      associated with bivalirudin use during primary PCI . However, whether prolonging infusions of
      bivalirudin could prevent ischemic complications is unknown. The investigators examined the
      effects of prolonged drug infusion after elective PCI. The investigators hypothesized that
      continuing the bivalirudin infusion commenced during the procedure at the PCI recommended
      dose for 4 hours would prevent myocardial damage.
