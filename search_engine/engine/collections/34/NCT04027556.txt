      human body is composed of adipose tissue and non-adipose tissue, and adipose tissue
      contributes little to the volume of distribution for contrast media. Therefore, iodine dose
      calculated based on lean body weight would be more personalized than merely considering total
      body weight. In addition, lowering the contrast media dose would be achievable by using
      virtual monoenergetic imaging at low keV. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether the
      acceptable image quality is achievable using low contrast media dose calculated based on lean
      body weight and low keV imaging for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
