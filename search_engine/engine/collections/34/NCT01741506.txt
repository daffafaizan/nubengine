      undergo surgery, there are two different methods of operation: either open surgery
      (thoracotomy) or Video Assisted Thorascopic Surgery (VATS). The latter method is increasing
      in use.

      Patients are often prescribed heparin pre- postoperatively, but it is unclear whether this
      prophylactic treatment is necessary, and it has never been thoroughly investigated.

      When patients receive heparin there is an increased risk of bleeding.

      Furthermore, it is unclear what changes occurs in the coagulation system pre, per- and
      postoperatively in patients undergoing surgery for lung-cancer, and hereby it is unclear
      whether these patients should have some sort of medical prophylactic treatment.

      By using new analysis methods in terms of Thromboelastometry, Thrombin generation and
      thrombocyte function analysis, hereby the total coagulation profile can be characterized and
      hereby estimate the risk of thrombosis and bleeding. Thereby better be able to give the right
      treatment for these patients.
