      develop a preoperative prediction model for lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer
      (KGOG-2014). This retrospective multi-center study showed that the accurate identification of
      a low-risk group for lymph node metastasis among the patients with endometrial cancer can be
      achieved with the new criteria using preoperative MRI and serum CA-125 assay. In this study,
      serum CA125 levels and three MRI parameters (deep myometrial invasion, lymph node
      enlargement, and extension beyond uterine corpus) were found to be independent risk factors
      for nodal metastasis. Based on the success of KGOG-2014, Korean Gynecologic Oncology Group
      initiated this prospective, multi-center observational study to validate our prior prediction
      model.
