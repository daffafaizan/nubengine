    
      This is a non-interventional, prospective, open-label, single-arm, 3-cohort, multicenter
      study in Germany. In total, 1,222 patients will be enrolled in 100 oncological sites
      (office-based medical oncologists, oncology outpatient-centers, and university hospitals) in
      a time period of 42 months. Of these, 415 patients with high risk, 415 patients with
      intermediate risk, and 392 patients with low risk, as a priori assessed by the metastatic
      colorectal cancer prognostic score (mCCS), will be included. Overall survival of the
      pre-defined prognostic groups will be analyzed as primary endpoint to validate the mCCS.

      Patients have been scheduled to receive first line combination therapy with panitumumab and
      FOLFIRI or FOLFOX according to German regulations and current German SmPC. Data on efficacy
      in terms of tumor response evaluation / survival and safety (ADRs) will be collected during
      first line therapy. A subset of patients participating in the 'VALIDATE-PRO' project (n=611)
      will be assessed for general and health-related quality of life with patient questionnaires.
      Biomarker status beyond RAS will be collected at baseline. The documentation of defined
      patient data including survival will continue until the end of the individual study
      participation which is latest 36 months after last patient in. The end of study will be at
      latest at 36 months after last patient in (LPI).
