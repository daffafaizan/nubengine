      GVHD (cGVHD) affects 40-60% of adult patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT. It is a
      major cause of non-relapse mortality and morbidity. Systemic prednisone is the first-line
      treatment for cGVHD; however, about one-half of all patients do not respond to this initial
      therapy, and there is no standard second-line therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy used for
      treatment of GVHD brings significant risk of infection, poorly affecting clinical outcomes.

      Vitamin D affects immunoregulation, fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis and
      endothelial cell function, and the investigators hypothesize that topical vitamin D
      application will have a positive effect on acute and chronic skin GVHD. The investigators
      hypothesize that topical vitamin D cream may restore normal cell function and decrease the
      use of steroid creams in acute GVHD of the skin.
