      refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients who have already undergone chemotherapy as part of
      their prostate cancer treatment. The hypothesis of the study is that HRPC patients who have
      been previously treated with chemotherapy will demonstrate objective PSA response rates to
      low dose ketoconazole, comparable to historical response rates reported in chemotherapy-na√Øve
      patients. This is a single arm trial, with all participants given ketoconazole 200mg TID,
      along with hydrocortisone given at 20mg in the morning, 10mg at night daily. Each cycle will
      consist of 28 days. The subject's study participation will continue until subject experiences
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, withdraws consent from the study or dies.
