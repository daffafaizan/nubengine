      development. Educational and psychosocial programs are standard treatments for autistic
      children, but drug therapy is often needed as well. Haloperidol is the drug most commonly
      prescribed for symptoms of autism. However, long-term administration of haloperidol has been
      associated with adverse effects such as blurred vision, constipation, and nausea. The
      investigation of alternative drug treatments is necessary. This study will determine whether
      the antipsychotic drug olanzapine may be a safe and effective alternative to haloperidol for
      treating symptoms of autism in children.

      This study will last 36 weeks and will comprise 2 phases. In Phase I, participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either olanzapine or placebo for 12 weeks. Participants who do
      not respond to treatment will complete their participation in the study. Participants who
      respond to their assigned Phase I treatment will continue onto Phase II. All Phase II
      participants will receive olanzapine daily for 6 months. Self-report scales and checklists
      will be used to assess participants after each phase; these measures will be completed by
      participants and their parents.
