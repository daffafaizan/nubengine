      millions of intravitreal injections done each year, even small improvements in participants'
      experiences could lead to significant benefit. During the process eye injections, the method
      of eyelid retraction has been shown to be one of the most significant sources of discomfort.

      Many ophthalmologists use an eyelid speculum to retract the eyelids, but potentially more
      comfortable methods exist. The purpose of our study was to test the comfort eyelid retraction
      with an eyelid speculum to that of the unimanual eyelid retraction method and a cotton tipped
      applicator eyelid retraction technique.
