      Chikai Black 18 microguidewire. Patients will undergo mechanical thrombectomy for acute large
      vessel occlusive stroke within the anterior circulation as is standard of care.

      Additionally, this study will have a retrospective portion which will examine 50 consecutive
      patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria treated for acute anterior circulation large
      vessel occlusive stroke prior to the initiation of the Sure -18 Registry. This retrospective
      cohort will be 50 consecutive mechanical thrombectomy cases performed using any neurovascular
      microguidewire other than the device under study (Asahi Chikai Black 18) at the same
      enrolling centers leading up to December 10, 2018.
