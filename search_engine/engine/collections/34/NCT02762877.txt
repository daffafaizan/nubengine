    
      This is a prospective clinical study to characterize the concordance of key clinically
      relevant genomic alterations in tumor tissue (biopsy/excision/cytology) and liquid biopsy
      (blood) using the Genomic Health LBMP in patients with stage IV non squamous NSCLC, that are
      either newly diagnosed with metastatic disease or progressing on therapy (any line). Tissue
      biopsy and blood collection (liquid biopsy) should be less than eight weeks apart and with no
      new systemic antitumoral treatment given in the interval between the tissue biopsy and blood
      collection. Local assessment of tumor tissue samples will be performed at each participating
      institution as per their clinical standard of care practices and results from the local
      assessment of genomic alteration status will be used.
