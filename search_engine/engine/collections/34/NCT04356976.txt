      the most common conditions requiring surgery.

      Mesh-reinforced as well as suture repair are used for the treatment of primary hernias, but
      for smaller umbilical hernias (diameter 1-3cm), there is little evidence for the superiority
      of mesh repair. Despite the widely use of composite ventral patch, there are few studies
      showing the advantage and disadvantage of ventral patch. In recent years, the barbed suture
      has been widely used in umbilical and incisional hernias, in laparoscopic as well as in open
      surgery. However, there are no studies comparing ventral patch with slowly absorbable barbed
      suture in open surgery.

      The investigators intend to compare the use of sublay composite mesh (ventral-patch) with
      non-resorbable barbed prolene suture repair only and investigate recurrence rate and other
      short and long-term postoperative complications in these two methods.
