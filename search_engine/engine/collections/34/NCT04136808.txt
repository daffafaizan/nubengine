    
      This treatment protocol is being conducted while a phase 3 enfortumab vedotin (EV) study is
      ongoing for participants with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial
      carcinoma (UC).

      This is an expanded access program to provide EV to participants with locally advanced or
      metastatic UC who have previously been treated with a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)
      or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, and a platinum containing regimen and for
      whom, in the judgment of the investigator, there is no available standard of care therapy.
      The participants must not be eligible for an ongoing EV clinical study. Participants who have
      previously participated in any EV studies or studies that included EV as one of the treatment
      options are not eligible, even if the participants was not given or assigned EV. To request
      enrollment, the investigator or designee will submit the candidate participant's relevant
      medical history and other records in order to support the participant's protocol eligibility.

      Safety of EV will be assessed through evaluation of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse
      events (SAEs), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, laboratory
      measurements, vital signs and physical examinations.

      Participants will be provided with study medication until FDA approval and commercial
      availability of enfortumab vedotin (EV) or termination by the sponsor.
