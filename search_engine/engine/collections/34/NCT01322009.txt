      synergistically preserve levels of GSH and reduce oxidative stress in children with severe
      TBI. We will enroll 20 children age 2 to less than 18 years old (less than 216 months) after
      severe TBI in a randomized, controlled study of administration of the combinational therapy
      and test if the administration of these drugs is safe and if antioxidant reserve can be
      preserved within the serum and CSF.

      Probenecid (at the same dose that is used as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy) and NAC (at
      the same dose that is used for acetaminophen-induced liver disease), or vehicles will be
      given for 3 days. The primary outcomes of the study will be the safety of drug administration
      and the CSF and serum levels anti-oxidant reserve (AOR), with the presumption that
      maintaining anti-oxidant levels within the brain may prove neuroprotective. Other secondary
      outcomes (CSF and serum probenecid, NAC, GSH and phenytoin concentrations) will also be
      tested. Adverse events occuring during treatment with these drugs after TBI will be monitored
      by a local Data Safety Monitoring Board.
