      can detect lymph node metastases.

      Patients who are returning for an ultrasound exam after detection of a suspicious node via
      magnetic resonance imaging will be enrolled in the study.

      Enrolled patients will receive a clinical ultrasound exam, as is the current standard of
      care. Suspicious nodes will be identified and imaged with combined ultrasound and
      spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging. Measurements will be acquired with three to five
      replicates with slightly modified transducer positioning to measure system and intranodal
      variance of the measurements. One to five contralateral axillary lymph nodes will be imaged
      to serve as a control and to determine patient-to-patient variability in lymph node saturated
      oxygen. The distance from the skin to the lymph node will also be measured with ultrasound
      imaging for each node.

      If the ultrasound imaging identifies a suspicious node, patients will undergo ultrasound
      guided biopsy to confirm the true metastatic state of the nodes. Suspicious nodes will be
      clipped to facilitate identification at the time of axillary node dissection. During the
      sentinel node procedure, investigators will use intraoperative photoacoustic imaging to
      measure the blood oxygenation in the sentinel lymph node immediately prior to its removal.
      Histology will be performed on all biopsy samples and excised nodes to determine the true
      metastatic state of the node(s).
