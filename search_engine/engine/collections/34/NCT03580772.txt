      patient reported outcomes of patients that have undergone a MC TKR to an age, gender, BMI,
      pre-operative diagnosis with satisfactory clinical outcome at one year (OKS > 34) matched
      cohort of patients undergone a modern generation TKR which utilises a gradually reducing
      radius of curvature on the femoral component with conventional polyethylene (Attune) to a TKR
      with gradually reducing radius of curvature on the femoral component but a medial congruent
      (MC) TKR design (Persona).
