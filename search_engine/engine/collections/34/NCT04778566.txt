      a larger prospective study that will compare the performance of Cologuard with the
      gold-standard colonoscopy in identifying advanced adenomas and colorectal cancers in LS. Data
      regarding rate of consent, and adherence to the protocol will be recorded. Since patients
      with known genetic predisposition to cancers tend to view screening tests more positively
      than the general population, a second aim of the study is to evaluate patient satisfaction
      with bowel preparation, colonoscopies, and Cologuard testing. Up to 90 individuals with
      genetically confirmed LS will be recruited via Geisinger's HRC to complete a goal of 90
      Cologuard studies. Upon enrollment, Cologuard will be ordered by the study team at no cost to
      the subject and will be completed according to the standard instructions for use. Results
      will be securely obtained and blinded until the time of data analysis. Subjects will undergo
      colonoscopy as part of their routine HRC visit. Results from the colonoscopy (and biopsy as
      indicated) will be retrieved from the Electronic Health Record (EHR) and documented in a
      research-associated spreadsheet. If repeat colonoscopy is clinically indicated, repeat
      Cologuard may be completed if the subject meets inclusion criteria.
