      Participants in the proposed study will belong to one of four intervention groups:

        1. Conventional or regular pulmonary rehabilitation program alone(an exercise program that
           consist 3 main components: aerobic conditioning, resistance training, and flexibility
           exercises).

        2. Very low load IMT(sham IMT) alone.

        3. Conventional or regular pulmonary rehabilitation program + Targeted inspiratory
           resistive or threshold IMT.

        4. Targeted inspiratory resistive or threshold IMT alone.
