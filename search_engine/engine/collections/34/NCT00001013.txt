      reduce the high relapse rate found after conventional therapy. Trimetrexate (TMTX) was chosen
      for this trial because it was found to be much more potent than sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim
      (SMX/TMP) against the PCP organism in laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with
      leucovorin (LCV), did not cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial. It is believed that
      TMTX will be more effective than SMX/TMP in treating PCP and in preventing a recurrence of
      PCP. Preliminary studies suggest that aerosolized pentamidine (PEN) is likely to be effective
      in preventing a recurrence of PCP.

      Patients entered in the study are randomly assigned to TMTX / LCV or to SMX/TMP for a 21-day
      trial. For the first 10 days, the trial is double-blind (neither patient nor physician knows
      which drugs the patient is receiving), and drugs are given by intravenous infusion. TMTX is
      given once every 24 hours and LCV every 6 hours; SMX/TMP is given every 6 hours. Doses are
      determined by body size. After the first 10 days, LCV and SMX/TMP may be given orally. Doses
      are adjusted or treatment is changed to intravenous PEN if side effects are too severe.
      During the 21-day trial, zidovudine (AZT) may not be used because of possible increased bone
      marrow toxicity. AZT may be resumed as soon as the patient's white cell count is acceptable.
      Aerosolized PEN therapy is begun 7 - 10 days after completion of therapy for the acute
      episode. PEN is inhaled once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 48 weeks.
