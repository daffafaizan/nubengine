    
      Approximately 120 female volunteers attending the study site requesting a pregnancy test will
      be recruited locally to the UK trial centre.

      Volunteers will be required to use the Clearblue Pregnancy Test according to the product
      instructions, and provide a urine sample from the same void.

      Trained technicians will conduct a second test from the urine sample to evaluate performance
      between consumer and technician testing.
