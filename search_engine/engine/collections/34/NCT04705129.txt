      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and achieved good long-term survival. However, among
      DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP, EBV+ had a lower 5-year OS than EBV- patients (65% vs
      82%). For primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), although the initial treatment
      has a better prognosis than DLBCL, there are still 10% to 30% of PMBCL patients with primary
      refractory or relapsed disease, and the prognosis is poor.

      Zanubrutinib combined with Tislelizumab has been proved efficient in relapsed or refractory
      NHLs, with ORR rate 37%, CR rate of 16.7%. This phase II, prospective, open-label, single-arm
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zanubrutinib combined with Tislelizumab in the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and Epstein-Barr
      Virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
