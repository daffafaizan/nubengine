    
      This is a multi-center, open label, non-randomized, sequential, within-patient
      dose-escalation study in patients with recurrent or refractory primary solid tumors with
      metastatic involvement (including brain metastases). Patients will be administered 1 to 3
      (Test Doses A, B and Dose C) escalating doses of 131-I-TM-601 by intravenous (IV)
      administration, with dosimetry (imaging-based evaluation of the dose reaching the target
      sites) conducted prior to and following administration of each dose. Whole body dosimetry on
      critical structures including, but not limited to, bone marrow, bladder, brain, liver, and
      thyroid will be determined. The preliminary results from Test Dose Levels (A and/or B) for
      each patient will be analyzed prior to treating patients with Dose C.

      Patients will be followed until 28 days following the final dose, with a complete clinical
      assessment and imaging evaluations at the final follow-up visit.
