      recruited from NYU Langone Medical Center's ENT Department and will receive either high-dose
      intranasal oxytocin or a nasal spray containing Pcca Mucolox and distilled water, serving as
      the placebo. Long term treatment with high-dose oxytocin (45 IU four times daily) may reduce
      the frequency and severity of tinnitus, the burden tinnitus symptoms cause patients, and
      improve their quality of life.
