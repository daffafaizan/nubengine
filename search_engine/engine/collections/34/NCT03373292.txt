      gained a vested interest. Compared with venous sinus stenosis, isolated IJVS at extracranial
      segments is more concealed and likely to be neglected, leading to misdiagnosis or treatment
      delay and subsequent exacerbation of clinical outcomes. Stenting seems to hold a potential of
      addressing the intracranial pressure elevation-associated clinical issues from etiological
      level, especially after medical therapy failure. The complications of stenting such as
      ipsilateral headache, restenosis, intra-stent thrombosis and hemorrhage have beem
      demonstrated in the settings of intracranial sinus obstruction and osseous
      impingement-associated IJVS, particularly bony structures between the styloid process and
      lateral mass of C1 that constrain the IJV. Nevertheless, so far, to the best of our
      knowledge, few or no stenting related adverse events have been found in isolated IJVS
      patients with venous stent implantation.

      In this study, 60 patients satisfied with the inclusion criteria will be enrolled and
      randomly allocated into two groups. The safety and efficacy of stenting in patients with
      non-osseous impingement-mediated IJVS will be analyzed. Other medical interventions will be
      guaranteed according to the best medical judgment from clinical practitioners.
