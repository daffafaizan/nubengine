      condition according to the standard of care of the practitioner. All patients at a given site
      with surgeries that meet eligibility requirements will be included in the study and available
      progress notes, medical records, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), radiographs, and
      complications will be obtained from the medical records.

      The safety and performance of the MLX and XLX ACR interbody implants will be assessed using
      the following:

        1. Complications attributable to the use of the associated interbody implant as noted in
           surgical summaries, progress notes, and hospital records

        2. Neurologic status, symptoms, and subject self-reported clinical outcomes (e.g., pain and
           disability), as available

        3. Radiographic outcome (fusion) and description of device status from plain film
           radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scan(s), as available
