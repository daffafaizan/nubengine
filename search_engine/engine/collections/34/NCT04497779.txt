      I. Establish a testing service for screening prospective donors of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP).

      II. Characterize the titer and neutralizing properties of severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in CCP.

      III. Correlate the SARS-CoV-2 antibody characteristics in CCP with the outcome in severely
      ill COVID-19 patients treated with CCP.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Facilitate the recruitment of CCP donors in medically underserved areas.

      II. Develop high-throughput methods for detection/characterization of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
      and non-neutralizing antibodies.

      III. Develop a bank of convalescent plasma that would be available for future studies
      relating to the content of CCP.

      IV. Study the impact of antibody levels, donor characteristics and patient characteristics on
      outcome in COVID-19 patients treated with CCP.

      V. Procure blood samples from COVID-19 convalescent volunteers for future COVID-19-related
      studies.

      OUTLINE:

      PROSPECTIVE CCP DONORS: Participants undergo collection of blood and/or nasopharyngeal swabs
      at the time of screening. Participants' medical records are reviewed.

      CONVALESCENT BLOOD DONORS WHO CHOOSE NOT TO DONATE CCP: Participants undergo collection of
      blood sample at the time of screening. Participants' medical records are reviewed.

      CCP RECIPIENTS: Patients undergo collection collection of blood samples at baseline, between
      CCP unit infusions, 24 hours after last CCP infusion, and between 14-28 after last CCP
      infusion. Patients' medical records are reviewed.
