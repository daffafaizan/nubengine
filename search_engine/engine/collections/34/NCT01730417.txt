      I 123 in normal human volunteers. The low specific activity iobenguane I 123 has been shown
      to be useful for the detection and staging of neuroendocrine tumors in adults and children
      and imaging neuronal activity in the heart. The innovation in this proposal is through the
      use of patented solid phase technology to produce a proven diagnostic agent at extremely high
      specific activity to increase sensitivity and specificity and lower radiation exposure to
      normal organs without the pharmacologically active cold carrier compound. The FDA considers
      iobenguane labeled with two different isotopes of iodine [I-131 and I-123] as two distinct
      drugs requiring distinct regulatory applications.

      To meet the required quality standards for the chemistry, manufacturing and controls
      component of an IND application, GMP quality polymer drug precursor is used to generate the
      Ultratrace diagnostic iodine-123 agent. Analytical methods were validated with the proposed
      final drug formulation to demonstrate the final drug does not interfere with tests used to
      define the identity, purity, and strength of the agent. The drug product was verified for
      apyrogenicity and sterility before human testing. The IND application was written and
      submitted to the FDA and the Duke Medical Center IRB. MIP produces clinical trial material,
      and will conduct human testing of the radioactive drug substance for safety and superiority
      compared to conventional iobenguane I 123 in normal healthy volunteers.
