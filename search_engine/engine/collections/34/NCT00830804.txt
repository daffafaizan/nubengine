      decade, current first-line ART regimens are imperfect. The ideal combination, unlike some
      current first-line options, would have uncompromised efficacy in the presence of transmitted
      drug-resistant variants. The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the cumulative
      proportion of ART-naive participants experiencing virologic failure at or prior to week 24
      after initiating raltegravir (RAL) plus darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/RTV).

      The study will last 52 weeks. All participants will follow the same treatment schedule and
      take RAL plus DRV/RTV orally daily for the duration of the trial.

      After entry, all participants will have scheduled visits at weeks 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, and
      52. Medical/medication history, blood and urine collection, and liver function tests will
      occur at screening. A targeted physical exam and concomitant medications history will occur
      at all study visits. Blood and urine collection and liver function tests will occur at most
      study visits. For females, a pregnancy test will occur at screening and study entry.

      RAL and DRV were provided by the study. RTV was not provided by the study.
