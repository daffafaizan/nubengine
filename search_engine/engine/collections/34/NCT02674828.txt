        1. To determine if the reinforcement intervention increases walking. The proportion of days
           on which participants meet walking goals will be assessed via Fitbit, a commercially
           available activity monitor, as well as continuous weeks on which goals are met. The
           hypothesis is that patients assigned to the reinforcement intervention will meet walking
           goals on a higher proportion of days and have longer durations of meeting walking goals
           than patients assigned to standard care.

        2. To assess if the intervention reduces A1c. Patients randomized to the reinforcement
           intervention are expected to have greater decreases in A1c than patients in usual care.

      In addition to the primary aims, secondary outcomes will also be evaluated. The intervention
      is expected to enhance subjective and objective indices of fitness, increase quality of life,
      improve indices of diabetes management and decrease depression symptoms. Predictors of
      response to treatment will also be evaluated.

      Results from this pilot study will be instrumental for guiding a subsequent, larger and
      longer term randomized study for evaluating reinforcement interventions for improving
      outcomes of youth and young adults with T1D.
