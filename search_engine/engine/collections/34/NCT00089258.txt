        -  Determine the efficacy of beta-glucan, isotretinoin, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in
           enhancing monoclonal antibody 3F8-mediated ablation in patients with high-risk
           refractory neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen, in terms of assessing disease status
           in the bone marrow by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
           reaction, in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are stratified according to refractory disease
      (primary refractory [never had disease progression or disease recurrence] vs secondary
      refractory [recurrent disease that did not respond completely to reinduction therapy]).

        -  Courses 1 and 2: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on
           days -5 to 11. Patients also receive oral beta-glucan once daily on days -2 to 11 and
           monoclonal antibody (MOAB) 3F8 IV over 30-90 minutes on days 0-4 and 7-11.

        -  Courses 3 and 4: Patients receive GM-CSF, beta-glucan, and MOAB 3F8 as above. Patients
           also receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days -2 to 11.

      Treatment repeats every 2-4 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-74 patients (10-33 for stratum 1 and 17-41 for stratum 2)
      will be accrued for this study.
