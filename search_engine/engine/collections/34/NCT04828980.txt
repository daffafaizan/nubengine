      non-pharmacologic strategies to improve pain may help reduce narcotic use. Further,
      preoperative anxiety is common and can impact postoperative pain, analgesic requirements, and
      recovery. In addition to facilitating with postoperative pain control, VR may have a role in
      reducing preoperative anxiety. However, it is unclear whether different VR experiences may be
      more beneficial for different clinical applications.

      This study will evaluate if there are differences in preoperative anxiety and postoperative
      pain when utilizing different VR experiences. Patients undergoing head and neck surgery will
      be randomly allocated preoperatively to first participate in either a mindfulness or active
      gaming VR experience, and then postoperatively will crossover and participate in the other
      experience they did not utilize prior to surgery.
