      character of the results of the studies conducted to date and of a relatively low number of
      studies investigating the effectiveness of HMB supplementation over a longer period on a
      large population of trained athletes, the aim of this study was to verify the effect of
      12-week with HMB and a placebo supplementation on body composition, anaerobic and aerobic
      capacity, as well as concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained
      athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.
