      previously developed for chronic back pain can improve the multiple somatic complaints
      associated with the COVID Long Haul Syndrome in patients without evidence of ongoing tissue
      injury. We will perform a 12-week intervention consisting of a series of classes which will
      focus on knowledge therapy, desensitization, emotional expression, and stress reduction.
