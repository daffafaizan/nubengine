      effectiveness and screening is associated with potential harms. Patient Decision Aids (PDAs)
      are tools that assist users to understand treatment options, risks and benefits to align
      decisions with values and preferences. The investigators would now like to know whether use
      of a PDA alongside evidence-based information provided through the McMaster Optimal Aging
      Portal, or simply access to evidence-based information alone, can help users to make informed
      decisions about breast cancer screening in women.
