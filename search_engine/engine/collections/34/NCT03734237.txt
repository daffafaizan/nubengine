      egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines to the effectiveness of two other types of licensed
      vaccines, the cell-culture based inactivated influenza vaccine and the recombinant influenza
      vaccine, in the prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in active duty
      members, military retirees, and other DoD beneficiaries. Military treatment facilities (MTFs)
      in the United States will participate in this protocol. Enrollment will be restricted to
      adults (â‰¥18 years and older) who are preparing to receive seasonal influenza vaccination at
      participating DoD sites. Subjects will be randomized to receive one of the three licensed
      influenza vaccines types for evaluation of effectiveness. There is no exclusion for
      pregnancy, as none of these licensed products are contraindicated in pregnant women.
