      condition with serious consequences, especially in older people, as it may lead to falls and
      consequent fractures. One of the most common causes of dizziness is the so-called Benign
      Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). Patients with BPPV typically have severe vertigo
      provoked by a change in head position.

      Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo can now be accurately diagnosed, and distinguished form
      other dizziness producing conditions, in the physician's office and without any sophisticated
      diagnostics tools. Furthermore, it can be treated in the office setting by specific head
      positioning maneuvers (Canalith Repositioning Procedure) that are easy to learn and perform.

      The Canalith Repositioning Procedure is currently almost exclusively performed in specialized
      settings by ENT and Internal Medicine specialists. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in
      these settings. However, to-date no studies have been conducted in the primary care settings
      about the use and efficacy of the procedure, where the condition is first seen and assessed.

      This is a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the procedure performed by family
      doctors cures dizziness.
