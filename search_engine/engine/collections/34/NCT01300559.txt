      One retrospective study by Snyder et al evaluated hemostatic efficacy of this technology in
      children undergoing surgery for spinal fusion and instrumentation. Although the study
      reported no statistically significant difference in transfusion rates, there was a reduction
      in amount of blood transfused and operative time which was attributed to hemostatic efficacy
      in comparison with conventional wound management during surgery. The surgeons also reported a
      clearer operative field, improving visualization during surgery. Finally, the reduction in
      operative time which they suggested might be due to the use of this new device may reduce
      other complications by diminishing overall anesthesia exposure and blood product
      transfusions. From this initial retrospective study, the authors concluded that the use of
      the TissueLink HemoSealing device in spine surgery may be an effective tool in control of
      intra- and post-operative blood loss and may significantly reduce blood related and operative
      complications. More rigorous research needs to be done to evaluate the efficacy of the
      TissueLink HemoSealing device in hemostasis in the area of spine surgery.
