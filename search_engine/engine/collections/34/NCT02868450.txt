      development of molecular tools, the natural history of this bacterium continued to clarify.
      The currently proposed scheme is as follows: after contamination human oral-oral or fecal,
      patients will develop acute infections such as bacteremia, gastroenteritis and pneumonia.
      They can then produce specific antibodies. Likely depending on the host-related factors,
      three types of evolution appear to be possible: (i) some patients eliminate the bacteria and
      develop specific antibodies. (ii) some patients are chronic carriers of the bacterium with a
      strong immune response. (iii) Finally, patients develop subacute or chronic infections, with
      an insufficient immune response or non-existent answer to T. whipplei.

      Subacute or chronic infections include Whipple's disease characterized by histological
      involvement of the small intestine, as well as localized without digestive impairment, such
      as endocarditis or encephalitis. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, patients with
      Whipple's disease will present relapse (30-40% of patients), but also of re-infection with
      different genotypes of T. whipplei.

      Here the hypothesis is that HLA-DRB 13 and/or HLA-DQB1 06 alleles are associated with the
      presence of chronic infections with T. whipplei (defined by classic Whipple disease and / or
      endocarditis and/or encephalitis)
