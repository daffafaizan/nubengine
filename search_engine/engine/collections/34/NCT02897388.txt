      infancy and extending into adulthood, and breast milk feeding is promoted by numerous
      professional organizations. However, for various reasons, in neonatal intensive care unit in
      China, most infants are separated from their parents and are fed infant formula exclusively.
      To address this problem, the investigators propose to carry out a pilot study to assess the
      prevalence of breast milk feeding in a NICU of a tertiary teaching hospital in China, and
      then to introduce an intervention program to increase the prevalence of breast milk feeding
      and to evaluate the impact of this program.

      The intervention would include building a nutrition team in the NICU, training of a lactation
      coordinator and nursing staff by a team from Mount Sinai Hospital, providing parents with
      education on breast milk feeding, providing access to breast pumps through a lend/lease
      program and providing a breast pumping room for parents. The investigators will collect data
      on breast milk feeding, including prevalence and reasons for not breast milk feeding during
      both the pre-intervention and intervention period. The investigators will also assess the
      enrolled infants' weight gain from admission to discharge, incidence of nosocomial infection
      and mortality, and average length of stay in the NICU, to assess the efficacy of the breast
      milk feeding intervention.

      This trial has the potential to dramatically change feeding of infants in Chinese NICUs from
      exclusive infant formula to breast milk, with potential impacts on nosocomial infection,
      growth, development and hospital length of stay.
