      relationship between the two diseases is well established. HIV increases the risk for TB
      acquisition, reactivation, and reinfection, and reduces survival compared to patients with TB
      alone. In individuals with HIV, TB infection results in reduced survival, increased risk for
      opportunistic infections, and elevations in HIV replication. Improving the outcome of
      HIV-infected individuals who develop TB is of high importance. Initiating antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) shortly after initiating TB treatment may improve outcomes in individuals
      co-infected with HIV and TB. However, data to support this suggestion were limited before
      this study began. This study will determine the most appropriate time to initiate ART in
      HIV-infected individuals who recently initiated treatment for TB.

      This study lasted 48 weeks and comprised two steps. At study entry, participants underwent
      clinical assessment, drug adherence training, and blood collection. In Step 1, participants
      were randomly assigned to one of two arms. Participants in Arm A initiated ART after
      approximately 2 weeks of TB treatment. Participants in Arm B deferred ART until after 8 to 12
      weeks of TB treatment. In Step 2, Arm B participants initiated ART; Arm A participants did
      not enter Step 2. ART consisted of efavirenz (EFV) and emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF); FTC and TDF could be given as individual agents. Drug
      substitutions could be made for participants who could not tolerate the specified regimen.
      Blood collection and clinical assessments occurred at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48.
