      obstruction diagnosed in the neonatal period. If left untreated, this obstruction leads to
      biliary cirrhosis and early death. Although considered a rare disease (between 1/15,000 and
      1/20000 births), it is the leading cause of neonatal cholestasis and liver transplantation in
      children. The reasons for this obstruction are still poorly known and might involve several
      factors (immune, infectious and possible toxin effect). The accumulating evidence point to
      genetic factors involved, yet they are not of the classic monogenic or Mendelian types. The
      purpose of this study is to collect the fluid samples, explanted liver tissue samples and
      dermal biopsy samples to enable investigators to perform the genetic and molecular analyses
      that might point to the gene(s) and cellular pathway involved in etiology of BA disease.
