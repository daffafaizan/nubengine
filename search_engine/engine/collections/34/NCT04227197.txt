    
      Background: The overwhelming majority of people with Down syndrome do not have access to
      specialty clinics, a disparity resulting in delayed or missed diagnoses and significant
      untreated co-morbidities. To meet this critical gap in needs, the investigators created "Down
      Syndrome Clinic to You" (DSC2U), a novel, web-based tool created for caregivers of
      individuals with Down syndrome, which generates personalized recommendations for the
      caregiver and the patient's primary care provider (PCP).

      Methods: In a national, randomized controlled trial of 230 caregivers who had children or
      dependents with Down syndrome without access to a Down syndrome specialist, 117 were
      randomized to receive DSC2U and 113 to receive usual-care. The primary outcome was adherence
      to five health evaluations indicated by national guidelines for Down syndrome: celiac screen,
      sleep study, thyroid test, audiogram, and ophthalmology evaluation.
