      (HBOC) may be considered in the treatment of several ischemic conditions, such as acute
      coronary syndromes (ACS). Elective percutaneous intervention (PCI) induces transient
      myocardial ischemia due to reduction of coronary flow during balloon inflation in the
      coronary artery, thus simulating in a control setting, the occurrence of an ACS.
