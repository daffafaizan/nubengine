      The patients who undergo laparoscopic surgery acquired fewer doses of analgesics than who
      undergo laparotomy. This point is also one of the advantages of the laparoscopic surgery. The
      fascia closure in fascial defects larger than 10 mm diameters in laparoscopic surgery is an
      important issue. Incisional hernias may occur after laparoscopic surgery. The surgeons prefer
      the techniques in fascial closure which is more safe and cause less pain. In current study,
      investigators aim to compare the post-operative incisional pain in two different techniques
      in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery; conventional versus by 'Berci Fascial Closure'.
