      outpatient study conducted at multiple sites throughout the US in healthy children aged 6
      months to less than 36 months. Parents/guardians of subjects were asked to read and sign the
      informed consent before any study-related procedures were performed. Subjects at each study
      site were sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 separate blood sample groups referred to as
      "cellular immunity" or "antibody secreting cell". Subjects within each blood sample group
      were then randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a single intranasal dose of CAIV-T 10^7 FFU per dose,
      CAIV-T 10^5 FFU per dose, placebo or a commercially-available injectable trivalent influenza
      vaccine (TIV).
