      stimulation modality that has been shown to have the ability to modulate both cortical and
      deep brain structure activity. This technique has undergone a significant amount of
      investigation in varied neuropsychiatric populations and interest in this technique has
      increased dramatically as of late.

      Some researchers have studied the effects of this modality on sleep as well as memory with
      promising results. One such study demonstrated that by using bilateral tDCS with a pattern of
      stimulation in the delta frequency range (0-3 Hz) delivered during slow wave sleep, that it
      is possible to increase delta power during slow wave sleep, as well as improve sleep
      efficiency. In addition to showing that it is possible to enhance slow waves, it was also
      demonstrated that this increase was associated with an improvement of a measure of
      declarative memory consolidation (one of the theorized functions of slow wave sleep).
      Enhancing memory function in a normal healthy group raises the possibility that it would also
      be possible to enhance memory in clinical populations who would benefit from such an
      intervention.

      The investigators propose to test this intervention for replication in a similar cohort.
