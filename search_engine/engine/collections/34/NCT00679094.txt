      I. Assess the toxicity of single-dose Bowman-Birk Inhibitor Concentrate (BBIC) when
      administered as a suspension in orange juice in healthy male participants.

      II. Determine the appropriate dose range and doses to be used in a subsequent phase I
      multiple-dose BBIC study that will be based upon the data gathered from this phase I
      single-dose study.

      III. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of single-dose BBIC.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Bowman-Birk Inhibitor Concentrate (BBIC).
      Participants are sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose level cohorts. One participant in each
      dose level cohort is randomized to receive placebo or BBIC.

      Participants receive a single dose of oral BBIC or placebo, as an orange juice suspension,
      immediately followed by consumption of a defined low-fat breakfast. Participants continue to
      consume a low-fat diet for the next 48 hours and then resume their normal diet.

      Participants undergo blood and urine sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic
      studies. Samples are analyzed by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure
      concentrations of BBIC and its metabolites in serum and urine.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed once weekly for 4 weeks.
