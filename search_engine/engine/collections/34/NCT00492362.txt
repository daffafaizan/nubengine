    
      Study Design:

      Prospective, randomized, controlled trial of chronic hemodialysis outpatients within the
      Manitoba Renal Program.

      Potential patients include any individual receiving chronic outpatient hemodialysis in
      Winnipeg (Seven Oaks, Sherbrook, Central and St. Boniface dialysis units) and the Brandon
      hemodialysis unit.

      Exercise Interventions:

      Patients will be block randomized to one of the following 2 interventions:

      Group A: Cycling on an ergometer GOAL 60 minutes 3 times per week on hemodialysis for 24
      weeks A cycling ergometer will be placed on the floor in front of the patient's dialysis
      chair or at the foot of the bed (if there are only beds available in that unit). The patient
      will be allowed to exercise anytime during the first half of each dialysis treatment. Goal
      frequency will be 3 times per week during their usual scheduled hemodialysis treatments.

      Group B: Pedometers This group will each receive a pedometer (StepsCountÂ®) at the onset of
      the study following exercise testing. They will be educated regarding the technical use of
      the pedometer and will receive the handout entitled "Pedometer Information Sheet: Get
      Physically Active One Step at a Time!" They will also receive verbal education regarding use
      of the pedometer and goal activity levels from the exercise study supervisor.
