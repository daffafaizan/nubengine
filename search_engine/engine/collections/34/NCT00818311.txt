      develop new indications or to optimize the result already obtained in the treatment of
      wrinkles around the eyes. We therefore propose to perform a safety clinical trial with male
      and female volunteers with different schedules per day or per week.

      A total of 100 subjects (male and female) will be randomized in the study according to the
      following schedule of exposure:

      Group A: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED twice a week for one
      cycle (35 seconds) with an interval between treatments of at least 2 days, during a treatment
      period of 4 weeks.

      Group B: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED twice a week for two
      consecutive cycles (35 seconds each) with an interval between treatments of at least 2 days,
      during a treatment period of 4 weeks.

      Group C: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for one cycle (35
      seconds) twice a day (morning and evening). This treatment will be repeated twice a week with
      an interval between treatments of at least 2 days, during a treatment period of 4 weeks.

      Group D: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for one cycle (35
      seconds) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4 weeks.

      Group E: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for two consecutive
      cycles (35 seconds each) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4
      weeks.

      treatment period of 4 weeks.

      Group D: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for one cycle (35
      seconds) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4 weeks.

      Group E: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for two consecutive

      weeks.
