      moderate to severe hemorrhagic cystitis as determined by a physician. A total of up to 12
      subjects are anticipated and will be enrolled in study sites in the United States. Enrollment
      is expected to be completed within one year of initiating the study. The proposed trial will
      recruit 12 subjects in a dose-escalation trial where 4 subjects will be allocated into each
      one of three groups.
