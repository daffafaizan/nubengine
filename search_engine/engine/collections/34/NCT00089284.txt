    
      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of motexafin gadolinium followed by a phase II
      study. Patients are stratified according to extent of lymphomatous involvement (≤ 5% vs > 5
      but ≤ 24% of cellular elements).

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of motexafin gadolinium
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which
      2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) OR the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience DLT.

        -  Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose level as in
           phase I.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months and then monthly for 5 years.
