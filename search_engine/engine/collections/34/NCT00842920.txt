    
      This is a national multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial allowing
      for a minimum follow-up time of 24 months in conversion-free patients. Randomization will be

           (according to the guidelines of the German Society of Cardiology for the primary
           prevention of cardiovascular disease); patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2
           treatment (1) Simvastatin (60 mg) one tablet/day (2) Placebo one tablet/day.

        2. "low-statins": patients treated with low doses of Statins; patients will be randomly
           assigned to one of 2 treatment (1) Simvastatin (60 mg) one tablet/day (2) 20 mg
           Simvastatin one tablet/day.
