      to a healthier level. Zetiaâ„¢ (ezetimibe) 10 mg is available by prescription for the treatment
      of high cholesterol. While Zetia has been shown to inhibit the absorption of dietary
      cholesterol into the bloodstream, its effects on oxysterol absorption from the diet have not
      been completely evaluated.
