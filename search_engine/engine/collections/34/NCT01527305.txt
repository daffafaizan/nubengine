      (looking forward using periodic observations collected predominantly following participant
      enrollment), non-comparative and multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety
      of paliperidone palmitate in acute schizophrenic participants. This study consists of a
      screening phase (up to 7 days), treatment phase (13 weeks), and a study completion or early
      withdrawal visit. Safety evaluations will include adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      concomitant medications, physical examination, and vital signs, which will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for each participant will be
      approximately 13 weeks.
