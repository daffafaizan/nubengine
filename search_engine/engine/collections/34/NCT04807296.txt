      urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The holmium:
      yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho: YAG) laser is the longest running and most studied laser used to
      perform this minimally invasive procedure.

      Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) reduces hospital stay and hemoglobin drop
      while improving IPSS and quality of life, as well as other positive postoperative outcomes.
      HoLEP has been found to have a better enucleation efficiency rate and may have better
      hemostatic properties when combined with the modulated pulsed laser energy featured
      associated with Moses technology (m-HoLEP).

      A novel laser technology called thulium fiber laser (TFL) delivers a pulsed laser at a more
      optimal wavelength and a shallower depth of tissue penetration leading to better hemostatic
      properties. However, the differences in clinical outcomes between TFL enucleation of the
      prostate (TFLEP) and m-HoLEP, to our knowledge, have yet to be described.

      This prospective study aims to compare the safety profile and clinical outcomes,
      peri-operatively up to one year post-operatively, between m-HoLEP and TFLEP with BPH and
      evidence of bladder obstruction. Variables of particular interest include the length of
      hospital stay and the need for blood transfusion, which are benefits of both techniques
      compared to transurethral resection of the prostate, the current gold standard of BPH
      treatment according to American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines. The results of this
      study will guide urologists in selecting the most appropriate procedure from the growing
      armamentarium of treatments for BPH.
