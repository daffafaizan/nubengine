      developing it at some point in their lives. Most bowel cancers happen when a type of polyp (a
      growth in the bowel) called an adenoma becomes cancerous. Doctors use a camera test, known as
      a colonoscopy, to look inside the bowel and find these polyps and remove them. Removing
      precancerous polyps is known to reduce the chances of a person developing bowel cancer in the
      future. How good colonoscopists are at finding these polyps varies, and there is a lot of
      research into how to improve "adenoma detection rates".

      A new device, called the Endocuff Vision (a small plastic device attached to the end of the
      colonoscope which helps by holding the folds of the bowel back to give a clear view of the
      inside of the bowel) has been shown to improve the rate of polyp detection at colonoscopy,
      and to make polyp removal easier. Previous small studies have shown that there is a
      significant improvement in detection of adenomas when an Endocuff Vision is used (with the
      rate of detection of adenomas rising from 49% to 66%). Colonoscopists who have used the
      Endocuff Vision before also feel that polyp removal is easier when it is on the colonoscope.
      This study will randomise patients coming for colonoscopy to have their procedure performed
      as usual (i.e. without the Endocuff Vision attached) or as an Endocuff Vision-assisted
      colonoscopy. The investigators will record polyp and adenoma detection rates, duration of
      procedure, participant comfort levels, and complications. All patients referred for
      colonoscopy (via the symptomatic service, surveillance procedures, and the Bowel Cancer
      Screening Programme) will be invited in 7 centres (a mixture of specialist centres and
      district general hospitals), recruiting a total of 1772 participants.
