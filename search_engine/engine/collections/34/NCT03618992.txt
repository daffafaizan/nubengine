    
      Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever, is a fungal condition most commonly seen in
      Arizona and can affect multiple organs, including the skin, lung, bone, joints, and central
      nervous system. Oral antifungal therapy such as fluconazole is the first-line medication to
      treat coccidioidomycosis. Through the investigator's clinical observations at the Valley
      Fever Center for Excellence, nearly all patients who have been placed on systemic azole
      treatment show some extent of cosmetic changes in their skin and hair, such as dry skin,
      chapped lips, hair loss, and change in hair characteristics. The goals of the study are to 1)
      understand the cosmetic changes in the skin and hair in patients initiating and discontinuing
      long-term oral antifungals, and 2) to examine whether cholesterol-based
      commercially-available moisturizers for the skin and for the hair can improve the cosmetic
      appearance better than a vehicle without these cholesterol ingredients.
