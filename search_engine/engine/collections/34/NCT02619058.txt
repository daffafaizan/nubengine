      years, with the approval of immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies. NKT cells are a potent
      immunoregulatory cell population heavily implicated in promoting immunity to infection and
      cancer. And now with new generation of amplification method, more than 1,000 folds
      amplification of NKT cells can be obtained, so NKT cell based adoptive cell transfer is now
      available and might show its efficacy in melanoma. Investigators conducted this open label,
      dose escalation, phase I clinical trial of to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of intravenous administration of autologous NKT Cells in
      metastatic melanoma patients.
