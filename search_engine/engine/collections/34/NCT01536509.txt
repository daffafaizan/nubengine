      protocol to improve medication adherence in children and adolescents with IBD via a
      randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants in the TBT condition will be compared to
      those in an education only (EO) condition. In order to examine clinical significance of the
      intervention, treatment outcomes will include disease severity, HRQOL, and health care
      utilization. This randomized controlled clinical trial for nonadherence to medication
      randomizes participants to either the TBT or EO intervention condition, with assessments
      occurring at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Both conditions
      will participate in a self-guided educational intervention during week 6 of enrollment, with
      three intervention sessions at weeks 8, 10, and 12. A 4-week run-in phase immediately
      preceding randomization is utilized to establish participants' baseline adherence.
      Assessments will occur at week 5 (Baseline Assessment 1), week 14 (Post-treatment Assessment
      2), and 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-treatment follow-up (Assessments 3, 4, and 5). Intervention
      topics will differ for each condition; however, the frequency of contact is equivalent across
      conditions.
