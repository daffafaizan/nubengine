      performance and increased pulmonary pressures during neonatal life and at different pediatric
      ages.

      The principal investigator also hypothesize that premature newborns with poor cardiac
      performance and/or pulmonary hypertension have higher morbidities and poorer
      neuro-developmental outcomes.

      The principal investigator also hypothesize that premature newborns with poor cardiac
      performance and/or pulmonary hypertension have higher morbidities and poorer
      neuro-developmental outcomes and that novel echocardiography techniques will detect anomalies
      not uncovered by conventional imaging, and that early echocardiography may identify those
      with later pulmonary hypertension.
