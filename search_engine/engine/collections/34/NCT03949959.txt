      enrolment of 3 patients undergoing PRPt, and 3 patients undergoing PRPu following PRP. There
      will be a variable length baseline (A1) and then a staggered start to provide internal
      validity - one patient starting at 5 days (post-PRP), one at 8 (post-PRP) and one at 11 days
      post-PRP, randomly allocated. This study will utilise an A1-B-A2 design: a baseline (A1 no
      intervention); intervention phase (B); and a no intervention (A2 follow up).

      Primary outcome measures will be collected daily during this time period. The baseline phase
      will be followed by a 6-week intervention period (B). Participants will have 10 one hour
      sessions over a 6-week period. The intervention will be delivered by an experienced
      physiotherapist with postgraduate qualifications. During the intervention period, once or
      twice per week the daily collection of the primary outcome measures will coincide with the
      delivery of each intervention session. The intervention phase will be followed by a 12-week
      follow-up phase (A2) where participants will have no contact with the intervention personnel.
      This follow-up phase is implemented in order to determine the possible duration of
      improvement post intervention. All outcome measures will be collected at the completion of
      this 12-week follow-up period.

      Secondary outcome measures for generalisation purposes will be collected prior to commencing
      PRP, at the end of the intervention period (which coincides with the commencement of the
      no-intervention period), and at the end of the no-intervention period; totalling 3 sampling
      points throughout the study duration.
