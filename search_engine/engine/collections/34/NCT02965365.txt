      neonatal respiratory distress. However there is not an adequate method to diagnose or rule
      out TTN.

      In several studies pulmonary artery Doppler indices are investigated as the possible
      indicators of pulmonary function. As a result of these studies, physiological processes in
      fetal lung maturation were established; pulmonary tissue impedance or resistance decreases
      with increasing gestational age, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow. In a normal lung
      maturation process the peak sistolic velocity is reached in midsystole, but in case of any
      reason disturbing the nornal development process,the peak occurs earlier.

      We suggested that TTN, which is a factor increasing pulmonary tissue impedance like
      respiratory distress syndrome(RDS) and pulmonary hypoplasia, would change pulmonary
      artery(PA) Doppler indices, thus by the way of evaluating pulmonary artery Doplerr indices,
      we could predict possible diagnosis of TTN
