    
      This is a prospective, acceptability study in fifteen (15) participants aged three (3) years
      and over, who are established on a ketogenic diet (KD), of Krio to aid in the management of
      their diet.

      Participants will be provided with a 7-day supply of Krio and will be asked to complete a
      daily diary and short questionnaire to record information allowing assessment the following:

        -  Gastrointestinal tolerance

        -  Palatability

        -  Compliance

      Krio is a Food for Special Medical Purposes (FSMP) and is intended for use in the KD. It has
      a fat to protein and carbohydrate ratio of 3 to 1. This makes it appropriate for inclusion in
      all versions of the KD: classical, medium chain triglyceride (MCT), modified Atkins diet
      (MAD) and low glycaemic index (LGI). It is suitable from 3 years of age.

      Krio is presented as a ready to eat solid bar (28g), with no additional preparation required.
      It contains fat (20g per bar), protein and carbohydrate with added sweetener and flavourings.
      It does not contain any added micronutrients.

      The recommended intake of the product for each participant will be determined by a dietitian.
      The quantity to be consumed daily will be recommended on an individual patient basis, but
      will be a minimum of 1 bar.

      Product acceptability data from 15 participants are required in order to submit an
      application to the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) for product
      registration.
