    
      Hall, et al. have observed retrospectively that treatment with topical prostaglandin F2 alpha
      analogs (applied either to the eye or fingernail bed) significantly reduced the frequency,
      severity and duration of headaches in migraine sufferers, as well as their migraine
      disability assessment score (MIDAS).

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective clinical study to determine if the
      effect of FDA-approved bimatoprost, a prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, has anti-migraine
      activity when administered topically to people suffering from migraine.
