      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil when administered
           with cetuximab and radiotherapy in patients with stage II or III squamous cell carcinoma
           of the esophagus. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the postoperative complication rate and lethality in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the R0 resection rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the event-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the metabolic response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil followed by
      an open-label, phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-90 minutes on days -15, -8, 1, 8, 15, 22,
           and 29; oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on days 1, 8, 22, and 29; and fluorouracil IV
           continuously on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33. Patients undergo radiotherapy
           on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33. Patients then undergo radical esophagectomy
           29-42 days after the completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive oxaliplatin and fluorouracil as in phase I at the MTD
           determined in phase I. Patients also receive cetuximab and undergo radiotherapy and
           radical esophagectomy as in phase I.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
