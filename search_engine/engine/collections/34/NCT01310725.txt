      Each patient receive a radial artery graft and a vein graft harvested with a pedicle of
      surrounding tissue to the right and left side of the heart respectively. The left internal
      mammary artery is used for the left anterior descending artery in a skeletonised or
      non-skeletonised fashion.

      The evaluation is made with angiography up to 5 years after surgery.
