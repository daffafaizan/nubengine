    
      The study is based on an anonymous questionnaire that is distributed among polish surgeons
      across the country. The questionnaire focuses on the demographic data of the surgeon, their
      experience in years, a few questions regarding their experience in the field of
      cholecystectomy surgery and questions about whether or not they are familiar with the SAGES
      Safe Cholecystectomy Program, Teaching Program for the Culture of Safety in Cholecystectomy,
      as well as Updated Tokyo Guidelines for the management of acute cholangitis and
      cholecystitis. The questionnaire is available as an appendix. It is then followed by the list
      of all the Rules of SAGES Safe Cholecystectomy Program with questions about the usefulness of
      each of the rule, evaluated in form of a 10-point numeric scale (0 - completely useless, 9 -
      critical).

      The collected data will be subject to statistical analysis, the result of which will form the
      base for creating the Polish Program for Safe Cholecystectomy that will serve to increase the
      safety of this very common surgical procedure.
