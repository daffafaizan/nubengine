    
      The required sample size has been calculated using IBM© Sample Power© version 3 .The primary
      outcome measure is the prevalence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in the 1st and 3rd
      trimesters.

      Accordingly, it is estimated that a sample of 240 patients in either study group would have a
      power of 80% (beta error, 0.2) to detect a statistically significant difference of 9% between
      the two groups as regards the incidence of SUI.

      The incidence of SUI is assumed to equal 10% in the 1st trimester. The prevalence of SUI in
      the 3rd trimester is assumed to equal 10% under the null hypothesis and to equal 19% under
      the alternative hypothesis.

      This calculation used a two-sided z test with a confidence level of 95% (alpha error, 0.05).

      Data will be collected, tabulated, then analyzed using IBM© SPSS© Statistics version 22.

      Normally distributed numerical data will be presented as mean and SD, and skewed data as
      median and inter-quartile range.

      Qualitative data will be presented as number and percentage.Comparison of normally
      distributed numerical data will be done using the unpaired Student t test. Skewed data will
      be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

      Categorical data will be compared using the chi-squared test, or Fisher's exact test when
      appropriate.

      A two-sided p-value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant .
