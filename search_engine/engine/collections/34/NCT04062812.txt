      Observational Registration of variables for analysis.

      Study population Inclusi√≥n/exclusion criteria:

      Adult patients (regardless of their underlying pathology), who develop acute renal failure,
      admitted to the ICU of St Pau Hospital with the Intensive Medicine medical team, who require
      citrate anticoagulation in continuous dialysis therapy and are treated with Baxter
      "Prismaflex" monitor.

      Patients who meet the criteria described above will be followed up in this study.

      Expected sample size:

      It is estimated that with 10 patients will be enough to achieve our goal.

      Methodology. Information sources:

      The start of the treatment with Baxter citrate will be given according to the patient's need
      and subject to a basic medical decision. From here the research team will enter. The
      investigation team will never influence the medical decision.

      Since such a treatment is started, the main investigator will assign a number to the dialysis
      circuit and will be followed, every six hours, for the most important variables. The rest of
      the variables will be collected at least once a day and according to the patient's situation.
