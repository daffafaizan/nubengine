      instrumental in presenting antigens (such as HIV antigens) to the body's immune system. Since
      dendritic cells are not functioning maximally in HIV-infected patients, infusion of dendritic
      cells from an HIV-negative sibling may enable the affected sibling's immune system to
      recognize foreign particles more readily and increase immune response against the virus.

      Dendritic cells from an HIV-negative sibling are obtained and treated with various viral
      proteins (HIV vaccines) or immunomodulators. The treated dendritic cells are infused into the
      HIV-infected patient monthly for 6 months. Siblings must be able to donate on multiple
      occasions, and patients are followed every 2-4 weeks during the study. Patients are screened
      over 3 months prior to study entry.
