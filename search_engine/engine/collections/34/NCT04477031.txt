      arguments against fasting (kidney toxicity, vasovagal reaction, discomfort) and seams
      unusefull regarding it's main goal : reducing nausea and vomiting. The investigators propose
      to assess frequency of nausea and vomiting among patients having taken their breakfast at
      home before day care angiography.

      The investigators hypothesise that less than 1% of non fasting patients will suffer of
      vomitint.
