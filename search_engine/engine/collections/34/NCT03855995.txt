      during study follow-up visits at the community level as well outpatient and inpatient visits.

      Enhanced hospitalisation surveillance (EHS) is defined as case detection during
      hospitalisation through monitoring of medical records and registries for the study
      participants not enrolled in active surveillance.

      The study targets enrolling at least 45,000 children in active surveillance (AS), including
      22,500 in the exposed clusters and 22,500 in the unexposed clusters for evaluation of the
      vaccine safety, effectiveness and impact. In the exposed clusters are included a minimum of
      20,250 children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E for evaluation of the vaccine safety, and a
      minimum of 2,250 unvaccinated children for evaluation of effectiveness and impact assuming
      that 80% of the 22,500 study participants will receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01E, 10% will
      receive one or two doses and 10% will not have any dose.

      The Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) is considering implementing the malaria
      vaccine in unexposed clusters as from 2023. This decision will directly impact the temporal
      (before/after) and concurrent (exposed versus unexposed clusters) comparisons. Based on this,
      the EHS recruitment will be stopped as from 01 January 2023 in sites that were not involved
      in the NCT02374450 study and study conclusion will be conducted in a timely manner for
      already enrolled subjects in those sites (EHS will stop in all sites in Malawi, Siaya and
      Nyando sites in Kenya and unexposed sites in Ghana).
