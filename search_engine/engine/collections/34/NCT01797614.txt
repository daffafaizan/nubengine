      ventilation and recruited respiratory muscles to work. Previous study showed that
      transdiaphragmatic pressure was increasing while pressure support was reducing. However, the
      transdiaphragmatic pressure required invasive procedure to measure and not used frequently in
      weaning. IAP reflects the pleural pressure. If the PEEP is not changed, change of IAP is
      largely due to change of transpulmonary pressure.

      Study Aim:

        1. To evaluate the patterns of change of IAP during SBT

        2. To predict success of SBT by the change of IAP

        3. To predict weaning outcome by the change of IAP
