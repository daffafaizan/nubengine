      smoking cessation when compared to placebo. We have developed, tested, and validated an
      efficient Phase 2a screening procedure that optimally combines the validity of randomized
      clinical trials with the practicality of lab- based medication studies. Notably, it employs a
      within-subject, cross-over design comparing active versus placebo effects on quitting smoking
      to maximize statistical power without a large sample, in contrast to the large samples needed
      for between-groups randomized treatment conditions. Using this procedure, we will evaluate
      effects of JNJ-39393406 vs. placebo on short-term smoking abstinence in smokers who already
      have a high interest in quitting soon. We predict that, compared with placebo, JNJ-39393406
      will increase days of abstinence, identifying initial evidence of efficacy for smoking
      cessation. Our main dependent measure is days of very stringent biochemically validated
      (expired CO<5 ppm) 24-hr smoking abstinence, with post-quit withdrawal and cognitive function
      as secondary measures. Potential for adverse side-effects will be assessed at each visit.
