    
      This is a multicenter, Phase Ib/II study that combines Luspatercept and Lenalidomide in
      people with lower-risk, non-del(5q) MDS for whom ESAs were ineffective or who are unlikely to
      respond to ESAs, with a baseline serum EPO level >200.

      Lenalidomide, also known as RevlimidÂ® is an FDA approved drug for some types of lymphoma and
      for those who have a different type of MDS than what is being looked at in this study.
      Lenalidomide is considered investigational (experimental) in this study because it is being
      used in a different setting than the FDA approval. Lenalidomide blocks the development of
      abnormal cells, prevents the growth of blood vessels within tumors, and also stimulates
      specialized cells of the immune system to attack the abnormal cells.

      Luspatercept, also known as Reblozyl, has been recently approved by the FDA for those with
      lower-risk MDS. Luspatercept works by helping red blood cells grow and mature.

      There are 2 parts to this study: part 1 is referred to as phase I and part 2 is referred to
      as phase II.

        -  The goal of phase I is to find the safest dosing schedule of Luspatercept in combination
           with Lenalidomide

        -  The goal of phase II is to use the safest dosing schedule (found in phase I) to assess
           the independence a patient can have from receiving red blood cell transfusions.
