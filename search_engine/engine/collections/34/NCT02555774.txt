      Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to confirm whether cognitive training in subjective
      memory impairment would show improvement in the subjective and objective cognition. We
      include subjects with normal cognition but complained subjective feeling of memory decline
      and conduct cognitive training programs combined with lifestyle modifications for 3 months.
      We evaluate the neuropsychological tests and questionnaires about subjective improvement
      after 3 months of interventions.
