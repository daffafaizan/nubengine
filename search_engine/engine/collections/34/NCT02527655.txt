      evidence of feasibility and efficacy for promoting mobility through the uptake of physical
      activity among men aged 65 years and older who are physically inactive. Specifically, Men on
      the Move will evaluate the effects of a choice-based physical activity model paired with an
      active transportation model. The choice-based physical activity model encourages older men to
      use existing community-based resources to create and implement actions plans for physical
      activity. It also provides ongoing face-to-face and telephone-based support from trained
      activity coaches. The active transportation model provides transit passes and active travel
      planning to promote use of transit and walking to destinations of interest. The feasibility
      of delivering the intervention will be assessed. Accelerometry and travel diaries will be
      used to measure the effects of the intervention on physical activity.
