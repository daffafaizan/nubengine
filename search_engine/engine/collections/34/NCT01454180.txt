      diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to a
      treatment arm or control arm of experimental treatment guided by the therapeutic targets.
      Patients in the control treatment arm will be treated with any of the schemes used in the
      study according to the discretion of the physician responsible. Patients will be analyzed as
      "intention to treat." In the experimental treatment arm (therapeutic targets) and within 15
      days will determine the markers of therapeutic targets detailed in the protocol, either from
      pre-existing tumor sample or a fresh sample obtained by biopsy. Based on the results of this
      analysis, we prescribe a chemotherapy treatment determined for possible treatments currently
      used in pancreatic carcinoma, gemcitabine, gemcitabine and capecitabine, gemcitabine and
      erlotinib, FOLFIRINOX, FOLFOX, FOLFIRI.
