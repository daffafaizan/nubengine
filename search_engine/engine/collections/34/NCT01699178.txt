      open-label study. This study contained an arm to evaluate the oral TU formulation as well as
      a comparator arm of the market-leading transdermal T-gel formulation. The comparator arm was
      included in the Phase III study and in this extension study to allow a general evaluation of
      comparative safety. Subjects randomized to oral TU in the Phase III study were continued on
      oral TU in the extension, and those who completed this 12-month Phase IV study have been
      followed for a total of 2 years of oral TU therapy. Likewise, subjects randomized to
      transdermal T-gel in the Phase III study were continued on T-gel in the extension, and those
      who completed this 12-month Phase IV study have been followed for a total of 2 years of T gel
      therapy. This 2-year period of therapy and assessments was to provide a long-term view of the
      safety of oral TU and the stability of the T replacement.
