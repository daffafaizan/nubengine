      based on weekly improvements will be set to facilitate the final goal. After each training
      session there will be feedback between the participant and the CUIDATE group to change or
      improve any exercise or activity. This feedback will allow to us to select adequate exercises
      and levels of difficulty. As a result, a modifiable personal training will be assigned to
      each one focusing on cardio-respiratory, mobility, and endurance performance through online
      system rehabilitation (using written instructions, HD videos, and audio files).
