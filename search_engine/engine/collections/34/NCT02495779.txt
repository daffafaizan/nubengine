      of short-term episodic Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV prevention among men who have sex
      with men (MSM). Long-term PrEP may be unnecessary for the many HIV-uninfected men who have
      episodic contextually defined high-risk periods, particularly when away from their home
      setting. Alternative dosing strategies, such as short-term fixed-interval episodic PrEP
      (Epi-PrEP), may be a more realistic, feasible, acceptable, and useful option with high public
      health impact for the majority of MSM. The overall objective is to determine the feasibility
      of a clinic-based Epi-PrEP implementation pilot project for 50 MSM (25/each of the 2 study
      sites) who report occasional condomless sex and who anticipate a period of high-risk while
      away from home (e.g. vacation) during the study period.
