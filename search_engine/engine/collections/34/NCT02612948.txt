    
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of scheduled quetiapine for delirium prophylaxis in
      critically ill, trauma/surgical patients identified as high-risk for delirium utilizing a
      validated prediction model.

      Design: Prospective, open-label, single-center study. Setting: Trauma/surgical intensive care
      unit at an academic medical center. Patients: Eighty two adult trauma/surgical patients who
      were admitted to the intensive care unit and were at high-risk for the development of
      delirium (PRE-DELIRIC Score â‰¥50%, past medical history of dementia, past medical history of
      alcohol misuse, or past medical history of drug abuse).

      Interventions: Patients were randomized by unit location to receive pharmacologic prophylaxis
      for delirium (quetiapine 12.5 mg every 12 hours) or no pharmacologic prophylaxis for delirium
      within forty-eight hours of admission to the intensive care unit.

      Measurements: The primary end point was the incidence of delirium during admission to the
      intensive care unit (ICU). Secondary end points included time to onset of delirium, ICU and
      hospital lengths of stay, ICU and hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and
      adverse events. Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the intensive
      care unit.
