      screening several SNPs by whole exome sequencing which can be used as genetic marker for
      sepsis patients. We will collect whole blood samples from patients with sepsis inRespiratory
      Intensive Care Unit (RICU), the Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU), or the Department of
      Surgery's ICU 301 Hospital since January 2013, and then whole exome sequencing was used to
      Screen SNPs which were related to sepsis. Then another 500 sepsis patients and 500 normal
      controls were used to validated the sequencing results.
