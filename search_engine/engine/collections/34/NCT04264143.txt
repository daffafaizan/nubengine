      tumors. Subjects with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) have a poor prognosis with a
      median survival that is usually reported to be 9 months, and nearly 90% of children die
      within 18 months from diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is radiation to the primary tumor
      site. Surgical resection does not influence outcome and is often not feasible in this part of
      the central nervous system.

      Many promising drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders have failed to attain
      clinical success due to an intact blood brain barrier (BBB), limiting their access form the
      systemic circulation into the brain. Systemic administration of high doses may increase
      delivery to the brain, but this approach risks significant side effects and systemic
      toxicities. Direct delivery of the drugs to the brain by injection into the parenchyma
      bypasses the BBB, however, drug distribution form the site of injection tends to be limited.
      The convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of drugs describes the infusion of drugs under
      controlled pressure to the brain parenchyma via targeted microcatheter. This technique
      facilitates and deliver higher drug concentrations in brain tissue or tumor. The BBB can now
      operate to retain drug and to significantly reduce systemic side effects. In addition, the
      fact that panobinostat seems to be most efficacious clinically available drug against DIPG
      cells.
