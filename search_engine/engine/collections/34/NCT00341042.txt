      affect several million people worldwide. Individually and together these two diseases kill
      more people than any other infections, with the worst suffering occurring on the African
      continent. Mali is a West African state awakening to the reality of these issues. While
      tuberculosis has always been a major problem in Mali, more recently HIV incidence has begun
      to increase.

      We are commencing a new research initiative to study HIV and tuberculosis in Africa, using
      Mali as a model country. However, there is little baseline epidemiological, hematological,
      immunological or microbiological data to help distinguish normal from abnormal results;
      establishing normal population baseline values is necessary to facilitate future research. We
      will collect whole blood and sputum samples to establish baseline values, for the purpose of
      facilitating ongoing or future HIV and tuberculosis research. Specifically, samples will be
      used to determine normal hematological, immunological and other parameters for Malian people.
      In addition, we will use samples to optimize routine and specialized research assays. Sputum
      samples will be used in bacteriological and genetic studies intended to optimize studies
      relating to tuberculosis.
