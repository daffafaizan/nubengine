      derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), inhibits bone formation and resorption in a high
      percentage of patients with either chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or gastrointestinal
      stromal tumors(GIST).1 Some, but not all, patients taking imatinib developed hypophosphatemia
      but the effect on bone, as measured by markers of bone synthesis and metabolism, was seen in
      some patients with normal phosphate levels as well. Marked urinary phosphate wasting with
      elevated levels of parathyroid hormone was seen in nearly all patients. The effect of
      imatinib on bone may be dose-related. Patients with hypophosphatemia were routinely started
      on oral phosphate replacement, but follow up determinations of urinary phosphate wasting were
      not performed.

      The clinical consequences of these abnormalities on bone are not yet known. This trial will
      study 60 patients with CML in chronic phase, early accelerated phase (as detected by
      cytogenetics only) or GIST who are already taking imatinib. Parameters relating to bone
      metabolism will be checked every 3 months for 2 years. We will determine the incidence of
      bone abnormalities in this treated population, determine whether fasting serum phosphate can
      predict for changes in bone metabolism, determine whether there is change in bone density by
      measuring serial bone densitometry, determine whether oral phosphate replacement can restore
      phosphate balance, and determine whether there is a dose effect of imatinib on parameters of
      bone metabolism.
