      healthy adult subjects, consisting of 35 subjects per marketed EC product, will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be evaluated for plasma nicotine uptake, as well as overall product liking. The
      study will involve the use of four (4) marketed EC products in tobacco consumers who are
      exclusive smokers (i.e., na√Øve EC users) or dual users of cigarettes and ECs (i.e.,
      intermittent EC users).
