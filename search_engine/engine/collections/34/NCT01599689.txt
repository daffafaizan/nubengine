      commonly after cardiac surgery, increases sharply from the age of about 65 years. Its
      occurrence, even for one day, is associated with longer ICU and hospital stays, increased
      costs, and negative physical and cognitive outcomes at one year. In spite of previous
      prevention and intervention research, delirium incidence in the older cardiac surgical
      patient remains high (up to 72%).

      ICU clinicians at Papworth Hospital have made observations suggesting that delirium could be
      reduced using a novel and unconventional strategy of bedside mirrors. Mirrors of any type are
      uncommon in ICU environments[1], but their occasional use by patients on our ICU has been
      reported by bedside clinicians and physiotherapists to result in:

        -  a normalisation of mental status and attention (core delirium diagnostic criteria), and

        -  earlier physical mobilisation (associated with reduced delirium risk), particularly in
           older-aged patients

      Evidence from other sources supports mirrors' beneficial effect in these areas [2-10], but
      mirror use has never to our knowledge been explored for the reduction of delirium. This pilot
      study seeks to determine whether the use of bedside mirrors, as a clearly defined part of
      patients' postsurgical ICU care, can reduce delirium and improve outcomes in the older
      cardiac surgical patient.
