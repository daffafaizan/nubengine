      sperm (same quantity in both arms). If randomized to treatment arm a balloon catheter will be
      filled with 1cc of air prior to insemination. The speculum will be removed immediately and
      the catheter will be left in for 15 minutes and then removed. Pregnancy outcomes will be
      recorded in both groups.
