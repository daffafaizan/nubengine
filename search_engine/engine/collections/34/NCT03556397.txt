      women with breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy is a method with a high false-negative
      rate. Patients will be classified into groups according to histological findings during SLNB,
      clinical and ultrasonography (USG) findings in the axilla. The aim of this study is to create
      clear indications for SLNB or axillary dissection (AD). In case of extension of SLNB
      indications, there will be a decrease in morbidity after surgical therapy when compared to
      AD, which will mean a profit for the patients.
