      were assigned to the case group (n=355) and the control group (n=340). All the BP patients
      were enrolled from 11 State Hospitals in China, and all the controls were selected from the
      same district to match for the patients. The study was coordinated by a tertiary referral
      centre, Tongji Hospital. The House-Brackmann grading system and Facial Disability Index (FDI)
      was adopted to assess the BP patients. Kessler 10-Item Psychological Distress Scale（K10）was
      usde to explore the psychological distress, and the Cattell 16 Personality Factor (16PF)
      scale was employed to evaluate the personality profiles of all subjects.
