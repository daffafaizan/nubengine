      al. 2017). And since the introduction of autogenous dentin graft for alveolar ridge
      preservation by Kim et al. clinically (Y.-K. Kim et al. 2010), it has increasingly attracted
      attention and teeth are no longer seen only as a waste. Tooth dentin has a chemical
      composition similar to that of alveolar bone; the inorganic content is 70%-75%, organic
      content 20%, and water content 10%, whereas alveolar bone has proportions of 65%, 25%, and
      10% respectively(Y.-K. Kim et al. 2013). The similarity in chemical composition between
      dentin and alveolar bone, as well as its content of growth factors such as bone morphogenetic
      proteins (BMPs), made the dentin a successful graft for filing alveolar bone defects of same
      patient(Y.-K. Kim et al. 2010, Nampo et al. 2010, Y.-K. Kim et al. 2013) .

      The technique proposed by Kim et al includes demineralization of the dentin as it reduces
      minerals content, exposes collagen fibrils and increases BMPs released thus promoting the
      process of osteogenesis(Y.-K. Kim et al. 2010). However, demineralisation step is
      time-consuming, taking several days, which challenges same visit application. As a result,
      two main approaches have been developed to overcome this obstacle. One approach is to
      maintain the demineralization step but with improving the technique to shorten the processing
      time(MURATA et al. 2010, E.-S. Kim 2015, Kabir et al. 2015). On the other hand, many
      investigators have used the whole tooth without demineralization and reported satisfactory
      clinical outcome(Gideon Hallel et al. 2014, Valdec et al. 2017). Hence, more investigations
      are needed to evaluate the technique with the best outcome.
