      despite on-going control efforts. In 2015, there were >200 million cases of malaria
      worldwide, causing nearly half a million deaths, with most of the deaths occurring among
      children under the age of 5 years. Mosquitos also transmit arboviruses, including dengue,
      yellow fever, West Nile virus, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, and
      Zika virus. The current new outbreak of Zika virus in Central and South America, as well as
      the Caribbean, serves as a reminder of how quickly these viruses can spread and how difficult
      they can be to control.

      In this protocol we plan to perform a Phase I study of a novel universal mosquito-borne
      disease vaccine. Through modulation of the immune system after a mosquito feeding, this
      vaccine targets the vector saliva and may provide prophylaxis against multiple arboviral and
      protozoal diseases. In addition the vaccine potentially leads to a reduced mosquito lifespan
      after feeding therefore also reducing transmission of these diseases.

      In this protocol we hope to demonstrate the safety of this vaccine similar to SEEK s other
      peptide based vaccines Flu-v and HIV-v that have been found to have very good safety profiles
      in previous Phase I trials. We also hope to demonstrate immunomodulation after a controlled
      clean Aedes aegypti mosquito feeding to demonstrate proof of concept efficacy of the vaccine.
      With the current rise of Zika in the Americas and the threat of local mosquito transmission
      in the U.S. and the rest of the world, a successful universal mosquito-borne disease vaccine
      offers the benefit of targeting this emerging disease as well as the many established
      infections such as dengue and malaria that make dealing with this newly emerging epidemic a
      challenge.
