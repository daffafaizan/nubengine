    
      Randomized controlled trial with 2 arms to test the influence of oxytocin in placental
      transfusion.

      Placental transfusion: the amount of blood that passes to the baby from the time of birth
      until the cord is clamped.

      The difference in weight between a measurement at birth and a second one after clamping the
      cord at 3 minutes will be considered as proxy for placental transfusion.

      In one arm the oxytocin will be used immediately after birth and the cord clamped at 3
      minutes In the other arm the oxytocin will be administered at 3 minutes of birth after the
      cord is clamped.
