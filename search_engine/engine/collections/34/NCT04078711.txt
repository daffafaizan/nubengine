      lethal and disabling diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and
      chronic renal insufficiency. The higher the blood pressure level, the higher the risk of
      these diseases. Antihypertensive drugs can control blood pressure, and effectively reduce the
      risk of these serious complications. A multi-center, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled
      clinical study was designed to explore the effectiveness and safety of early intervention of
      Chinese medicine (Qianyanguuyin formula) in improving urinary albumin to creatinine ratio
      (ACR), based on standard antihypertensive treatment (losartan 100mg qd, if necessary combined
      with calcium channel blockers). Patients were recruited if they were (1) age between 35 and
      55 years old, (2) primary hypertension (grades 2-3 ), (3) microalbuminuria (ACR of 30-300
      mg/g) and eGFR of at least 60 ml / (minâˆ™1.73m2), (4) ascendant hyperactivity of liver Yang or
      Yin deficiency in TCM syndrome. It's intented to form a standardized plan for the prevention
      and treatment of early renal injury in hypertensive patients.
