      investigators are examining this care at home intervention in patients with advanced
      hematologic malignancies.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, questionnaires, remote
      patient monitoring (e.g. patient-reported symptoms, home monitored vital signs) and hospital
      care at home (e.g. providing maximal supportive care to to address and manage patients'
      symptoms) and structured communications oncology clinicians to optimize end of life care for
      patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.

      Participants will include 3 groups:

      1) Enrolled patients with advanced hematologic malignancies receiving the end of life (EOL)
      care at home intervention; 2) caregivers of these patients; and 3) oncology clinicians caring
      for these patients.

      Participants will be in this research study for approximately six months after consent. It is
      expected that about 30 patients, 30 caregivers, and 15 oncology clinicians will take part in
      this research study.
