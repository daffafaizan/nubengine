      suspected diagnosis, pleural lavage using 10% povidone-iodine (warmed to normothermic 37Â°C)
      will begin. The 10% povidone-iodine is mixed with sterile water with a dilution of 1/10. A
      total of 6-14 liters of solution will be prepared in advance of the procedure, pending the
      size of the patient's chest cavity. The warmed PVP-I will be instilled into the chest cavity
      to a volume that fills involved thoracic cavity or cavities. Once filled, the solution will
      be allowed to dwell for 15 minutes. At the conclusion of the 15 minutes, the PVP-I solution
      will be suctioned out of the chest. This process will be repeated for a total of three dwell
      sessions.

      At the conclusion of the PVP-I lavage, chest tubes should be placed in the chest cavity to
      re-expand the lung adequately. Chest tube management will be at the discretion of the
      individual thoracic surgeons, including suction vs water seal and plan for removal.

      An honest attempt to maintain the management according to the study protocol will be made.
      However, if it deemed inappropriate for that patient due to clinical signs, symptoms, or
      anticipated problems, the surgical team can make whatever changes are deemed necessary. The
      reason for the deviation must be documented. This patient's data will continue to be
      collected and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis for the primary, secondary and tertiary
      endpoints.
