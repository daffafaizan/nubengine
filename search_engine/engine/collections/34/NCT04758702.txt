    
      A Randomized, Three Parallel Arms Clinical Trial. The primary objective is to assess the
      clinical impact of L-PRF vs H-PRF vs Palatal stent on the healing of the donor palatal site
      by comparing the percentage of re-epithelization of the palatal donor site at 5, 10, 14 and
      21 days using a standardized intraoral palatal photo.

      The secondary objective is to compare the post op discomfort between the three groups during
      the healing period daily for 2 weeks using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Analgesic
      consumption.

      All subjects from the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry clinics. Subjects that are
      coming increasing the width of keratinized tissue or for the treatment of gingival recession,
      and match the inclusion criteria will be told about the research and offered the opportunity
      to participate.
