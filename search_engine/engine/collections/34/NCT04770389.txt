      participants with mild dyslipidemia to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      obicetrapib and ezetimibe combination therapy. The screening period for this study will take
      up to 2 weeks. Following the screening period, eligible patients will be randomized to
      placebo, 5 mg obicetrapib + 10 mg ezetimibe; 5 mg obicetrapib + placebo ezetimibe; or placebo
      obicetrapib + 10 mg ezetimibe for an 8 week treatment period. After the treatment period,
      patients will continue for a 4 week safety follow-up and a 8 week PK follow-up.
