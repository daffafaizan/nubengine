      Trauma-related LTP/LTD disbalance in favor of potentaion and excessive excitation of
      glutamate receptors generated when arousing experiences occur in conjunction with
      memory-related activation of the hippocampus and amigdala. Traumatic memories connected to
      the amplification of mechanism LTP, when new information is unable to induce reliable LTD,
      which reverses synaptic plasticity formed during previous emotional learning experiences.

      MHC class I and CD3-zeta play a key role in these changes. We assume that the composition of
      glutamate receptors and CD3-zeta expression in T-cells can be used as the model reflecting
      for LTP/LTD balance in CNS.

      The work includes the learning of following parameters:

        1. The Expression in T-cells: glutamate receptors, CD3-zeta.

        2. Glutamate level in plasma

        3. Cytokines levels in plasma:

             1. interferon-γ that can induce some components of class I MHC (9).

             2. tumor necrosis factor-α that influences the AMPAR expression and plays a role in
                LTP reduction (10).

      Groups (of 20 people each) will make patients with a priori various degree of LTP/LTD
      balance: healthy people and PTSD patients.

      People suffering PTSD, frequently have conditions when they again, brightly and deeply
      experience event injuring them. The memoirs painted by painful emotions, seize attention of
      the person and then it seems to him as if he again experiences injuring event and sees it as
      real.

      We assume, that it is connected to the unable to induce reliable LTD, and that the
      composition of glutamate receptors and CD3-zeta expression in T-cells such people should
      differ from healthy.
