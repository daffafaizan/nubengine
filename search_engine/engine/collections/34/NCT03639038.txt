      tuberculosis. There are two assays being tested under this Project:

        1. Activated TB assay for differentiation of latent and active TB infection using blood
           samples and

        2. Direct TB assay (DTA) for rapid detection and DST of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
           using sputum specimens.)
