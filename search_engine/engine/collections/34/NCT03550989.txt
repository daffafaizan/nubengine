    
      The purpose of the study is to show that Non-Smokers, exposed to environmental tobacco
      aerosol from IQOS in a restaurant setting, do not have higher urinary levels of Biomarkers of
      Exposure (BoExp) to selected Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents (HPHCs),
      representative of Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), compared to the urinary levels of BoExp
      measured in Non-Smokers before IQOS environmental tobacco aerosol exposure.

      Furthermore, the impact of passive exposure to IQOS environmental tobacco aerosol on IQOS
      Users and Cigarette Smokers, not using any tobacco or nicotine-containing products, will be
      investigated. This will enable the assessment of individuals with varying levels of exposure
      to HPHCs and determine whether there is any measurable additional exposure related to the
      environmental tobacco aerosol from IQOS.

      The study will also evaluate Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) through the assessment of
      concentrations of nicotine and selected HPHCs representative of tobacco-specific and IAQ
      markers in the air during exposure and non-exposure periods in a real-life restaurant
      setting.
