      development of a more intuitive and functional prosthetic device. Tiny (2.5 mm by 16 mm)
      Implantable Myoelectric Sensors (IMES) will be implanted into the residual forearm muscles of
      three transradial amputee subjects. These devices wirelessly transmit electrical muscle
      signals to an electromechanical prosthetic wrist and hand.

      Following a two-week recovery from implantation of six to eight IMES into residual forearm
      muscles, subjects will initiate seven months of training. Subjects first train for
      approximately a month using a bench-top IMES system. When they receive their custom-fit IMES
      Prosthesis (including electromechanical wrist and hand) subjects initiate six months of
      additional training. Subjects will then be given the option to use the IMES Prosthesis for
      another sixteen months. The usability and functionality of the prosthetic system will be
      evaluated throughout the study.
