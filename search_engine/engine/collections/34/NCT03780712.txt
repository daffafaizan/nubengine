      To respond to pathogens, newborns depend essentially on their innate immune system. Premature
      babies have a significant impairment of innate and immune regulatory functions, thus
      promoting neonatal sepsis. In addition, chronic infections during pregnancy, including those
      of parasitic origin, fetal immunity. In utero exposure to P. falciparum antigens impacts
      particularly the newborn immune development and is a risk factor predisposing to malaria and
      also to other infections during the first year of life.

      The major objectives are to assess:

        -  The relevance of a host biomarker driven diagnostic of sepsis in newborns,

        -  The relevance of immune markers as indicators of sepsis incidence, secondary infections
           occurrence, and mortality

        -  The role of novel diagnostic techniques (FilmArray panels) as part of the
           microbiological diagnostic,

        -  The immunological profile of the infants in the 3 first months of life.

      The targeted population is newborns with a high risk to develop sepsis recruited at delivery
      compared to a control infant population with a low infection risk.
