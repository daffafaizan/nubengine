      effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in
      treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness (how well the drug/s work) of
      nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.

      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the
      body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. Nivolumab has been approved by the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma (a type of skin
      cancer), and specific types of previously treated advanced lung and kidney cancers.
      Ipilimumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

      The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is now FDA approved as treatment for patients
      with metastatic melanoma. However, the use of nivolumab as well as ipilimumab alone or in
      combination for the treatment of patients with thyroid cancer is not approved
