    
      AIM AND HYPOTHESES

      The primary aim is to investigate treatment mechanisms of MBCT and markers of relapse risk.

      Controlled design:

      First, we aim to first investigate the effect of treatment on clinical outcomes in the
      controlled design post treatment and at 3 months follow up. Second, we will run mediation
      analyses of hypothesized mechanisms (increased mindfulness skills, decentering, interoceptive
      and decreased rumination, and change in neural connectivity in a priori networks), and
      finally check for moderating influences of vulnerability markers (childhood trauma, no.
      episodes of depression and residual symptoms).

      Prospective design:

      We aim to investigate predictors of relapse risk at 12 month follow treatment using i)
      baseline markers and ii) mechanism outcomes that change significantly due to treatment, and
      iii) check for moderating influences of vulnerability markers
