      acidity and is therefore considered safe to use in elective surgical patients without risk
      factors for pulmonary aspiration. It reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting and improved
      sense of well-being after surgery. Moreover, carbohydrate-rich drink was not found to be
      affected by delayed gastric emptying in patients with uncomplicated type 2 diabetes.
      Therefore, carbohydrate drink may be safely administered 3 h before anesthesia without risk
      of hyperglycemia or aspiration.
