      subjects will be followed at the usual clinical schedule of pre-op, 6-week, 3 -, 6- and
      12-month post-operative follow-up visits. After signing informed consent, age at time of
      surgery, height, weight, body composition, leg length will be recorded to be used during data
      processing. Chart review will further yield data on Cobb angle, Lenke Scoliosis
      classification, instrumentation used during surgery, and level of spinal fusion. All subjects
      will be asked to complete assessments of activity level (Marx Score, Tegner Activity Score),
      general health (EQ-5D), and a validated scoliosis survey (Scoliosis Research Study
      questionnaire SRS-22). Movement studies will consist of the Lower Quarter Y Balance Test
      (YBT-LQ), and Functional Movement Screen (FMS), and measures of forward flexion, right and
      left lateral bending, and right and left trunk rotation. These measures will be assessed
      preoperatively and at postoperative follow-up visits.
