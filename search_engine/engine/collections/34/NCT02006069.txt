    
      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, multi-center trial. Data will be
      collected at enrollment, baseline, implant procedure, patient classification, 6 months and 12
      months of follow-up. During the 6-month visit, the patient's response to CRT will be
      evaluated according to LVESV reduction. Patients with an LVESV reduction of at least 15% will
      be classified as responders. These patients will terminate their participation in the study
      and return to the center's standard practice. Patients with an LVESV reduction less than 15%
      will be classified as non-responders and the MPP feature will be activated according to
      randomization result and they will be followed until the 12-month visit.
