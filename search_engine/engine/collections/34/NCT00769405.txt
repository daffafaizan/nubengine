      Primary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients with peritoneal carcinoma of colorectal origin
           undergoing complete surgical resection and receiving systemic chemotherapy with versus
           without intraperitoneal chemohyperthermia.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate recurrence-free survival of these patients.

        -  Evaluate treatment toxicities.

        -  Determine morbidity from surgical complications.

        -  Determine prognostic factors of survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, residual tumor status (R0/R1 vs R2 ≤ 1 mm), prior regimens of systemic chemotherapy
      (first vs ≥ second), and preoperative systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs
      no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients undergo maximal surgical resection of the tumor.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard systemic chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV
           followed by fluorouracil IV over 30 minutes. Systemic chemotherapy will continue for at
           least 6 months (before and/or after surgery). Patients must stop systemic chemotherapy
           at least 1 month before receiving intraperitoneal chemohyperthermia (CHIP). If
           bevacizumab is given as neoadjuvant therapy, then systemic chemotherapy must be
           discontinued 6 weeks before beginning CHIP. Patients undergo CHIP comprising oxaliplatin
           intraperitoneally during surgery and hyperthermia for 30 minutes.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo surgery and receive standard systemic chemotherapy comprising
           leucovorin calcium IV followed by fluorouracil IV over 30 minutes. Systemic chemotherapy
           will continue for at least 6 months (before and after surgery).

      Tumor markers (ACE and CA 19-9) are assessed at baseline, at 1 month after surgery, and then
      at follow-up visits.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months, every 3 months
      for 3 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
