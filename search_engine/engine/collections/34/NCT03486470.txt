      patient and operator preference and carries a lower risk of bleeding and mortality. The most
      lasting consequence of transradial procedures remains radial artery occlusion, which is
      mainly influenced by the artery diameter and the size of the sheath. As a new, more distal
      approach looms on the horizon, it is plausible to determine factors that could impact its
      feasibility. Since the success rate for artery cannulation depends to a great extent on the
      size and the depth of the artery, the current study examines both parameters, as well as
      whether they are influenced by variables such as sex, body mass index, handedness, or
      comorbidities i.e. diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
