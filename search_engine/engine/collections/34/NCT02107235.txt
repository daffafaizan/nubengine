    
      This is a multicenter, dose-escalating study of oral rigosertib administered with concurrent
      cisplatin and Radiotherapy in patients with intermediate- and high-risk Head and Neck
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

      Three rigosertib escalating cohorts (up to 6 patients per cohort) will be sequentially
      evaluated: 70 mg 3 times a day (TID), 140 mg TID and 280 mg TID. The total treatment course
      will be 8 weeks: 1 week of oral rigosertib alone (70 mg TID, 140 mg TID or 280 mg TID)
      followed by 7 weeks of concurrent administration of rigosertib, cisplatin and radiation
      therapy.

      After completion of treatment, patients will be followed for up to 36 months to document
      Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival.
