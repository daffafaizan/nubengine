      (idarubicin/cytarabine/etoposide) vs. MICE (mitoxantrone/cytarabine/etoposide) vs. DCE
      (daunorubicin/cytarabine/etoposide) in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.
      II. Compare disease-free survival and overall survival achieved with each anthracycline on
      the above induction regimens and with intermediate-dose cytarabine (IDIA vs. NOVIA vs. DIA)
      as consolidation therapy. III. Compare disease-free survival, relapse rate, death in first
      CR, and overall survival in patients who receive peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) vs.
      autologous bone marrow transplant (AuBMT) vs. allogeneic bone marrow transplant (AlBMT) as
      rescue from myeloablative therapy following remission consolidation. IV. Assess the time to
      recovery of normal or acceptable polymorphonuclear leukocyte and platelet counts following
      each treatment step. V. Determine the incidence and type of grade 4 toxicity and
      treatment-related mortality. VI. Evaluate the quality of life during each step of treatment
      using self-administered questionnaires. VII. Compare stem cell mobilization after IDIA vs.
      NOVIA vs. DIA, each using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor as the mobilizing growth
      factor. VIII. Assess the rate of completion of stem cell transplantation using PBSC vs. AlBMT
      vs. AuBMT as the last step of therapy. IX. Compare the costs of treatment (e.g., antibiotics
      and transfusion requirements) and hospitalization duration between the AuBMT vs. PBSC.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. All patients are randomized to Arms I, II, and III for
      Induction/Consolidation. Patients in CR following Consolidation who have an HLA-identical
      sibling, are less than 45 or 55 years of age (depending on center policy), and have adequate
      organ function are nonrandomly assigned to AlBMT on Regimen A; those in CR who are without an
      available sibling donor and who have adequate organ function proceed to Regimen B, then are
      randomized to Arms IV and V. The following acronyms are used: AlBMT Allogeneic Bone Marrow
      Transplant ARA-C Cytarabine, NSC-63878 AuBMT Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant BU Busulfan,
      NSC-750 CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 DCE DNR/ARA-C/VP-16 DHAD Mitoxantrone, NSC-301739 DIA
      DNR/ID ARA-C DNR Daunorubicin, NSC-82151 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor
      (Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer) ICE IDA/ARA-C/VP-16 IDA Idarubicin, NSC-256439 ID Intermediate Dose
      IDIA IDA/ID ARA-C Mesna Mercaptoethane sulfonate, NSC-113891 MICE DHAD/ARA-C/VP-16 NOVIA
      DHAD/ID ARA-C PBSC Peripheral Blood Stem Cells TBI Total-Body Irradiation VP-16 Etoposide,
      NSC-141540 INDUCTION/CONSOLIDATION: Arm I: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by 2-Drug
      Combination Chemotherapy. ICE; followed by IDIA. Arm II: 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy
      followed by 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. MICE; followed by NOVIA. Arm III: 3-Drug
      Combination Chemotherapy followed by 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. DCE; followed by DIA.
      POSTCONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Regimen A: Single-Agent Chemoablation plus Radioablation or 2-Drug
      Chemoablation followed by Hematopoietic Rescue. CTX; plus TBI (equipment unspecified); or
      CTX/BU; followed by AlBMT. Entry on EORTC study comparing CI IDA with standard CTX/TBI or
      CTX/BU encouraged. Regimen B: Stem cell Mobilization and Harvest. G-CSF or CTX/G-CSF. Arm IV:
      Single-Agent Chemoablation plus Radioablation or 2-Drug Chemoablation followed by
      Hematopoietic Rescue. CTX/TBI or CTX/BU; followed by PBSC. Arm V: Single-Agent Chemoablation
      plus Radioablation or 2-Drug Chemoablation followed by Hematopoietic Rescue. CTX/TBI or
      CTX/BU; followed by AuBMT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,520 patients will be randomized for Induction/Consolidation over about 5
      years; if excessive deaths are found at interim analyses, the inferior arm will close. It is
      expected that 744 patients will be randomized for Postconsolidation therapy, with 345
      patients followed until relapse/death.
