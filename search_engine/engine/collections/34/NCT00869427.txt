      prevent urinary tract infections in stable, ambulatory spinal cord-injured patients. To be
      included, patients should have had at least 3 previous UVI episodes over the last two years.
      40 patients are included. Patients are randomised to receive either 1 g vitamin C b.i.d. over
      1 year, or no vitamin C. The main outcome is the number of clinical UVIs that have been
      treated with antibiotics.
