      I. To evaluate the uptake (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax]) of
      64Cu-DOTA-alendronate in female patients with biopsy-proven malignant breast calcifications.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate on PET -computed tomography (CT) with histology
      after mastectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate.

      Participants receive 64Cu-DOTA-alendronate intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT imaging 60
      minutes after injection. Participants with sufficient levels of residual radioactivity may
      undergo repeat imaging on day 1 as determined by the study team.

      After completion of study , participants are followed up for 7 days.
