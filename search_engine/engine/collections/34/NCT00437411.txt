      fibromyalgia (FM), can be effectively treated by encouraging self-awareness of emotional
      tension. While anecdotally effective in selected patients, this approach has thus far not
      been tested in a randomized controlled trial. Our purpose is to determine whether an
      affective self-awareness approach significantly improves pain, tenderness, and other FM
      symptoms in a random sample of FM patients; and to determine what psychosocial factors
      predict a favorable response.

      Comparisons: changes in ratings of pain, tenderness, and other symptoms between two arms of
      the study:

        -  three weekly 2-hour small-group meetings supplemented with daily writing and meditative
           exercises to enhance affective self-awareness

        -  usual care
