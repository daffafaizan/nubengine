      composition, lipid profile, and oxidative and inflammation indicators among young Korean
      adults based on the timing of almond consumption. Participants were randomly assigned to one
      of three groups: (1) a pre-meal group (PM; n = 58) in which participants were instructed to
      consume 56 g of almonds per day as a preload when having regular meals; (2) a snack group
      (SN; n =55) in which participants were instructed to consume 56 g of almonds between meals as
      snacks; and (3) a control group (CL; n = 56) in which participants were provided
      high-carbohydrate iso-caloric control food. The three-day diet records, including two
      consecutive weekdays and one weekend day, were done once before the trial and twice during
      the trial. Body composition was assessed through multi-frequency whole-body bioimpedance
      measurement using InBody 620 (Biospace Co., Ltd, Seoul, Korea).After a 12-hour fast, blood
      samples were taken at the baseline time point (week 0) and at weeks 8 and 16 by standard
      venipuncture. The serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were measured by the
      enzymatic-colorimetric method using a Cobas 8000 c702 chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics;
      Mannheim, Germany). HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were determined via
      homogeneous enzymatic colorimetry.
