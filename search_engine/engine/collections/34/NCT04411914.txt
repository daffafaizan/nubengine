    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group inpatient study of
      clavulanic acid for 10 days in adults (18-65) seeking treatment for cocaine use disorder. For
      those subjects who can tolerate 500 mg/day for 3 days (or matched placebo), there will be a
      forced dose escalation to 750 mg/day for 3 days. Subjects who can tolerate 750 mg/day for
      three days will have a forced dose escalation to 1000 mg/day for 4 days until the study ends.
      Structural MRI, functional MRI and MRS scans will be done throughout the study. At the time
      of each scan, safety of the subject to complete the scan will be re-assessed. Subjective,
      cognitive, and adverse effect assessments, blood pressure and pulse will be performed daily.
