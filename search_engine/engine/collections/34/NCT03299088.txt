      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when given in
      combination with trametinib in the proposed sequencing schemes in patients with advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS mutations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess in a preliminary manner the clinical efficacy of these combinations with the
      proposed sequencing schemes including overall response rate and progression free survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      To determine in an exploratory manner changes in PD-L1 expression as well as other immune
      correlates induced by mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)
      inhibition.
