      pain symptoms in many patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), others either do not
      respond to or tolerate medical therapies, or have failed attempts at revascularization. For
      this growing number of patients, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches. The
      purpose of this protocol is to test the effectiveness of nitric oxide (NO) inhalation therapy
      for the relief of inducible myocardial ischemia in patients with CAD who have failed
      conventional attempts at medical and revascularization management. Our hypothesis is that
      enriched NO transport in blood from the lungs and delivery to the coronary vasculature with
      NO inhalation will improve blood flow to the myocardium during stress by dilating coronary
      arteries and arterioles. The primary end-point of this study is improvement in treadmill
      exercise duration during NO inhalation compared with exercise duration during room air
      breathing, with secondary end-points selected to provide mechanistic insight as to relief of
      inducible ischemia by NO, including effects on: 1) arterial delivery and myocardial
      extraction of NO transport molecules, 2) myocardial perfusion, and 3) global and regional
      myocardial contractility. This clinical trial is randomized, double-blind, and placebo (room
      air)-controlled in design, with CAD patients treated with NO (or room air) breathing for
      approximately 1 hour before each stress test, followed by crossover to the alternate therapy
      after two days of testing. Demonstration of benefit from NO inhalation could result in an
      important therapeutic option for CAD patients with few alternatives for the relief of
      myocardial ischemia.
