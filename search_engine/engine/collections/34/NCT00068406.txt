      I. Determine the efficacy of radiotherapy and cisplatin, in terms of achieving a complete
      clinical and pathological response, in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma
      of the vulva that is not amenable to standard radical vulvectomy.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen followed by surgery in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy daily on days 1-5 and receive concurrent cisplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats weekly for approximately 6.5 weeks (a total of 32
      fractions of radiotherapy) in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Six to eight weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with a complete
      clinical response may undergo incisional biopsy of the primary tumor and bilateral
      inguinal/femoral nodes (if the groin nodes were initially unresectable). Patients with
      microscopic or gross resectable residual disease may then undergo radical resection of the
      residual tumor. Patients with unresectable disease after the completion of chemoradiotherapy
      receive additional radiotherapy with 1-2 courses of concurrent cisplatin.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
