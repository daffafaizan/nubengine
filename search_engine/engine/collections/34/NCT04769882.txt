    
      Patients will be assessed and selected at the University Odontostomatology Clinic (COU) in
      Perugia; patients are considered eligible for enrolment if they are at least 18 years old and
      have a carious lesion on permanent teeth, cavitated and non-destructive, deepening to the
      middle third of the dentine and no further. The patients will be randomly assigned to two
      groups as follows: group A, control group, which includes treatment with traditional therapy;
      group B, intervention group, which includes treatment with Er:YAG laser therapy. For each
      patient, two salivary swabs will be taken on the cavity dentine of the carious lesion: one
      before and one after the treatments.
