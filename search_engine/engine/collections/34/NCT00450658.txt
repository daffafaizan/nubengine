    
      HZT-501 is a combination product including ibuprofen and the acid reducing agent famotidine.
      The study is designed to determine whether the combination product reduces the rate of ulcer
      development in subjects who require long-term daily use of ibuprofen.

      Subjects will be assigned randomly, in approximately a 2:1 ratio, to treatment with either
      HZT-501 (ibuprofen 800 mg/famotidine 26.6 mg) or ibuprofen (800 mg) three times daily for a
      24 week treatment period or until they develop either an endoscopically-diagnosed upper
      gastrointestinal ulcer and/or prohibitive toxicity. Subjects will visit the study center for
      Screening and at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24. Physical exams will be performed, and clinical
      laboratory measurements made, at selected times during the study. Endoscopic exams will be
      performed during Screening and at Weeks 8, 16, and 24. Subjects will be contacted four weeks
      following study completion.
