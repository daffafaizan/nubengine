      team reached a recommendation to terminate further development of ATR-107 (PF-05230900). This
      was based on a number of factors, including development of anti-drug antibodies in
      approximately 70% of subjects in the First-in-Human study in healthy volunteers (B2281001).
      This recommendation is not based on adverse events observed in study B2281001.
