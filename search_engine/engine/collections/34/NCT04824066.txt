    
      This is a single-center non-randomized prospective cohort study using wearable devices in
      cardiothoracic surgery patients to detect post-operative complications. Patients undergoing
      cardiothoracic surgery who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled
      consecutively with verbal informed consent from the time this protocol is approved by the IRB
      until 1000 subjects are enrolled. At ~30 days preoperatively the subjects will have a
      wearable device (such as a Fitbit) placed on their wrist and will wear the device until ~60
      days post-operatively. This device will wirelessly transmit data regarding activity and sleep
      quality to a smartphone application for the duration of wear and data will be analyzed by our
      collaborators at Case Western Reserve University.
