    
      40 prospective patients (aged 18 to 85 years) will be included in the first 36 hours after
      ischemic stroke onset.

      The study period will be 2 years. Included patients will have F-MISO PET followed by brain
      MRI (MRI-1)(diffusion, FLAIR, perfusion, TOF) as soon as possible after stroke onset (less
      than 36 hours). A second brain MRI (MRI-2) will be performed on day 7.

      The aim of the study is to locate hypoxic tissues and to compare with ischemic tissues
      defined by diffusion and FLAIR MRI sequences, with MRI evolution, and with clinical status at
      day 7 and day 90.

      Inclusion criterias

        -  Patients aged 18-85 years with encephalic brain ischemic stroke,

        -  defined stroke onset,

        -  NIHSS 5 to 20,

        -  F-MISO Pet and MRI available <36 hours after stroke onset,
