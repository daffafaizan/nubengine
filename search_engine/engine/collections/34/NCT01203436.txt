      occurs primarily in very premature infants. Eye development occurs normally in the womb; in
      infants born prematurely, however, the blood vessels must finish developing outside the
      protective environment of the uterus. Retinopathy of prematurity (also known as retrolental
      fibroplasia) is a leading cause of blindness and other vision impairments (myopia,
      strabismus, and amblyopia) in children, both in developed and developing countries.

      This study was a randomized trial comparing the effects of 2 oxygenation strategies on the
      progression of ROP. Infants with prethreshold ROP in at least one eye were eligible for the
      study. Enrolled infants were randomized to receive either conventional oxygenation at a pulse
      oximetry target of 89% to 94%, or supplemental oxygen to achieve a pulse oximetry target
      range of 96% to 99%. Infant were placed on continuous pulse oximetry monitoring and to
      maintain oxygen saturation, as much as possible, in the assigned target range.
