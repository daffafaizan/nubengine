      control of long-term complications. The best-established treatment is tight control of blood
      glucose achieved by frequent daily injections or continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin,
      ie, intensive insulin therapy. Although insulin therapy has developed enormously, even the
      most modern technologies do not allow the maintenance of normoglycemia.

      Since the establishment of the autoimmune etiology of type 1 DM in the late 1970s, many
      clinical trials analyzing the effects of different types of immune interventions demonstrated
      that beta-cell preservation is an achievable target in different degrees.

      Controlled trials and further biological studies are necessary to confirm the role of this
      treatment in changing the natural history of type 1 DM.

      This is a prospective pilot study which will enroll patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      within the first months of diagnosis, with clinical and laboratory findings. The donor
      stimulation will be with cyclophosphamide, filgrastim, and mesna. The cells will be
      recollected from peripheral blood by apheresis and refrigerated. The patients will receive a
      nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and after this,
      the cells will be injected intravenously. They will receive a standard regimen of
      post-transplant prophylaxis. The duration of use of this prophylactic drugs scheme depends on
      the patient's recovery time. The reinfusion of stem cells will be completed after the last
      dose of cyclophosphamide, through a peripheral vein.

      Lately, every three months, the C-Peptide levels, glucose and insulin serum levels will be
      measured.
