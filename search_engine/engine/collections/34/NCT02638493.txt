      prophylaxis will provide multiple semen and blood samples during a 48-hour inpatient visit. 8
      HIV positive men taking TAF (tenofovir alafenamide) will provide multiple semen and blood
      samples during a 48-hour inpatient visit.

      Participants will take part in the study for approximately two months. After the screening
      visit, there is one 2 day overnight visit for intensive PK/PD
      (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) sampling. The investigators will study drug concentrations
      and intracellular endogenous nucleotide concentrations (dATP and dCTP) in seminal plasma and
      (where appropriate) seminal cells.

      Samples will be analyzed through the use of novel laboratory methods to determine the seminal
      plasma and seminal cell concentrations of tenofovir and emtricitabine. New technologies will
      be used to better understand compartmental and intracellular antiretroviral pharmacology of
      nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Pharmacokinetic modeling will be used to
      estimate the primary outcomes.
