      Mackay Memorial Hospital, 35 patients with clinically diagnosed VAP were investigated.
      sTREM-1 was measured in BAL samples using ELISA at the onset, 4th - 5th and 7th - 9th day of
      clinical diagnosis of VAP.Of these 35 patients, 27 had positive BAL culture. The sTREM-1
      levels in BAL fluid were measured and compared between patients with positive BAL culture and
      negative BAL culture. Serial changes in sTREM-1 levels were evaluated in relation to patient
      outcome.
