      increase radiosensitivity in hypoxic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).

      Previously, it has not been possible to discriminate more hypoxic tumours from less hypoxic
      tumours. Thus, nimorazole has been added the radiotherapy of most HNSCC.

      Recently, a hypoxia gene profile has been developed, that discriminate between more and less
      hypoxic tumours. The basis of the discrimination is the cumulated expression of 15 hypoxia
      responsive genes, quantified from the tumour biopsy.

      The profile has been validated on the independent DAHANCA 5 cohort. There was a significant
      effect of adding nimorazole to the radiotherapy of more hypoxic tumours as estimated with the
      gene profile, whereas there was no effect of adding nimorazole to the less hypoxic tumours.
      In a test for interaction, there was a significantly different response to nimorazole in the
      more hypoxic tumours compared to the less hypoxic tumours.

      In the Dahanca 30 trial it is aimed to verify, that there is no benefit of supplying the
      radiotherapy of less hypoxic HNSCC with nimorazole. Thus, to explore whether it is possible
      to avoid the sideeffects of nimorazole without risk for the patient.
