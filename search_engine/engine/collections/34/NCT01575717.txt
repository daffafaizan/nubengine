      list. The hepatologists at Mount Sinai's Transplant Institute will ask each potential
      participant if she/he is interested in participating. If the patient expresses an interest in
      the study, one of the researchers will meet with the patient when the patient is at Mount
      Sinai for a regular appointment and will describe the study to the potential participant. If
      a patient continues to be interested in participating, she/he will be given a copy of the
      IRB-approved consent document to read. The consent document will be used as a guide for
      explaining the study in detail to the patient. If the patient's preferred language is
      Spanish, she/he will be given a consent document in Spanish and the study will be explained
      in Spanish.

      Once the subject's 25(OH)D level is known, if the subject's 25(OH)D level is ≤ 15 ng/ml, the
      participant will be contacted by one of the investigators on the research team and instructed
      to begin taking 2 tablets per day (4000 IU total) of vitamin D. If the subject's 25(OH)D
      level is greater than 15 and ≤ 25, the participant will be contacted by one of the
      investigators on the research team and told to begin taking 1 tablet (2000 IU total) per day
      of vitamin D. If the participant's vitamin D level is < 25 ng/ml, they are considered Vitamin
      D insufficient/deficient. If the Serum Vitamin D is > 25 ng/ml they will be informed that
      they are not to take any vitamin D and they will be followed as controls for this study.
