      between January 1, 2021 and June 1, 2021 in the orthopedic surgery clinic where the study
      will be conducted will comprise the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to
      participate in the study. The research was planned as a randomized controlled experimental
      study. Block randomization method will be used to determine the experimental and control
      groups. In order for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the order produced by a
      computer program (www.randomizer.org) will be used. Randomization will be done by a
      biostatistician outside the researcher. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to
      participate in the study will be assigned to the experimental and control groups according to
      the randomization list. Research data will be collected in a hospital's orthopedics and
      traumatology service surgery ward between 1 January 2021 - 1 June 2021.

      The dependent variables of the study are postoperative statue anxiety score, patient
      self-care ability score, pain severity (Visual Analog Scale-VAS), pain control and status (
      pain-causing conditions, analgesic such as use case), patient satisfaction score,
      re-hospitalization average. In the research, "Individual Characteristics Form" and "Patient
      Follow-up Form" prepared by the researcher in line with the literature will be used as data
      collection tools.
