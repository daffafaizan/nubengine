      in cisplatin-ineligible patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      following weekly outpatient methotrexate (arm I) versus paclitaxel (arm II). II. Compare the
      response rate of patients in the two treatment arms. III. Compare the Trial Outcome Index
      scores of patients in the two treatment arms. IV. Compare the weight change, neurologic
      toxicity, and mucositis scores of patients in the two treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by performance status (0-1 vs 2)
      and age (less than 60 vs at least 60). Patients are randomized to receive methotrexate IV
      bolus every week for 4 weeks (arm I) or paclitaxel IV over 1 hour every week for 4 weeks (arm
      II). All patients receive at least 4 weeks of treatment (1 course). Patients continue
      treatment for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 230 patients accrued into this study over 2.4 years.
