    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the improvement in progression-free survival with Reolysin (wild-type reovirus),
      carboplatin, and paclitaxel relative to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in patients with
      recurrent or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Reolysin in combination with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel versus without Reolysin in patients with recurrent or metastatic pancreas cancer.

      II. To compare the treatment groups for other efficacy endpoints such as overall response
      rate and overall survival.

      III. To define how the combination of Reolysin and carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) modulate
      factors regulating immunity to reovirus and its persistence in the system circulation of
      patients with pancreatic cancer.

      IV. To prospectively establish and validate the relationship between Ras mutations in tumor
      samples and response to Reolysin.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1 and wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in Arm I. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease
      progression may crossover to Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 2
      months thereafter.
