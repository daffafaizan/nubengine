    
      Prostatic Urethral Lift (PUL)/ UroLift® is an FDA-approved device for the treatment of
      obstructive symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (also called prostate gland
      enlargement). This study seeks to evaluate UroLift's efficacy in a unique cohort of
      participants with obstructive symptoms who are candidates for radiotherapy or those who
      developed obstructive symptoms after radiotherapy. The primary objective of this study is to
      achieve urinary obstructive symptom relief in prostate cancer participants undergoing
      radiotherapy treatment with placement of PUL. This will be quantified using primary
      effectiveness endpoints:

        -  For PUL placement post-EBRT and post-BT: ≥ 30% or ≥ 4 point International Prostate
           Symptom Score (IPSS) reduction 3 months after PUL.

        -  For PUL placement pre-BT: ≥ 30% or ≥ 4 point IPSS reduction 3 months after Brachytherapy
           (BT) from pre-PUL baseline.

      The team will also assess participant outcomes with regard to International Prostate Symptom
      Score (IPSS), peak urine flow (Qmax),post-void residual (PVR), quality of life (QOL) scores,
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Impact Index (BPHII) scores, Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire
      (MSHQ) scores, and urinary incontinence at 6 and 12 months of PUL placement post-External
      Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT), post-BT, and pre-BT.
