      immunosuppression after transplantation. CsA has a spectrum of neurologic and more subtle,
      poorly investigated neuropsychological functional effects. In the NHLBI, a unique opportunity
      exists to evaluate changes in neuropsychological function following CsA in a large cohort of
      aplastic anemia patients accrued to NHLBI treatment protocols.

      With increased success in treating blood diseases with immunosuppressive therapy or stem cell
      transplantation that utilize CsA in the treatment regimen, patients are enjoying prolonged
      survival during which quality of life becomes an increasingly relevant concern. We therefore
      propose this natural history protocol designed to evaluate neuropsychological functioning
      before, during, and after CsA administration in severe aplastic anemia patients.

      The primary objective is to evaluate changes in attention, language, memory, spatial/motor
      and executive function domains following CsA therapy using well established
      neuropsychological tests including the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) Screening
      Module, Revised Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised Brief Visual-spatial Memory Test,
      Judgment of Line Orientation test, Grooved Pegboard, Trail Making Test and the two
      performance subsets in Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III. IQ test by Wechsler Abbreviated
      Scale of Intelligence and depression/anxiety level will be screened once prior to formal
      testing. Measures will also be correlated with clinical status, standard CsA side effects,
      CsA drug levels and relevant biochemical lab values at each time point to control the testing
      accuracy and explore potential correlation.
