      colles fracture, and are often caused by fall and osteoporosis. These fractures are highly
      related to morbidity and mortality among elderly people and consumes considerably health care
      resources. More than 70% of the proximal humerus fracture patients are over 60 years of age
      and 75% are female.

      Only sparse evidence reveals to what extend the patients need rehabilitation and how it
      should be implemented in the treatment strategy.

      In Denmark as well as in Finland the rehabilitation after proximal humerus fractures takes
      place in local centers in the municipalities, and the rehabilitation offered to the patients
      varies significantly. Currently in Denmark there are no national clinical guidelines to
      support the rehabilitation strategy.
