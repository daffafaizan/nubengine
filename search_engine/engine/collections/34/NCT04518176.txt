      pregnancy undergoing scheduled or emergency cesarean were randomized into two groups. In the
      BUAL group, women underwent BUAL before placental delivery; in the control group, women had
      cesarean delivery without BUAL. The primary outcome was the estimated blood loss during a
      cesarean
