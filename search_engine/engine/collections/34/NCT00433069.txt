      increase liver fibrogenesis and reduce the rate of response to antivirals. Regarding the
      latter, a previous study showed that a sustained virological response (SVR) occurred in about
      one third of patients with genotype 1 and insulin resistance (measured as homeostasis
      assessment of insulin resistance, HOMA-IR > 2) vs. two thirds of genotype 1 patients without
      insulin resistance. These findings were independently confirmed by other studies and extended
      to non-responders with genotypes 2, 3 and 4. Thus, we suggested that insulin resistance
      should be corrected in patients with chronic hepatitis C not responding to currently
      available antiviral treatment, in order to improve response to retreatment. The modalities of
      this intervention, however, have not been established. In addition, the optimal HOMA-IR score
      to be attained has not been identified. To assess this point, we planned a prospective,
      multicenter study to investigate the efficacy and safety of the insulin-sensitizer
      pioglitazone (ActosTM, Takeda Pharma AG, Lachen, Switzerland) 15 mg QD, added to the
      pegylated interferon-α2a (PEG-IFN-α2a) (PegasysTM, Roche Pharma Schweiz AG, Reinach,
      Switzerland) 180 μg QW/ribavirin (CopegusTM, Roche) 1000-1200 mg QD combination therapy in
      chronic hepatitis C patients who had previously failed to respond (i.e. had detectable serum
      HCV RNA after 12 weeks of therapy) to a pegylated interferon-α/ribavirin combination without
      the insulin-sensitizer. All patients had a baseline HOMA-IR score >2 as additional inclusion
      criterion, because this was the threshold discriminating responders from non-responders in
      previous works. Diabetic patients were excluded.
