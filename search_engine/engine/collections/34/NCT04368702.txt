      in patients with gastric and breast cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are researching if getting an MRI during radiation
      is a feasible way to delivery radiation. In this research study, a MRI done during treatment
      will help doctors adapt the radiation to target the most precise spot where the cancer is
      located.

      The research study procedures include:

        -  Screening for eligibility

        -  Study treatment including evaluations

        -  Follow up visits

        -  Questionnaires

      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of
      investigational radiation treatment and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational radiation treatment to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that
      the way the radiation treatment is delivered is being studied.

      This research study is a Feasibility Study, which means it is the first-time investigators at
      this institution are examining this type of MR-guided radiation. Investigators at other
      hospitals and academic centers are already using this type of radiation.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this radiation machine and these
      drugs as treatment options for gastric and breast cancer.
