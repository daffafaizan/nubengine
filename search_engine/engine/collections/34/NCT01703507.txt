      metastases will die from CNS related death. Radiation therapy is an effective treatment for
      patients with brain metastases for symptom palliation and survival benefit. Patients with
      multiple metastases are typically treated with whole brain radiation treatment (WBRT). For
      patients with a few metastases, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone can be used as an
      alternative. CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4) antibody, Ipilimumab has shown
      efficacy in metastatic melanoma and unresectable melanoma. Treatment with high doses of
      radiation therapy would result in tumor cell death, releasing tumor debris and liberating
      potential tumor antigens. We hypothesize that combining radiation therapy with Ipilimumab
      will facilitate immune recognition of these novel tumor-specific antigens, yielding a
      synergistic effect. Further, the hypothesis of this study is that this combination could
      focus the immune system on tumor antigens and minimize the aberrant immune activation in
      normal tissues, consequently reducing the incidence of irAE's (immune related adverse
      effect). Combination of radiation treatment with Ipilimumab will likely result in better
      local control, decrease the risk of developing new brain metastases, and improved overall
      survival. However, the safety profile and toxicities of combining Ipilimumab with brain
      radiation treatment are unknown. The current phase I study will assess the safety profile of
      combining different doses of Ipilimumab with standard dose radiation treatment either with
      WBRT or SRS. The MTD (maximum tolerated dose) will be determined, as well as a recommended
      phase II trial dose of Ipilimumab.
