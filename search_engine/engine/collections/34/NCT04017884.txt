      (Remin pro) has been introduced. It has been claimed that hydroxyapatite fills eroded enamel,
      fluoride seals dentinal tubules and xylitol acts as an antibacterial agents. This product has
      been assumed to be suitable for management of dentinal hypersensitivity, prevention of enamel
      demineralization and promoting remineralization of enamel subsurface lesions. There are few
      studies regarding the effect of calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite-based agents on
      remineralization and optical appearance of White spot lesions following orthodontic therapy.

      Recently a new formulation of Remin pro has been introduced called (Remin Pro Forte) with the
      same components of fluoride, hydroxyapatite, xylitol in addition to two natural products
      (Ginger, curcuma) with the rationale based behind that they have antibacterial effect against
      streptococcus mutans in addition to anti-cariogenic effect which is being confirmed in the
      scientific literature.

      Follow up period is selected to be 3 months, which is enough for evaluation of the outcomes
      (caries regression, color change, mineral content) assessed in this study.
