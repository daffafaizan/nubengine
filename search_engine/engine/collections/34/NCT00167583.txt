    
      Behcet's disease is a multisystem vasculitis often involving ocular (retinal) blood vessels
      (in 70% of all cases). This form of uveitis or retinal vasculitis still leads to blindness in
      25 to 50% of the patients irrespective of immunosuppressive treatment.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate if Interferon-alpha2a is superior to the present standard
      treatment (cyclosporin A (CSA)) for severe ocular (panuveitis, posterior uveitis, retinal
      vasculitis) Behçet's Disease (BD) and significantly improves visual prognosis and quality of
      health and life of the patients with ocular BD and is acting more rapidly than standard
      treatment. Furthermore, we want to evaluate if IFN-α induces long term remissions of ocular
      BD which can be maintained without further medical treatment.

      The patients are randomised into two treatment groups (IFN/CSA) and treated for one year
      according to an algorithm which adapts dosages to clinical course. A crossover from one
      treatment arm to the other is planned in case of inefficacy.
