      using the Flexi-Bar vibration device (www.flexi-bar.co.uk) +/- the XCO-Trainer
      (www.xco-trainer.co.uk) in a randomized trial among patients suffering lateral elbow
      tendinopathy (lateral epicondylitis).

      Primary outcome measure of this clinical trial is pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10)
      before and after 12 weeks of training.

      Secondary outcome parameters involve DASH score before and after, grip strength (JAMAR),
      vibration and two-point discrimination (mm).
