      participate in the study. Each patient will be anesthetized generally. The same drugs will be
      used in each stage of anesthesia. The induction: propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium. The airway
      will be secured with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). When there is a risk of aspiration, the
      patient will be intubated. Then, rocuronium or suxamethonium will be used. The anesthesia
      maintenance: sevoflurane, fentanyl. The emergence: oxygen, sugammadex or neostigmine a
      required.

      After the induction of general anesthesia, an opaque envelope with the selected group will be
      opened. In the controlled group, the procedure will be continued in the patient's supine
      position. Women from the ESP and Sham groups will be placed in the lateral position. The
      operated side will be above. Then, the ultrasound-guided ESP block with saline or ropivacaine
      will be performed.

      At the end of the surgery, an anesthesiologist will administer oxycodone intravenously (0.1
      mg/KG).

      After emergence from anesthesia, the patient will be transferred to the postoperative care
      unit. Vital signs will be monitored. The patient-controlled analgesia pump with oxycodone
      will be used.
