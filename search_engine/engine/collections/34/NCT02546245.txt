      Math Heroes game which was designed to be played for up to 8 hours. Other games in the HoK
      series may be included in this process if they are fully developed and available for testing.
      In testing the efficacy of the Math Heroes game, children will play the game for 1-1.5 hours
      per week, 2-3 times per week, for 2-4 weeks (to accumulate 6-8 hours of game play). The game
      has been designed to target math knowledge skills identified by the Common Core Standards for
      Mathematics (2012).
