      This will provide data that will allow researchers to classify abnormal valve and venous
      morphology, distinguish vessels which are more responsive to treatment, determine groups who
      respond more favorably to treatment, and overall evaluate the outcomes of venous angioplasty
      in various neurodegenerative disorders that involve venous obstruction.
