        -  Determine the efficacy of temozolomide and thalidomide in patients with metastatic,
           locally advanced, or unresectable leiomyosarcoma.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the clinical and laboratory toxic effects and tolerability of this regimen in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 7 days every other week and oral
      thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues for up to 26 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5-25
      months.
