    
      This is a multicenter, open-label study involving multiple specific advanced solid tumor
      types, consisting of a dose escalation part A followed by an expansion part B. Cancer
      subtypes will be studied in separate disease-specific cohorts in both Parts. Eight separate
      cohorts will enroll malignant melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), glioblastoma, large
      cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), high-grade
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (GEP NEC), other NEC, and solid tumors other
      than the above.
