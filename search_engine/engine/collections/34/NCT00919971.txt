      system in the prehospital setting.Ventilated patients receiving sedatives drugs can be
      included during primary prehospital interventions or interhospital transfers. During primary
      prehospital interventions, the protocol starts before endotracheal intubation. Depth of
      sedation is assessed every 5 minutes by the physician of EMS team. Blinded BIS monitoring is
      performed at the same time and recorded by the nurse at the end of out-of-hospital
      management. Data are analysed secondarily by the principal investigator.
