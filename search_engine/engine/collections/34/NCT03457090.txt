      cardiac failure as a life-saving measure. Adults treated with ECMO survived to hospital
      discharge in 21,8% to 65,4% of cases. Neurologic complications such as intracranial
      hemorrhage, anoxia and ischemia are major causes of death and long-term disability in ECMO
      patients (7% to 14%). Current neurological monitoring techniques are insufficient to predict
      which critically ill patient receiving ECMO therapy will suffer from neurologic injury. Even
      after a clinical suspicion of neurologic injury, diagnosis can be difficult. TCD is commonly
      used to monitor the CBFV of traumatic brain injury. There are no reports that evaluate CBFV
      of patients requiring ECMO therapy. Patient will have to do both echocardiography and TCD to
      evaluate cardiac output and CBFV. We will repeat these dopplers every 24 hours until ECMO
      withdrawal and one day after explantation.
