      to almost 50% mortality within 5 years from the time of lung transplant. In the past CLAD was
      exclusively occurring in small airways causing a condition called "Bronchiolitis Obliteran
      Syndrome" (BOS). However, recently many have observed restrictive changes in lung physiology
      with or without parenchymal abnormalities. This new CLAD is called RAS or RCLAD. What is also
      concerning is that RAS is thought to be associated with disproportionally high morbidity and
      mortality. This clinical trial intends to create a registry of patients who completed lung
      transplant and who are undergoing routine surveillance bronchoscopy. A subgroup of patients
      will be characterized by hyper polarized gas magnetic resonance image to enhance detection of
      CLAD, and to be correlated between the MRI imaging results and clinical/biochemical results.
      This study is anticipated to advance our understanding of CLAD which is currently inevitably
      fatal outcome among patients after lung transplant.
