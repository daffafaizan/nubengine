      acute respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, with high short-term mortality
      rates. However, only 5% of patients infected with COVID-19 are concerned by this pejorative
      evolution. At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19
      patients at admission.

      Chest computed tomography (CT) is widely used for the management of COVID-19 pneumonia
      because of its availability and quickness. The standard of reference for confirming COVID-19
      relies on microbiological tests but these tests might not be available in an emergency
      setting and their results are not immediately available, contrary to CT. In addition to its
      role for early diagnosis, CT has a prognostic role through evaluating the extent of COVID-19
      lung abnormalities.

      Finding a way to predict which patients with an initial mild to moderate presentation of
      COVID-19 would develop severe or critical form of COVID-19 according to CT-scan data, simple
      clinical and biological parameters is challenging. In this multicentric study, the study aims
      to construct a predictive score for early identification of cases at high risk of progression
      to moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 combining simple clinical and biological parameters
      and qualitative, quantitative or artificial intelligence (AI) data from the initial CT from
      non-severe patients. The final objective is to organize optimal patient management in the
      appropriate health structure.
