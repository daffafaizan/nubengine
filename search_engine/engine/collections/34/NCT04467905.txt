    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      effects of etripamil Nasal Spray in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study
      includes Screening, the Treatment Period and Follow-up procedures.

      Each subject will receive placebo or 70 mg of etripamil intranasally; treatment will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio, to yield 50 evaluable patients with atrial fibrillation in 2
      groups of 25.

      Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) will be selected by the Investigator. The screening
      procedures will include a review of inclusion/exclusion criteria and recording of any
      concomitant medications.

      After screening procedures are complete, eligible patients will be randomized to receive
      etripamil or placebo. Heart rate will be measured via Holter ECG (Electrocardiogram)10
      minutes prior to and immediately before drug administration; patients must exhibit a rapid
      ventricular rate (â‰¥110 bpm measured during 1 minute) prior to drug administration in order to
      be dosed. Blinded study drug will be administered during Holter ECG (Electrocardiogram)
      monitoring, which will be conducted for at least 10 minutes prior to and for 6 hours after
      administration.

      Patients will undergo a safety follow-up assessment and return the Holter device
      approximately 24 hours post-dose. Patients will also be contacted by phone 7 days post-dosing
      for safety follow-up.
