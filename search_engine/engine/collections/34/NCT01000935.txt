    
      Surgical procedures: Arthroscopic inspection of the shoulder will be performed to assess
      intra-articular structures and to evaluate the rotator cuff and other sub-acromial
      structures.

      Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair: Rotator cuff tears will be categorized as partial-thickness
      and full-thickness tears. The full-thickness tears will be classified as small (<1 cm),
      moderate (1-3 cm), and large (>3-5 cm) based on the largest dimension and will be treated
      with a repair using sutures and suture anchors as indicated.

      Rehabilitation: A comprehensive protocol with instructions on different types of exercises
      will be provided pre-operatively. Rehabilitation will be based on the standard protocols for
      these procedures used at the Holland Centre.

      Follow-ups: Patients will be monitored for 6 months, or when participation is terminated by
      the investigators, or because the patient withdrew consent or fails to return for visits. To
      evaluate safety, clinical laboratory (WBC, Hb, platelet count, serum chemistry and IL-6, CRP,
      PT, PTT and INR tests will be conducted at 6 weeks, and 3 months to determine the impact of
      treatment interventions.
