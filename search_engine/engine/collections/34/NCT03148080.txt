      the Wake Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)
      Research Base (WF NCORP RB). Data will be collected using a web-based interface and will
      capture physical, psychosocial and cognitive late effects; work ability; work-related
      outcomes, including labor force participation, occupation, work place characteristics, and
      educational attainment; survivor characteristics; and cancer diagnosis/treatment information
      (from clinical records). We will evaluate the relationships among these measures using the
      theoretical framework to guide statistical analysis.
