      newborn has been delivered, received the intervention (UCM or DCC), and been placed on the
      resuscitation bed a NIRS sensor and a pulse oximeter will be placed within 60 seconds. While
      arterial saturation and heart rate data will be available to the clinical team, data from
      NIRS will be blinded. Data on all study infants will be recorded for at least the first 10
      minutes in the delivery room, and then for 24 hours in the NICU. Heart rate, oxygen
      saturations, and cerebral oxygenation, will be downloaded as per each site's practice for
      neonatal resuscitation.
