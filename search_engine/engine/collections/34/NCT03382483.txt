    
      The prospective arm of this non-interventional, observational study is designed to collect
      real world evidence from patients at risk of a fracture non-union across the US receiving
      EXOGEN treatment. Patients will be followed for 9 months post fracture. As a
      non-interventional study, the treating clinician will continue to provide routine care
      without research intervention or dictation by a protocol. A medically staffed
      Direct-to-Patient Contact Center will serve as a central investigational site with scheduled
      and structured direct-to-patient contacts via phone/email/text/web based surveys to obtain
      informed consent and collect data directly from the patient. For all prospective patients,
      primary effectiveness data will be obtained directly from the medical records of the treating
      physician.

      The comparator arm of this study will be a retrospective cohort of patients within a national
      health insurance claims database. An extract of this database will be taken and eligible
      controls derived via propensity score analysis.
