        -  Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of men with estrogen receptor- or
           progesterone receptor-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer treated with
           goserelin and anastrozole.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall objective tumor response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete
           and partial) in patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate prostate specific antigen (PSA), testosterone, estradiol, estrone, estrone
           sulfate, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and dehydroepiandrosterone
           levels with PFS and response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive goserelin subcutaneously on day 1 and oral anastrozole on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at approximately 4-6 weeks and
      then every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56 patients will be accrued for this study within 48 months.
