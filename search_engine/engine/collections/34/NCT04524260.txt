      in recent years and several studies showed a positive effect on the healing process of
      patients undergoing surgery. Painting art therapy represents another possible form of such a
      complementary medical treatment. However, the effect in the context of major abdominal
      surgical interventions has not yet been investigated, which is why the investigators are
      conducting this study. Selected patients referred to the Department of Visceral and
      Transplantation Surgery with operable pathologies of the pancreatic and the lower
      gastrointestinal tract are subjected to perioperative painting art therapy. It is carried out
      according to the protocol of (LOM® Solution Centered Art Therapy) by trained painting art
      therapists. The investigators want to evaluate the effectiveness of perioperative painting
      art therapy by analyzing the results of several questionnaires regarding anxiety and
      depression levels as well as health related patient data to observe the short/long term
      outcome and the psychological well-being of patients undergoing major surgery in case of
      carcinoma. The aim of the study is to assess if painting art therapy, more precisely the
      LOM®-method, is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients
      undergoing surgery. When it appears that the application of perioperative painting art
      therapy has a major influence on the postoperative outcome in cancer patients, some patients
      could benefit from a noninvasive, low-risk and easy additional treatment option. This study
      is a collaboration with the Institute of Complementary and Integrative medicine of the
      University Hospital Zurich.
