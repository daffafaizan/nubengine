      vs. trough (2 hours before oral dose) plasma methadone levels. Anecdotal clinical
      observations suggest that fetal activity is increased at trough methadone levels and
      decreased at peak methadone levels, yet the investigators do not understand how in utero
      methadone exposure affects fetal neurobehavioral state development.
