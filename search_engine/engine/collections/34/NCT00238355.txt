      Primary

        -  Determine the 12-week complete and partial response rate in immunocompromised patients
           with invasive fungal infections treated with voriconazole and caspofungin acetate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 12-week survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive voriconazole orally or IV over 1 hour twice daily and caspofungin
      acetate IV over 1 hour once daily on days 1-84. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.
