    
      LNP023 is a novel oral small molecular weight compound, that inhibits alternative complement
      pathway (AP). Blockade of the AP with oral LNP023 has the potential to prevent both intra -
      and extravascular hemolysis.

      This three-period study includes: a screening phase of up to 8 weeks, a baseline visit, Day 1
      (first day that the investigational drug is given), a 4-week treatment period of LNP023 at
      the first dose in the assigned sequence (Period 1), an 8-week treatment period at the second
      dose in the assigned sequence (Period 2), an approximately 2 year extension Period 3,
      followed by a taper down period of 2 weeks and end of study visit and a safety follow up call
      performed 30 days post end of treatment.
