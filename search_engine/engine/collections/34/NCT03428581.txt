      will determine which of these subjects will have the ARM with LVB and which subjects will
      have the ALND without this technique. As a baseline, all subjects will have the circumference
      of their arms measured and complete a questionnaire about lymphedema. Performing the
      measurements and answering a questionnaire will be repeated at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after
      surgery.
