      estradiol hypothesis was tested in a randomized-controlled trial in which estradiol was given
      to women with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder aged 18 to 45 -
      Kulkarni 2014. In that 3 arms trial, Kulkarni administered transdermal 100 µg estradiol/200
      µg estradiol/ placebo to patients receiving anti-psychotics and reported reductions in PANSS
      positive, general and total symptoms in both estradiol patients' groups compared with the
      placebo group. Patients receiving 200 µg experienced greater improvement, specifically in the
      PANSS positive subscale, the effect size was 0.44.

      The objective of this study is to attempt to confirm Kulkarni's trial in a large-scale trial.
      This proposed study is a 2-arm study, in which patients will be randomized to either 200 µg
      estradiol or placebo in order to test the effectiveness of estradiol on women of childbearing
      age with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder for a limited period of
      56 days.
