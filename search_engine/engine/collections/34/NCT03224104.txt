      MGMT promoter-unmethylated anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma who will receive TG02 and
      RT.

      Group B will be composed of newly-diagnosed, elderly patients with IDH1R132H-non mutant and
      MGMT promoter-methylated anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma who will receive TG02 and
      temozolomide.

      For both Groups A and B, there will be a classical 3+3 dose escalation and an expansion phase
      in the study. Up to a total of 24 evaluable patients in Group A and up to a total of 12
      evaluable patients in Group B (up to 36 evaluable patients for Groups A and B).

      Group C patients will be composed of patients initially diagnosed with IDH1R132H-non-mutant
      anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma at first relapse post TMZ/RT-->TMZ therapy who will
      receive TG02.
