      the necessity of optimal alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. The results of
      the meta-analysis comparing the Airtraq with the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope
      concluded that the use of Airtraq results in a rapid and accurate intubation. The main
      advantages of the fiberoptic bronchoscope are minimal airway trauma and minimal deterioration
      of the hemodynamic parameters.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the hemodynamic parameters, intubation times,
      complications during and after intubation and postoperative sore throat scores of the
      patients having normal airway anatomy, intubated with Airtraq, Macintosh laryngoscope or
      fiberoptic bronchoscope, by experienced anesthesiologists.
