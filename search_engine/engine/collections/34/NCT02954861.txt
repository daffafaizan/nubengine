      historically known complication after cardiac surgery. In 2013, almost 900 heart operations
      were performed in a South East, Scottish Cardio Thoracic unit. and audit data shows that 45%
      of these patients developed post operative delirium.

      Multiple pre, post & intra operative factors have been attributed to the development of
      delirium. Whatever the precipitating factors, delirium not only causes psychological distress
      to the patient but also their loved ones. In some cases this psychological upset continues to
      affect the patient even after discharge from the hospital referred to as post traumatic
      stress symptoms (PTSS). This study therefore aims to look at the extent and experience of
      post operative delirium in cardiac surgery patients.

      The study plans to recruit patients at a pre admission clinic where patient's baseline
      clinical data will be collected. They will also be provided with questionnaires to complete
      before the end of the clinic. This is to evaluate the participant's pre operative mood,
      cognitive status and social orientation. During their hospital stay following surgery the
      participants will be assessed routinely for delirium. If they are known to have suffered from
      delirium, they will be enrolled to phase 2 of the study.

      The consented patients will be seen at 6 week follow up clinic where they will be provided
      with a questionnaire to identify PTSS and also participate in a semi structured interview.
      Three months later the same will be repeated on telephone.

      Data analysis will help understand and explore this unfortunate patient experience.
