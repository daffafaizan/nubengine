      pulmonary function test, respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity, physical activity
      level, quality of life will be evaluated.

      Pulmonary function test will be assesed with spirometer, respiratory muscle strength will be
      evaluated with mouth pressure. Exercise capacity will be evaluated using six minute walking
      test, incremental shuttle walk test, cycle ergometer. Muscle oxigeneration will be asssed
      with wearable lactate threshold predicting device. Physical activity level will be evaluated
      trial accelerometer.

      Then, patients will be randomly divided two high intensity interval exercise training groups.

      First group: short duration high intensity exercise training (Exercise load phase : 30sn %100
      Patients performance, rest phase: 120sn %25 patients performance) Second group: Long duration
      high intensity interval exercise training (Exercise load phase : 4 dk %100 Patients
      performance, rest phase: 120sn %25 patients performance) All patients will participate three
      times a week during eight weeks. The muscle oxigeneration, blood glucose consantration, blood
      pressure, heart rate will be recorded before and after each exercise session. After 8 week,
      all test will be done again.
