      technology leveraging the investigators' expertise in creating and deploying apps to measure
      food intake and deliver nutritional interventions in free-living household conditions.
      Investigators will validate the app against weighed waste in a controlled laboratory setting.

      The study will yield an app ready for future study deployment while analyses of the data will
      inform rapidly evolving policy discussions concerning optimal approaches to reduce food
      waste. These outcomes align with program priorities to understand the economics of food waste
      and to use behavioral economics to address consumption behavior.

      Specific objectives include:

        1. Development of FoodImage, a smartphone app that measures household food waste and
           food-waste-related behaviors,

        2. Assess differences in the accuracy and time burden of measurements taken with the
           FoodImage app versus current household food waste measurement approaches (a
           pen-and-paper diary)

        3. Use the FoodImage app in a pilot randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the
           effectiveness of reducing household food waste through behavioral nudges in the form of
           personalized feedback about food waste levels and household-specific reduction goals.
