      characterized by Ô¨Åbrosis of the skin and internal organs, skin thickening, and decreased
      organ functioning leading to dermatologic, vascular, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal,
      neurological, musculoskeletal, and renal complications. SSc patients often suffer from
      psychological impairments, such as depression, anxiety about disease progression, body image
      dissatisfaction and low self-esteem. The non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment
      of the psychological sequelae of systemic sclerosis currently available are limited and have
      shown poor efficacy. Well-Being Therapy (WBT) is a brief psychotherapy which has been
      manualized in 2016 and has shown efficacy in randomized clinical trials. It showed to be
      effective in decreasing the relapse rates of depression in adults, it showed to be effective
      in generalized anxiety disorder and in cyclothymia. No psychological treatment aimed at
      empowering the level of psychological well-being rather than at working on distress in SSc
      patients have been implemented although it was shown that such kind of interventions directly
      increase the level of psychological well-being and indirectly decrease the level of
      psychological distress (i.e., anxious and depressive symptoms) in subjects affected by
      chronic diseases. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the psychological status of SSc
      patients with specific attention to suffering and mental pain, and to test the efficacy of
      WBT in SSc subjects if compared to a control condition. Thus, sixty outpatients with a
      diagnosis of SSc will be enrolled and will receive WBT or the control condition.
