    
      This is a clinical trial, randomized, blinded, in which 60 volunteers, after evaluation
      preoperatively, consisting of: cirtometry to measure thoracoabdominal mobility, spirometry
      for measures of lung function, nasal inspiratory pressure to inspiratory muscle strength and
      endurance incremental test for evaluation of respiratory muscle strength, were randomized and
      allocated into three groups, with 20 volunteers each. The interventions were performed in the
      immediate postoperative period and the first day after surgery. The first group, called the
      control group received care by Conventional Respiratory Physiotherapy (CRP), consisting of
      breathing exercises, incentive spirometer and ambulation. The second group, called Positive
      Pressure Group received two-level positive airway pressure for one hour, addition of CRP. The
      third group, called Load Inspiratory Group held exercises with inspiratory pressure with
      linear load, linked also to the CRP. Treatments were applied twice in the immediate
      postoperative period and shortly after returning to the ward and after 4 hours of the initial
      treatment and three times a day on the first day after surgery. On discharge, the second day
      after surgery, the volunteers performed chest x-ray and underwent the same evaluations
      performed preoperatively.
