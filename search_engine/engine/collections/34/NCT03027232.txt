      autoimmune diseases. Many aspects of immune cell regulation are unknown. A better
      understanding could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to improve immune function in
      patients suffering from various diseases.

      The investigators have found that hypertonic conditions regulate leukocyte functions through
      feedback mechanisms involving ATP release and purinergic receptors. The purpose of the
      proposed protocol is to obtain access to peripheral blood from healthy volunteers to study
      these complex regulatory mechanisms in more detail.
