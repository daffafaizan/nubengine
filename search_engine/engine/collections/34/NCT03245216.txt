      motor control impairments, such as gait disturbances and postural instability. Beneficial
      effects of exercise are attributed to mechanisms of neuroplasticity, and task-specific motor
      training is consequently considered to be a motor learning process. While motor learning is
      preserved in persons with Parkinson's disease, slower acquisition rates and reduced retention
      have been reported compared to healthy individuals.

      Thus, it is crucial to identify strategies to enhance motor learning in people with
      Parkinson's disease. Recent studies have accumulated evidence to show that aerobic exercise
      can facilitate motor skill learning. However, these observations are limited to healthy
      individuals and have not been addressed in individuals with neurologic conditions.

      The present study is designed to assess the effects of a single bout of moderate intensity
      aerobic exercise on a motor skill learning task in patients with Parkinson's disease.

      In a cross-over design, participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. Both
      groups will practice balancing on a specific stability platform (motor learning task). The
      experimental group will additionally perform a bout of aerobic exercise (cycle ergometer)
      immediately before the motor learning task, while the control group will rest before
      practice. Subsequently, the acquisition and one-day retention of the motor learning task will
      be examined.
