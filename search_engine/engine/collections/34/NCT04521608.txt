      Rehabilitation (PR) is very small. The current model of a center-based PR program fails to
      address the needs of many patients with COPD. After the COVID epidemic, telehealth is an
      option for individuals referred to patients referred to center based rehabilitation.

      The direct referral to home-based, unsupervised PR has been proposed as an alternative model
      to hospital-based programs and has been found to be safe and effective. The refined
      home-based PR program from the pilot portion of the study supported by a separate grant
      mechanism (R61HL142933/NCT03865329) will be tested in this second part randomized control
      study.

      Subjects with a COPD-related hospitalization (exacerbation or pneumonia) will be randomized
      after hospital discharge to either home-based PR or Choice (referral to conventional
      center-based PR or telehealth-based PR).
