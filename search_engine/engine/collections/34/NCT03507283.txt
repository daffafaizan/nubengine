      subconjunctival Tenon's tissue and surrounding fibrovascular tissues followed.The
      conjunctival edge was trimmed. The corneal surface was gently scraped with a scalpel. The
      Same procedure was done on temporal pterygia. A free conjunctival autograft was obtained. The
      graft was divided vertically into two parts. The nasal part of the graft was cut from limbal
      attachment including limbal tissue; temporal part was left attached. The nasal part of the
      graft was moved to the nasal conjunctival defect and attached to the sclera with fibrin
      sealant (Tisseel; Baxter, Vienna, Austria). The Same procedure was done with the temporal
      part of the graft. The orientation of graft was ensured before securing it.
