      presented as a main complaint from morbid obese patients. The main concern to use Brief ports
      laparoscopy or hidden scar laparoscopy to reduce incisions and change sites. The study
      designed to identify superiority of technique regarding success as a day case surgery, better
      cosmoses and lesser pain.

      We tried to wear off the port sites scar and kept our stabs in the suprapubic Bikin line. We
      kept camera port in the navel's natural scar and used the other ports in lower abdominal
      crease at Bikini line. Cosmosis has been and still the reason among patient population to
      accept the laparoscopic surgery, many synonyms can be applied here, as Cosmotic,Hidden scar,
      Scarless, Non-visualized or Scarless Bikini cholecystectomy.

      BLLC is performed under general anesthesia. Patient placed in the supine position with
      patient's legs apart and arms are rolled in, patient strapped to table at the mid-thigh.
      Surgeon stood between patient's legs, the camera man stood on the right side of patient,
      monitor placed near patient head to the right side. Three ports were used, 12 mm visiport
      (â€¦.) umbilical, with A 30 degree camera used, 5mm in Bikini line at Right mid-clavicular line
      and third port 5mm in Bikini line at left mid-clavicular line (Figure) Patient kept in
      reverse Trendlenburg position with maximum degree 20. But to lesser degree than done in
      classic LC,
