        -  To prepare, separate into components, and store the blood specimens at the NSABP Serum
           Bank at Baylor College of Medicine Breast Center for future DNA, RNA, and plasma
           analysis, and to analyze specific proinflammatory cytokines, genetic polymorphisms, and
           RNA expression arrays in collaborating laboratories at University of California, Los
           Angeles (UCLA).

        -  To examine the association between markers of inflammation and symptoms of fatigue among
           patients with and without exposure to metformin hydrochloride.

        -  To examine the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the
           promoter regions of IL-1 and IL-6 and symptoms of fatigue with and without exposure to
           metformin hydrochloride.

        -  To examine RNA expression profiles in relationship to fatigue and compare the pattern of
           expression in patients with and without exposure to metformin hydrochloride.

        -  To determine the biological and behavioral predictors of fatigue in breast cancer
           patients in the five years post-randomization.

        -  To determine whether metformin is associated with reductions in inflammatory markers and
           corresponding decreases in fatigue. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients' serum and plasma, collected at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months after NCIC CTG
      MA.32 randomization, are analyzed for inflammatory markers, DNA polymorphisms, and RNA
      expression arrays by ELISA, TaqMan PCR, and RT-PCR.

      Patients complete the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (symptoms associated with fatigue, sleep
      disturbance, depression, and endocrine therapy) at baseline and periodically during study.
