      value of intraoperative TTE is unclear. There are preliminary data that it is feasible For
      intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) an impact on cardiac and non-cardiac
      surgery patientsÂ´ management has been shown.

      Purpose of this study is to evaluate the application of focused TTE in patients with
      increased perioperative risk undergoing moderate to high risk surgery who become hemodynamic
      instable during anesthesia in the operating theatre.

      When hemodynamic instability under anesthesia occurs focused TTE is conducted and the
      obtained diagnostic information are used for further patient management. Any change in
      management or therapy will be recorded.
