      period where a probiotic strain/placebo and Aspirin is co-administered. After the 6 weeks,
      probiotic strain/placebo is given for two additional weeks to investigate the potential
      effects of the probiotic strain on intestinal healing after long-time Aspirin use.

      Subjects will participate in the trial for a total duration of 10 weeks including the run-in
      phase. Besides the screening visit, the trial will consist of 6 visits.

      After having given their written informed consent, subjects will complete screening
      procedures to evaluate their eligibility for participation in the trial and complete a run-in
      period of two weeks duration to washout possible pre-trial probiotics and/or use of
      medication. After baseline assessments at Visit 2, subjects will start daily intake of 300mg
      Aspirin and also be randomly assigned to 8 weeks daily intake of active or placebo product in
      a ratio of 1:1.
