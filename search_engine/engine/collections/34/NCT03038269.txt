      direct current stimulation, tDCS), followed by one hour of shoulder/wrist robotic training.

      Before and after therapy, participants will receive and assessment of their arm function, as
      well as an assessment of their brain activity, using electroencephalography (EEG) and
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
