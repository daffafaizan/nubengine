    
      After ethical committee approval, informed written consent will be obtained from all
      patients. A Sample size of 72 patients (36 per group) was calculated based on 15% reduction
      in morphine consumption with 0.05% significance and a power of 0.8.

      Consenting patients scheduled to have elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia will
      be randomised to receive bilateral QLB or TAP at the end of surgery.The dose of local
      anaesthetic in both groups will be 0.2 ml/kg 0.125% Bupivacaine. Allocation to either group
      will be done using closed envelope technique.

      All the blocks will be performed in operation theatre after the end of cesarean section with
      intravenous access, ECG, BP, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry monitoring and full
      resuscitation equipment and medication ready.

      All patients will be in the supine position . Under ultrasound guidance a 22 Gauge, two inch
      Pajunk Sonoplex needle will be used for both techniques. The calculated dose of local
      anaeshetic will be injected bilateraly with intermittent aspiration. The spread of injectate
      will be seed on ultrasound.

      All patients will receive the routine postoperative analgesia, comprising patient-controlled
      IV morphine analgesia and regular diclofenac and paracetamol.

      All patients will be assessed postoperatively by a blinded investigator: in the
      postanesthesia care unit and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postoperatively.
