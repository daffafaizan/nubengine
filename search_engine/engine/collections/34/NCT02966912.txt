      from the Providence VA Medical Center without clinical heart failure. 20 participants will be
      treated with 400 mg of Magnesium Oxide twice daily, while 20 participants will receive no
      treatment. The trial tests the hypothesis that oral Mg supplementation will improve: LV
      structure (by LV mass, steatosis, and ECV), LV function (systolic and diastolic), vascular
      health (systolic blood pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity) and visceral adiposity.
