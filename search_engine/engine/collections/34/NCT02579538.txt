      routinely resolves after healing of the surgical site. However, in some patients, pain
      persists long after surgery. PPSP is a diagnosis of exclusion that has most consistently been
      defined as pain that (1) developed after a surgical procedure, (2) is not residual from a
      preexisting condition, (3) has lasted for at least two months, and (4) is not attributable to
      other causes. One suggested risk factor for PPSP is poorer performance on tests of cognitive
      flexibility. Two common tests of cognitive flexibility are the Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and
      B and the Color Word Matching Stroop Test (CWMST).

      Three hundred patients undergoing either total knee arthroplasty or thoracotomy/mastectomy
      will be enrolled. During preoperative evaluation, participants will complete the TMT and
      CWMST. Subjects will be followed prospectively and will complete surveys at one month, six
      months, and one year postoperatively to assess PPSP prevalence and intensity.
