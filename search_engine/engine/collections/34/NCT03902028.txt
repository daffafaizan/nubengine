      developed countries. In 2013, the number of patients hospitalized in France for heart failure
      amounted to 165 231 and 20% of them were re-hospitalized at least once for the same reason
      during this year. Several factors contribute to the occurrence of cardiac decompensation (DC)
      : some modifiable (age, severity of IC, etiology ...) and others modifiable, such as
      therapeutics. Various elements could reduce the frequency of re-hospitalizations and the
      mortality due to this disease :

        -  a better knowledge of treatments by patients and consequently a better therapeutic
           compliance

        -  a better knowledge of the factors and signs of DC (low-sodium diet, weighing...)

        -  a better implementation of prescribing recommendations : less than 50% of patients have
           optimal treatment compared to ESC recommendations

        -  a better communication at the transition points of the patient pathway. The creation of
           a binomial cardiologist-clinical pharmacist during hospitalization and the maintenance
           of this optimized multidisciplinary follow-up within 3 months post-hospitalization is a
           proposal to intervene on these factors. Indeed, the clinical pharmacist (present in the
           care unit) works in collaboration with the medical and paramedical teams and can improve
           the care of patients. In the experimental group, a specific multidisciplinary
           consultation is planned for one month after the end of the hospitalization. A 3-month
           follow-up visit will be carried out by phone call to meet the criteria for readmission,
           mortality, quality of life, adherence and persistence of treatments.
