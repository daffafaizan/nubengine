      dyspeptic adult patients, who are diagnosed with functional dyspepsia in accordance with Rome
      III criteria, are randomly allocated in a 1:1 proportion to receive either lansoprazole 15mg
      or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. Primary outcome is complete relief of dyspeptic symptoms.
      Secondary outcomes include significant symptomatic relief, improvement of dyspepsia severity,
      and health-related quality of life. We use a multiple logistic regression analysis to
      investigate whether dyspepsia subgroups are associated with different therapeutic responses.
