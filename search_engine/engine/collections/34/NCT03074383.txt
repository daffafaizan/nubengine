      assigned to maintain standard treatment or participate in the Self-Care Multidisciplinary
      Workshop for Diabetes. The workshop consists of 15-minute individual meetings with each
      professional of a multidisciplinary team (nurse, pharmacist, nutritionist, physical educator
      and social worker) in which education and self-care topics will be approached aiming at the
      formation of knowledge and skills necessary for patient self-care. The workshop will be
      offered in 3 different modules with 2 to 4 weeks difference between them.

      Patients will be followed for 12 months. The variation of glycated hemoglobin as well as
      aspects associated with self-care, adherence and quality of life will be evaluated at the
      study entry, 6 and 12 months later.
