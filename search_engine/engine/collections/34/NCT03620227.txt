      anthropometric data, the signature of a consent term and delivery of the list of foods that
      should be avoided 24 hours before the tests and a treadmill familiarization. On the second
      and third day the physical intervention will be performed associated with juice or placebo
      supplementation. A wash out period of at least 7 days will be performed between the second
      and third day. The volunteers will arrive at the laboratory at 7am in the fasted state and
      will be rested until 07:20am and then the blood pressure (BP) measurement (collected three
      times, with an interval of 1 minute between measurements), collection of the saliva and the
      measurement of heart rate (HR). Approximately at 07:30am they will start drinking the juice
      and will have up to 15 minutes to consume. BP will be measured at 08:00am, 08:30am, 09:00am
      and 09:30am. At 9:30am a physical exercise session will begin, during which will be monitored
      by a cardio-frequency monitor, which will remain until 11h10am (period referring to the end
      of BP monitoring in the laboratory). At 10:10am the workout will be finished, and then the
      saliva will be collected. After this period, the volunteers can take up to 250 ml of water
      until 11:10am, and every 15 minutes, BP will also be measured. and at 11:10am a collection of
      saliva will be performed. The volunteers will have the period of 15 minutes to be hygienised,
      and at 11:25am the ABPM will be placed (ambulatory blood pressure monitor). The ABPM will be
      taken the day after the test at 10:10 am (time for the first post-exercise BP measurement),
      and the last collection of saliva will be carried out concurrently with the ABPM removal.
