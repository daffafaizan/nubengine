    
      The main goal of the present study is to evaluate the acceptability, usability, and
      satisfaction to m-RESIST solution among the target groups (patients, caregivers, clinicians),
      and also to evaluate the effect of m-RESIST solution to empowerment and perceived quality of
      life of the treatment-resistant Schizophrenia patients (TRS). Interventions targeting key
      problems in TRS (risk behaviours, persistent symptoms of psychosis, poor medication
      adherence, lifestyle habits) will be administered in a clinical setting, with the long-term
      goal of creating a widely-available system that can be deployed by users as needed, in their
      own environments.

      The study will be conducted in three different regions: Gertner (Israel), Semmelweis
      (Hungary) and Barcelona (Spain). Consequently, the outcomes obtained in each site and their
      comparison will allow improving the m-RESIST program in terms of interoperability,
      integration of components and final implementation of the interactive system in the
      healthcare pathways.

      The participants will be selected from Sheba Medical Center - Psychiatric Division (Tel
      Aviv), Semmelweis University - Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (Budapest), and the
      adult psychiatric outpatient service of Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Barcelona).

      A total of 45 patients with TRS (15 per centre), with their caregiver, will be included in
      the trial. All participants will be fully informed about the nature of the study (aims,
      methodology) and the system tested (data protection, expected risks/benefits, possible
      adverse events) and they will sign the informed consent for their participation in this
      study.
