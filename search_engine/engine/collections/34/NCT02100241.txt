      were formed:

        1. Stretching+Transcutaneous Electrical Nervous Stimulation (TENS);

        2. Active stretching;

        3. Conventional stretching.

      Parameters: straight leg raise test (SLR), popliteal angle with the passive knee extension
      test (PKE) and the toe-touch test (TT).

      The inter-group means were compared and clinically relevant parameters calculated [relative
      risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR) and number needed to
      treat (NNT)].
