      Type of research: Prospective, exploratory, clinical, interventional trial

      Specific objectives are:

      To explore the efficacy of Re-step rehabilitation technology to improve dynamic balance in
      the gait of people after Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).

      The investigators suggest a new technology of intervention that will induce unexpected
      changes of underfoot slopes, with Re-Step shoes, during walking and will force the central
      nervous system (CNS) to react and solve walking problems in real-time.

      The investigators propose that the new approach will have a significant motor function
      improvement on balance in gait, transferred to real environmental settings and be retained
      for long periods of time.

      Research methods:

      Subjects:

      A total of 40 subjects of ABI victims will be studied in one treatment group-Re-Step shoes
      walking training

      Time flow protocol:

      Participants will be approached using a database of hospitalized patients of Reuth
      Rehabilitation Hospital (Tel-Aviv, Israel) and through a call for participation placed in a
      newspaper.

      Subjects will be recruited according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, after medical
      examination and given consent of participation.

      Tests and measures (see outcome measures) will be applied to measure changes:

        -  T1 - before starting the intervention to form a baseline

        -  T2 - after 20 sessions of intensive treatments 60 min each, 2 sessions a week.

        -  T3 - 6 months after T2, a period of normal daily schedule of subjects, with no
           interventions, to examine for retainment of training results.

      The treatments will start in a week from T1; the T2 will be performed in a week after
      training was completed; T3 will be performed 6 months (take or leave 2 weeks) after T2.
