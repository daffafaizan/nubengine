      hospitalization, lost of time at work, and surgery. Approximately 80% of stones consist of
      calcium and oxalate, of which both components come from diet and normal bodily processes.
      Individuals who have high levels of oxalate in their urine have a greater tendency to
      generate stones. One recommendation is to reduce their intake of oxalate-containing foods,
      but many healthy foods contain oxalate, and an oxalate-free diet is unpalatable and difficult
      to achieve. Some patients, despite reducing their oxalate intake, still have high amounts in
      the urine.

      Intestinal metabolism is largely affected by the state and composition of the intestinal
      bacterial flora, with several metabolic diseases being linked to a disrupted "normal"
      intestinal flora. The investigators believe that calcium oxalate stone disease as well as
      high urinary levels of oxalate (hyperoxaluria) are triggered by inefficient oxalate
      metabolism in the intestine, which is linked to a "disrupted" intestinal bacterial flora that
      lacks certain key components such as O. formigenes. The long-term purpose of this study is
      therefore, to determine the effect of replenishing the intestinal flora of patients with that
      of "normal" controls, thereby re-introducing a balanced environment that will lead to the
      re-establishment of normal metabolic functions and a decrease in urinary oxalate levels and
      hopefully lower incidence of stone disease.
