      with CD19-targeted CAR-T cells. However, for myeloid malignancies, which has higher
      morbidity, trials of CAR-T is few. CD33 is expressed on most myeloid leukemia cells so it is
      a ideal target for CAR-T. This trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and
      effectiveness of CD33-targeted CAR-T.
