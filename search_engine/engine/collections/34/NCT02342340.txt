    
      This is a single site, blinded, randomized, controlled study designed to examine
      phytochemical absorption, metabolism and excretion, as well as vascular health and satiety,
      after ingestion of 4 different bean varieties (pinto, navy, red kidney, black).

      Recruitment will consist of a total of 8 volunteers. Volunteers will be recruited through
      advertisement from the local community.

      The study will be conducted at the I.H. Asper Clinical Research Institute,located at the St.
      Boniface Hospital. Participants will be asked to provide written informed consent prior to
      participation in the study. Participants who have provided written consent will be asked to
      attend an in-patient visit to provide a fasting blood sample. Should the participant be
      eligible to participate, they will be scheduled for six study visits to assess the
      bioavailability, metabolism and excretion of phytochemicals present in beans compared to
      lentils and white rice.

      Uptake, metabolism and excretion of phytochemicals present in different varieties of beans
      during acute phase testing in healthy individuals will be examined. Possible relationships
      between phytochemical composition of the beans, arterial function and satiety will be
      investigated as the secondary objective.
