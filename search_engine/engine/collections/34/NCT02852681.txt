      assess the effect of food on the rate and extent of absorption of a drug when the drug
      product is administered shortly after a meal (fed conditions), as compared to administration
      under fasting conditions. Therefore, this study was designed to characterize the effect of a
      high fat meal on the bioavailability of E4 and DRSP after administration of a single tablet
      containing 15 mg E4 and 3 mg DRSP.

      All subjects entered the study site at least 12 hours before each dosing and fasted for at
      least 10 hours prior to each dose.

      All subjects were to receive both Treatment A (Reference; a single 15 mg E4/3 mg DRSP tablet
      without food (fasted)) and Treatment B (Test; a single 15 mg E4/3 mg DRSP tablet with food
      (fed)) either at the first treatment period (Period 1) or the second treatment period (Period
      2). Approximately half of the subjects were randomized to receive either Treatment A followed
      by Treatment B (Sequence AB), or Treatment B followed by Treatment A (Sequence BA).
