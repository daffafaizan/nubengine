      1cm or 2cm margins. The margin will be based upon the previous biopsy site or area of
      pigmentation. The skin and subcutaneous tissue (down to fascia) will be resected. Closure
      considerations may require removal of additional tissue for non-oncologic purposes. As per
      standard of care, sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed using a dual tracer technique
      (technetium radiolabeled sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue) with or without
      lymphoscintigraphy.
