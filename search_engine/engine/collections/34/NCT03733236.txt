    
      The study is an open label study in which a comparative group of patients will be
      prospectively selected from a resource of clinical trial data, the Virtual International
      Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA), on the basis of similar eligibility criteria and match for
      principal prognostic variables available at trial entry. Data from patients will be
      transferred to VISTA in a real time or at most, weekly basis and comparative group patients
      will be prospectively matched throughout the recruitment period. The VISTA investigators will
      be blinded to treatment group when receiving data from BrainsGate. The VISTA investigators
      will match each recruited BrainsGate patient with 3 patients from the VISTA archive. The
      matching criteria will include age ± 4 years; baseline NIH score matched exactly, and side of
      infarct.

      In addition, to the end of treatment visit, in which implanted patients will undergo a device
      removal procedure, two follow-up visits will be performed. The visits should be performed at
      30±5, and at 90±5 post enrollment. Aggregate trial duration will be ~100 days per patient,
      and the overall study duration will be up to 18 months.
