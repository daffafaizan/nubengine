      grades (P2-4) in each of the recruited schools will be randomly allocated to intervention or
      control arms. After the consenting process and baseline survey, we will conduct a 3-month
      intervention and then 2-month boosters which include 8 worksheets, around 15 online question
      quizzes and 30 WhatsApp messages. After 3-month and 6-month follow-up periods, we will assess
      the differences of children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (including SHS and THS
      at home, SHS at home from neighbours and SHS outside home), children's SHS-related knowledge
      and attitude, intention to smoke, respiratory symptoms, parents' smoking cessation, and
      family happiness. According to the results of baseline survey, we will also invite all the
      students exposed to SHS at home to provide their hair samples before intervention and at the
      6th month in order to obtain objective results (hair nicotine measurements).

      Aims of this study: (1) To reduce children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. (2) To
      reduce objectively measured exposure to tobacco smoke (hair nicotine) among children who are
      exposed to SHS at home at baseline. (6-month, laboratory test). (3) To promote SHS-related
      knowledge and attitudes, and avoidance of SHS among children. (4) To reduce children's
      intention to smoke. (5) To reduce children's respiratory symptoms. (6) To promote smoking
      cessation (past 7 days) of parents. (child report) (7) To promote children's perception of
      family happiness.
