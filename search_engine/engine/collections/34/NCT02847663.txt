      minutes) vs. cold water immersion (10°C for 15 min) and a passive control group (20 min
      supine position) are compared. These effects are examined after a muscle damage protocol of
      the frontal thighs (3 x 30 jumps). The objective recovery parameters are vertical jump,
      maximum voluntary contraction of the anterior thigh muscle, heart rate, blood pressure,
      skin-core body temperature and the oxygen saturation of the thigh muscles. Subjective
      recovery parameters are the local muscle soreness details and the general exhaustion details.
      The parameters are directly and 24, 48 and measured 72 hours after exposure. The aim is to
      elicit the effects of whole body cooling to make recommendations to. The current scientific
      knowledge situation calls for further studies to whole body cooling.
