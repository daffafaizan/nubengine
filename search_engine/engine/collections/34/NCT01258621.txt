      assessed for eligibility for LDP. Exclusion criteria were: major vessels contact in cancer
      patients, severe organ dysfunction, BMI > 35, and refusing laparoscopic approach. All
      laparoscopic procedures were carried out by the same surgical team with large experience in
      open pancreatic surgery. All patients were treated according to an early recovery after
      surgery protocol. Primary endpoint was conversion rate. Secondary endpoints were operation
      time, operative blood loss, postoperative morbidity, and length of stay.
