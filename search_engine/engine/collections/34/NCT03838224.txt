      modifies the altered sensorimotor function in people with neck pain. The secondary objectives
      will be to investigate the effects of a single DN session on muscle length (indirectly
      measured with FRT) and to investigate the effects of a single DN session on self-reported
      pain.

      With this aim, a random control trial (RCT) design will be conducted with two groups;
      intervention group (dry needling of the OCI) and placebo group (sham needling). Sham needling
      has shown to be a valid control method in dry needling research.

      The study will take two days. In the first day, the outcome measures will be measured before
      (baseline) and immediately after the intervention (immediate follow-up). In the second day
      (one-week follow-up), outcome measures will be measured again. Pain intensity, measured with
      the visual analogue scale, will be only measured at baseline and one-week follow-up.

      The baseline and follow-up assessments will be performed by an independent assessor who will
      be blinded to the intervention allocation. The interventions will be provided by a therapist
      with dry needling training and 3-years of musculoskeletal experience who will be blinded to
      outcome measures.
