        -  Compare the efficacy of androgen suppression and radiotherapy with or without subsequent
           paclitaxel, estramustine, and etoposide, in terms of overall and disease-free survival,
           biochemical and local control, and freedom from distant metastasis, in patients with
           localized high-risk prostate cancer.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prostate-specific
      antigen level (â‰¤ 10 ng/mL vs 11-100 ng/mL), tumor stage (T1-2 vs T3-4), Gleason score (7 vs
      8-10), and prior hormone use (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment
      arms.

      All patients receive androgen suppression comprising a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
      (LHRH) agonist AND bicalutamide OR flutamide for 4 months. Beginning 8 weeks after the
      initiation of androgen suppression, all patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a
      week, for 7-8 weeks. Patients who received prior androgen suppression therapy count time to
      radiotherapy from start date of prior hormonal therapy.

        -  Arm I: Patients continue androgen suppression therapy (LHRH agonist only) for
           approximately 20 more months after radiotherapy is completed.

        -  Arm II: Patients continue therapy as in arm I and receive chemotherapy beginning 28 days
           after completing radiotherapy. Chemotherapy comprises oral estramustine 3 times daily
           and oral etoposide twice daily on days 1-14 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2.
           Chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,440 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years.
