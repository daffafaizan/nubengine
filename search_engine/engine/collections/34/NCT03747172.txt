      obtain information about CAM use from patients. The screening tool was based on a The
      National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine's (NCCAM) classification of CAM.
      CAT were grouped into five main categories: (1) biologically based therapies , (2) mind/body
      therapies, (3) manipulative and body-based therapies, (4) Energy therapies and (5)
      alternative medical systems.

      The questionaire was tailored to meet the objectives of this study and to be adjusted to
      hospice patients specifics. It was piloted on the group of 25 patients, resulting in some
      vocabulary changes. The final questionnaire consists of 25 multiple-choice, semi-structured
      questions and takes about 15 min to complete. For each general CAM category the detailed
      information was collected on the type of specific therapy that was used. Patients were
      considered as CAM users if they have used at least one therapy from at least one of the
      categories during the period of 12 months prior to the screening. Patients were asked to
      specify the reasons for CAT usage, experienced effects of the therapy, stage at which
      patients considered using CAM
