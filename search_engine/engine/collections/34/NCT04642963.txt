      pharmacotherapy, ICD implantation and electrophysiology-guided catheter ablation. The
      treatment, however, is associated with a relatively high risk of VT recurrence. Given the
      limited therapeutic options and significant impact on patients quality of life, non-invasive
      cardiac radiosurgery has been recently gaining popularity in scientific literature as a
      viable alternative to salvage catheter ablations. Considering the scarcity of data from
      prospective trials and concern about the safety of the treatment method, this trial seeks to
      determine whether Stereotactic Management of Arrhythmia - Radiosurgery in Treatment of
      Ventricular Tachycardia (SMART-VT) meets the expected safety requirements for clinical use.
