    
      This is a prospective, openï¼Œinvestigator initial clinical trial with a single arm, aimed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of decitabine combined with Second-line
      chemotherapy regimens (CODOX-M/IVAC) in relapsed or refractory T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. A
      total of 40 patients are planned to be enrolled into the study. Patients with diagnosis of
      relapsed or refractory T-lymphoblastic lymphoma will be treated with decitabine plus
      CODOX-M/IVAC. The primary end point is responder rate (RR) and time to progression (TTP), and
      the secondary end points include overall survival (OS) and the median survival time (MST).
