      given as an IV push dose in combination with continuous infusion cyclosporine and oral
      etoposide concurrent with and prior to radiotherapy in children with newly diagnosed primary
      intrinsic brain stem glioma. II. Determine the incidence and severity of other toxicities of
      vincristine in this regimen in these patients. III. Determine a safe and tolerable dose of
      vincristine under these conditions to be used in phase II studies. IV. Seek preliminary
      evidence of antitumor activity in this setting in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is dose escalation study of vincristine. Patients receive radiotherapy daily
      for 6 weeks with concurrent induction chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy consists of
      vincristine IV push weekly for 6 weeks, oral etoposide daily on days 1-21 and 29-49 and
      cyclosporine IV over 2 hours prior to vincristine followed by a continuous 36 hour infusion.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vincristine. If dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT) occurs in 2 or more of 3-6 patients, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been exceeded
      and the preceding dose is declared the MTD. Maintenance therapy consists of 6 monthly courses
      of cyclosporine IV over 36 hours beginning on day 1, vincristine IV push on day 1, and oral
      etoposide daily for days 1-21. Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 6 patients will be accrued into this study at a rate of 12
      patients per year.
