      was examined.

      The quality of royal gel is determined by the amount of polyphenol it contains. Polyphenol in
      royal gel was assessed in the following stages: first, the sample was diluted with ethanol
      50% to 1:10 ratio, and then, 100µl of this preparation was poured into a test tube, and 750µl
      of 1:10 diluted solution of FCR (Folin Ciocalteau Reagent) was added and left at room
      temperature for five minutes. Then, 750µl of sodium carbonate 6% solution was added to each
      tube, and after keeping these tubes in the dark for one hour, absorption was measured at
      780nm wavelength. Negative control consisted of all reaction compounds, except the sample,
      for which, ethanol 50% was used instead. The sample concentration was determined using the
      gallic acid standard. By definition, the desirable quality of polyphenol in natural royal gel
      ranges from 0.15mg (minimum) to 0.75mg (maximum) in every 100 grams, and this was determined
      0.5 mg for the sample used in the present study, indicating a good quality (15).
