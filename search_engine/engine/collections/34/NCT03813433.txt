      of the need of elimination of bacterial infection; the lack of natural apical constriction
      against which a suitable filling material can be placed is considered the main problem.

      In the past many different treatments have been proposed for immature permanent teeth with
      necrotic pulps such as:Custom fitting of filling materials like gutta percha, Periapical
      surgeries, apexification. The disadvantages of these treatments are: the compromised
      Crown/root ratio, possibility of vertical fracture.

      Pulp revascularization is dependent on the ability of residual pulp and apical and
      periodontal stem cells to differentiate. These cells have the ability to generate a highly
      vascularized and rich living tissue.

      MTA was chosen as coronal seal to be placed over the blood clot due its a biocompatibility,
      bio-inductivity. However, the disadvantages of MTA are: discoloration of the coronal dentine
      when placed in the canal and the difficult handling properties.

      Recently, a new bioceramic material has been introduced to the market, namely, EndoSequence
      which is bioactive, has antibacterial activity, less cytotoxic effect and similar
      antimicrobial properties, maintain color stability of the tooth when compared to MTA
