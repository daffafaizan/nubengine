      male participants. This study will characterize how TAK -994 is absorbed, metabolize,
      excreted by the body, after single oral administration by collecting plasma, urine, and feces
      samples for testing.

      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. The study consists of 2 parts: Part A and
      Part B.

      In Part A, all participants will receive TAK-994 as tablet and [14C]TAK-994 as intravenous
      infusion. In Part B, all participants will receive a single dose of [14C]TAK-994 as an oral
      suspension.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 67 days, including a 28-day screening period plus
      approximately 30 days for follow up.
