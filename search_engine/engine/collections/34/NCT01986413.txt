    
      Non invasive ventilation (NIV) is one of the major medical innovations of the last 30 years.
      Especially continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the established Gold Standard in
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment.

      NIV with bilevel ventilation (BiPAP-ST) is the established Gold Standard in acute hypercapnic
      respiratory failure, especially in exacerbated COPD.

      Still, the adaption of CPAP in OSA is less complicated than a bilevel therapy in hypercapnic
      failure. The adjustment of NIV requires not only the definition of expiration pressure (PEEP)
      but also of inspiration pressure support. Only adequate pressure difference guarantees
      effective ventilatory assistance and an improvement of alveolar ventilation. The pressure
      changes need to be defined by the physician, as well as the breathing frequency.

      Ventilation can furthermore be controlled by a target volume (volume controlled) or a target
      pressure (pressure controlled).

      Moreover, patients with respiratory insufficiency are often suffering of significant dyspnoea
      and are hard to accustom to a respiratory mask.

      There is a lack of systematic studies addressing the effects of different ventilator settings
      on sleep and life quality, as well as studies about the necessary monitoring extent during
      the NIV initiation.
