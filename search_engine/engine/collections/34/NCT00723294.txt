      patients will undergo imaging by mammography, ultrasound, and breast MRI. Patients will then
      undergo complete surgical resection of the primary tumor. The primary and secondary
      objectives of the study are described below.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the rate of complete tumor ablation in patients treated with cryoablation,
           with complete tumor ablation defined as no remaining invasive or in situ carcinoma
           present upon pathological examination of the targeted lesion

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the negative predictive value of MRI in the post-ablation setting to
           determine residual in situ or invasive breast carcinoma

        -  To describe the adverse events associated with cryoablation

        -  To prospectively gather pain assessment data on cryoablation and surgical resection

        -  Explore technical variables that may affect the success of cryoablation
