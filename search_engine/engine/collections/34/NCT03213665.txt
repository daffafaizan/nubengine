      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat with advanced solid tumors (including central
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or histiocytic disorders that harbor gain
      of function mutations in EZH2, or loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF complex subunits
      SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 at a dose of 520 mg/m^2/dose twice daily for patients without any CNS
      involvement or 1200 mg/m^2/dose orally twice daily for patients with CNS involvement.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival in pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat
      that harbor gain of function mutations in EZH2, or loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF
      complex subunits SMARCB1 or SMARCA4.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of tazemetostat in children with relapsed or
      refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to tazemetostat and specifically,
      whether tumors that harbor different missense mutations or fusions will demonstrate
      differential response to tazemetostat treatment.

      II. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
