      e-coaching and ICT-based self-regulation as add-on to regular care. The intervention consists
      of a baseline measurement (T0), followed by a preparation phase of 2-3 weeks duration before
      the first group meeting. The first group meeting is followed by the action phase with a
      second group meeting in 9-11 weeks. During the action phase, test persons are stimulated to
      use the special self-regulation computer program, monitor their dietary sodium intake on this
      website and receive e-coaching from their personal coach. Test persons in the control group
      receive standard care. After 3 months in study (T1), all test persons visit the outpatient
      clinic for measurements and data collection. The half year long maintenance phase starts
      after this timepoint, test persons in the intervention group can continue the use of the
      special website and get feedback from their coach at 3, 4, 5, 6 months. After 9 months of
      total study duration (T2), data collection and measurements take place.

      At each timepoint blood and 24-hourly urine is collected, test persons fill out
      questionnaires. The intervention group collects after 5 weeks in study an additional
      24-hourly urine collection to assess dietary compliance and enable feedback.

      Cost-efficacy and implementation analysis will be conducted after study closure.
