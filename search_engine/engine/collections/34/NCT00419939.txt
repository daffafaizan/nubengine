      Danish and international experiences 250 of these get severe injuries. About 120 younger
      people often males need highly specialised neuro-rehabilitation at one of the two regional
      centres in Denmark. Due to the limited amount of research in this field it cannot be
      documented but assumed, that the patient's motivation and involvement in planning and
      implementation of rehabilitation improve subjective and objective outcome. Motivation,
      involvement and learning in patients with severe traumatic brain injury constitute a major
      challenge. The cases are individual, but often involve disturbances in language and
      perception, lack of realization, reduced initiative, tiredness and depression. The focus of
      this project is the intensive physical and psychosocial rehabilitation viewed as a process of
      relearning targeted daily life competences using the ICF levels of function, activity and
      participation.
