      sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Also a link has already been demonstrated between OSAS and
      hypertension.

      Nowadays, the most efficient treatment of the OSAS is the continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (cPAP). Several studies have also shown that cPAP could reduce arterial blood pressure of
      about 3,3 mmHg in OSAS patients. Unfortunately, 40% of the patients either refuse being
      treated by cPAP or give up treatment. In parallel, alternative medications are proposed to
      patients with moderate OSAS and hypertension, in order to decrease their cardiovascular
      risks. A study led on rats has shown the superiority of the beta adrenergic blocking agents
      in the decrease of hypertension in OSAS patients.

      Our study has also the objective to compare the effects of Valsartan and cPAP on hypertension
      in OSAS patients. Those one will be randomized either in the group "treatment by Valsartan
      and then by cPAP" or in the group "treatment by cPAP and then Valsartan" (cross-over study).
