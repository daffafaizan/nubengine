      pronounced in women than in men, and women are particularly vulnerable to ongoing
      smoking-related morbidity and mortality. One important reason for gender differences in
      smoking cessation is concern about cessation-related weight gain among women, which is
      associated with poorer cessation outcome. We previously documented that cognitive behavior
      therapy to minimize weight concerns (CBT) was effective in promoting cessation and
      controlling weight gain among weight concerned women smokers. The current study is a
      randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to determine whether the addition of bupropion
      (Zyban) to CBT (12 sessions over 14 weeks, with 6 booster sessions) will enhance longer-term
      abstinence. Bupropion was the clear medication of choice for this trial because it is
      efficacious in promoting smoking cessation, attenuates cessation-related weight gain
      (particularly in women), and relieves negative mood, which appears more common in
      weight-concerned women. Four hundred fifty weight concerned women smokers will be randomized
      to either CBT for weight concerns plus standard cessation or standard smoking cessation only
      and six months of either bupropion (Zyban) or placebo (2 x 2 design). Primary outcome will be
      rates of smoking abstinence at 1 year and time to relapse across the four treatment
      conditions. In addition, we will determine the effects of these treatments on tobacco
      withdrawal, mood, and weight. Results of this investigation will provide information on the
      relative efficacy of the CBT intervention and bupropion alone and in combination and the
      utility of drug and counseling strategies that are specifically tailored for a high-risk
      population.
