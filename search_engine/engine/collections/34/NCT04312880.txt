      Investigators will recruit patients undergoing elective, primary, decompressive lumbar
      surgery via a posterior surgical approach of less than 3 levels. This includes patients
      undergoing decompressive lumbar laminectomies with or without fusion. Fusion may include
      posterior interbody and/or posterior lateral techniques with instrumentation.

      There will be 3 treatment arms with the goal of 65 patients in each arm. Patients will be
      randomized pre-operatively and enrolled into the IV transexamic acid group (receiving
      intraoperative intravenous tranexamic acid infusion), or the topical transexamic acid group
      or the control/placebo group (receiving intraoperative intravenous saline). The Investigators
      expect the duration of each treatment group to be approximately 4-5 months. Therefore, the
      study should be completed within 1.5 years. The primary surgeon and anesthesia staff will not
      be blinded to the treatment arm due to the nature of the different administration routes, but
      post-operative nursing staff will be blinded to administration routes.
