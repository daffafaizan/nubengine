      oxygenation. Adequate tissue oxygenation is essential to maintain normal physiologic
      functions and to reduce complications, such as wound infections.

      Fat tissue is relatively hypoperfused and, therefore, poorly oxygenated. Subcutaneous tissue
      oxygenation in the obese is thus critically low and even supplemental oxygen only slightly
      increases subcutaneous oxygenation.It is likely that poor subcutaneous oxygenation in the
      obese surgical patients results in part from inadequate intraoperative fluid replacement.

      It remains unknown how to hydrate obese surgical patients best. The most physiologic approach
      for perioperative fluid replacement is now thought to be goal-directed management, using
      stroke volume as the treatment parameter.
