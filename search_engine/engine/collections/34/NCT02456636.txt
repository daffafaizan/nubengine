      higher rate from obesity and obesity-related illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease,
      and arthritis. Local primary care physicians are an important resource for treating obesity
      in rural areas because of a lack of other community resources.

      This study is looking at how effective current, real-world primary care treatment models are
      in helping rural residents lose weight and maintain that weight loss. Physician clinics will
      be randomized (like picking numbers from a hat) to conduct one of the three methods. The
      method a participant is part of will depend on the method their physician's clinic is
      randomized to. The three methods involved in this study are:

        1. Individual weight-management counseling in person (in clinic individual visits)

        2. Group weight-management counseling, both in person and by telephone; the latter if
           preferred by the group (in clinic group visits)

        3. Group weight-management counseling by telephone (phone group visits)

      Participants will be in the study about 24 months. The number of in-person clinic visits and
      phone calls each participant will be asked to complete depends on the method.
