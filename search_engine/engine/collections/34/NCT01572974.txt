      life.While a diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is also associated with a decrease in quality
      of life, these studies evaluated Barrett's esophagus patients with GERD symptoms.It is
      unclear whether decrements in quality of life from cancer risk in patients with Barrett's
      esophagus are due to actual cancer risk or a patient's false perception.Here we Compare the
      overall quality of life of patients with no Barrett's esophagus , non-dysplastic Barrett's
      Esophagus (NDBE), Barrett's esophagus with low grade dysplasia (LGD), and Barrett's esophagus
      with high grade dysplasia (HGD). The Investigators will also Compare the overall quality of
      life of Barrett's esophagus patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
      symptoms to those with no GERD symptoms. Finally the investigators will compare the overall
      quality of life of patients with a perceived low risk of esophageal cancer to those with a
      perceived high risk of esophageal cancer
