      purposes used in staining cells and tissues for detecting neoplastic diseases. The main
      purpose of this product is to detect abnormal cervical lesions (CIN2+) during a gynecological
      speculum examination. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical
      performance of Folate Receptor-Mediated Epithelium Staining (FRDTM) in detecting cervical
      neoplastic lesions (CIN2+).

      The subjects who are enrolled in this study will first undergo the FRD test, then cytology
      and HPV test. Women with abnormal cytology (≥ ASCUS/AGC), positive FRD test in either the
      cervix or cervical canal, and/or positive HPV test will be referred to colposcopy. In
      addition, 10% of the subjects who tested negative for all three tests and are ≥ 25 years old
      will be randomly selected to complete a colposcopy as well.

      According to the colposcopy assessment, if the results show satisfied (type I) then a biopsy
      will be taken. Subjects with a positive FRD test for the cervical canal, unsatisfied
      colposcopy (type II-III), and/or detection of AGC during cytology will have to complete an
      ECC procedure as well. Finally, a histopathological examination will be done and used as the
      gold standard. Subjects with a histopathological examination result of < CIN2 will be asked
      to come back for a follow up visit within 6 months or 1 year, according to the investigator's
      discretion. Subjects can exit the study at any time after colposcopy.
