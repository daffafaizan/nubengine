      (group) study. The study consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (within 3 weeks
      prior to the start of study medication), treatment phase (8 to 15 days), and the follow-up
      phase (up to 6 days after the discharge from the hospital). Approximately 6 participants will
      be receiving the 14C-JNJ-39823277 in the study. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of
      adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical
      laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study
      will be up to approximately 6 weeks.
