      worse outcome after a bridge-enhanced ACL repair (BEAR) as defined by an 11.5 point
      difference on the IKDC Subjective or Objective Knee Evaluation score at two years after
      surgery. Additional objectives are to determine the effect of age on safety outcomes
      including infection, graft rejection, and need for further surgical procedures.
