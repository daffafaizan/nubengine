      18 years of age admitted with a central venous catheter expected to be in place for > 48
      hours. Patients will be randomized to either receive 1) Tegaderm CHG clear dressing or 2)
      standard clear Tegaderm IV dressing. All central line care will remain uniform between the
      two groups as dictated by the central line maintenance bundle currently directing central
      line care in our children's hospital. Study completion will occur at the time of central line
      removal or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first.
