      patients with a diagnosis of persistent hindfoot pain will be evaluated and randomized into 3
      groups. Group 1 will receive a customized slipper with 3mm horseshoe foot pieces and 2.5mm
      EVA cover (shore A 28). Group 2 will receive a customized slipper with 3mm medial / lateral
      wedge foot pieces and 2.5mm EVA cover (shore A 28). Group 3, considered to be control, will
      receive a plain slipper with no elements, only with an EVA cover of 2.5 mm (shore A 28) with
      the same characteristics as the intervention groups. The evaluator and the patient will be
      considered blind. The evaluations will be carried out at the beginning (T0), after 12 weeks
      of wearing the slippers (T12) and a reassessment at week 16 (T16) to monitor the pain. The
      primary outcome will be pain (numerical pain scale); secondarily the foot posture (Foot
      Posture Index), functionality by the FFI - Foot Function Index questionnaire to assess
      functionality, and finally the 6-minute walk test for walking performance. Statistical
      analysis: The data will be analyzed by t-student tests, Mann-Whitney test, repeated measures
      ANOVA and analysis by intention to treat.
