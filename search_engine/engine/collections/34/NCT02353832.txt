    
      A phase II study to assess safety and efficacy of the spacer injection process, ability of
      the spacer to effectively provide the space necessary to reduce acute events in the rectum,
      and also meet the SABR based rectal constraints, and to monitor stability of this process
      during SABR. Unlike IMRT, which uses smaller dose/fraction, when using such high
      dose/fraction, even a few mm of shift in spacer positioning may impact the dose that the
      rectum receives, and therefore, a rigorous study of stability of material during the SABR
      treatments will need to be determined. If there is some shift, by doing this study, we may be
      able to determine the margin of error that will be necessary in considering rectal organ
      dosimetry, based on the possible shift in positiong that may occur with the spacer over time.

      As the SABR therapy is strictly local, we will select for patients with prostate cancer
      locally confined to the prostate gland. As such, we will select eligibility criteria of low
      risk patients to minimize risk of extraprostatic spread, seminal vesicle invasion, and nodal
      spread. Hormonal therapy may also be used to shrink prostates that are massively enlarged as
      this may also help further reduce length of rectum that will be irradiated. As the primary
      toxicity will likely be mucosal damage, we will avoid enrolling patients with pre-existing
      mucosal dysfunction (including those with previous radiation, TURP, very large prostate
      glands, inflammatory bowel disease) and immunosuppressed individuals based on our phase I
      experience[13]. In this way, patients will be uniformly selected in a fashion that would
      identify patients likely to receive benefit from the therapy.
