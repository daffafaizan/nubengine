      syndrome (ARDS) is the ARDSnet protocol (N Engl J Med 2000; 342:1301-1308) which has been
      shown to improve survival by limiting tidal volumes and thus preventing over distention of
      the lungs. However, the lungs can also be damaged by under-inflation during mechanical
      ventilation, and current practice ignores the effects of chest wall compression of the lungs,
      which can cause under-inflation. The investigators have observed that a fraction of
      critically ill patients with apparent ARDS have lung function abnormalities caused by
      extrinsic compression which can be estimated by PES measurements. Changing ventilator
      settings to apply normal physiological pressure to the lung has been beneficial in many such
      patients. This protocol will formally test the clinical utility of PES measurements in
      patients with ARDS.

      This is a randomized controlled trial of therapy directed by esophageal balloon measurements
      (PES) versus therapy directed by ARDSnet protocol, the current standard of care.
