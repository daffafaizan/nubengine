    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with diffuse large B-cell/immunoblastic and
           Burkitt histologies with elevated serum free light chains (FLC).

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma with clonal immunoglobulin
           (Ig) DNA detection in the plasma.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the agreement between the detection of a monoclonal Ig DNA spike in plasma
           and the detection of a monoclonal DNA spike in tumor tissue.

        -  To estimate the agreement between the fragment length of a spike in tumor tissue and the
           fragment length of the spike in plasma.

        -  To estimate the detection rate of elevated FLC in each histology, including diffuse
           large B-cell/immunoblastic and Burkitt lymphoma.

        -  To estimate the detection rate of clonal Ig DNA in each histology, including diffuse
           large B-cell/immunoblastic, Burkitt lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  To analyze clinical and pathologic correlates of detection by the serum/plasma tests:
           disease subtype, stage of disease, disease bulk, lactate dehydrogenase, and Ki-67 index.

        -  To estimate the detection rate of clonotypic B-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells from patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood and tissue samples collected at the time of diagnosis are analyzed for serum free light
      chain and clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) DNA rearrangements and circulating clonotypic B-cells
      via PCR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 with diffuse large B-cell/immunoblastic
      histologies, 15 with Burkitt lymphoma, and 10 with Hodgkin lymphoma) will be accrued for this
      study.
