      protocol which include; bed rest, ambulation prohibited for 24-48 hours and starvation for
      several postoperative days till the recovery of bowel. Some studies reported the efficacy of
      early rehabilitation protocols or FTR protocols in thoracic surgery to reduce postoperative
      complications and to minimize hospital stay. But these studies are few and retrospective.
      Prospective randomized trials focuses based on the "fast track regimen" or medical fast track
      that interest only on the medical component .

      This prospective, randomized study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of postoperative
      care pathway using FTR protocol in comparison with the traditional postoperative care.

      In order to conduct this study, patients having a thoracic surgery will be randomly
      attributed to FTR protocol group or control group.
