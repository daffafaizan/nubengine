      operative trauma, and ischemia-reperfusion injury can induce a profound systemic innate
      immune response. This response contributes to postoperative morbidity and mortality, as
      increased proinflammatory cytokine levels are associated with several postoperative
      complications. Commensal microbiota in the gut can modulate systemic immune responses. The
      investigators hypothesize that reduction of systemic immune activation by disruption of the
      microbiome may be beneficial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      The objective of this trial is to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of disruption of the
      intestinal microbiota with broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients with systemic inflammation
      following cardiac surgery and to assess the effects on clinical outcomes in these patients.

      To this end, subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment arms and will receive
      either active treatment or a placebo during the seven days prior to surgery. Active treatment
      consists of a seven day course of oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day, oral vancomycin 500
      mg thrice per day, oral metronidazole 500 mg thrice per day and a six day course of oral
      fluconazole 200 mg once per day. Placebo treatment is randomly allocated in a double blind
      fashion in a 1:1 proportion to the active treatment. Stool samples will be obtained prior to
      and directly after study treatment to assess the effects on the richness and diversity of the
      gut microbiota. During and after surgery, plasma levels of circulating cytokines will be
      measured to assess the effects of microbiota disruption on the inflammatory response.
