      PTBD at the Interventional radiology department. Only patients who received percutaneous
      biliary drainage performed with right sided intercostal approach will be included in study.
      The initial puncture was ultrasound-guided in all patients. Any subsequent step of the
      procedure was performed under fluoroscopy. The cumulative fluoroscopy time (the total time of
      the exposure to X rays during intervention) after the US guided puncture was recorded. It
      will be used as an indirect measure of the complexity of the intervention and as an important
      parameter of radiation exposure. The patients will be divided into two groups based on the
      puncture angle: ≤30° group and >30° group. The two groups will be retrospectively analysed
      for technical success, fluoroscopy time and complications.
