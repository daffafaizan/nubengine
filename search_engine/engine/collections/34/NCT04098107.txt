      there has also been an increase in overuse injuries. Current methods of overuse injury
      prevention, such as pitch-counting, fail to account for differing techniques or effort and
      often ignore the elevated risk for children participating in two or more sports emphasizing
      the same body part. This wearable device seeks to more accurately monitor overuse to prevent
      and aid rehabilitation of overuse injuries.

      Subjects will be asked to fill out a short survey about their athletic activities. They will
      wear a prototype of a minimal risk throwing device during simulated baseball play in a sports
      medicine session or at the Human Motion Laboratory. Various motion data from the device and
      from the Motion Lab analysis will be collected to create and refine an algorithm to quantify
      workload and throwing movements.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to quantify motion capture data on movements common to
      baseball play. The secondary endpoints include quantifying injury associated with different
      baseball movement using the proposed system, development of algorithms to quantify workloads
      associated with injury during common baseball movements and validation of basic device
      measurements (Pilot Phase).
