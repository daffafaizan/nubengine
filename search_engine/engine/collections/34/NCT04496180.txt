      most frequent wound occurrences are represented by wound infections, skin dehiscence or
      parietal hernias.

      Despite standard surgical aseptically technique and perioperative prevention management of
      infections (e.g. antibiotics), wound complications after emergency laparotomies are still an
      important unmet challenge.

      Moreover, all these complications increase the cost of care requiring new managements.

      CINPt has been longly used to favour the successful healing of a plethora of open wounds.

      In particular CINPt is based on the application of local negative pressure to the wound
      surface. In case of open abdomens, the procedure is performed by applying a sterile abdominal
      dressing, which consists of a fenestrated soft plastic non-adherent layer with enclosed
      central foam, which is placed on the surface of the viscera. Then, two layers of porous
      sponge dressings are applied over the plastic layer. Finally, a transparent adhesive is
      placed over the foam and the wound to seal the abdominal cavity. The entire system is then
      connected, by suction tubes, to a device which ubiquitously applies negative pressure
      (cyclically or continuously) on the surface. The fluid from the wound is collected into a
      container. The benefits of negative pressure wound therapy have been reported to include
      removal of infectious material, reduction in oedema and improved perfusion to tissue. Since
      few years, a new negative pressure wound therapy has been created for closed wounds to reduce
      time of healing and avoid wound complications.
