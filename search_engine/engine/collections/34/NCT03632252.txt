      have the potential to restore function for the millions of Americans who experience mobility
      challenges due to injury and disability. Since individuals with mobility challenges have an
      increased metabolic costs of transport, the benefit of such assistive devices is commonly
      assessed via the reduction in the metabolic work rate of the individual who is using the
      device. Currently, metabolic work rate can only be obtained in a laboratory environment,
      using breath-by-breath measurements of respiratory gas analysis. To obtain a single steady
      state data point of metabolic work rate, multiple minutes of data must be collected, since
      the signals are noisy and slow. In addition, the user has to wear a mask and bulky equipment.
      The investigators propose an improved way to obtain such estimates of metabolic work rate in
      real-time. In this project, the investigators will use various small sensors to optimize
      push-off timing for an active ankle prosthesis.
