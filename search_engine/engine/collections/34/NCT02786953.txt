      sleep-promoting intervention tailored to meet the needs of adolescents with T1D, building on
      successful sleep interventions in other populations, including components such as limiting
      caffeine, establishing a media curfew, and positive bedtime routines, while addressing the
      needs unique to adolescents with T1D, such as fear of hypoglycemia. The study will be
      conducted by a multidisciplinary team, consisting of Sarah Jaser, PhD, a pediatric
      psychologist, and two co-investigators, Beth Malow, MD, MS, a neurologist with specialty in
      sleep medicine, and Jill Simmons, MD, a pediatric endocrinologist. Sleep is a potentially
      modifiable risk factor that may have both a physiological and behavioral impact on diabetes
      outcomes. Given the strong associations between sleep and diabetes outcomes in the
      preliminary data, and recent evidence from sleep restriction studies indicating the impact of
      insufficient sleep on insulin sensitivity, behavior, and mood, there is reason to believe
      that a sleep-promoting intervention has the potential to improve outcomes in adolescents with
      T1D indirectly by improving adherence and directly through its effect on metabolic function.
      Therefore, the proposed study offers a novel approach to improve adherence, quality of life,
      and glycemic control in adolescents with T1D.
