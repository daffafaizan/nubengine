      how best to provide proper nutrition to their child and/or model healthy eating behavior. We
      have developed a curriculum that provides information about how to establish healthy eating
      patterns and social support for mothers with children under three years of age. The
      curriculum will be delivered in a support group format led by co-therapists affiliated with
      the UNC Eating Disorder Program.
