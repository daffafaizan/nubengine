      clearly demonstrated in the literature, which also emphasizes the need for evidence-based
      interventions targeting symptom management in such advanced patients. The main challenge is
      identifying an intervention that is not only effective in managing cancer-related symptoms
      but is also feasible, acceptable, and safe for this patient group. The proposed study aims to
      test the effects of a patient-centered self-administered acupressure intervention on fatigue
      management for Chinese advanced cancer patients using the robust study design of a
      randomized, wait-list controlled trial.
