      pembrolizumab and idelalisib in NSCLC patients whose disease has stopped responding to immune
      therapy. Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy that is given intravenously and is
      approved for treatment of malignant NSCLC. Idelalisib is the first-in-class oral PI3K-Î´
      inhibitor that is approved for treatment of certain forms of leukemia and lymphoma.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as anti-PD-1) are effective in treating NSCLC as a single
      agent, but overall response isn't optimal; overall response rates (ORR) are only ~20% on
      average. The goal of this study is to see whether combining standard therapy with additional
      immune modulators will increase response rates, compared to the response seen with
      pembrolizumab monotherapy.
