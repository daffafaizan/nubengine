      (IL-2) in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the
      median survival of patients treated with IL-2. III. Further delineate the toxicity of IL-2 in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive bolus interleukin-2 on days 1-5 and
      8-12. The cycle repeats every 3 weeks. Patient response is evaluated after 2 cycles. Patients
      with stable disease, partial, or complete response may be treated with maintenance IL-2 for
      up to 4 additional cycles. Patient evaluation is performed after every 2 cycles. At this
      point, patients with stable or responding disease may be treated with IL-2 every 6 weeks
      until disease progression, intolerable toxic effects, or 2 cycles beyond complete response.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued.
