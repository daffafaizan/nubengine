      program, hereafter referred to as the Program. They received a weight loss intervention as a
      part of routine medical care in the Program. At the end of their first consultation, each
      individual that met the inclusion criteria and failed to meet the exclusion criteria was
      asked if he or she would like to join the study. Each individual was informed that the study
      would not change the type or level of care that he or she would receive while enrolled to the
      program; however, researchers would be studying the effects of their care through additional
      screenings. Individuals who thereafter signed an informed consent form were monitored for
      changes in health outcomes without change to the Program.

      This study was observational. Health outcomes were assessed in individuals that predefined
      their program status (i.e., enrolled or not enrolled). Each participant received routine
      medical care, and the investigators studied the effects of the intervention. No new
      intervention or intervention specific to participants only was assigned.
