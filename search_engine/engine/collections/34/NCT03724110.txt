      acute stroke, specifically related to the use of intravenous thrombolysis. Effective urgent
      stroke evaluation and secondary stroke prevention is also essential to decrease the risk of
      recurrent stroke, however, there have been no studies to date examining the use of telestroke
      to improve delivery of non-emergent inpatient stroke care per American Heart Association
      (AHA) guidelines.

      Currently, access to stroke specialist expertise is limited resulting in significant
      disparities in stroke care. Previous publications have identified that patients in rural
      areas may receive sub-optimal stroke care that does not follow accepted guideline
      recommendations. Telestroke is a cost-effective mechanism to deliver specialist stroke care
      to hospitals that do not have in-person stroke consultation available. The aim of
      TELECAST-TIA is to determine whether specialist telestroke inpatient rounding improves
      guideline-based TIA treatment when compared to non-specialist transient ischemic attack
      treatment.

      The primary outcome of TELECAST-TIA is a composite score of 3 categories: diagnostic stroke
      evaluation, secondary stroke prevention, and stroke education. Individual components of the
      primary outcome were principally derived from AHA stroke guidelines. Additional outcome
      measures include individual analyses of the components of the primary outcome as well as the
      complication rate, stroke recurrence rate, transfer rate, patient and provider satisfaction
      levels, and a cost-analysis. All outcomes will be assessed at 1 year post-implementation,
      with data accruement starting after a 3-month lead in phase.
