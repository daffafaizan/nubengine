      Apart from the permanent disability, ocular trauma has a profound impact on both patients and
      society at different levels, including, but not limited to, psychological trauma, cosmetic
      disfigurement, socioeconomic costs, and the need for specialized medical care and vocational
      rehabilitation.

      Traumatic cataract is a common complication of pediatric eye injury. In developing countries,
      ocular trauma was responsible for up to 45% of childhood cataract. Vision loss induced by
      traumatic cataract is surgically manageable. However, the high risk of postoperative
      inflammation, posterior capsular opacification (PCO), amblyopia, and the associated ocular
      tissue damage may negatively impact visual outcome.

      Several studies reported visual outcome of pediatric traumatic cataract in different
      populations. With the sacristy of studies on traumatic cataract in Egyptian children, we
      conducted this retrospective study to report the demographic features, visual outcome, and
      complications of pediatric traumatic cataract at Assiut University Hospital, the biggest
      tertiary referral center in Upper Egypt.
