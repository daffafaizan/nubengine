      patients with complaints of acute onset vertigo over 18 years of age and who underwent brain
      MRI. Pregnant women, smokers, and those with significant neurological signs were excluded.
      Patients with acute ischemia with MRI were included in the central vertigo group, and
      patients with normal MRI were included in the peripheral vertigo group. Blood samples for
      native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT), disulfide, and IMA were collected from all patients at
      admission. Statistical analyzes were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows 16.0
      Package Program.
