      neurodevelopment. Premature infants are at risk of DHA deficiency and circulating levels
      directly correlate with health outcomes. Most supplementation strategies have focused on
      increasing DHA content in mother's milk or infant formula. However, extremely premature
      infants may not reach full feedings for weeks and commercially available parenteral lipid
      emulsions do not contain preformed DHA, so blood levels decline rapidly after birth. Our
      objective is to develop a DHA supplementation strategy to overcome these barriers. This
      single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial determined feasibility,
      tolerability and efficacy of daily enteral DHA supplementation (50 mg/day) in addition to
      standard nutrition for preterm infants (24-34 weeks gestational age) beginning in the first
      week of life. Blood FA levels will be analyzed at baseline, full feedings and near discharge
      in DHA or placebo supplemented preterm infants. Term peers will also have blood FA levels
      analyzed for comparison. Growth, feeding tolerance and adverse outcomes (NEC,
      intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), thrombocytopenia, sepsis) will be evaluated. Study
      progress and safety will be monitored by an external Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).
      Overall, the study aims to determine if daily enteral DHA supplementation is feasible and
      alleviates deficiency in premature infants.
