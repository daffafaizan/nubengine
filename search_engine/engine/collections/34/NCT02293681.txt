      research study), observational study to compare the effectiveness of infliximab with
      conventional therapies in ankylosing spondylitis participants with hip joint involvement. The
      study will be conducted in 3 parts: a 14-day screening, a 30-week first follow-up (Follow-up
      1), and an additional 22-week follow-up (Follow-up 2) up to Week 52. Participants will be
      assigned to two groups based on the current treatments they are receiving: cohort 1
      participants receiving infliximab with or without combination of disease modifying drugs
      (DMARDs-such as Sulfasalazine, Methotrexate and Thalidomide) and/or non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and in cohort 2 who are receiving DMARDs and/or NSAIDs for
      treatment of pain will be observed. Participants will primarily be assessed for change in
      harris hip score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
