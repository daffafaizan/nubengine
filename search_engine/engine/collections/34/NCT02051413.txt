    
      Rationale: Predictive factors and biomarkers of response to antidepressants in major
      depressive disorder are scarce. Beta-arrestins are proteins which inhibit G Protein Coupled
      Receptors and desensitize serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors.

      Hypothesis: The study hypothesis is that Beta-arrestins 1 and 2 are predictive factors and
      biomarkers of response to antidepressants in major depressive disorder.

      Method: In a controlled prospective open naturalistic monocentric 3-month study, 60 patients
      with a major depressive disorder requiring a treatment with venlafaxine will be included and
      assessed before treatment, 1 month and 3 months post-treatment. 20 controlled healthy
      subjects matched for age and gender will also be assessed.

      Assessments:

      The Beta-arrestin pathway will be assessed using genetic polymorphisms, Peripheral Blood
      Mononuclear Cell measures and functional pathway.

      Antidepressant response will be assessed using depression scales, olfaction and memory as
      surrogate markers of neurogenesis.
