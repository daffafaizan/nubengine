      significant physical, psychological and social impact on daily activities, emotional and
      social life as well as work. In Chronic hand eczema, there is a close relationship between
      atopic dermatitis (that involves 70% of patients), sensitization to environmental antigens
      and irritant triggering factors. There are limited treatment options for Chronic hand eczema
      refractory to highly potent topical steroids. The only systemic treatment labelled in Chronic
      hand eczema, alitretinoin, is associated with moderate efficacy, high drop-out due to adverse
      events and it requires strict contraception measures in women of child bearing potential.
      Dupilumab has recently demonstrated high efficacy and good safety profile in the treatment of
      moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. There is a crucial need of developing new treatment
      options in Chronic hand eczema refractory to topical therapy. the investigators hypothesise
      that Dupilumab will also have high efficacy and good safety profile in the treatment of
      moderate to severe Chronic hand eczema refractory to highly potent topical corticosteroids.
