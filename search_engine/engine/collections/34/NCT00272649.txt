      potentially much higher biologic activity in pre-clinical studies than the production process
      used in a previous study (clinical protocol MB-002-003). While both processes are based on
      individual subject autologous tumor RNA and autologous monocyte derived DCs, the maturation
      of DCs in this newly modified process involves an altered regimen of culture with cytokines.
      In addition, huCD40L mRNA is added to the autologous expanded tumor total mRNA for
      electroporation. These changes promise a much improved migration, and activity profile of the
      DC-Immunotherapeutic product in RCC subjects.
