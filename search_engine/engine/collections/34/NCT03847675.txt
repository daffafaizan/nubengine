      as they approach school age, as reading exposes the child to rich language and diverse
      content. Reach Out and Read program (ROR) is an American non-profit organization that
      advocates for childhood literacy.

      In this study the investigators aim to implement an adapted version of the "Reach Out and
      Read" program and to encourage parents to read Arabic books to their children in order for
      this to become a daily habit. The goal of this study is to see an increase in the proportion
      of parents who read Arabic books to their children and by extension children will grow up
      loving to read Arabic books and ultimately may have improved Arabic literacy.
