      motivational/coaching message to justice-involved youth and their caregivers will lead to
      greater youth substance use treatment attendance and engagement. The study will start with
      identifying the feasibility and acceptability of the SMS text-messaging intervention with
      community-supervised justice-involved youth. Then, the study will determine whether the
      tailored dyadic (youth and caregiver) SMS text-messaging intervention improves
      justice-involved youth substance use or dual diagnosis treatment attendance and engagement
      relative to standard of care (not receiving text messaging appointment reminders and
      motivational/coaching messages). Finally, the study will characterize patterns of key justice
      and behavioral health system-level factors that promote or hinder eventual adoption and
      sustainability of mHealth technology as a tool to improve treatment attendance for
      justice-involved youth.
