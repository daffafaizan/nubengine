      protein, may reduce blood pressure. This proposed study is designed investigate the effect of
      whey protein compared to another protein source.

      Since blood pressure is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease, if there is
      clear evidence that whey protein reduces blood pressure, dietary recommendations may be made
      regarding whey protein intake. However, dietary recommendations to consume whey protein as a
      means to improve health status must be science-based. Results from this study will provide a
      scientific basis for dietary recommendations regarding whey protein intake.
