      neck squamous cell carcinomas have 5 year survival ranging between 25-45%. 60% of all LH
      cancers occur in the developing world and its incidence in India ranges from 1.8-8.8 per
      1,00,000 population .

      Local control outcomes of OPC patients with stage III and IV OPC has been modest with
      reported loco-regional control rates of 50-60% at 5 years. For patients with locally advanced
      LH a 60-70% 2 year survival is seen and loco-regional control rates of 70% have been reported
      . Majority of locally advanced OPC and LH cancers are treated with a combination of
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CRT) with organ and function preserving approach.

      Identifying the area of tumour involvement in the OPC and LH could be challenging on CECT
      scans, requiring metabolic imaging with PET-CT for more precise definition of radiation
      target.

      Improvements in radiation treatment delivery techniques have enabled clinicians to explore
      the possibility of improving tumour control probability (TCP) and reduce normal tissue
      complication probability . This allows us to explore the role of escalating dose in the above
      group of patients to assess the safety and efficacy of the regime.

      Tumours treated in the standard dose arm will receive radiotherapy @ 220 cGy per fraction for
      30 fractions whilst those in the escalated dose arm will receive @ 245 cGy per fraction for
      30 fractions using IMRT techniques. Patients in both arms will receive weekly platinum based
      chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy.
