      weight retention has been shown to be one factor contributing to weight retention, obesity
      and possible development of type 2 diabetes. African-American women and other minority women
      are at especially high risk for the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. We propose to
      pilot a six-month postpartum-specific lifestyle intervention among urban-based, postpartum
      African-American women.
