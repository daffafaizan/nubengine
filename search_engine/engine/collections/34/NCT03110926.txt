      chemotherapy as induction treatment prior to standard neoadjuvant chemoradiation to decrease
      the rate of distant recurrence among patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.
      mFOLFOX6 is frequently used to treat metastatic esophageal cancer because of its high
      response rate in this setting. It has shown promising efficacy in several trials of patients
      with advanced esophageal cancer and it is the most commonly used combination regimen for this
      group of patients in the United States.

      The investigators propose treating a sample of 40 patients with 3 cycles of induction
      mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy over six weeks followed by standard chemoradiation and surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that patients who undergo induction chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6
      prior to standard neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery will have a lower rate of distant
      disease recurrence compared to standard neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery.
