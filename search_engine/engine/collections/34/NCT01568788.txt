    
      Dosage and administration route in this clinical trial:

      Subjects age 3 years or older was vaccinated following a single 0.5ml dose immunization
      regime.

      The preferred site of injection was the at the skin near outboard deltoid muscle of the upper
      arm.

      The administration route is after the sanitization with 75% alcohol, intramuscularly inject
      the test vaccine or the control vaccines when the skin was slightly dried for those subjects
      complied with the inclusion requirements.

      Safety indicators:

        -  Post-vaccination local and systemic adverse reaction levels, together with the
           soliciting adverse reaction within 30 minutes ;

        -  Post-vaccination local and systemic adverse reaction levels, together with the
           soliciting adverse reactions through 6 hours to the 29th day ;

        -  Summarize the adverse events/severe adverse events and the incidence levels from the
           inclusion of the subjects to the completion of the clinical trial.

      Immunogenicity indicators:

      Evaluate the Post-vaccination immunogenicity of the test and the control influenza vaccines
      in persons age 3 years and older by its HI antibody level on Day 28.

      Take 1:10 serum dilution as the minimum dilutability. The seroconversion in this trial was
      defined as the post-vaccination HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 when the HI antibody < 1:10 before
      the vaccination or the post-vaccination HI antibody titer quadruply increased when HI
      antibody ≥ 1:10 before the vaccination.

      The Immunogenicity criteria set for this clinical trial is the seroconversion shall be > 40%
      after 14 days of the vaccination.
