      versa. A significant proportion of cardiovascular diseases are coronary artery disease; most
      of these patients are subjected to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). That population
      of patients, which is under greater risk of depression, has been passing through the health
      system without adequate management of psychiatric difficulties. Despite the abundance of the
      data regarding the concomitancy of cardiovascular disease and depression, potential
      biomarkers for the development, the course and the recovery of both diseases are still in the
      focus of interest of many studies. One of the biomarkers that stands out is brain derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDFN). BDNF plays a significant role in regulating vascular growth and
      repair but also stimulates the survival, differentiation, and conservation of neurons. Its'
      serum level is reduced in cardiac failure and acute coronary syndrome, and indicates a higher
      risk of coronary incident in angina pectoris. BDNF is also reduced in depression, but
      increases during a pharmacological treatment along with the clinical improvement.

      Therefore the aim of the study is to detect the occurrence of depression in patients
      undergoing PCI and to determine the impact of psychiatric treatment on the functional
      recovery of those patient and the correlation with the changes of serum levels of BDNF.

      This represents the objectivization of the tertiary type of prevention intervention for
      recovery of cardiovascular patients who are currently passing through the investigator's
      health system with unrecognized psychiatric comorbidity.
