    
      A prospective phase I/II, nonrandomized open-label study of agen related macular degeneration
      and Stargartd patients with best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 20/200.
      Standardized ophthalmic evaluation will be perform at baseline and at weeks 1, 4,12 and 24
      (Â±1) following intravitreal injection of 10 x 106 bone marrow stem cells/ 0,1ml . Three
      measures will be used to evaluate the short-term safety of intravitreal of bone marrow stem
      cells: 1) severe visual loss, defined as a drop in 15 letters on ETDRS visual acuity scale;
      2) decrease in ERG response; 3) decrease in 5 square degrees on visual field; secondary
      safety outcomes : 1) increase in intra-ocular inflammation defined herein as anterior chamber
      cells and flare higher than 3+ for more than 1 month after injection according to a
      classification described elsewhere ; 2) decrease in CMT more than 50um; 3)genesis of abnormal
      tissues (teratomas) or tumors; 4) qualitative changes in retinal or choroidal perfusion, like
      macular nonperfusion. Secondary outcome measures will be used to evaluate the short-term
      efficiency of intravitreal of Bone Marrow Stem Cells: 1) improvement in ERG response; 2)
      increase in visual field: 3) increase in CSMT > 50um and not related to macular edemar or
      choroidal neovascularization; 4) increase > 5 letters on BCVA
