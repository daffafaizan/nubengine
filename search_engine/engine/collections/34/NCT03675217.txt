      psychological and social repercussions, as consequence of the care that they provide. From
      Primary Health Care there is a "caregiver care program" to prevent and palliate this
      situation, consisting mainly in education programs in care and psychotherapy. There is
      controversy about the effectiveness of these programs, being necessary to develop new
      therapeutic strategies.

      Objectives: to determine the effects of a physical exercise program, adressed by the primary
      health care physioterapist, on health related quality of life (HRQol), pain and physical
      fitness in dependent patient caregivers included in the " caregiver care program" of a basic
      health area.

      Methodology: randomized clinical trial, with control group (GC = 32) and intervention group
      (GI = 36), double blind and pre and post-intervention evaluation. The GC received the usual
      program of the " caregiver care program". The GI also carried out a multi-component exercise
      program for 12 weeks, with 3 weekly sessions realized in group and monitored by
      physiotherapists. The outcomes variables are measured by Quality of life (SF-36), Burden
      (Zarit), anxiety (Goldberg Ansiety Questionanaire), depression (Yesavage Questionnaire), pain
      intensity (EVA), disability (Roland Morris) and physical fitness (battery of fitness tests).
      Patients evaluator and Outcomes Assessor are masked.

      Applicability of results: If the physical exercise program, carried out from the primary
      health care physiotherapy, improves the HRQol, pain and physical fitness, this intervention
      could be an effective therapeutic strategy in the "caregiver care programs". Furthermore the
      proposed intervention is simple, reproducible and requires few resources.
