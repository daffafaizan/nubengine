      inhibitors (ICIs), nivolumab and pembrolizumab, leads to 20-30% of complete remission (CR)
      rate. This means that for the majority of patients a consolidation strategy is usually
      offered, in order to reduce relapse rate.

      Strategies to improve CR rates should therefore be implemented, including combination
      treatments. In solid tumors, the combination of ICIs and radiotherapy led to higher response
      rates without mjor toxicity concerns. Radiotherapy is an effective therapeutic option already
      used in Hodgkin lymphoma patients, also in the setting of relapsed/refractory disease. In his
      observational study we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICIs and radiotherapy
      administered in combination in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.
