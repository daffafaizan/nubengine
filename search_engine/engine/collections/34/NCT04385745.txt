      cannot be executed in a blinded fashion, because all patients treated by the study method
      will be invited.

      The study purpose is to investigate long-term biodegradation process of the
      polylactide-co-glycolide intramedullary nails, used in treating the forearm shaft fractures
      in children. It is aimed to determine the stage of biodegradation of the
      polylactide-co-glycolide intramedullary nails, compared with the time since operation and the
      potential complications and/or radiographic and clinical recovery at least 4 years after the
      implant implementation.

      Close clinical recovery is another objective of the study.

      Potential adverse events, being related to the biodegradation process of the implant, are to
      be evaluated: fluid accumulation, sinus formation, osteolysis, swelling, cyst formation.
      Further, the soft-tissue reaction in the surroundings of the former fracture will be
      evaluated.

      Radiographic recovery will be be evaluated in means of plain radiograph investigation (plain
      radiographs in lateral and anterior-posterior views). The signs of bone healing after the
      long-bone diaphysis fracture, including the resolution of the previous callus formation,
      tubularization of the long-bones around the previous fracture area, remodeling of the angular
      and rotational alignment will be analyzed.
