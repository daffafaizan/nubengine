      such as: obesity, hypertension and diabetes. In 2013, cardiovascular diseases were the
      leading cause of death in women (34.4%) and the second in men (28.0%). There is a forecast
      that overweight and obesity will reach levels of 89% and 85% in men and women, respectively,
      by 2030. This will result in an increase in the obesity-related prevalence of coronary heart
      disease by 97%. The promotion of research on arterial hypertension and how it could be
      reduced is one of the basic pillars in decreasing the prevalence and incidence in the Spanish
      population. Research should anticipate and develop treatments and vaccines that prevent new
      scenarios of widespread infection.

      Therefore, the main objective is to study the effects of the use of a mobile application plus
      recommendations based on a Mediterranean diet on the intake of micronutrients from natural
      sources (not drugs) on health indicators, cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure...),
      physical condition and body composition in the adult Spanish population.
