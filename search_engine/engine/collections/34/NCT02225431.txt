      patients undergoing imaging diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (contrast-induced acute
      kidney injury, CI-AKI).

      Several protocols have been tested for the prevention of CI-AKI, including periprocedural
      hydration with isotonic saline or sodium bicarbonate, antioxidant compounds, use of low- or
      iso-osmolar contrast agents, and hemofiltration or dialysis. The results of these
      interventions and strategies have been often disappointing or inconclusive and intravenous
      volume expansion remains the only therapy of undisputed efficacy.

      Bioimpedance analysis is an inexpensive, rapid, and accurate tool for evaluating a patient's
      hydration status, and can be performed at the bedside within minutes [Maioli, JACC
      1014;63:1387-94]. In this study we defined patients with "lower fluid status" with high risk
      of CI-AKI (Male with resistance/height ratio > 315 Ohm/meter and Female > 380 Ohm/meter).
      BIVA may represent the optimal tool to monitor the adequacy of volume expansion and
      protective strategy delivery.

      However, most hydration protocols rely on a "one size fits all" approach with a fixed volume
      and time of infusion without an assessment of whether adequate hydration was achieved. This
      practice risks either under-hydration without true amelioration of CI-AKI risk or
      over-hydration with risk of adverse outcomes.

      Thus, on the basis of results of BIVA testing a randomized fluid infusion plan is prescribed.
