    
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm EFS. Patients undergoing use of an
      Impella device for cardiogenic shock or PPCI, requiring an arteriotomy created by 13 to 14 F
      sheaths (arteriotomies up to approx. 18 F), via the common femoral artery will be screened
      against the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the patient meets study eligibility
      requirements, they shall be invited to participate, provide informed consent, and shall
      subsequently be assigned a study ID number. Enrollment will occur at the point where the
      PerQseal study device first enters the patient's body.

      The planned enrollment is a minimum of 20 treated patients at a maximum of 5 study sites
      located in the United States.
