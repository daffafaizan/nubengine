    
      BKM120 is a potent and highly specific oral pan-class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)
      inhibitor, currently under investigation in a first-in-man study in patients with advanced
      solid tumors (wild type and PIK3CA-mutated). Consistent, dose-dependent pharmacodynamic
      activity has been demonstrated and clear signs of anti-tumor activity have been seen with
      BKM120. Three breast cancer patients showed significant tumor shrinkage after â‰¥ 2 months. Two
      confirmed partial responses (PRs) per RECIST have been seen, one in a patient with a triple
      negative KRAS-mutated breast cancer and the other in a patient with an estrogen receptor
      (ER)-positive, PIK3CAmutated tumor. Two minor responses have also been observed; one of these
      occurred in a HER2+/ER+ breast cancer patient.
