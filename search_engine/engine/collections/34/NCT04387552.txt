    
      The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of mHealth prenatal and postnatal
      interventions aimed at promoting safe sleep (SS) practices and breastfeeding (BF) within a
      population of pregnant Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
      clients.

      The study will randomize 2,000 pregnant women, when they reach 34 weeks gestation, to one of
      four mHealth prenatal/postnatal messaging combinations of safe sleep and breastfeeding
      practices.
