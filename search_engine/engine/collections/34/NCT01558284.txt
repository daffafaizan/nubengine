      The effect on symptoms will be rated by symptom scores. The primary endpoint will be the
      symptomatic benefit reported by the patient answering the simple question: Did your symptoms
      improve compared to prior to the clinical trial.

      Additional secondary endpoints will capture sleep quality, changes in stool texture and
      individual symptom scores employing standardized symptom scores.

      The study design is a 4 week, randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind study where 40
      patients receive either placebo (20) or NEU-P11 (20). In the mid of the four week time of the
      Study the dose can be doubled of the patient does not recognize any relief of the D-IBS.
