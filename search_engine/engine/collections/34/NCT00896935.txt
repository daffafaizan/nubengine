        -  Provide cancer investigators access to a wide variety of tissues and biospecimens for
           translational studies in cancer.

        -  Collect and preserve tissue from the primary organ site (uninvolved and involved with
           cancer), from the metastases, from patient blood (serum and lymphocytes), and from
           patient urine.

        -  Provide quality-controlled storage and management of the specimen bank.

        -  Collect relevant clinical and pathologic information with appropriate privacy
           protection.

        -  Contribute to the development of a comprehensive database annotated with relevant
           clinical data, pathology, and research findings.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumor samples, lymph node samples, and normal pancreas tissue samples are collected. Blood
      samples are also collected prior to surgery, six months after the initial blood draw and
      tissue sample collection, and every six months thereafter for two years.
