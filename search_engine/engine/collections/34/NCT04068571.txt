      Baseline and Endline surveys, and qualitative interviews. The Diaries and the Surveys will be
      carried out in two Counties, Kakamega and Kisumu (Kenya). The qualitative interviews will be
      carried out in the two counties and in Nairobi as an additional county. The study will use a
      cluster randomized control trial design in Kakamega to evaluate the impact of I-PUSH program.
      In Kisumu, selected households will be followed-up to capture the health-seeking behavior,
      health insurance, and health expenditure pattern of households over time. The study will be
      initially for 17 months and will continue for three years subject to additional funding.
