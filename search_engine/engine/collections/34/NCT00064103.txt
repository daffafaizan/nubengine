      I. Determine the acute toxic effects of Ad5CMV-p53 gene administered as an oral rinse and as
      an intramucosal injection in patients with diffuse premalignant carcinoma of the oral cavity
      or oral pharynx.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      topical transduction efficiency of adenoviral-mediated wild type p53 gene transfer in
      patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the efficacy of this drug in reversing the histology of oral premalignancies in
      these patients.

      V. Determine the distribution of transgenic protein within the area of the premalignant
      lesion in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of Ad5CMV-p53 gene administered as an
      oral rinse.

      Phase I: Patients receive Ad5CMV-p53 gene by intramucosal injection into the area of the
      lesion followed at least 2 hours later by Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse on day 1. Patients
      then receive Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse twice daily on days 2-5. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Phase II: Patients receive treatment with intramucosal Ad5CMV-p53 gene as in phase I and
      Ad5CMV-p53 gene as an oral rinse at the MTD. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years. Patients then receive long-term
      follow-up annually for an additional 10 years.
