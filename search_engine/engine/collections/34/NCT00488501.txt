      will be included in your study after informed consent. The OptiVol (TM) feature will be
      activated and at baseline data is collected (blood sample including BNP, electrocardiography,
      echocardiography, chest X-ray and ICD check-up). During follow-up patients will be
      re-assessed in case of an OptiVol alert or in case of heart failure.
