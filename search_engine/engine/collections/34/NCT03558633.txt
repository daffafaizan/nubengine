      during endotracheal intubation. To find out effectiveness external pressure is applied, the
      investigators will evaluate the relative position of esophagus and trachea. And also
      comparing the effects of Cricoid pressure and Paralaryngeal pressure during whole tracheal
      intubation procedures.

        1. Confirm the relative positions between esophagus and trachea in awake patients by using
           ultrasonography.

        2. Compare the effect of 'Cricoid pressure' and 'Paralaryngeal pressure' to esophageal
           opening during tracheal intubation procedure as below points.

      1) Awake states. (Before sedation) 2) Anesthetized states. (After muscle relaxation) 3)
      During direct intubation procedure.
