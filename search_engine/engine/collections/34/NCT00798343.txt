      Immunological objectives

        -  To evaluate heterosubtypic neutralising antibody to influenza viruses in older people

        -  To evaluate heterosubtypic neutralising antibody responses to human and non-human
           influenza viruses following seasonal influenza vaccine

        -  To evaluate homologous and heterosubtypic neutralising antibody responses to human and
           non-human influenza viruses after MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine;

        -  To evaluate cellular B and T cell responses to influenza H5 in non-exposed subjects who
           exhibit anti-H5 neutralising antibodies before and after seasonal (TIV) or pandemic H5
           vaccination

        -  To identify epitopes on the influenza haemagglutinin to which anti-H5 neutralising
           antibodies in sera from non-exposed subjects are directed Safety Objectives

        -  To evaluate safety of one or two IM doses of MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1)
           influenza vaccine, containing 7.5 μg of H5 antigen in adult subjects

        -  To evaluate safety of one IM dose of seasonal influenza vaccine, containing 15 μg of H1,
           H3 and B antigen in adult subjects

      Hypotheses:

        -  Heterosubtypic cross reacting antibodies to influenza exist in some elderly subjects and
           can be boosted by a single dose of (a) seasonal TIV or (b) pandemic influenza
           vaccination

        -  Heterosubtypic cross reacting antibodies to influenza do not exist in younger subjects
           and cannot be induced by (a) seasonal TIV or (b) pandemic influenza vaccination
