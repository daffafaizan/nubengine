      common type of esophageal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in China. Although
      concurrent radiochemotherapy is recommended as the standard treatment for advanced esophageal
      carcinoma, the local failure still reaches up to 44%-54%.

      Sodium Glycididazole(CMNa) is a radiosensitive drug for hypoxic tumor cells. Clinical trials
      showed that CMNa can improve local control rate and survival rate of esophageal cancer. This
      study is going to confirm the efficacy and safety of CMNa in concurrent radiochemotherapy of
      radiotherapy and 5-FU+DDP for esophageal squamous carcinoma.
