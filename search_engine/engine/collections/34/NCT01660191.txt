      lower endogenous levels of Coenzyme10 (CoQ10). This decrease in CoQ10 levels may be
      responsible for side effects such as myalgia.

      Previous studies have shown that Pitavastatin may not affect CoQ10 levels as other statins
      do, while still lowering cholesterol.

      In this study, investigators intend to compare the plasma levels of CoQ10 in patients taking
      3 different FDA-approved statins, in equipotent doses.
