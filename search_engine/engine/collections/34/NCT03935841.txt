    
      An open-labeled intervention study testing healthy, lean, and male volunteers on two separate
      occasions with at least 48 hours apart.

        1. blood sampling after consuming 36 gram 3-Hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) salt.

        2. blood sampling while given a variable rate of 3-OHB salt intravenously to replicate the
           concentrations seen during oral consumption.

      The primary outcome is differences in insulin concentrations (incremental AUC) 180 minutes
      after 3-OHB consumed orally vs. intravenously.

      Secondary outcomes includes iAUC for other gastrointestinal hormones and substrates
      (Glucagon, GLP-1, GIP, glucose, and 3-OHB) Gastric emptying will be evaluated using 1500 mg
      Paracetamol consumption before each intervention day. Urine will be analyzed for ketone
      concentrations/excretion rates.
