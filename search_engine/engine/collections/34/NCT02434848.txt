      vaccination courses to immunization with either double-dose Engerix B or Fendrix:

        1. Investigators will measure the proportion of individuals seroconverting with Hepatitis B
           surface antibody titres of >100 (and â‰¥10) IU/ml at 8 weeks after the immunisation
           course, as well as the durability of this response at 1 year following the completion of
           the course. The primary aim will be to provide some preliminary data from a head to head
           study of these two approaches with which to power a larger multi-centre randomized
           controlled trial.

        2. Investigators will define the magnitude and quality of the Hepatitis B-specific CD4+
           T-cell response following vaccination, thus obtaining key immunological data to fill the
           knowledge gap in T-cell responses to Hepatitis B vaccination, required to support the
           rationale design of future multi-centre, randomized study comparing vaccination
           strategies in HIV-infected non-responders to standard Hepatitis B vaccine courses.

      The research is original. There is only one published study to date looking at the efficacy
      of double-dose Engerix B in HIV-infected non-responders to standard courses1. There is
      currently anecdotal experience of the use of Fendrix in this group from the Investigators
      cohort and others. There are no head-to-head comparisons of these two strategies.
