      on those with >=1 diabetes autoantibody positive (GAD, IA2 ZNT8). Sensitivity analysis will
      be performed by repeating all analysis defining T1D as a) double antibody positivity and b)
      single antibody positivity combined with a high genetic risk score for T1D (T1DGRS>5th
      centile of a control population).

      Further aims will be to evaluate the utility of dried blood spot testing to detect change in
      C-peptide and the utility of home test results as a marker of hypoglycaemia and glucose
      variability.
