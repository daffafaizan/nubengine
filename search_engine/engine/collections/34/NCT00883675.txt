    
      Patients with stage Ib - IIIa NSCLC participated in an open-label, single arm study to assess
      the safety and tolerability of docetaxel (75 mg/kg) and carboplatin (AUC 5.5) administered
      for 3 cycles after resection for curative intent. The primary endpoint of the study was
      safety, as reflected by a febrile neutropenia rate of <10%. Other endpoints assessed protocol
      compliance and the impact of minimally invasive surgical technique.
