      oxygen saturation, it has revolutionized the way we care for patients. However, new
      technology comes at a cost to our healthcare system. It is therefore important to ensure that
      new devices actually improve outcomes. One example of this is minimally invasive surgery,
      which decreases morbidity to patients and reduces length of hospital stay. Unfortunately,
      despite this advance in lung surgery, delays in discharge from hospital are still prevalent
      due to prolonged air leaks. Many intra-operative methods have been explored in order to limit
      this issue with underwhelming success. This is why we are proposing a randomized controlled
      trial comparing a digital pleural collection system by ATMOS to traditional pleural
      collection devices by Atrium.

      Our research question is: Can the use of a digital air leak monitoring system decrease
      hospital stay in patients undergoing anatomical lung resection when compared to traditional
      pleural drainage systems?
