    
      A5361s is a prospective study to determine the effects of pitavastatin on physical function.
      The study will enroll participants enrolled in both REPRIEVE (A5332) and its mechanistic
      sub-study A5333s or in REPRIEVE (A5332) alone and follow them for 48 months after entry to
      REPRIEVE (A5332). Treatment groups (pitavastatin vs placebo) will be defined according to
      randomization in REPRIEVE (A5332). No intervention will be provided in this sub-study.

      Study visits are scheduled at PREPARE (A5361s) entry and at months 12, 24, 36 and 48 after
      REPRIEVE (A5332) entry. Each study visit will include evaluation of physical function,
      frailty and self-reported physical activity and sedentary time. In addition, demographic and
      clinical data, laboratory specimens and CT scans collected as part of the main study REPRIEVE
      (A5332) or its mechanistic sub-study A5333s will be used.
