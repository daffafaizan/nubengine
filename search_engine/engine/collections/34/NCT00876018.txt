      evidence of significant improvements in physical fitness, aerobic capacity and anaerobic
      threshold of children and adolescents with nutritional intervention, albeit in children with
      initial sub-optimal nutritional status. This may be of particular relevance in developing
      countries like India, where there is limited data on physical fitness and a wide-spread
      prevalence of concurrent micronutrient deficiencies even in apparently normal school age
      children. The present study therefore, is designed to assess the effect of a nutritional
      supplement on the physical performance measures of school going children. This is a
      randomized, double blind placebo-controlled study of three treatment groups (1 test, 1
      positive control (placebo) and 1 'no intervention') conducted in equal numbers of male or
      female children [ages 7-11] attending day schools in Bangalore. Subjects in the intervention
      (test and positive control) groups will receive study treatments (fortified or un-fortified
      nutritional powder) once a day for 4 months. The treatments will be administered under
      supervision on all school working days; for the weekend and other holidays, sachets will be
      provided for home consumption. At baseline and 4months, physical performance tests will be
      administered and blood sample drawn to assess nutritional status. Other selected outcome
      measures such as nutrition status and muscle strength/ endurance will also be assessed. It is
      hypothesized that after 4 months of intervention, children consuming fortified nutritional
      powder will have statistically significant improvements in physical performance/ fitness
      measures as compared to the two control groups.
