      app for IBS patients. The design of the study is experimental. There will be two experimental
      groups, an immediate treatment group and an active control group. Once consented and
      enrolled, participants will be randomly assigned to either the immediate treatment group or
      the active control group by the coin toss feature of random.org. Participants in the
      immediate treatment group will be able to download the app at no cost. Participants in the
      control group will be given access to an education and relaxation training control app at no
      cost to them. At 8 weeks after enrollment, all participants in both groups will receive a
      battery of follow-up questionnaires (the same that they answered directly after consenting in
      the beginning of the study as baseline measures). Upon receipt of the 8 week questionnaire
      data, participants in the control group will be given access to the Zemedy app. After having
      had access to the app for 8 weeks, control participants will be asked to complete another set
      of questionnaires. All participants will receive 3 month post-treatment follow-up
      questionnaires. The research method is experimental, cross over (randomized controlled trial)
      with a control control. Participation in the study will last approximately 4.5 months,
      depending on the subjects willingness to participate and rate of completion.
