      symptoms ranged from 7.8 to 13.2, and most of them were at a moderate level of severity.
      Dyspnea, fatigue, and anxiety arose as the most problematic symptoms of lung cancer.
      Non-pharmacological approaches to manage of symptom among lung cancer patients showed either
      no or mild effects. Qigong is hypothesized to alleviate these adverse outcomes; however, all
      trial analyzed on a single symptom, and not lung cancer patients, and there have not been
      many well-designed randomized control trials. The objectives of this study are following: 1)
      to assess the effect of Qigong on managing dypsnea, fatigue, and anxiety (as a cluster) in
      lung cancer patients; 2) to explore the effect of Qigong on cough another common symptom
      linked with dyspnea, fatigue as a cluster and quality of life (QOL) in lung cancer patients.

      Methods: 156 subjects with lung cancer (stage I - IV) will be randomized to either the Qigong
      group or the wait-list control group. Participants in the Qigong group will conduct Qigong
      practice 5 times per week for 6 weeks, and participants in the control group will receive
      usual care. The primary outcome (dypsnea, fatigue, and anxiety), secondary outcomes (cough
      and QOL) will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and post 6-weeks of follow-up.

      Discussion: This study will be the first randomized trial to investigate the effectiveness of
      Qigong for management symptom cluster in lung cancer patients. The finding of this study will
      help to establish the optimal approach for the care of lung cancer patients.
