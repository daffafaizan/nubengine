      there were few studies about the use of corticosteroid in children with refractory MPP. Lee
      KY et al indicated oral prednisolone of 1 mg/kg/ day for 1 week be useful for children with
      severe MPP. Akihiro T et al demonstrated that intravenously administered methylprednisolone
      at a dose of 30 mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days had an efficacious treatment for
      children with refractory MPP.But the methods of corticosteroid use, such as the dosage,
      administration route, duration of treatment have not been well understood. So in this study,
      we planned to investigate whether small doses of methylprednisolone pulse macrolide therapy
      can relieve symptoms,chest X-rays faster than macrolide alone therapy for refractory
      mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in a prospective, open-label fashion.
