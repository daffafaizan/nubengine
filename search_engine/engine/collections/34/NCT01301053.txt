      test the hypothesis that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is safe in critically ill
      patients and provides important information that can prevent hypoglycemia. This study will
      determine the feasibility of CGM along with the current UVA intensive care insulin protocol
      in critically ill hyperglycemic patients as well as to provide some information that may help
      estimate differences necessary to power future studies.

      The following statements summarize the background for this protocol:

        1. Hyperglycemia is prevalent in critical illness, even without prior diabetes, and is
           associated with increased mortality.

        2. The physiology between critical illness and hyperglycemia may be secondary to
           inappropriate tissue oxygenation or intense inflammatory mediator release leading to
           elevated counter-regulatory hormones that stimulate endogenous glucose production and
           promote insulin resistance.

        3. Early research by Van den Berghe suggested that controlling hyperglycemia by insulin
           infusion improved outcomes; however, this has been contested in part by the
           Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation-Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation
           (NICE-SUGAR) study.

        4. The results of the NICE-SUGAR study may reflect differences in control glucose range or
           in the high incidence of hypoglycemia.

        5. Hypoglycemia has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in the ICU.

        6. Glucose variability is associated with ICU mortality.

        7. Continuous glucose monitoring has been shown to be safe for up to 7 days in critically
           ill patients and may prevent episodes of hypoglycemia
