      CAPD patients on incremental Peritoneal Dialysis therapy.

      The objective is to demonstrate the superiority and safety of using 2, as compared to 1,
      icodextrin bags / day, in a cohort of elderly incident continuous ambulatory peritoneal
      dialysis (CAPD) patients using incremental peritoneal dialysis (PD) (3 bags / day), with the
      aim of prolonging the period of time for which incremental PD can be used.

      This is a phase IV open-label, randomised, multicentre study with 2 parallel groups, which
      will take place in up to 30 hospital out-patient clinics un Europe.

      It is planned to include 160 patients on the run-in period in order to obtain 100 randomised
      patients and 90 patients evaluable at the primary endpoint (45 in each group). The duration
      of patient recruitment is estimated at 1 year but this may be extended until all 160 patients
      are recruited.

      There are 2 periods: a run-in period of 2 months and a treatment period of 18 months.
