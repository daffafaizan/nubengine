      (Active comparator). At the Week 0 time point, the patients will receive either PCV13
      (Experimental) or PPSV23 (Active comparator) and undergo a blood draw of 5ml for assessment
      of pre-vacation serotype titers. The Active Comparator group will undergo a 5ml draw of blood
      for assessment of titers at week 8, 16, and 24 following vaccination. The Experimental group
      will undergo vaccination with PPSV23 at week 8 with 5 ml blood draw for pneumococcal serotype
      titers as well as a blood draw at week 16 and week 24.
