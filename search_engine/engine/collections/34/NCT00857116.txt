      Because of increasing multi drug resistance and the long treatment period of at least six
      months, new therapeutic options are urgently needed. In countries like Ethiopia where TB is
      endemic, chronic worm infection is also highly prevalent. Recent data support that helminth
      infection might limit the host response against TB by inhibition of the TH1-response that is
      crucial in controlling the disease. In this study we want to test the hypothesis that
      Albendazole treatment of patients coinfected with helminths and TB could improve clinical
      outcome in addition to chemotherapy against TB. Additionally we will investigate the
      immunological interactions between TB and chronic helminths infection.
