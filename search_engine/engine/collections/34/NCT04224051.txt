    
      Subjects with no history of diabetes will be recruited from a cohort of patients with
      diagnosed AAA and a maximum aortic diameter of 30-49mm for men and 30-44mm for women.

      A total of 500 subjects with AAA will be included in the study, 250 in each study arm.
      Patients will be randomised to metformin or standard care in a 1:1 ratio.

      CT imaging and AAA US will be performed at baseline, 24 months and end of study, as well as
      if necessary according to clinical routine. Study drug will start at baseline and continue
      through completion.

      When all enrolled subjects have completed the 24-month follow-up (including imaging) an
      interim analysis will be performed to assess for efficacy and safety; if there is no trend
      towards a positive effect or signs of a harmful effect of metformin, the study will be
      stopped at this phase.
