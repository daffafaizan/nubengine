      refractory carcinosarcoma of the uterus who have failed standard therapy. II. Determine the
      nature and degree of toxic effects of topotecan in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for a minimum of 1 course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with complete response, partial response, or stable disease continue
      treatment for at least three courses. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then periodically thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2
      years.
