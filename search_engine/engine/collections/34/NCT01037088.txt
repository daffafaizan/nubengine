      efficacy of vaporized cannabis in subjects, the majority of whom were experiencing
      neuropathic pain despite traditional treatment. Thirty-nine patients with central and
      peripheral neuropathic pain underwent a standardized procedure for inhaling medium-dose
      (3.53%), low-dose (1.29%), or placebo cannabis with the primary outcome being visual analog
      scale pain intensity. Psychoactive side effects and neuropsychological performance were also
      evaluated.
