      hospitalization and/or specific drug management. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
      programs have proved to be efficacious in PD both for the management of motor and non-motor
      symptoms. This is however the case only in out-patients and by using standardized 8 weeks
      programs. The team has experienced in the hospitalization unit that methods derived from the
      MBSR program such as the "body scan", administered by the paramedical personnel, is of great
      help for the non-pharmacological management of anxiety and agitation in PD, avoiding physical
      contention in many cases. Based on this experience the study aims at evaluating the
      feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a simple and standardized administration of the "body
      scan" meditation in the management of anxiety and agitation in PD admitted in the unit since
      less than 48h.
