      leads to ischemia of the uterine muscle, which consequently causes pelvic pain. A large
      number of drugs have been studied for pain relief in dysmenorrhea patients with non-steroid
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) being the most effective with the overall success rate of
      more than 75%. Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are also an established treatment for PD with
      the success rate of 70%. Lately, OCP's have been used continuously in patients with
      endometriosis and had better pain control than traditional administration of OCP.
