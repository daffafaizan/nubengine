      phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive pentostatin IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and mitoxantrone
           hydrochloride IV on day 1. Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 1 beginning in
           course 2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and mitoxantrone
           hydrochloride (at the maximum tolerated dose determined in phase I) as in phase I.

      All patients receive either pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-4 following each
      course or filgrastim or sargramostim SC beginning 2 days after each course until blood counts
      recover.

      Patients undergo blood collection and bone marrow biopsy periodically for assessment of
      therapy response by biomarker and laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed for molecular
      genetics for IgH arrangement by PCR and for response by immunoelectrophoresis. Some samples
      are analyzed for response by flow cytometry or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients (18 patients for phase I and 45 patients for phase
      II) will be accrued for this study.
