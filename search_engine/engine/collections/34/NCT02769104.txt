      receptor-positive breast cancer. But it still a question if neoadjuvant endocrine therapy can
      be used combined with chemotherapy. There have been several small-sample studies concerning
      about this item and also got some results that support the suppose that endocrine therapy
      combined with chemotherapy could rise the effect of neoadjuvant treatment. This study is to
      investigate the effect of aromatase inhibitors (AI) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as
      neoadjuvant treatment in postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
