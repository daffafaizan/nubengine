      project is to conduct a pilot study under randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      conditions, to provide preliminary estimation of the efficacy of a 6 week Accu Drop nicotine
      fading protocol used in conjunction with cigarette tapering to bring about termination of
      cigarette usage in moderate to heavy smokers (*15 cpd) who are interested in smoking
      cessation. Both the experimental and control groups in this study will receive six weeks of
      the manually driven behavioral treatment by experienced and trained therapists. The
      experimental group (N=30) will also be prescribed active Accu Drops (AD&C) while the control
      condition (N=30) will be prescribed placebo Accu Drops (PD&C) very similar in appearance,
      viscosity, and taste to active Accu Drops. Completion of the study protocol and smoking
      cessation rates at 1 week, 1 month, and 6 months post-treatment will be the prime measures of
      efficacy. The findings of this study will provide sufficient preliminary indication for the
      efficacy of the experimental treatment and its extended investigation in a Phase II study or
      for its nonefficacy.
