      GNE-related diseases. The GNE gene encodes for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, the
      bifunctional enzyme that initiates and regulates intracellular sialic acid (Neu5Ac)
      biosynthesis and glycan sialylation. GNE myopathy is a rare, autosomal recessive myopathy
      with onset in early adulthood characterized by progressive skeletal muscle atrophy and
      weakness. The impairment of Neu5Ac production is presumed to cause decreased sialylation of
      muscle glycoproteins, resulting in muscle deterioration. Other GNE-related diseases such as
      congenital thrombocytopenia have been recently identified, but the pathophysiology is not
      well understood. In this protocol, we plan to evaluate patients with GNE myopathy and other
      GNE-related diseases clinically, biochemically, and molecularly to characterize the
      mechanisms of disease, to delineate the natural history, phenotypes, progression and
      complications of GNE-related diseases, and to identify endpoints and biomarkers to support
      clinical trials testing potential therapies.
