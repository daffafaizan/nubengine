      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Umbralisib as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The FDA has approved Rituximab as a treatment option for this disease.

      Umbralisib is an investigational drug which blocks a protein called PI3K. PI3K is a protein
      that plays a role in the way cells grow. In this type of cancer, PI3K is increased and more
      active than usual. This helps the cancer cells to grow and survive. Early clinical trials
      have shown that Umbralisib can kill cancer cells in some patients and cause their tumors to
      shrink.
