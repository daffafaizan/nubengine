    
      Cephalic duodenopancreatectomy is the technique indicated for patients with pancreatic head
      carcinoma and periampullar tumors.

      There are different technical variants, it is not standardized what is the best option in
      relation to local recurrence, metastasis and survival.

      In the study, patients will be randomized into two study groups with pancreatic and
      periampullary tumors undergoing cephalic pancreatectomy (NT) vs initial approach by superior
      mesenteric artery (SMA).

      The measurement of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) allows to assess the degree of cellular
      dissemination due to surgical manipulation.CTCs will be evaluated during surgery (nยบ CTCs /
      mL blood). To do this, a maximum of 4 blood samples from the portal vein will be performed,
      in each study group according to the following scheme:

        -  NT group: basal (at the beginning of surgery), portal vein pancreatic detachment,
           postresection (NT2) and before closure (NT3).

        -  SMA group: basal (at the beginning of surgery), after Kocher maneuver and SMA
           dissection, postresection, before closure.

      Subsequently, the quantified levels of CTCs will be correlated with the occurrence of local
      tumor recurrence, metastasis development and patient patient survival.
