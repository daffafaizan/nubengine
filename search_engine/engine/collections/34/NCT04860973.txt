      and disturbed sleep after brain injury. This is a single centre study based in a community
      hospital in the UK. Outcomes centre on determining the feasibility and acceptability of the

      linen for 7 consecutive days and nights. Sleep will be measured using observations and
      actigraphs; behaviour and behavioural interventions will be recorded.
