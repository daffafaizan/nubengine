      (study groups) by enrolling a total of ten participants, five in each cohort. The two cohorts
      include individuals who received mechanical circulatory support (specifically the IMPELLAÂ®
      device) compared to individuals who did not receive mechanical circulatory support for
      treatment of their PPCM complicated by cardiogenic shock index event.

      The duration of enrollment for each participant is about 5 months. It is anticipated that the
      trial will be complete in 12 months. Participant engagement to the study will be
      self-initiated.

      Under the guidance and support of Medical College of Wisconsin research coordinator,
      participants will directly access the study REDCapTM database for enrollment and follow-up
      data entry for this study. The research coordinator will obtain and abstract participant
      medical records documenting the event.
