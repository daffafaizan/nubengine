      women with and without lumbar osteoporosis. The specific objective is to determine the
      relationship between the degree of thoracic kyphosis and dosing of 25 OH vitamin D with
      postural balance in postmenopausal women with lumbar osteoporosis.

      One hundred and twenty-six postmenopausal women between 55-65 years of age were evaluated and
      separated into two groups according to the bone mineral density values of their lumbar spine:
      the osteoporosis group and the control group.

      Functional mobility was evaluated through the Timed Up and Go Test. Postural balance was
      evaluated using a AccuSway® model portable force platform, in standard standing position,
      with eyes open and closed, for 60". Data were collected, stored, and processed by the Balance
      Clinic® program, configured to 100 Hz frequency, with a frequency cut-off filter at 10 Hz.

      Muscle strength was evaluated via a Biodex® isokinetic dynamometer in the
      concentric/concentric knee extension mode at 60o/s.

      Dosing of 25 OH vitamin D and thoracic spine x-rays to determine the degree of kyphosis
      measured by the Cobb angle were performed in the osteoporosis group.
