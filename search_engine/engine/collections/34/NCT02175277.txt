      study (NCT01362140) for the treatment of anaemic patients with MDS. Participants who
      completed the active-treatment period of the darbepoetin alfa MDS 20090160 study and met the
      eligibility criteria could be enrolled into this study to continue treatment of darbepoetin
      alfa for up to 73 weeks or until progression to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), whichever
      occurs first.
