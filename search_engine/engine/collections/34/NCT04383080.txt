      pathogenesis of traditional Chinese medicine was first seen in the "Shu Wen". It is clearly
      pointed out that "heart qi" is the basic pathogenesis of heart failure. The "qi" and "blood"
      of Chinese medicine are closely related. The blood line is driven by the gas, the blood is
      bloody, and the qi deficiency is unable to push the blood to blood. If the qi deficiency, it
      would lead to blood stasis; There were studies have indicated that traditional acupuncture
      treatment can increase exercise tolerance and adjust autonomic nerve activity in patients
      with chronic heart failure, and can reduce their readmission rate and mortality rate in
      patients with acute heart failure. Studies using laser acupuncture to treat patients with
      heart failure have also found that they can increase the subject's six-minute walking
      distance.
