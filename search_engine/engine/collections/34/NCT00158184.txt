      concern. The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse report revealed that the number of
      first-time users of prescription opioid medications for non-medical reasons reached 2 million
      in the year 2000, a number that has quintupled since 1984. Despite this trend, little
      experimental research has been directed towards understanding who may be abusing these
      medications, and under what conditions. The study will examine the reinforcing, subjective,
      performance, and physiological effects of oxycodone. Because it is not clear who is abusing
      prescription opioids, the medication effects will be compared in drug abusers and non-drug
      abusers.
