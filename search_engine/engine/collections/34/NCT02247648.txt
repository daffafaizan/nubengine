      operative pain in patients who had an arthroscopic shoulder surgery in ambulatory setting in
      comparison with a placebo. The intensity of pain was evaluated on a visual analog scale as
      the quantity of hydromorphone taken by patients, and the side effects during the first 72
      hours.
