      sleep of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation has received little attention. This
      project is designed to characterize sleep and circadian rhythmicity in critically ill
      patients and to explore the efficacy of a non-pharmacological intervention to improve sleep
      and normalize circadian phase. The study will examine the effect of a protocol employing
      noise reduction and enforcement of a robust light-dark cycle on sleep quality and circadian
      rhythmicity. A secondary analysis will examine the relationship between delirium and sleep
      disruption and loss of circadian rhythmicity. Circadian rhythmicity will be characterized
      through the measurement of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels at frequent intervals, while
      sleep will be assessed using continuous polysomnography.
