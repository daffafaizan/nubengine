      once-daily and DETROL® LA 4 mg once-daily in the reduction of urge urinary incontinence
      episodes in female patients with overactive bladder. This is a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group study with two active treatments. Screened patients are
      qualified for the study based on information obtained from seven consecutive 24-hour urinary
      diaries completed during the Baseline Week, and other eligibility criteria. Qualifying
      patients receive 12 weeks of treatment with DITROPAN® XL or DETROL® LA, with clinical visits
      at the end of Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

      Safety evaluations during the study include the collection of adverse events, laboratory
      tests including blood chemistry and urinalysis, physical examinations, vital signs (blood
      pressure and heart rate) and post-void residual urine volume. Over-encapsulated DITROPAN® XL,
      10 mg tablets once-daily by mouth or over-encapsulated DETROL® LA, 4 mg capsules once daily
      by mouth. The treatment phase of the study runs for 12 weeks.
