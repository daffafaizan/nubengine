      chamber of the heart may prevent the progression of congestive heart failure (CHF) in some
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients. CHF refers to symptoms (shortness of
      breath, fatigue, fluid overload) caused by decreased pumping action of the heart muscle. The
      ICD can be set to use one wire (top or bottom of the heart) or two wires (top and bottom).
      Both settings allow the heart to beat more naturally using its own electrical signals. Two
      device settings will be compared. Managed ventricular pacing (MVP) will allow the ICD to use
      both wires only as necessary. This setting allows the ICD to send electrical signals to the
      top and bottom chambers of the heart if needed. The other setting, ventricular pacing (VVI)
      will allow the ICD to operate the bottom chamber of the heart if it is needed.
