      nodules) in the study based on qualifying for a lung cancer screening CT or by routine CT
      chest with the observation of a lung nodule between 5-30mm diameter. These patients will be
      followed for 2~3 years and be managed according to institutional standard of care. This may
      involve the Chinese Thoracic Society guideline or Fleischner criteria (either 2013 or 2017
      guidelines). The clinical data, CT imaging and biospecimens will be collected during each
      visit. Once a patient undergoes surgery, tissue samples (FFPE) from surgery will also be
      collected.

      The gold standard for lung cancer diagnosis will be the results of bronchoscopic biopsy of
      lung or lymph nodes, percutaneous biopsy of lung or other organ sites, surgical biopsy or
      resection, or a minimum follow-up of 2 years.
