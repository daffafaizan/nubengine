    
      Written informed consent by the patient is asked before cardioversion and participation in
      the study. Patient anamnesis is assessed by standardized questionnaire.

      Patients perform several standardised neurocognitive tests to obtain a general view on the
      neurocognitive status (auditory verbal learning test, mini-mental state examination, trail
      making A and B, digit-symbol coding and RAND 36 Health Survey).

      Cerebral oxygenation is observed during cardioversion by means of the SenSmart Model X-100
      (Nonin). Additional parameters (pulse oximetry, cardiac output, arterial blood pressure,
      6-lead electrocardiography (ECG), left ventricular ejection fraction) are recorded. All
      measurements are performed non-invasively. Patients receive standard treatment following the
      clinical guidelines.
