      endocrine function. The data from both inexperienced and experienced groups will help us
      better understand how longer-term practice of yoga may be beneficial. The study consists of
      one 3-hour screening session and three 6-hour activity sessions with 30 minute follow-up
      appointments the following morning scheduled 2 - 4 weeks apart. Each participant will
      complete the 3 activity sessions, which will consist of either yoga, mild movement, or a
      neutral activity (watching a videotape), in randomly assigned order. Thus, both novices and
      experts will participate in 3 activity sessions each (yoga, movement control, video control).
      The order in which each participant goes through the activity sessions is counterbalanced.
      Data for each activity session will be aggregated by group (i.e. novice or expert). We will
      measure responses to tape stripping to assess skin barrier repair, and evaluate responses to
      computer tasks, self-report measures, and a battery of unobtrusive behavioral measures. We
      will also collect blood and saliva samples to measure immune and endocrine outcomes.
