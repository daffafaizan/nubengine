      ratio) will be randomized to receive once daily by mouth capsules containing either ETC-1002,
      ezetimibe, or ETC-1002 + ezetimibe. This study will explore the safety and efficacy of
      concomitant administration of ETC-1002 and ezetimibe, while also exploring the effect of
      ezetimibe on ETC-1002 systemic exposure.
