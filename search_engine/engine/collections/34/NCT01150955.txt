      but obese men. We hypothesize that resveratrol will counteract some of the detrimental
      effects of obesity, and as an imitator of calorie restriction will give new insight into the
      basic biochemical pathways underpinning human metabolism. Of special interest is the
      potential connection between resveratrol, calorie restriction, SIRT1, STAT5b and the GH/IGF-I
      axis.
