    
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      ABT/3BNC117 combination in conjunction with an existing failing antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      for 1 week, and then with optimized background regimen (OBR) for 24 weeks, respectively. A
      total of 20 eligible subjects who demonstrate evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing
      antiretroviral therapy with documented genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to multiple
      classes of HIV drugs (3 classes or more) will be enrolled. Patients must have been treated
      with HAART for at least 6 months and be failing or have recently failed (i.e., in the last 8
      weeks) therapy to determine baseline viral load.
