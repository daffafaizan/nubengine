      Probiotics are known to have a beneficial effect on the management of constipation. Thus, the
      current study objective was to evaluate the impact of a microbial cell preparation (MCP)
      (HexbioÂ®; comprising Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains) on stool frequency,
      consistency, and constipation-related symptoms in elderly patients with multiple chronic
      medical conditions.
