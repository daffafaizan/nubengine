    
      This prospective controlled randomized study conducted upon 100 patients at Alexandria
      University hospital from 21 May 2020 to 21 December 2020. Patients enrolled will be divided
      into two equal groups according to the urethral catheter inserted

      The institutional ethics committee for research approved the study. Written informed consent
      was obtained from all participants. In addition to taking the patients' medical history and
      completing general and physical examinations, physicians will choose proper catheter size all
      perform catheterization using aseptic technique according to guidelines of proper aseptic
      catheterization. Urologist ensures comparable catheter size and amount of balloon inflation.

      An aseptic non-touch technique (ANTT) must be used to obtain catheter specimen urine
      following these steps:

        -  After catheterization apply clamp 10 cm distal to meatus then after few minutes clean
           the drainage port with alcohol and allow to dry then insert the syringe tip into the
           drainage port.

        -  Three to five ml of urine collected in sterile disposable plastic cup at day zero
           (within 2 hours of catheterization), day ten and day twenty post catheterization.

        -  The urine subjected to routine urine analysis, urine culture and sensitivity.

      Appropriate statistical tests will be used to indicate the frequency and type of CAUTI as
      well as to assess catheter tolerance in each arm, followed by a comparison to conclude the
      results.
