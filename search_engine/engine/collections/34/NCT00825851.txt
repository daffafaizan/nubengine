      histology and the suction blister model to study epidermal regeneration and skin transudate.
      In addition blood sampling was made to validate compliance to the study arms and to study
      systemic markers of collagen metabolism and oxidative stress. In addition, wound infections
      and wound ruptures were recorded post hoc as complications to the excisional skin biopsy
      model were not expected to occur.
