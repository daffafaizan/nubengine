    
      This study will include previously treated patients with AL amyloidosis.

      Primary objectives to determine the hematologic and organ response rate to the association of
      cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CLD).

      Secondary objectives

        -  to determine the safety of CLD,

        -  to determine time to response to CLD,

        -  to determine the duration of response to CLD,

        -  to assess survival of AL amyloidosis patients treated with CLD.

      Patients receive 28-day cycles cyclophosphamide on days 1, 8 and 15, oral lenalidomide on
      days 1-21 and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      Up to 9 courses can be performed until one of the following endpoints is met:

        -  completion of cycle 9,

        -  complete hematologic remission observed after cycle 3 or 6,

        -  partial hematologic response associated with organ response after cycle 6.

        -  no response at cycle 3 or 6. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed
           every 3 months for up to 3 years.
