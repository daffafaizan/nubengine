      early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma or limited hepatic metastatic disease from colorectal
      cancer, when surgery is precluded (1, 2). Recently, RF ablation has been proposed as a viable
      option for the treatment of pulmonary malignancies. Experimental studies in animal tumor
      models have confirmed the effectiveness of RF ablation in the destruction of
      experimentally-induced pulmonary malignancies (3). Pilot clinical investigations have
      suggested that the treatment can achieve high proportions of tumor response (4, 5). We
      designed a prospective, intention-to-treat, multicenter clinical trial aimed at assessing
      feasibility, safety and effectiveness of RF ablation in the treatment of lung malignancies.
