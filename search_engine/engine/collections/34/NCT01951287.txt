      non-milk beverages with a breakfast meal on postprandial glucose and insulin responses in
      overweight and obese adults with varying levels of glucose tolerance (normal, pre-diabetic,
      type 2 diabetes). The investigators expect the consumption of fluid milk with breakfast to
      decrease the postprandial glucose response relative to other non-milk beverages (orange juice
      and sweetened coffee). Furthermore, the investigators expect that there will be no difference
      in the postprandial glucose or insulin response between varieties of fluid milk (skim,
      low-fat, and whole).
