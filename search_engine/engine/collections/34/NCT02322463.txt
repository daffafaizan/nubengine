      of child care. Studies in the adult population revealed that ethnicity might be associated
      with disparities in analgesia and opioid treatment in ED patients suffering from limb
      fractures. The investigators aim to explore if ethnicity has an influence on analgesic
      practice in the pediatric ED. The objective of this study is to determine whether minority
      population Arab children with orthopedic injuries are less likely than Jewish children to
      receive oxycodone for limb fracture .
