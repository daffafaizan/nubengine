      public health issue. Many people who suffer from them do not have access to an adequate
      psychological treatment. Some of the reasons why this situation happens are: the high cost
      that tends to represent a proper psychological treatment, and, in countries like Dominican
      Republic, the lack of a protocol that guides health professionals of Primary Care Units on
      the diagnosis and treatment of these emotional disorders. The purpose of this study is to
      describe a pilot project, in which a treatment protocol for emotional disorders will be
      applied by trained mental health professionals in Dominican Primary Care Units. It will be a
      randomized controlled trial with 300 patients. To prove the effectiveness of this protocol,
      the phases of this study will be: 1) psychological assessment of the study sample; 2) seven
      sessions of conventional treatment offered to a control group, and seven sessions of the
      evidence-based psychological techniques, suggested by this new protocol, given to an
      experimental group; 3) psychological reassessment of the study sample. This protocol suggests
      transdiagnostic approaches and collaborative interventions, that include group-sessions and
      evidence-based psychological techniques derived from cognitive behavioral therapy. Also, the
      protocol will be supported by mHealth tools. Some of the points included in the protocol are:
      psychoeducation on emotional disorders symptoms, relaxation and breathing techniques, thought
      management, improvement of quality of life and relapse prevention.
