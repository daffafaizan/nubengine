      Diaphragmatic Stimulation (ADS) as a primary form of heart failure therapy with low rates and
      severity of adverse effects. Medical refractory symptomatic heart failure patients with
      reduced ejection fraction and no evidence of arrhythmias or ventricular dysynchrony will
      undergo laparoscopic implantation of the VisONEâ„¢ implantable system comprised of a pulse
      generator and two leads, programmed to deliver cardiac-gaited diaphragmatic stimulation
      pulses at asymptomatic outputs. Patients will be followed in pre-specified durations of 1,3,6
      and 12-months using a series of evaluations of hemodynamic, echocardiographic, heart failure
      status, diaphragmatic function, implanted system data and standard safety measures including
      adverse events, for comparison with their baseline values. The results are intended to be
      used for designing a subsequent larger study for performing statistical power calculations.
