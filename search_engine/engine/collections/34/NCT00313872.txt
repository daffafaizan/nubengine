      malignancy in Korea. Metastatic gastric cancer remains a therapeutic challenge for medical
      oncologists due to poor prognosis. A recent phase III trial comparing
      docetaxel-cisplatin-5-FU (DCF) to the reference arm of cisplatin-5-FU (CF) showed a
      significant superiority of DCF in terms of survival, time-to-progression, and response rate.
      However, because DCF regimen was associated with high incidence of toxicities, the regimen
      has not yet been widely accepted as the standard first-line chemotherapy for gastric cancer
      patients. Thus, the optimum front-line chemotherapy regimen should be extensively
      investigated in these patients to improve survival.
