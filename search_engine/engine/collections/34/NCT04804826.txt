    
      In response to COVID-19, the urogynecology department at TriHealth has recently transitioned
      to a same day discharge (SDD) model for our major pelvic reconstruction surgeries with total
      vaginal hysterectomy. Traditionally, these patients were admitted for overnight observation
      and discharged to home on postoperative day one. SDD after major pelvic reconstructive
      surgery is new in our department, but multiple studies have shown that SDD after hysterectomy
      is safe, cost effective, and well received by patients.

      While patients have been accepting of SDD, they often have questions in the preoperative
      period about what to expect once they are discharged home. Previous research has shown that
      patients appreciate advice and recommendations from others who have previously had the same
      surgery; often reporting improved outcomes and satisfaction. Direct advice and narrative
      stories from other patients can provide a "more personal" experience of the day-to-day coping
      postoperatively that the physician cannot necessarily provide.

      We would like to get our patients' perspective on what happened immediately after surgery, in
      the hospital and at home. By expanding our awareness as providers of what challenges patients
      face upon discharge, we will be better able to counsel patients in the preoperative period,
      improve patient satisfaction with surgery and SDD, and help develop strategies to mitigate
      areas of concern regarding the surgical process.
