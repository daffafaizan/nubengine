      Atlanta, the research coordinator contacts the family prior to the procedure and describes
      the study to them, details the goals, benefits versus risks, and answers any questions they
      may have. Written consent is obtained from the parents. Assent is obtained from the child.
      Both the parent and child are given the age appropriate Peds QL (tm) Pediatric Quality of
      Life Inventory, version 4.0. The forms are returned to the research coordinator. If the child
      is ablated, then 5-6 months after the ablation, the same questionnaire is sent to the child
      and parent. Data are entered into a database.
