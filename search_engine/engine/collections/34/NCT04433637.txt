      to its easy application, cheapness, reliability and rapid assessment. False negativity rates
      of NST also cause an increase in cesarean rates. Studies in recent years show that there are
      methods and factors that increase fetal movements and shorten NST application time. It was
      observed that nutrient intake, music playing, fetal acoustic vibration application and
      halogen light applications before NST increased fetal movements and shortened NST time.
