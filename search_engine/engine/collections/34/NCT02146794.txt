      chronic heart failure. It is not known whether they would suffer large drops in blood
      pressure which might compromise safety.

      This pilot study required patients to remain in hospital for one week during which they had
      careful monitoring of blood pressure with the ability to halt the trial if any patient
      suffered any dangerous effect such as a large drop in blood pressure. It also monitored blood
      pressure after discharge for six months.
