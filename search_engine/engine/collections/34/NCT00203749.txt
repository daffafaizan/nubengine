      [Kisarawe], 8 in Zimbabwe [Mutoko], 8 in South Africa/Vulindlela, 8 in South Africa/Soweto
      and 14 in Thailand [Chiang Mai]) are being randomized to receive either a community-based HIV
      voluntary counseling and testing (CBVCT) intervention plus standard clinic-based VCT (SVCT),
      or SVCT alone. The CBVCT intervention has three major strategies: (1) to make VCT more
      available in community settings; (2) to engage the community through outreach; and (3) to
      provide post-test support. These strategies are designed to change community norms and reduce
      risk for HIV infection among all community members, irrespective of whether they participated
      directly in the intervention.

      A community-level intervention based on modifying community norms can change the
      environmental context in which people make decisions about HIV risk, and has the potential to
      alter the course of the HIV epidemic in developing countries. This is the first international
      randomized controlled Phase III trial to determine the efficacy of a behavioral/social
      science intervention with an HIV incidence endpoint.
