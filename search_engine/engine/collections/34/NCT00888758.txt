    
      The aim of this multicenter, prospective, randomized trial with a core lab analysis is to
      assess the safety and effectiveness (at 9-month follow-up) of third generation DES (biolimus
      A9 and everolimus) in patients with evolving STEMI with the OCT guidance (to optimize a stent
      implantation) A serial OCT analysis will be performed to assess the number of either
      uncovered or malaposed stents strut and a degree of in-stent neointimal hyperplasia.
      Furthermore, the in-segment vessel wall response to DES implantation will also be analysed.
      The goal is to enroll 400 patients (200 in each group) with OCT guidance in 100 patients in
      each group.
