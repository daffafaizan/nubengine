        -  Evaluate the rate of complete responses, defined as no vomiting and no nausea, in
           patients with primary gastrointestinal and/or retroperitoneal sarcomas treated with two
           different dosing schedules of palonosetron hydrochloride during abdominal radiotherapy
           as part of their cancer treatment.

        -  Determine the tolerability of palonosetron hydrochloride vs placebo in these patients.

        -  Validate patient diaries for assessing nausea and vomiting by comparing with alternative
           methods for measuring nausea and vomiting in order to determine the optimal approach for
           future studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to planned radiotherapy duration (< 5 weeks vs â‰¥ 5
      weeks), planned concurrent fluorouracil ( yes vs no), and gender. Patients are randomized to
      1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride IV on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 4.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive placebo IV on day 1.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive placebo IV on days 1 and 4. In all arms, courses repeat weekly
           during radiotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete nausea and vomiting questionnaires and diaries at baseline and daily during
      radiotherapy. Patients also complete symptom experience diaries weekly during radiotherapy.
