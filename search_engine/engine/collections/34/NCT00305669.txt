      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of daily neoadjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) in
           patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.

        -  Determine whether tissue-specific antiprostate cancer immunity is induced by the
           administration of neoadjuvant GM-CSF in patients with localized prostate cancer prior to
           radical prostatectomy.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the baseline antitumor immune response in patients treated with 2 different
           dose schedules of GM-CSF.

        -  Determine the magnitude of the difference in immune response between 2 dose schedules of
           GM-CSF.

        -  Determine the clinical effects, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline,
           surgical outcome, surgical complications, and histologic appearance of surgical
           specimen, of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      dose.

      Patients receive 1 of 2 dose levels of GM-CSF subcutaneously on days 1-14 or 1-21. Treatment
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Within 3 days after the last dose of
      GM-CSF, patients undergo radical prostatectomy.

      Blood is collected at baseline, day 28 of each course, and at the 4-week follow-up visit and
      is examined for activated T-cells. Tissue is collected during surgery and assessed for
      biomarkers and cytokines.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
