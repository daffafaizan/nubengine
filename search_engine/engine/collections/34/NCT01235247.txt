      of patients: (1) pregnant women; (2) HIV-exposed infants; and (3) adults and children
      co-infected with TB and HIV identified from the AMPATH clinics. Patients will be randomized
      to either receive the reminders as part of a paper summary, or to not have any of the
      reminders in their summary. Reminders implemented will vary by type of patient population.
      Comparisons will be made between the intervention and control groups.
