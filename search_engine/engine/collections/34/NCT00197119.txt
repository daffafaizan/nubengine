      between subjects who received one of the two formulations of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals'
      combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine according to a two-dose or three-dose schedule.
      These long-term follow-up studies involved taking blood samples at approximately 6, 7, 8, 9
      and 10 years after the primary vaccination of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine, to assess
      antibody persistence and a retrospective safety follow-up.
