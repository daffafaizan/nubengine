      spray on vocal cord. After that, an effective caudal or brachial plexus block was performed.
      End-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was maintained at 2.5%. Spontaneous respiratory was
      maintained. Sevoflurane was stopped after the end of surgery. Patients were randomly assigned
      to 2 groups: high concentration group (Group HC, end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane when
      extubating >=0.5%) and low concentration group (Group LC, end-tidal concentration of
      sevoflurane when extubating <0.5%). Patients in Group LC were extubated when they coughed or
      purposeful movement appeared. The patients whose end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane >=
      0.5% were excluded. Patients in Group HC were extubated when any of the criteria was met:
      1.the patient coughed or purposeful movement appeared 2.end-tidal concentration of
      sevoflurane decreased to 0.5%. A trained nurse (blind to groups) recorded PAEDs scores in
      PACU.
