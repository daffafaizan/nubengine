      reconstruction to clearly define and 3D model the normal and aberrant vascular anatomy of the
      donor site in order to decrease dissection time and secondary perioperative complications
      including fat necrosis and donor site complications.

      Secondary objective: To propose incision lines to match the corresponding volumetric analysis
      of the transposed tissue in order to facilitate the creation of a patient specific tailored
      flap, which will improve the aesthetic outcomes.

      This is a single-armed, prospective study to determine the feasibility of using 3-D virtual
      planning and medical modeling in breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction
