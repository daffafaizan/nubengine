      evidence-based treatment in improving exercise capacity, muscle strength, dyspnea, and
      quality of life. However, optimal SpO2 value during pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with
      chronic respiratory failure receiving long-term oxygen therapy is unclear.

      The present study is randomized to compare the effect of exercise capacity between high SpO2
      (Minimum SpO2 94-96%) value during pulmonary rehabilitation and low SpO2 (Minimum SpO2
      84-86%) value during pulmonary rehabilitation for the patients with chronic respiratory
      failure receiving long-term oxygen therapy.
