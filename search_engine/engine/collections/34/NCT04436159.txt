      treatment for symptomatic patients. Today, most surgeons agree that a fundoplication should
      be included in the hiatal reconstruction in order to reduce the risk of postoperative
      gastroesophageal reflux and hernia recurrence. However, what type of wrap that should be
      recommend is yet to be determined.

      One might argue that the overall durability and effectiveness of a partial fundoplication in
      the control of reflux might be less reliable than a total wrap, but on the contrary, the
      latter carries the risk of inducing a pseudoachalasia similar situation in PEH patients.

      We therefore designed a double blind randomized clinical trial in which patients with
      symptomatic paraesophageal hernia to receive either a posterior partial (Toupet) or total
      (Nissen) fundoplication after hernia reduction and crural repair.

      Six months follow up with questionnaires and 24-hour pH monitoring after surgery of
      para-esophageal hernia with addition of total fundoplication vs posterial partial
      fundoplication.
