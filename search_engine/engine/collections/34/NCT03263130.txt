      limitation including large central airways vs small peripheral airways/alveoli. In mild to
      moderate obstructive airways disease and emphysema, I believe routine spirometry including
      FEV 1(L), FVC (L), and FEV 1/FVC % may be normal, despite expiratory airflow limitation in
      lung peripheral airways. I also want to determine whether the mechanism(s) of expiratory
      airflow limitation are related to measured loss of lung elastic recoil or intrinsic
      obstruction of small peripheral airways or both. It is also important to determine the extent
      and distribution of emphysema using high resolution, thin section lung CT with voxel
      quantification. If available pathological analysis of lung surgical specimens and also
      formalin inflated lungs obtained at autopsy will also be studied. Blood studies will include
      but not limited to CBC, serum IgE, complete metabolic panel, and alpha 1 antitrypsin levels.
      Extensive lung function testing will also include spirometry tests before and after inhaled
      albuterol bronchodilation, lung volumes measured in a plethysmograph, diffusing capacity,
      measurement of lung elasticity that requires placement of an esophageal balloon, measurement
      of airflow after breathing a mixture of 80% helium-20%oxygen for 7-10 minutes, and
      measurements of exhaled nitric oxide. CAT scans of the lungs will be obtained to evaluate the
      presence, extent and distribution of emphysema and bronchiectasis. In some cases,
      bronchoscopy may be requested.

      The above tests may be uncomfortable but should cause no harm.
