      participant receives), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work
      on a medical research study) and placebo-controlled study of infliximab in participants with
      moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. All the eligible participants will be randomly
      assigned to infliximab and placebo groups. The infliximab group will receive 5 milligram per
      kilogram (mg/kg) infliximab infusions (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of
      a needle) intravenously (into a vein) at Week 0, 2 and 6 in the induction treatment phase
      followed by maintenance regimen of the intervention every 8 weeks up to 26 weeks. Placebo
      infusions will also be given at Week 10, 12 and 16. The placebo group will receive placebo
      infusion at Week 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22. At Week 10, participants in placebo group will then
      receive infliximab induction therapy. Efficacy of the participants will primarily be
      evaluated by percentage of participants who achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75
      (PASI) response at Week 10. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
