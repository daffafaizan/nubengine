      glycol/glycerol intake effects on cardiorespiratory function are unknown. Weaning of
      propylene glycol/glycerol could allows a quick clearance of propylene glycol/glycerol from
      the body, with subsequent recovery of cardiorespiratory function.

      Specific aim of the research. This research proposal tests the following hypothesis regarding
      the reversibility of propylene glycol/glycerol and nicotine intake:

        -  Propylene glycol/glycerol cessation restores cardiorespiratory function.

        -  Chronic propylene glycol/glycerol and propylene glycol/glycerol/nicotine intake induces
           specific serum and urine proteomics profile, which are partially reversed after
           cessation.

        -  Chronic propylene glycol/glycerol and propylene glycol/glycerol/nicotine intake induces
           specific serum and urine metabolomics profile, which are partially reversed after
           cessation.
