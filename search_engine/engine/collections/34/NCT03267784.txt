    
      This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of allogeneic ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in
      patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer. Allogeneic MSCs will be isolated ex vivo and will
      be expanded in vitro. The Investigational medicinal product (IMP) containing the
      ABCB5-positive MSCs will then be applied two times (at Visit 3 and six weeks later, at Visit
      10) on the wound surface of DFU.

      Patients are followed up for efficacy for a period of three months starting after the first
      IMP application which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound
      coverage.

      The wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size
      reduction evaluation will start two weeks after the first IMP application. The quality of the
      wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue,
      epithelialization and wound exudation.

      Pain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated
      with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-DFU
      three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 after the first IMP application are included.
