      (Breast Imaging Tensor-Motion) software to detect and discriminate between benign and
      malignant breast lesions that are identified on mammogram (MG) and ultrasound (US)
      examinations. Women over the age of 18 who have a breast lesion that is seen on MG or US will
      be eligible to enroll. Participation in this study will involve one non-invasive non-contrast
      MRI scan of the breasts.
