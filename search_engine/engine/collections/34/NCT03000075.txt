      150 mg in Part A. All participants received 2 injections to maintain the blind: the placebo
      arm received 2 injections of placebo, the risankizumab 75 mg arm received one injection of
      risankizumab 75 mg and one injection of placebo, and the risankizumab 150 mg arm received 2
      injections of risankizumab 75 mg. Participants who received placebo in Part A switched to
      risankizumab in Part B; participants who received risankizumab (75 mg or 150 mg) in Part A
      continued to receive the same treatment (risankizumab 75 mg or 150 mg) in Part B.
