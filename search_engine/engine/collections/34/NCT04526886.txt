      chemotherapy dose reductions and treatment delays in patients with neutropenia and/or
      thrombocytopenia during treatment with FOLFOX-type regimens. The clinical algorithm was
      developed by the principal investigator, and the algorithm has been iteratively revised over
      time based on experiences from use in routine care.

      Features of the dose adjustment algorithm that differ from criteria used in clinical trial
      protocols and routine care include:

        -  At presentation for cycle 2 and 3 - the algorithm employs proactive chemotherapy dose
           reductions, without treatment delay, in patients with mild cytopenias (absolute
           neutrophil count [ANC] 1000-1499/mm3 and/or platelet count 75,000-99,000/mm3). In usual
           care, mild cytopenias during early treatment cycles do not trigger a chemotherapy dose
           reduction, but these early cytopenia events often lead to more severe cytopenias and
           subsequent delays in later treatment cycles.

        -  At any cycle - the algorithm employs chemotherapy dose reductions without treatment
           delay in patients with moderate cytopenias (ANC 750-999/mm3 and/or platelet count
           50,000-74,000/mm3). In usual care, moderate cytopenias trigger both a chemotherapy
           treatment delay AND a subsequent dose reduction, whereas the study algorithm will
           introduce a dose reduction without a treatment delay.

      Decisions about dose modifications and delays for reasons other than neutropenia and/or
      thrombocytopenia will be made at the discretion of the treating clinician, as per
      standard-of-care treatment.
