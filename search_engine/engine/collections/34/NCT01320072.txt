      Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, NY. The patient
      population in the Bronx has one of the highest asthma prevalences in the country. Thus, our
      study participants are being recruited among the population most in need of a better
      understanding of the disease process.

      Visits 1 and 2: Low-dose challenge with 20 mg and 40 mg of ASA. ASA will be administered
      orally to participants in both groups: 20 mg at Visit 1 and 40 mg at Visit 2. Visits will
      take place at least 1 week apart. Blood and urine will be collected at several time points.

      Visit 3: Oral graded ASA challenge will be performed to confirm or rule out the presence of
      ASA-hypersensitivity. This visit will take place at least 1 week after Visit 2. Both groups
      will undergo an oral graded ASA challenge as per earlier described protocol. Urine and plasma
      will be collected from the patients at several time points. Hypersensitivity reactions will
      be defined in four different ways: a) decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)
      of at least 15% combined and naso-ocular reaction; b) 20% decline in FEV1; c) isolated
      naso-ocular reactions; d) isolated cutaneous reactions (hives and swelling). Patients with
      reactions will be treated according to their symptoms.
