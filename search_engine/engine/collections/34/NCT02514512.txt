    
      Twenty patients 18 years of age or more and undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)
      at Northern Sydney Cancer Centre for lung cancer will receive the new treatment. Participants
      will be physically able to undergo all aspects of treatment and intellectually able to
      provide written informed consent and complete questionnaires. Beacons will be implanted in
      the patients' lung to allow the Multi Leaf Collimator (MLC) tracking equipment to follow
      precisely the movement of the lung. The difference in ability to track tumour movement
      between MLC and the current standard method will be compared to identify changes in study
      outcomes. Audiovisual (AV) Biofeedback will also be used to regulate patients' breathing
      during radiotherapy.
