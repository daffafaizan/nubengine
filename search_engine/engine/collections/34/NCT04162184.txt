      substance use disorder is an important public health priority. In the US nearly half (45%) of
      all pregnancies are unplanned and studies have consistently found this rate to be much higher
      among individuals in substance treatment, almost 90%. There is a paucity of research on
      interventions to support the family planning care of this population. The primary goal of
      this project is to identify an innovative delivery model to address the family planning needs
      of individuals of reproductive age in treatment for substance use disorder at an urban
      integrated safety-net health system. Through the use of mixed methods this study will address
      the following objectives: 1) To describe the family planning experiences and needs of
      individuals in treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) in a representative sample of
      patients and 2) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among study
      participants. If found to be acceptable, efficacy should be assessed in a randomized
      controlled trial. A navigator model such as this is generalizable and could be easily
      integrated into a variety of settings.
