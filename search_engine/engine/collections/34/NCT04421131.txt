      for promoting cancer screening. mIVAA comprises two components: a digital imaging device and
      a telemedicine platform.

        1. The digital imaging device is either a mobile phone camera or the pocket colposcope
           plugged into a mobile phone.

        2. The telemedicine platform is mobile phone-based, with an interface for midwives in the
           mobile units to enter patient information and acquire and upload cervical images, and an
           interface for the colposcopists based remotely to review the cervical images and patient
           information and return feedback.

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To pilot test mIVAA in a community-based setting in Peru.

      Aim 2: To evaluate effectiveness of mIVAA by comparing the attendance for follow-up clinical
      evaluation among women screened with mIVAA compared to historical data on women referred for
      follow-up without mIVAA.
