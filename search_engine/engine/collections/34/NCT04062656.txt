      pathological examination of the resected tumor following preoperative systemic therapy. A pCR
      rate of 15% is expected in Arm A with FLOT chemotherapy (FLOT = Biweekly fluorouracil,
      leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel regimen). An increase to 35% is estimated to be
      clinically relevant when patients are treated with either nivolumab in combination with
      chemotherapy (Arm B) or nivolumab and another immuno-oncology (IO) agent (i.e. ipilimumab or
      relatlimab) in Arm C and D. Additional objectives include resection rate, diseasefree
      survival (DFS), median overall survival (OS), patient's quality of life (QoL), and safety and
      tolerability of the treatment. Furthermore, translational endpoints will be investigated.
