      COPD, the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Despite the well established
      causal role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer and COPD, only 10-20% of smokers actually
      develop these diseases. This suggests that there are genetic predisposing factors that place
      some individuals at greater risk. Our prior work shows that healthy smokers (cigarette
      smokers with normal history, physical exam, lung function tests and chest x-rays) and smokers
      with COPD have marked up and down regulation of greater than 200 genes in the small airway
      epithelium and alveolar macrophages. There is however, a varied response to smoking among
      individuals, with some individuals abnormally expressing far fewer genes. The focus of this
      study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the response of the lung cells to the stress of
      smoking is unique to each individual but is consistent over time. Furthermore, individuals
      that stop smoking will each have a unique response, but is constant over time for each
      individual. By defining the patterns of biologic response over time among smoking, ex-smoking
      and nonsmoking subjects, we will be able to identify common biologic pathways as potential
      targets for intervention.
