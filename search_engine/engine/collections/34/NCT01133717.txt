      to the general population. The mechanism for the increased stroke risk in OSA is unknown.
      However, the constellation of adverse pathophysiological consequences, including intermittent
      hypoxia and carbon-dioxide retention as a result of OSA may be detrimental to CVR and
      predispose the brain to ischemia. Previous studies in OSA subjects have measured CVR only
      using TCD. Therefore, our study will examine CVR by two methods (TCD and BOLD-MRI) with
      reliable and reproducible hypercapnia and independent control of oxygen saturation
      (RespiractTM). Patterns seen on CVR may eventually allow the identification of OSA patients
      who will be at greatest risk for stroke and will therefore, require aggressive risk reduction
      and/or treatment irrespective of symptoms.
