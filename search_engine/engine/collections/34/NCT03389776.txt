      collected as part of routine anesthetic care. No intervention will take place. Once
      identified from a theatre list, patients/parents will be approached preoperatively and
      consent taken to participate. If inclusion criteria are met and consent gained the
      preoperative questionnaire will be completed to obtain information regarding pain, nausea,
      sore throat, itching, thirst and hunger. Each symptom will be graded none, mild, moderate,
      severe. Intraoperative data will be collected after surgery whilst the child is in the
      recovery room. This is objective data obtained from the anesthetic chart. Prior to discharge
      to the ward the child will undergo a second interview answering the same questions as he/she
      did preoperatively (a further 1-2 minutes). Any child who has a sore throat in the recovery
      room will then be followed up 2 hours later on the ward with a further questionnaire. This
      will include questions about the location of the sore throat, severity and voice changes
      (5-10 mins). This will be the end of the participants input.
