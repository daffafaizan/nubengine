      expression alterations in tumor prior to and following progression on ribociclib, during core
      phase and then prior to and following progression on alpelisib and thus identify patterns of
      mutations, how they evolve, and their association with CDK4/6 inhibition and outcomes such as
      sustained response or early progression. The study also aims to evaluate pharmacogenomics and
      its association with adverse events (frequency and severity), drug-drug interactions and
      clinical outcomes.

      Finally, the study will also generate additional long-term safety and efficacy data in this
      specific Italian population.
