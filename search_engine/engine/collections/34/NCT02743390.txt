      regularly followed at the Outpatient Resistant Hypertension Clinic/UNICAMP - which will
      randomized assigned to (1) saline infusion followed by infliximab infusion (TNF-α inhibitor,
      3 mg/kg) and (2) infliximab followed by saline, for two hours and washout of the 40-day
      period between both infusions. It is expected that the TNF-α inhibition regulates hemodynamic
      parameters, such as mean BP, cardiac Output, total peripheral resistance, which may allow a
      better rational approach for the RH treatment.
