      development and administration of effective treatments for adolescent depression. Adolescents
      who do not receive adequate exposure to active treatment are unlikely to benefit from
      experimentally supported treatments. Certain therapist behaviors may influence the
      attendance, drop-out, and overall participation of adolescents with depression. This study
      will evaluate the effect of engagement interventions and alliance on attendance,
      participation, completion, and outcome in depressed adolescents.

      Participants in this study will have 12 weekly sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      at a school-based health clinic. Audio recordings from the completed CBT sessions will be
      replayed and evaluated to identify therapist engagement interventions, therapy alliance, and
      treatment participation.
