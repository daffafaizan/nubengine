      epithelium wound healing in patients receiving pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for diabetic
      retinopathy and penetrating keratoplasty. Background: During PPV for diabetic retinopathy
      retinopathy and penetrating keratoplasty, removal of the edematous corneal epithelial layer
      was usually required in order to obtain a better surgical view or enhance the postoperative
      epithelial wound healing process. However, delayed epithelial healing was frequently found in
      these patients after surgeries. In addition, corneal epithelial defect is also frequent found
      in diabetic patients after PPV even corneal epithelial debridement is not performed during
      the operation. Autologous serum, the fluid component of full blood after blood clotting,
      contains a large variety of growth factors, vitamins, and immunoglobulins. These
      epitheliotropic factors are thought to be responsible for the therapeutic effect of serum
      observed on ocular surface disorders. The effects of serum to promote epithelial wound
      healing have been well documented in cell culture system in a variety of epithelial cell
      types including corneal epithelial cells. Autologous serum eye drops have also been
      demonstrated to be beneficial in the treatment of persistent corneal epithelial defects. In
      this study, we planned a prospective study to determine the effectiveness of autologous serum
      tears as a primary treatment in corneal epithelial defect following vitrectomy in diabetic
      patients and penetrating keratoplasty.
