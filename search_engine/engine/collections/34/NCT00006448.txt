      individuals with amputations. This double-masked randomized trial to evaluate the utility of
      a combination of psychological intervention and physical therapy in order to improve pain
      reduction, increase physical functioning and quality of life for patients with pain
      associated with spinal cord injuries or amputations will compare the effect of a 6 week
      program of physical therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy with methadone to one without
      methadone (n = 400). Secondary outcomes are to evaluate the maintenance of effects of the
      combined intervention and to evaluate the usefulness of a course of opioid therapy compared
      to active placebo medication. Based on the sample size, all measures have greater than 0.7
      power to detect major within group differences at posttreatment, 6-month follow-up, and
      12-month follow-up (taking into account a 15% attrition rate, alpha .05). Patients who
      qualify for this study will receive a comprehensive medical and physical therapy evaluation
      at baseline. Outcome will be assessed by the physician, psychiatrist and physical therapist
      who are all masked both to the treatment condition and therapy. Pain is assessed through
      self-report (measures include pain inventories) and clinical interview.
