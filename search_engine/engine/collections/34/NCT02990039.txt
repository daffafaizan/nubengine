      increase physical activity and to reduce sedentary time in leisure time.

      Following the Intervention Mapping Protocol we developed the counseling letter intervention.
      The intervention is based on the Health Action Process Approach, comprising 3 tailored
      letters based on separate assessments, delivered over 6 month.

      All participants consented (i) to participate in an examination at the university hospital
      including standardized measurements of blood pressure, waist and hip circumference, body
      height and weight as well as blood sample taking, (ii) to fill in a paper-pencil
      questionnaire, and (iii) to wear an accelerometer for 7 days at baseline and at 12-month
      follow-up.

      A general population sample of cardiovascular healthy adults was randomly allocated to a
      control and an intervention group. At 5 time points (baseline, 3-month, 6-month, 7-month, and
      12-month follow-up) participants of both study groups completed standardized questionnaires.
