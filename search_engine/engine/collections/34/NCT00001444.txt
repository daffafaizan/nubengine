      UCN-01(7-hydroxystaurosporine) a protein kinase C inhibitor which also may affect
      cyclin-dependent kinase activity, given as a 72 hour infusion. This trial will determine the
      toxicity associated with the maximally tolerated dose of this drug in patients for whom no
      other therapeutic approach is deemed to be more useful.
