      family-based linkage analysis, together with rich data generated from NGS, to search for
      disease susceptibility locus for the patients with strong family history of primary NSCLC. By
      using family pedigrees, linkage analysis will be able to find co-segregation of alleles
      through multiple generations at a genetic susceptibility locus and a known genetic marker,
      and then the highly penetrate gene loci may be detected by our study. These gene loci will be
      a good genetic predictor of NSCLC which should be a great advantage in treatment, prevention
      and screening of NSCLC in the future.
