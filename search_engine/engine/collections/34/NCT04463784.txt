      major side effect i.e. the mental effects have been noticed and has a major influence on the
      adherence and efficacy of ART regimen. Mental effects of efaviren have been especially
      critical in Chinese patients, as the effective and toxic ranges of efaviren plasma
      concentration in Chinese patients are very close to each other.

      In this study, 500 treatment-naive Chinese patients with a body weight < 60kg will be
      screened and recruited. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to efaviren 400mg v.s. 600mg combined
      with lamivudine and tenofovir. All patients will be followed regularly for 2 years, at 0, 2w,
      4w, 3m and every 3 months. Virological and immunological measurements will be done at each
      visit. Meanwhile, various mental scales will be performed at each visit to evaluate the
      mental effects of each arm.
