      To compare the shape & diameter of root canals, risk of perforation and the canal
      transportation after using rotary versus manual instruments on root extracted second primary
      molars.

      Methodology:

      Extracted second primary molars will be collected from the dental clinics of Pediatric
      Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.

      The teeth are extracted either due to periodontal problems or because they are not restorable
      (beyond restoration) by the conventional coronal restorations or full coverage restorations
      in the case of root caries.

      The teeth will be selected according to our inclusions and exclusion criteria. The teeth will
      be collected, sterilized and stored according to the Occupational Safety and Health
      Administration guidelines and regulations, ultrasonic scaler will be used to clean and remove
      soft tissue debris and calculus attached to the teeth.

      Teeth will be divided into two groups:

      Group (1); ((ProTaper Next, Rotary system). Group (2); K- files, Manual instruments. For
      cleaning and shaping of the canal system and mechanical preparation of root canal treatment.

      Then shape of the canal (Canal transportation), canal diameter and risk of canal perforation
      will be compared in both groups.

      Before and after preparation of the root canal, the shape of the canal will be assessed by
      using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and diameter of the canal will be measured by
      using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).
