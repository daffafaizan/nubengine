    
      This protocol will permit normal subjects, as well as patients with suspected or proven
      medical conditions, to undergo MRI studies using the new software capabilities. This Protocol
      is not restricted to imaging of a particular organ system or disease. The Protocol does not
      involve injection of any contrast agent, or other minimally-invasive or invasive procedure.
      It is intended only for those cases for which the only requirement of the subject is to relax
      and lie still while imaging is being performed.
