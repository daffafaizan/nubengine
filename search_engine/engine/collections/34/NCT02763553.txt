      controlled, Phase IIb trial comparing standard enteral nutrition with an enteral ketogenic
      feed. The trial has a simple, pragmatic design and will be analysed on an intention-to-treat
      basis. It aims to recruit 10 patients from a single University teaching hospital adult
      general ICU. The anticipated recruitment period is 4 weeks.

      Adult patients admitted to intensive care and expected to require enteral feed via a
      nasogastric tube for at least 5 days and who fulfil other eligibility criteria will be
      allocated at random to receive either standard feed (Nutrison Protein Plus Multi Fibre) or a
      ketogenic enteral feed (Nutrison KetoCal 4:1).

      The primary endpoint will be increase in ketone body concentration in serum. Secondary
      endpoints will include, time taken to achieve a ketotic state, ketone levels in critical care
      patients who are not absorbing enteral feed, glucose levels in patients on a ketone feed,
      triglyceride and cholesterol levels, creatinine kinase levels and development of a metabolic
      acidosis.

      Adult ICU patients will be eligible to be included in this study if they are expected to
      require enteral feed via a nasogastric or nasojejunal tube or established percutaneous
      jejunostomy for at least 5 days. Practically, this will be achieved by screening ventilated
      patients as they will require enteral feeding Major exclusion criteria include
      contraindications to ketogenic feeds, contraindications to enteral feeding, a new (< 5 days)
      percutaneous jejunostomy.

      The intervention will continue until 14 days if the patient still requires enteral nutrition
      or until able to commence a normal diet orally.
