      primary objective of this trial is to investigate lot-to-lot consistency in terms of
      equivalence of the immune responses induced by 3 consecutive lots of TDV in healthy
      participants in non-endemic country(ies) for dengue.

      The study will enroll approximately 924 healthy participants. Participants will be randomized
      in 2:2:2:1 to one of 4 trial groups to receive TDV (Lots 1, 2 or 3) or placebo:

        -  TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous injection OR

        -  Placebo normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl) for injection.

      In each trial group, all participants will receive 2 doses of TDV or placebo by subcutaneous
      injection on Days 1 (Month 0) and 90 (Month 3). Immunogenicity will be assessed in
      participants included in the immunogenicity subset (TDV groups: 176 participants each and
      placebo group: 88 participants) and safety will be assessed in all participants in each
      group.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 270 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      including a final visit at Day 270.
