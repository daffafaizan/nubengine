      by iOWH and WHO to be as effective as amphotericin B administered IV at a dose of 1
      mg/kg/every other day for a total for a total of 15 doses over 30 days in the treatment of VL
      in Bihar, India (protocol VLPM01) in a recently completed study (94.6% vs. 98.8% of subjects
      were disease free at 6 months, respectively). This new study is being conducted to determine
      whether similar or better efficacy and safety of IM paromomycin can be achieved with a
      shorter duration of treatment (14 days rather than 21 days) administered for a shorter
      duration (14 days rather than 21 days) than the regimen studied in the previous trial.

      This shorter duration study will compare the initial and final cure (response to treatment)
      rates in subjects with VL receiving paromomycin at the following doses and dose regimens:

        -  Group A: paromomycin 11 mg/kg/day IM for 14 days

        -  Group B: paromomycin 11 mg/kg/day IM for 21 days

      Because compliance generally improves with shorter duration of therapy, and better treatment
      compliance decreases the probability of the emergence of drug-resistant disease,
      administration of higher daily doses of paromomycin for a shorter time may improve efficacy
      without producing unacceptable toxicity. In addition, a treatment regimen of shorter duration
      would cost less and be easier to administer.

      The current study is designed to explore different doses and dose regimens of IM paromomycin
      to determine the dose and dose regimen that should be recommended for first-line therapy for
      treatment of VL, while maintaining the efficacy and safety.
