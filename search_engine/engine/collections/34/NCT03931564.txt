      introduced to the market. MIGS procedures or devices, often small stents or tubes that can be
      placed into the eye, are potentially safer than standard trabeculectomy (TE). The surgery is
      faster and easier to perform. Patient recovery is faster with fewer postoperative visits,
      suggesting less impact on vision and quality of life. However, MIGS devices are more
      expensive compared to standard surgery and it is unclear if the higher costs can be
      compensated with their better safety profile and faster patient recovery (reduced
      productivity losses).

      To establish guidelines for the use of MIGS, the Netherlands Glaucoma Group has recognized
      the need for a formal investigation of their cost-effectiveness as compared to TE, prior to
      their implementation on a large scale for regular care. Therefore, a societal
      cost-effectiveness analysis of MIGS procedures will be undertaken to further elucidate their
      position in the glaucoma treatment algorithm in the Netherlands.

      The objective of this study is to aid in deciding on the use of the IMS in glaucoma surgery
      by assessing its efficacy and cost-effectiveness in patients with primary open angle glaucoma
      compared to trabeculectomy.
