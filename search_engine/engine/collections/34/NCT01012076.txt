      uses individualized video-feedback, modeling, and coaching strategies to help parents
      establish play interactions that promote communication. All participants take part in
      comprehensive baseline and post-intervention/post-active control assessments, as well as 6-
      and 12-month follow up assessments. Families in the active control group will also be invited
      to participate in an oral feedback session to discuss the results from these assessments.
      Children's involvement in other forms of intervention will be monitored using a validated
      intervention log so that the moderating effects of these treatments can be examined.

      By targeting parent-child interactions, the current intervention ensures that new child
      behaviors generalize beyond the immediate context of the intervention and are maintained over
      time (Schreibman, 2000). In addition, by involving parents in the treatment of their children
      (e.g., by establishing a daily playtime routine), the current intervention ensures that the
      intervention strategies are implemented with sufficient intensity for causing developmental
      change (National Research Council, 2001).
