      supplement 5HTP (isolated from the plant Griffonia Simplifolia) reduces human allergic lung
      responses and consequently improves lung function. The primary outcome is the change in FEV1.
      We anticipate the 5HTP at the proposed doses will improve lung function as in preclinical
      studies that used clinically relevant 5HTP. Secondary outcomes will be blood eosinophil
      counts and reduced symptoms for anxiety/depression, as seen in changes in the
      anxiety-depression scores from questionnaires (CES-DC & SCARED). The results from these
      studies have the transformative potential to influence approaches to improve lung function
      and asthma-associated anxiety/depression.

        -  Aim 1: Test that 5HTP improves lung function in children with allergic asthma

        -  Aim 2: Test that 5HTP reduces eosinophil numbers in the blood and nasal fluid of
           patients with asthma from Aim 1

        -  Aim 3: Test that 5HTP decreases lung inflammation, increases cortisol and prolactin
           without altering systemic plasma concentrations of 5HTP, serotonin,
           5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and dopamine
