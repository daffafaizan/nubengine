      the spiral CT in women having had an obstructed delivery. If this concordance is
      demonstrated, it would allow the use of this new technique of imagery, to realize a
      pelvimetry during the pregnancy less irradiating for the mother, and the fetus.

      To answer this objective, the study will be a prospective, monocentric, open clinical trial,
      comparing the radio-pelvimetry realized with EOS technique, to the spiral CT. Measures are
      performed in the 3 months following the obstructed delivery.
