      has a randomized double-blinded crossover design with three treatments that include an equal
      dosage of curcumin as follows :

        -  400 mg of curcumin extract,

        -  400 mg of curcumin in rice oil,

        -  400 mg of curcumin extract + 1.5 g omega-3 in MAG form.

      For each of the above listed products, a natural product number (NPN) was requested to Health
      Canada and these number are currently pending.

      Each participant will consume each of the three treatments in a random order with a minimum
      of 7 days washout phase between both treatments. Blood samples will be collected at time 0,
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 24h (10 blood samples per participant per treatment) after
      taking the single dose intake. A questionnaire will allow documenting side effects throughout
      the study period. The analyses will be performed by ultra-high-performance liquid
      chromatography couples to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC/MS/MS). Samples will be
      analyzed in a blinded manner such that the student and research assistant will be blinded
      from the type of treatment and the time point they are analyzing. After performing all the
      analyses, sample identification will be decoded and pharmacokinetic data of the curcuminoids
      in each of the treatments will be plotted on a plasma concentration vs time curve. The
      parameters below will be calculated:

        -  Area under the curve (AUC) 0-24h (bioavailability);

        -  Area under the curve (AUC) 0-6h (absorption);

        -  Maximum concentration (Cmax);

        -  Time to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax);

        -  Half-life (if available).
