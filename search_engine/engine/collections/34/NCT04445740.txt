    
      The current study employs a 2 group randomized control design (treatment and no-treatment
      control) with randomization occurring after baseline (time 0) and 3 additional evaluation
      periods (end of intervention (time 1), and 9 months (time 2) and 12 months post intervention
      (time 3)). Because the the iâ™¥rhythm project is intended to prevent children from beginning a
      trajectory toward overweight/obesity in elementary school, the impact of the intervention on
      change in standardized BMI (BMIz) during the following summer (time 2 and 3) will be
      explored, identifying whether a maintenance intervention is needed. Following the
      intervention and final data assessment (time 1 and 3), qualitative interviews will explore
      the acceptability of the intervention, treatment barriers and facilitators, difficulties with
      study procedures, maintenance of improvements, and self-efficacy to maintain improvements. A
      third treatment condition controlling for the effect of attention was beyond the scope of the
      current feasibility study.
