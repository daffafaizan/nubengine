      emotional facial expressions. The intervention portion of this study is part of a larger
      study. The first portion of this study consists of a screening visit with questionnaires, and
      a second visit with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and short computer tasks.

      For the intervention portion of this study, a subset of participants will return to the lab
      for an in-person visit either six or twelve months after their MRI scan. This visit will last
      approximately two hours. Participants will be asked to complete a computer task where they
      will be asked to identify emotional face expressions and receive feedback on their
      performance. They will also complete questionnaires about their mood and emotions.

      The primary purpose of this research is to gather scientific information about how people
      with anxiety process social and emotional information.
