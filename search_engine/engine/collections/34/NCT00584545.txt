      measure of pharyngeal strength on fluoroscopy by comparing it with simultaneous pharyngeal
      manometry. Combined videofluoroscopic swallowing studies with pharyngeal manometry are
      commonly used in the evaluation of dysphagia. However, no published study has compared the
      results of simultaneous pharyngeal manometry with objective timing and displacement measures
      on videofluoroscopy. These objective measures, such as the pharyngeal constriction ratio,
      were developed here at UCD and are not yet routinely used by other practitioners. A secondary
      aim of this study will be to corroborate recent data in the literature suggesting that the
      presence of feeding tube through the upper esophageal sphincter does not affect the
      oropharyngeal phase of deglutition. This topic is currently under hot debate in the speech
      language pathology realm and has important implications for the evaluation of hospitalized
      patients with dysphagia.
