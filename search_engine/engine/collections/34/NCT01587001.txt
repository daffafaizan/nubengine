      oxidative species are produced secondary to oxidative stress and inflammation and can affect
      key cellular processes. The investigators have shown a role for oxidative stress in chronic
      beryllium disease (CBD), a granulomatous disease that resembles sarcoidosis, and have also
      shown that antioxidant therapy reduces inflammation in CBD. Oxidative stress also plays a
      role in sarcoidosis but the exact mechanism and potential effect of antioxidant therapy on
      sarcoidosis is unknown. The investigators propose conducting a pilot study investigating the
      effect of an antioxidant, N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC), on inflammation and oxidative stress in
      sarcoidosis. The investigators will measure and compare markers of inflammation and oxidative
      stress in the lungs of sarcoidosis patients before and after treatment with NAC. The results
      of this study will prepare the investigators for a larger study investigating the role of NAC
      as a therapy for sarcoidosis with changes in lung function and x-ray as our primary outcome.
      This will provide the investigators with a new non-toxic therapy for sarcoidosis that can be
      used on its own or to supplement other therapies minimizing their toxicity.
