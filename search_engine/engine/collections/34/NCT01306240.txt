    
      Newborn between 35 and 41 weeks of gestation with RDS within the first 24 hours of life,
      treated with nCPAP and a FiO2 â‰¥ 30% are eligible. Randomisation is stratified by centre and 2
      age groups (35-36 weeks of gestation and 37-41 weeks ogf gestation). One arm will receive
      surfactant treatment after tracheal intubation. The second arm will continue nCPAP. A rescue
      treatment is used in the second arm if FiO2 > 60%. In each arm the newborn is weaned from
      mechanical ventilation and oxygen treatment as soon as possible. The primary outcome of the
      study is the success of the procedure defined as "survival without any oxygen treatment" at
      72 hours of life.
