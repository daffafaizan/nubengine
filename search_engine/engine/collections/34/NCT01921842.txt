        1. To train Child Care Health consultants (CCHCs) to become specialists in nutrition
           consultation in child care such that they will increase their daily consultation
           activities on nutrition, physical activity, and childhood overweight,

        2. To increase child care staff and parental knowledge of and positive attitudes toward
           providing healthy foods, appropriate portions of foods, and appropriate levels of
           physical activity for young children in out-of-home child care centers.,

        3. To strengthen child care center policies, procedures, practices and behaviors, regarding
           providing healthy foods, appropriate portions of foods, and appropriate levels of
           physical activity for young children in out-of-home child care centers, and

        4. To improve dietary intake and levels of physical activity, and to prevent increases in
           overweight and the risk of overweight as determined by body mass indexes among children
           in out-of-home child care centers.
