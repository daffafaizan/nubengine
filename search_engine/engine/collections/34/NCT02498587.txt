    
      Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) continues to be of major relevance to public health
      worldwide. In the last 10 years there have been multiple SARI outbreaks around the world. The
      2009 H1N1 pandemic was estimated to result in more than 200,000 respiratory deaths globally.
      The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SARI as an acute respiratory infection of recent
      onset (within 10 days) requiring hospitalisation, manifested by fever (â‰¥38oC) or a history of
      fever and cough. There is international consensus that it is important to undertake
      observational studies of patients with SARI as an essential component of pandemic and
      epidemic research preparedness.
