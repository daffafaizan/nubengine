      characteristics, and cognitive deficiencies. Although FAS was first described in the
      literature over 40 years ago, significant challenges remain in the development of rapid and
      efficient approaches to identify individuals who were prenatally exposed to alcohol. Further,
      no widely available effective interventions or treatments to improve the long term outcomes
      of individuals with FAS and related disorders (collectively known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum
      Disorders or FASD) exist, despite the high prevalence (as high as 33.5 per 1,000 in some
      communities) of FASD across the United States.

      The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) seeks to address
      critical issues related to earlier and improved recognition of FASD, identify biomarkers of
      exposure, and elucidate the genetic risk factors contributing to FASD risk and resilience by
      conducting multidisciplinary projects and maintaining cooperative resources. This project is
      part of CIFASD's ongoing efforts and will specifically address the elucidation of genetic
      factors that contribute to risk and resilience in FASD.

      Prior work with animal models of FASD have identified genetic variants that contribute to
      alterations in facial morphology after exposure to alcohol during embryonic development
      (McCarthy et al., 2013). Prenatal alcohol exposure also activates immune pathway genes in
      animal models. The identification of these genetic factors suggest that genetic variation may
      similarly contribute to differences in response to prenatal alcohol exposure in humans. The
      goal of this project is to identify genetic variants that protect against or increase the
      effects of prenatal alcohol exposure in humans.
