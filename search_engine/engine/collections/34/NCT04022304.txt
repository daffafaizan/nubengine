    
      The present study is designed to demonstrate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalence
      of Biocon Insulin N with HumulinÂ® N in healthy subjects.

      The treatment consists of one single dose of the test or reference product, administered
      during each of the three study periods, separated by 5-7 days between each dosing. The
      planned trial duration for each subject is about 17 to 43 days. Eligible subjects will
      undergo three euglycaemic clamp examinations (each of 24 hours duration).

      Depending on the sequence in which a particular subject is randomized, each subject will
      either undergo two clamps with administration of test product plus one clamp with
      administration of reference product, or, two clamps with administration of reference product
      plus one clamp with administration of test product, in random order.
