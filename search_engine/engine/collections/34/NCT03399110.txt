      cancer. Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin for 6 months after D2 gastrectomy is considered as
      effective postoperative adjuvant treatment for patients with operable stage II or III gastric
      cancer in the CLASSIC trail. However, because of adverse events discontinuations in the
      chemotherapy group occurred in 50 (10%) patients, mainly as a result of nausea, neutropenia,
      decreased appetite, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, and vomiting. At the 2017 ASCO Annual
      Meeting, Grothey et al reported the result of IDEA trail. For lymph node-positive colon
      cancer (stage III), some patients may need only half of the long-standing standard course of
      chemotherapy after surgery. In an analysis of 6 clinical trials with over 12,800 patients, 3
      months of chemotherapy was nearly as effective as 6 months in patients with relatively lower
      recurrence risk and caused fewer side effects, particularly nerve damage. Based on IDEA
      trail, we postulate that the chemotherapy of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin for 4 months may
      also benefit patients after D2 gastrectomy and decrease adverse events compared with 6
      months.
