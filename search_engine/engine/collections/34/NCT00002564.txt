      and overall survival in women surgically treated for early stage breast cancer who are
      receiving adjuvant therapy with or without either tamoxifen, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
      fluorouracil (CMF), doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (AC), fluorouracil, doxorubicin,
      cyclophosphamide (FAC, CAF), or AC followed by paclitaxel. II. Evaluate whether differences
      in the lipid profile are associated with dietary group assignment and dietary fat.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, nodal
      status, ER status, and type of adjuvant chemotherapy. The first group receives intensive
      dietary intervention for reduction of total fat intake to 15% of calories, with repeated
      individual and group counseling sessions. The second group receives USDA/DHHS dietary
      guidelines and minimal intervention. All patients who are estrogen receptor positive receive
      concurrent therapy with tamoxifen; cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF)
      followed by tamoxifen; doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by tamoxifen;
      fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC, CAF) followed by tamoxifen; or AC,
      paclitaxel followed by tamoxifen. Patients are followed annually throughout the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,500 women will be accrued for this study.
