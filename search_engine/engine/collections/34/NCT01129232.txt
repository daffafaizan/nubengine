      be important for the destruction of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas. Increasing
      indirect evidences exist that picornaviruses may either directly or indirectly through
      autoimmune processes destroy beta cells. New sensitive assays have been developed to detect
      these viruses and to study the immunological processes, especially T-cell function.
      Microsurgical technology has been refined, now making pancreatic biopsies a safe procedure.
      This study focuses on advanced in depth studies of immunology and virology in pancreatic
      tissue and small intestine at an early stage of disease.
