      has the same healing effect on the brain for people with depression as traditional
      antidepressants do, to find out more about the causes of depression and why people differ in
      the extent of problems caused by depression, and to determine if certain differences in genes
      within populations are related to clinical symptoms.Genes we are examining for this study are
      COMT, BDNF, and 5-HTT long arm and short arm, as well as future genes that may be discovered
      to play a role in depression at a later time, and will be determined by examining saliva and
      blood samples. We are primarily studying depression by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (fMRI) which allows us to identify certain parts of the brain that show how the brain works
      in controlling negative feelings. Participants will be imaged while performing different
      tasks that are believed to activate emotional circuitry of the brain. Comparisons of
      activation patterns across these tasks will be used to characterize the cognitive mechanisms
      supported by different cortical regions, and to determine patterns of functional brain
      deficits in subjects with depression. Comparisons will also be made between changes that
      occur after treatment with an approved antidepressant and treatment with CBT.
