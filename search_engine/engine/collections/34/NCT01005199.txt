        -  To determine if sorafenib tosylate with versus without everolimus can stop tumor
           progression in patients with localized, unresectable, or metastatic hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

        -  To evaluate changes in symptom-related and global quality of life (QL) and QL benefit
           over the course of trial treatment in these patients.

        -  To compare the primary endpoint (i.e., progression-free survival at week 12) to the QL
           benefit within 12 weeks from baseline.

        -  To evaluate how symptom-related and global QL indicators map on the single summary index
           derived from a standardized measure of health status for utility cost analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to WHO performance
      status (0 vs 1), disease spread (extrahepatic spread vs non-extrahepatic spread), and center.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm A (standard treatment): Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily for 4
           weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm B (investigational treatment): Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily
           and oral everolimus once daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients may undergo CT scan or MRI at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks during study to
      assess tumor response, tumor size, and tumor density.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline and every 2 weeks for 12 weeks
      during study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 3 years.
