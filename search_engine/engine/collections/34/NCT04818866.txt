      in Ann Arbor from February 1st, 2020 to date are included. Other participating centers will
      enroll patients depending on their variable capacity. Patients with a positive test for
      SARS-CoV-2 but hospitalized for non-Covid-19 reasons were excluded. Blood-based biomarkers
      including soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), C-reactive protein (CRP),
      procalcitonin, D-dimer, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase and interleukin-6 are measured in
      samples collected within 48 hours of presentation. The primary outcome of the study is the
      composite endpoint of in-hospital mortality, need for mechanical ventilation and need for
      renal replacement therapy.
