      sophistication that enables high-resolution monitoring of movements not only for everyday
      sports activities but also for movement disorders. Tremor-related diseases as Parkinson's
      Disease (PD) and Essential Tremor (ET) are two of the most common movement disorders. Disease
      classification is primarily based on clinical criteria and remains challenging. The primary
      goal of this study is to identify new phenotypical characteristics based on the captured
      movement data by the tremor-capturing smartwatches and tablets and smartphone-based
      questionnaires.

      The system will be applied and analyzed within an experimental and observational setting and
      only captures from patients, which have received informed consent. Within the study period,
      the SDS is not intended as clinical diagnostic support for physicians and will be not be used
      as medical device.
