      in the study. Interested patients read and signed an IRB-approved Informed Consent Document
      (ICD) that described the study and their potential involvement. The study coordinator read
      and or translated the ICD to women who spoke languages other than English or Spanish (i.e.
      Quechua).

      Pertinent disease specific demographic information was collected from each patient. Following
      insertion of a vaginal speculum and a one minute application of 5% acetic acid, polarized and
      non-polarized high resolution digital RGB images were taken of the ectocervix. Thereafter,
      non-polarized light colposcopy was performed as standard of care. The colposcopist derived a
      colposcopic impression and indicated whether a biopsy was necessary. So as not to compromise
      the next examination, Lugol's Iodine was not applied. Then, a polarized light colposcopy was
      performed. As before, the colposcopist derived an impression, indicated whether a biopsy was
      necessary and annotated the site of pending biopsy. Then if indicated, a minimum of one
      cervical biopsy was obtained from the area(s) representing the most severe colopscopic
      changes as seen during the non-polarized exam. The exact biopsy site was annotated.
