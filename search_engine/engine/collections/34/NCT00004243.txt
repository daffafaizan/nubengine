      in patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors. II. Describe the toxicities of this
      regimen in this patient population at each dose level studied. III. Evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of docetaxel. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1
      hour followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicities. Patients are followed for disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
