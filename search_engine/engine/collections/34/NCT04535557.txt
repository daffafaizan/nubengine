      treat people who have NSCLC with EGFR exon-20 insertion mutations who have failed the current
      standard of care (SOC) have no approved treatment therapies. Participants will be treated
      with mobocertinib until they experience progressive disease (PD) that requires an alternate
      therapy in the opinion of the physician, intolerable toxicity, or another discontinuation
      criterion. Treatment may be continued after PD if, in the opinion of the physician, the
      participant continues to experience clinical benefit.

      The study will enroll approximately 100 participants. Enrollment will be based on unsolicited
      participant requests. All participants will be assigned to receive-

      â€¢ Mobocertinib 160 milligram (mg)

      Dose interruptions or reductions (first dose reduction- 120 mg and second dose reduction- 80
      mg) will be implemented for participants who experience treatment-related adverse events
      (TEAEs), based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this expanded access study is 4 months. The follow-up period for survival
      begins at the end of treatment (up to 30 days past last dose) and continues until participant
      discontinues.
