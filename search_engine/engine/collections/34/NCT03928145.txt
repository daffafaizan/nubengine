    
      This is a factorial (2x2) randomized double-blinded clinical trial comparing the association
      of a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone 25 mg/day or hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/day) with a
      potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride 10 mg/day or amiloride 20 mg/day) as first drug option
      in patients aged 30 to 75 years with primary hypertension. The thiazide diuretic and
      amiloride will be combined in a single capsule. The capsules will be of the same size and
      color, so that neither the researcher nor the patients can distinguish the treatment by their
      appearance. The primary outcome will be the mean change from baseline in 24-h systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The
      secondary outcomes will be the mean change from baseline in daytime and nighttime systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure measured by ABPM, mean change from baseline in systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure measured by office blood pressure, incidence of adverse events,
      variation of laboratory parameters and proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure
      control (<140/90 mmHg and <130/80 mmHg for office blood pressure and 24-h ABPM,
      respectively). The follow-up will last 12 weeks. For a P alpha of 0.05, power of 80%, and
      standard deviation of 9 mmHg, and absolute difference of 6 mmHg on systolic blood pressure on
      24-h ABPM, it will be necessary to study a total of 76 patients. The sample size will be
      increased by 10% to compensate losses, resulting in 84 patients being randomized in total (42
      for each arm).
