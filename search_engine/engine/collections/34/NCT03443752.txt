      movement. Some signs and symptoms of PD include; tremors, rigidity, gait impairments, and
      balance disruption. Individuals with PD experience substantially impaired balance ultimately
      affecting their functional abilities. With this, individuals with PD may also experience
      lower quality of life due to these diminished determinants. Currently, there are medications
      which have proven to mask the symptoms of Parkinson's such as levodopa. There are also
      exercise programs which have proven to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease such as
      resistance based exercises and Tai Chi.based on the proven benefits of balance and overall
      quality of life through Shotokan-karate training, the purpose of this study will be to
      compare Shotokan-karate training versus Tai Chi on balance and quality of life in individuals
      with Parkinson's disease. Based on the literature available on the benefits of
      shotokan-karate on balance and quality of life in the elderly, it is hypothesized that
      shotokan-karate will improve balance and quality of life due to its high intensity, increased
      engagement and similarities to everyday movements. If the following hypothesis is supported,
      the present study will allow for individuals with Parkinson's disease to engage in an
      exercise program that shows vast improvements in their postural stability and overall quality
      of life. In addition, participants will be able to engage in an exercise program which will
      provide them with long term benefits and they will be able to implement this in their
      everyday lifestyle.
