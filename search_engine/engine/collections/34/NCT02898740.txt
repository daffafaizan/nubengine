      Nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are thought to be present from the early stages
      of disease and are often more disabling and resistant to treatment than motor symptoms. One
      of the most important and serious of these symptoms is depression. However, there is no
      consensus on best pharmacological treatment for depression in PD as efficacy is lacking and
      there is much concern about polypharmacy and safety of various antidepressant medications.
      Therefore, it is essential that the investigators characterize the effects of
      nonpharmacological interventions on depression in PD. A number of studies have shown
      significant benefits of exercise in reducing depressive symptoms. Emerging studies indicate
      similar benefits of exercise in the form of resistance training in limiting depression in
      older adults as well as in those with PD.

      Objective:

      The investigators hypothesize that a home-based exercise intervention will reduce depression
      in Veterans with depression in PD.

      Methods:

      The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial of a structured exercise intervention,
      evaluating effects on depression. Community-dwelling Veterans with depression in PD will be
      randomized to the exercise intervention or a health education control intervention.
      Participants will be male and female Veterans with a physician diagnosis of idiopathic,
      typical PD, with at least 2 of 3 cardinal signs of PD, response to dopaminergic medication,
      and depression. The interventions will last 6 months.
