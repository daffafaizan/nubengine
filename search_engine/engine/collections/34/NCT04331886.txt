      enrolled following admission to the hospital. Participants will have de-identified medical
      records collected from hospital admission to discharge, including but not limited to critical
      care monitoring, details on mechanical ventilation, laboratory data, imaging reports,
      medications, and all procedures. Diagnosis and patient management will follow each hospital's
      standard of care and no specific treatments, procedures or laboratory tests will be dictated
      by enrollment in TARGET-COVID-19.
