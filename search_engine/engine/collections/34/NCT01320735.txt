      subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM). Duration of induction therapy was at least 6
      months (6-9 months) during which PSA and testosterone levels were measured every 3 months.
      When PSA decreased by greater than 90% from baseline (PSA less than 10 ng/ml) or became lower
      than 4.0 ng/ml (for 2 consecutive measurements made at least 2 weeks apart) the participants
      were included into intermittent hormone therapy regimen group (IAD). Participants with PSA
      decrease not achieved greater than 90% or less than or equal to 4.0 ng/ml were given either
      continuous hormone therapy (CAD) or chemotherapy.

      Therapy was stopped if participants had PSA decrease greater than 90% from baseline or values
      less than 4.0 ng/ml after 6-9 months of continuous hormone therapy. PSA and testosterone were
      measured every 4 weeks. If PSA became greater than or equal to 10.0 ng/ml, hormone therapy
      was resumed until PSA was less than 4.0 ng/ml for 2 consecutive measurements made at least 2
      weeks apart. Duration of hormonal therapy cycle was at least 3 months. Then intermittent
      treatment was performed according to a similar scheme. PSA and testosterone levels were
      determined every 12 weeks when hormone therapy was administered and every 4 weeks after it
      was stopped. The treatment was carried out for 2 years or until Hormone Refractory Prostate
      Cancer (HRPC) developed.
