    
      For this study, you will be asked to take part in a personal or mail interview. During the
      interview, you will be asked questions about your demographics (age, sex, etc.), any
      chemicals you may have been exposed to, your medical history, family history of cancer, your
      diet, and your smoking and alcohol use histories. It should take around 50 minutes to
      complete the interview. Treatment information from your medical records at M. D. Anderson
      will also be collected.

      You will be asked to provide a saliva sample or have around 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for
      special tests. These tests will look for biologic factors associated with treatment-related
      AML/MDS.

      Your participation in this study will be over once the interview has been completed and blood
      or saliva have been collected.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 600 participants will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
