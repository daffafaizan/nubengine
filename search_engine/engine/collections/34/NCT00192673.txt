    
      Asparaginase is used in the treatment of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia. Approximately 1/3
      of the patients develops blocking antibodies against native E.coli asparaginase during the
      second exposure, so that they do not benefit from treatment and thus may have a worse
      prognosis.

      PEG-asparaginase is less immunogenic so that fewer patients may develop antibodies during the
      second exposure.

      There is no published study about the antibody formation after treatment of children with
      PEG-asparaginase during two treatment courses.

      The first part of the study is a description of the pharmacokinetics of PEG-asparaginase
      after intramuscular administration in order to determine the correct dose.

      The second part of the study is a comparison of antibody formation during two treatment
      courses after intramuscular administration og native E.coli asparaginase and
      PEG-asparaginase.

      Other side effects than antibodies will be registered during treatment with PEG-asparaginase.
      Finally comparison of the 5-year EFS between the groups (native E.coli asparaginase and
      PEG-asparaginase as well as patients who have and have not developed antibodies) will be
      evaluated.
