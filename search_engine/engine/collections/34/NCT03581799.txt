      for a wide range of paediatric age groups. They also have a number of advantages over more
      frequently used formulation types, such as suspensions. Currently few Commercial products are
      available as ODTs for administration to children. Investigators aimed to investigate the
      palatability of an oral dispersible tablet with no pharmacologically active agent (carrier
      tablet) by assessing overall parent-reported, observer-reported and, where appropriate,
      child-reported acceptance of the formulation. In addition, investigators assessed the in situ
      disintegration behaviour of the carrier tablet.
