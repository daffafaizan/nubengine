      is divided. The sternum is held open throughout the surgery so that the doctors can reach the
      heart. Sternal wound infection is an uncommon but serious complication of cardiac surgery
      that occurs when an infection develops at this site of entry. Sternal wound infections are
      associated with increased hospital stays, subsequent surgical procedures, and higher
      mortality rates.

      The purpose of this research is to determine if using the antibiotic vancomycin as a
      preventative topical (on the surface of the skin) treatment during open-heart surgery will
      reduce the risk of developing a sternal wound infection. The results of this study could
      provide important information to guide new standards of practice in cardiac surgery. The
      ultimate goal of this research project is to improve patient care by reducing the number of
      sternal wound infections at our hospital.
