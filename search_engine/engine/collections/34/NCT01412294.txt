      evidence of SP on gastric cancer recurrence after adjuvant therapy by the same drug (S-1) is
      not established. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Capecitabine/Cisplatin (XP) for gastric cancer patients who relapsed after adjuvant
      chemotherapy by S-1.
