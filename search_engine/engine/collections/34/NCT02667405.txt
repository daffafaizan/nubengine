      patients with distal radius fracture (DRF) during a therapy visit. Patients with recently
      healed DRF are randomized into two groups, with one group receiving hot packs during therapy
      and the other immersing the arm in a whirlpool for 3 consecutive therapy visits.

      Measurements of wrist and forearm range of motion, and volume of the hand are recorded before
      and immediately after heat for each visit, effectively creating six measurement time points.
      Change scores are recorded for range of motion and for volume, and analyzed using MANOVA to
      determine differences between groups.
