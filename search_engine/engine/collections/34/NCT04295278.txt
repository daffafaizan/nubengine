      performance of multi-biomarker based prognostic and predictive algorithms to aid in the
      clinical management of pediatric critically-ill patients.

      All enrolled patients will undergo a series of blood collection procedures during their
      admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. The levels of inflammatory cytokines,
      chemokines, and effectors will be assessed and used in multi-biomarker based prognostic and
      predictive algorithms to determine patients at risk of in-hospital mortality.
