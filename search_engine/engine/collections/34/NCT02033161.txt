      functional dyspepsia (FD) and functional abdominal pain (FAP), are common in adolescents and
      associated with impaired quality of life. In adults with IBS, internet-delivered CBT leads to
      reduced symptoms and increased quality of life, but studies in children are lacking. This
      pilot-study aim to evaluate the treatment effects and feasibility of an internet-delivered
      CBT-program for adolescents with FGID.

      Method: Pilot study with a pre-post-design and no control group. The internet-delivered
      CBT-program lasted for 8 weeks and included weekly therapist support, consisting of online
      messages and telephone calls. Assessment points were baseline, post-treatment and 6 months
      follow-up.

      Analysis: Effect sizes and within-group differences were calculated in an intent-to-treat
      analysis using Cohens' d and Student's t-test.
