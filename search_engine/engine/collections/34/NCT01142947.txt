      control of patients with persistent asthma. Use of inhaled steroids has been associated with
      improved lung function, diminished symptoms, and fewer exacerbations. However studies show
      considerable inter-subject variability in ICS response. It has also been estimated that
      corticosteroid resistance accounts for half of all asthma-related health care costs.
      Therefore, identifying factors associated with ICS response is both clinical and economically
      important. African-American patients have been understudied with respect to genetic
      predictors of asthma controller medication response, and to date there have been no
      sufficiently powered genome-wide association studies of ICS treatment response among African
      American individuals with asthma. This issue is of particular importance, since
      African-American individuals are disproportionately affected by asthma-related complications.
      In this proposal, we seek to identify novel genetic loci associated with ICS treatment
      responsiveness (defined by the change in Asthma Control Test score) among African American
      individuals treated with beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) for 6 weeks. We will attempt to
      validate loci identified in the discovery set by 1) reassessing these variants for their
      interaction with ICS treatment on asthma exacerbations in a separate group of African
      American individuals with asthma, and 2) by reexamining the genetic association with change
      in asthma control among similarly treated (i.e., treatment with 6 weeks of BD) European
      Americans with asthma.
