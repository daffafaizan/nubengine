      hypothermia during surgery, besides, pediatric patients are more vulnerable in temperature
      control. Conventional core temperature is monitored at esophagus, rectum, nasopharynx. But
      some of them are invasive and impossible in sometimes. Recently developed 3M™ Bair Hugger™
      skin temperature which is applied on temporal artery is correlated with core temperature
      measured by esophageal prove in several studies. Its mechanism is making zero heat flux on
      skin applied. But it also cannot apply in head or facial surgery. Other studies showed
      conventional skin temperature over carotid artery is also correlated with core temperature.
      The investigators hypothesized using 3M™ Bair Hugger™ on carotid artery could be alternative
      method measuring core temperature. The purpose of this study is comparing 2 methods of
      temperature monitoring in pediatrics. First, conventional core temperature measure by
      esophageal stethoscope. Second, 3M™ Bair Hugger™ applying on carotid artery.
