      significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the investigators need to establish
      guidelines in order to treat these pathologies. Standard treatments such as surgery or
      interventional radiology are of limited efficacy and related to a high level of recurrences
      as well as complications. Recent preclinical studies have shown the important role of the
      PI3Kinase/AKT/mTor pathway on the development and the venous/lymphatic vascular organisations
      suggesting an appealing therapeutic target to treat patients with venous, lympathic or
      complex vascular malformations.

      Investigators will realize a multicentric phase III study enrolling a higher number of
      patients to statistically evaluate the efficacy and the safety of the Rapamycin, an mTOR
      inhibitor, in the treatment of children and adults with vascular malformations for which
      conventional therapies such as surgery or sclerotherapy are ineffective or associated with
      high risk of important complications. Nearly 250 patients (200 adults and 50 children) will
      be enrolled in several european centers.
