      Due to our experience with management of severely anemic patients for whom blood is not an
      option, we anticipate encountering future patients with life-threatening anemia for whom
      blood is not an option. Blood is not an option in the following circumstances:

        -  refusal of transfusion

        -  lack of compatible red blood cells due to alloimmunity

      All patients with life-threatening anemia for whom blood is not an option will be treated as
      per the standard procedure. If those measures are not successful and the life-threatening
      anemia persists, then at the investigator's discretion treatment with HBOC-201 will then be
      considered.
