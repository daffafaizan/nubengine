      enrolled in this randomized, multi-center study. Following satisfaction of entry criteria and
      screening procedures, subjects will be randomized to either 1.2%, 2.4%, or 3.6% facial cream
      (JNJ 10229570-AAA) or color-matched vehicle. Subjects will apply the study medication once
      daily on the face for 12 weeks. Safety will be monitored throughout the study duration.
      Efficacy will be assessed by facial lesion counts and by the investigator global evaluation
      of acne severity at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Approximately 50 subjects
      from one investigational site also will have serums collected at Weeks 6 and 12 for
      evaluation of the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of JNJ 10229570-AAA cream.
