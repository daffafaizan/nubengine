    
      This study will evaluate the ability of a single dose of a live attenuated recombinant
      tetravalent dengue vaccine (TetraVax-DV-TV003, referred to as TV003) to protect against
      infection with a controlled human infection strain of either DENV-2 (rDEN2Δ30-7169) or DENV-3
      (rDEN3Δ30) in adults 18 to 50 years of age with no history of previous flavivirus infection.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either TV003 or placebo at study entry (Day
      0) and either rDEN2Δ30-7169 or rDEN3Δ30 on Day 28.

      Study visits will occur on Days 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42,
      44, 49, 56, 84, 118, and 208. Visits may include a physical examination and blood collection.
