      researchers of any illness. Following a 12-hour overnight fast, children will consume a
      standardized breakfast of a cereal bar, fruit cup and orange juice at home (total 330 kcal).
      Children will be asked to avoid consumption of any other food, with the exception of water,
      until arrival at the laboratory 3 hours later.

      At the laboratory, five treatments of: (a) 2 whole eggs, (b) 2 egg whites, (c) 2 egg yolks,
      (d) full fat yogurt isocaloric to the 2 whole eggs, and (e) snack skipping will be provided
      to children 9-14 years on separate days at least 7 days apart. Cognitive performance,
      subjective emotion/mood, and subjective appetite will be measured for 90-minutes following
      snack consumption (n=25). Cognitive performance assessments will include learning and memory,
      spatial memory, attention and processing speed, and executive functions. In a subgroup of
      individuals (n=10), glucose, insulin, incretin hormones (glucagon like peptide1(GLP1) and
      gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)),dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), amino acids, fatty
      acids, and choline will be measured for 90-minutes following snack consumption.
