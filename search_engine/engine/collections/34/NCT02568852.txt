      combined (epidural and spinal) anesthesia (CA) for laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy(LC).Laparoscopic cholecystectomies are usually performed under general
      anesthesia. Studies involving cholecystectomies with regional anesthesia recently published.
      During regional anesthesia pneumoperitoneum is performed with lower pressure(10mmHg CO2).
      Patients can not tolerate higher intraabdominally pressure. Thera are very few studies
      involving the effect of pneumoperitoneum on coagulation factors. In our study the
      investigators separate the patients into 2 groups. Group1:10 mmHg pressure, laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy under general anesthesia ; Group2 : 10 mmHg pressure, laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy under Combined Spinal-Epidural Anesthesia The investigators performed
      standard conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure with 10mmHg pressure in both
      groups. The investigators aimed to investigate Prothrombin Time(PT), activated partial
      thromboplastin time(aPTT), thrombin time(TT), D-dimer and fibrinogen levels preoperative,
      postoperative 1st hour and 24th hour respectively.
