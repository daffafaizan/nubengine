      associated with tachyarrhythmia being resuscitated without successful defibrillatory shock.
      This together with the increasing availability of automated external defibrillators (AEDs),
      at increasingly attractive prices, led, in the past decade, to a strong emphasis on early
      defibrillation. This emphasis may have inadvertently resulted in a decreased emphasis on
      cardiopulmonary resuscitative techniques, particularly in light of publications decrying the
      uniformly poor quality of CPR performed by laymen, medical professionals, and even EMS
      personnel. However, recent research strongly suggests that assisted reperfusion prior to
      defibrillation may actually significantly improve survival rates. These reports, based on
      clinical studies, have received substantial confirmation from carefully controlled laboratory
      studies, particularly in pigs.

      If assisted reperfusion prior to defibrillation (and subsequent to failed shock) is
      important, it is reasonable to suppose that the benefit is related to quality of chest
      compressions. Observations of resuscitative efforts in the field indicate that maintaining
      compressions is one of the more difficult tasks, for a variety of reasons. Observations in
      the laboratory with trained paramedics show that the depth of compression and the compression
      rate diminish rapidly with time from the onset of CPR, without the participant being aware
      that his/her effort is actually diminished.

      The desire to provide consistent and quality compressions has led to the development of a
      mechanical compression assist device called the AutoPulse. It is a self-contained, portable
      chest compression device that is rapidly field deployable.
