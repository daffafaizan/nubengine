        1. to identify possible reasons for the different comfort and vision experience in Japanese
           CL wearers compared to Caucasian CL wearers and

        2. to assess whether the modification of lens thickness in the optical zone results in
           increased comfort and reduced visual acuity fluctuations in Caucasian eyes.
