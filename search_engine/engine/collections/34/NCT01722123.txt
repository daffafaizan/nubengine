      repeated choices are made. This phenomenon, in which people experience diminished
      concentration and willpower after repeated decision-making, is termed decision fatigue. (1)
      People experiencing decision fatigue are more likely to bias subsequent choices toward the
      status quo. By choosing the status quo, the decision-maker reserves the option to make an
      alternate choice at a later time, thereby preserving possibilities. Patients and their
      surrogates often make complex medical decisions for which they may have little experience.
      Although clearly at high risk, decision fatigue has not been studied this population. To
      elucidate these questions, we propose a four arm study of patients in a population at high
      risk for making complex decisions. Participants will be randomly assigned to varied levels of
      decision making effort to assess for the development of resultant decision fatigue and
      whether it alters subsequent decisions.
