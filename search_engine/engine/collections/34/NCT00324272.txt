      range of applications including the control of lymphatic leaks and haemostasis. The
      physiological mechanism of action of fibrin was first described by Morawitz in 1905; fibrin
      sealant was first marketed in 1983.

      Lymph node dissection is undertaken for the control of malignant disease - frequently
      malignant melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Following groin or axillary dissection,
      excessive post operative drainage may necessitate the presence of wound drains for 10 days or
      more. This may prolong hospital stay in some patients, and may be associated with an
      increased complication rate (such as wound infection).

      Hypothesis: the use of fibrin sealant prior to wound closure following either groin or
      axillary dissection may reduce post-operative wound drainage.

      Comparison: patients who require an elective groin or axillary dissection who either undergo
      standard wound closure or those who have fibrin sealant instilled into the surgical wound
      prior to wound closure.
