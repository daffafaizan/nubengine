      failure (QAF) and eccentric exercise has been shown to lessen muscle atrophy post-ACL
      reconstruction. Given thatthese are two critical components of quadriceps strength,
      intervention combining these therapies may be effective at reinstituting quadriceps function
      post-reconstruction. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      combined NMES and eccentric exercise intervention to improve the recovery of quadriceps
      activation and strength post-reconstruction. Patients post ACL-injury will be placed into
      four treatment groups (NMES and eccentrics; eccentrics only; NMES only, and standard of care)
      Patients assigned to the NMES and eccentric and the NMES only groups will receive the NMES
      protocol 2× per week for the first 6 weeks post-reconstruction. MES and eccentric and the
      eccentrics only groups will receive the eccentric exercise protocol 2× perweek beginning 6
      weeks post-reconstruction. Quadriceps activation was assessed via the superimposed burst
      technique and quantified via the central activation ratio.Quadriceps strength was assessed
      via maximal voluntary isomeric contractions (Nm/kg). Data will be gathered on three
      occasions: pre-operative, 12-weeks-post-surgery and at return-to-play.
