      regional hospitals (control group) in southern Taiwan. Both the experimental group and the
      control group will contain 150 healthcare professionals and 64 patients with dementia. Both
      of the groups will receive a six-hour dementia care course. Then, only the experimental group
      will receive a half-day interprofessional education workshop, maintain a six-month
      interprofessional practice model, and join interprofessional practice experience-sharing
      conferences. The evaluation of outcomes will include the analyses of healthcare
      professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy of dementia care. The evaluation times
      are to be before and after the dementia care course and after the six months of
      interprofessional practice. The other evaluation of outcome is comparison of the outcomes of
      hospitalized patients with dementia between the two groups before the interprofessional
      education workshop and after the interprofessional practice.
