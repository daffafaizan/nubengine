      implantation is considered to be the preferential treatment method as it restaures auditory
      function and enables language acquisition for communication purposes. When cochlear
      implantation is done before 2 and a half years old, better results are obtained in terms of
      language, communication and social developement, as well as reading skills. However when a
      cochlear implantation occurs between 2 and 5 years of age, speech and language skills do
      develop but communication and reading skills are altered. Therefore, when a cochlear implant
      is placed before the age of 2 and a half we find ourselves within the maximal cerebral
      plasticity window for speech, language and communication developement.

      This study is divided into two cohorts, the first aged 10-24 months and the second 3-7 years.
      All children will be seen for 5 sessions, spread out at regular intervals, over a period of
      18 months and will participate in two perceptual tasks and two cognitive tasks. The children
      will also have a speech and language assessment at T-0 and T+12. The cochlear implanted
      patients will continue to be seen by the ENT service and the sessions will be organised to
      coincide with their natural follow up. As it is a non-interventional study, no follow-up
      would be needed. After the study patients will continue to receive the same quality of care.
