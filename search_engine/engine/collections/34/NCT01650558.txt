    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, phase III trial of standard of care TS
      prophylaxis and CQ prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis in adults receiving ART. Adults who
      have been receiving ART for at least six months with a good clinical response and provide
      informed consent and fulfill the eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of three
      arms: (1) to continue standard of care trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) prophylaxis, (2)
      discontinue standard of care TS prophylaxis and begin weekly CQ prophylaxis or (3)
      discontinue standard of care TS prophylaxis. Participants will be asked to return to the
      research clinic every four weeks for the first 24 weeks then every 12 weeks thereafter, and
      any time they are ill to facilitate both active and passive follow-up of the study endpoints.
      Participation will last for 32 to approximately 66 months. Participants who develop a WHO
      clinical stage 3 or 4 illness, experience a sustained decline in their CD4 count below 200
      cells/mm3, or who experience ART failure will be placed on standard of care TS prophylaxis.
      Those with confirmed ART failure will be evaluated for second-line therapy according to the
      Malawi Ministry of Health guidelines.

      The study population will include up to 1500 Malawian adults aged 18 years or older living
      with HIV in or near Blantyre or Zomba, Malawi, Central Africa who have been receiving
      antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months with good clinical response to ART, have an
      undetectable HIV viral load and a CD4 count >250/mm3.
