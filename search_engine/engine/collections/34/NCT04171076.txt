      positive results along some studies. The use of non-invasive stimulation can be an
      alternative to stimulate the spinal corn. In this pilot trial, the investigators recruit
      participants with Parkinson' disease and freezing of gait. The aim of the study is to explore
      the safety along the non-invasive magnetic thoracic spinal cord stimulation as well the
      effect on gait problems, especially freezing of gait, prospectively, in an open-label
      fashion.
