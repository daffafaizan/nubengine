      diabetes. Other research reported that the 10-year incidence of diabetic macular edema was
      14% in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and progression to diabetic macular edema occurred
      in 29% of individuals with type 1 diabetes over 25 years if left untreated . Although
      diabetic macular edema resolves spontaneously in about 33% to 35% of patients, it tends to be
      chronic in most patients..Diabetic macular edema can occur at any stage of diabetic
      retinopathy . The symptoms of diabetic macular range from slight visual blurring to complete
      blindness if left untreated . Optical coherence tomography is an objective non-invasive
      method for high-resolution cross-sectional imaging of the retina .
