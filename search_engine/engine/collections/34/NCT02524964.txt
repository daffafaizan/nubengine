    
      The primary endpoint is to determine whether sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate could prevent LV
      remodeling among patients with completely reperfused AMI after PCI, detected by 6 month
      change in LVEDVi measured using cardiac MRI when compared to placebo.

      Secondary endpoints will include cardiac MRI measures of variations in microvascular
      obstruction, defect size, ventricular wall motion score, wall thickening, global LV ejection
      fraction, ventricular volumes (LV end-systolic/ diastolic volume) and myocardial perfusion
      during the same interval.

      Furthermore, the investigators will determine the variation (change from baseline) of
      biomarkers indicating myocardial fibrosis (PICP, PIIINP, ICTP and MMPs) and NT-ProBNP at 1
      and 6 months after AMI.

      Additional efficacy endpoints will include 6-minute walk test, New York Heart Association
      functional classification, Seattle Angina Questionnaire score and incidence of cardiovascular
      events (defined as cardiogenic death, stroke, recurrent myocardial infarction, readmission on
      account of deterioration of congestive heart failure or unstable angina, target vessel
      revascularization) at the 6-month follow-up will also be analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of
      sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate treatment.
