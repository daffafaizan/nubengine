    
      This is a single-center, randomized, comparator-controlled, double-blind study in healthy
      subjects. Forty subjects will be randomly assigned to 2 supplementation groups (n=20 per
      group). One group will consume 10 ml of Buglossoides oil daily and one group will consume 10
      ml of flax seed oil daily for a 4 week period. Baseline data will be obtained at week 0.
      Subjects will return to the clinic after 2 weeks and again after 4 weeks for measurement of
      safety and efficacy endpoints.

      The efficacy parameters are statistically significant changes from baseline and between
      groups in plasma, red blood cell and leukocyte omega-3 fatty acid content.

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be:

      Plasma EPA concentration expressed as μmol/L plasma.

      The secondary efficacy endpoints will be:

        1. Plasma 20:4n-3 and DPA individually as μmol/L;

        2. Plasma 20:4n-3, EPA and DPA individually as % of total fatty acids;

        3. Erythrocyte 20:4n-3, EPA and DPA individually as % of total fatty acids;

        4. Mononuclear cell 20:4n-3, EPA and DPA individually as % of total fatty acids;

        5. Neutrophil 20:4n-3, EPA and DPA individually as % of total fatty acids;

        6. The omega-3 index (defined as the sum of red blood cell EPA and DHA concentrations),
           expressed as % total fatty acids.

      Safety endpoints will be:

        1. fasting serum chemistry

        2. fasting hematology profile

        3. fasting blood lipid profile
