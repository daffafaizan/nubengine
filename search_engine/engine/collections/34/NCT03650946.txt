      to identify the extent of disease extent to deliver adequate treatment, either for primary
      staging or in recurrence. However, conventional imaging techniques including computed
      tomography, bone scintigraphy, and immunoscintigraphy with 111In-capromab pendetide are not
      sensitive or specific enough to detect metastatic or recurrent disease. Although more widely
      applied, magnetic resonance still relies on size and shape criteria. 68Ga-PSMA is a new novel
      positron emission radiotracer which several preliminary data has shown to be effective of
      detecting recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer. These studies are confined to a small
      retrospective European population. In this study we aim to synthesize the novel tracer, find
      the usefulness of 68Ga-PSMA PET in detecting prostate cancer, including primary staging and
      recurrence, explore the relationship between imaging and clinical parameters, and seek the
      possibility of 68Ga-PSMA PET to predict tumor nature and prognosis.
