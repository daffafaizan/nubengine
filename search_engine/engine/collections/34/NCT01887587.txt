      modified VXD regimen. The study drug, MLN9708, will be administered on day 1, 8, and 15. If
      the patient experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) the dose of MLN9708 maybe reduced to
      the next dose level on day 8 or day 15 in that patient. DLT would be any grade 3 or more
      toxicity which is thought to be probably or definitely related to MLN9708. Three patients
      will be treated per dose level unless DLT is observed. The starting dose of MLN9708 will be
      2.3 mg orally on days 1, 8 and 15. If toxicity is seen at this level then dose may be reduced
      to 1.5 mg (dose level -1) . If no DLT is seen in the first 3 patients, the dose will be
      increased to 3 mg and then to 4 mg orally on days 1, 8 and 15 in a classic 3 +3 phase I
      design. We will not attempt to increase the dose beyond 4 mg orally which, if achieved with
      acceptable toxicity, would be accepted as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 0 of 3 DLTs
      would allow escalation to the next dose level. 1 of 3 DLTs will require expanding to six
      patients; 1 of 6 DLTs will allow escalation again. 2 DLTs will require dose de-escalation.
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be the highest dose administered at which no more than
      1 DLT was observed. All patients will be evaluated for hematopoetic stem cell
      transplantation. If patients achieve complete response (CR) and are eligible for
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), they will proceed to HSCT. If they are not
      eligible, no donor is identified or if HSCT will be delayed, and the patient has achieved
      benefit, then treatment maybe repeated at the discretion of the investigator. A total of 9-18
      patients will be enrolled on the study. The study duration would be about 2 years.
