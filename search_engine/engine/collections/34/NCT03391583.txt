      mild traumatic brain injury. Headaches are often debilitating and can significantly impact a
      patient's ability to function and interact in society(Azulay et.al 2013).

      The provision of education to patients and primary care physicians is important. There is
      often not enough time during clinic appointments to ensure that patients understand the
      pathophysiology, treatment and red-flags of their post concussive symptoms. The question is
      asked as to whether educational material can be delivered in a consistent and comprehensible
      manner.

      The study will look at whether or not targeted headache education material presented to
      patients at multiple time points outside of the current standard of care is feasible and if
      there is any impact on symptom severity scores utilizing standardized surveys such as the
      Rivermead Post Concussion Questionnaire. A patient's frequency and type of social
      interactions during their recovery along with their perceived quality of life will be
      measured using the Participation Assessment with Recombined Tools-Objective (PART-O tool) and
      the Quality of Life after Brain Injury (Quolibri) tools respectively will be analyzed. By
      providing the basics of when to seek medical attention, the hope is be able to track what
      type and how frequently patients access medical treatment outside of the tertiary care clinic
      setting.

      The investigators would like to see whether this education model is feasible and can be used
      as a consistent message sent to patients as well as other health care professionals.
