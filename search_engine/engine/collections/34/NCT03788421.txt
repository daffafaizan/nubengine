      mortality are the lack of effective screening strategies, diagnosis at advanced stage of
      presentation as well as the high risk of recurrence. In the last years the Gynecologic
      Associations worldwide have recommended that total salpingectomy be considered for potential
      ovarian cancer risk reduction in benign gynecologic surgeries after completion of
      childbearing.

      However, the data are limit regarding the Preferred surgical technique during cesarean
      section.

      In this randomized controled trial the investigators will compare between various techniques
      for bilateral salpingectomy during cesarean section.

      Primary outcomes are total operative time and bilateral completion of the randomized
      procedure. Secondary outcomes included surgical complications and post operation
      complications.
