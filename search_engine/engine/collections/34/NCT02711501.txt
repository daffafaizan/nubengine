      bone loss before and at the time of implant placement. Primary closure of soft tissue is a
      prerequisite for successful bone augmentation procedures. Adequate flap advancement is a key
      factor for tension free primary wound closure. The tension free flap is usually attained by
      incising the buccal flap using scalpels. However, this procedure, especially in cases with
      major flap advancement, results in increased patient morbidity after surgery. Swelling and
      hemorrhage during the first week after surgery have a negative effect on patient's quality of
      life.

      Currently, lasers are widely used as a tool for soft tissue management and diode laser
      appears to be an effective tool for incision and excision of the soft tissue. The major
      advantageous property of lasers is ablation of tissue together with effective hemostasis,
      minimal swelling and virtually no pain.
