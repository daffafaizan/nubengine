    
      The study compare the rate of occurrence of lipoatrophy in ARVnaive HIV-1 infected patients
      receiving either a NRTI-sparing antiretroviral therapy with NRTI and boosted PI,or a standard
      antiretroviral therapy with 2 NRTI plus PI or NNRTI.

      Patients were randomized (2:1:1) to either PI+NNRTI (Gp1) or standard therapy, 2NRTI+ either
      PI (Gp2) or + NNRTI (Gp3). The study-treatment were lopinavir/r 100/400mg bid or indinavir/r
      100/400mg bid for PI-class, for NNRTI-class, efavirenz or nevirapine and all NRTIs except D4T
      and DDC at usual dosage.

      Lipoatrophy is evaluated by evolution of subcutaneous fat in the limbs measured by DEXA (Dual
      Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)and CT-scan of the thighs between baseline and W96.
