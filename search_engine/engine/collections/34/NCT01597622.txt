    
      This is a multicentre, continuation study of belimumab plus standard of care (SOC) in SLE
      subjects who completed the Phase III BEL113750 protocol in Northeast Asia or who completed
      the open-label extension of the HGS1006-C1115 protocol in Japan. This study provides subjects
      who complete the BEL113750 study the option of continuing treatment with belimumab (10 mg/kg
      intravenously every 4 weeks) for those randomized to belimumab, or the option to begin
      treatment with belimumab for those randomized to placebo, as an add-on to their SOC SLE
      therapy. Subjects participating in this continuation protocol will continue to be monitored
      for safety and efficacy, as measured by the SLE responder index. Subjects who complete 48
      weeks of treatment on the BEL113750 study and who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, and
      provide informed consent, will be given the option to enter the continuation study. All
      subjects will receive belimumab 10 mg/kg IV infused over 1 hour every 4 weeks. Subjects
      recruited into this study will continue to receive treatment with belimumab until such time
      as belimumab becomes commercially available in a subject's country of participation, or the
      subject elects to participate in another belimumab continuation study for SLE, or until
      either the subject's physician withdraws the subject from the study, or upon the decision by
      the sponsor to discontinue further development of belimumab for SLE.
