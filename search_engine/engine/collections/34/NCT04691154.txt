      safety and tolerability of repeated doses of L606 in patients with PAH switching from a
      stable Tyvaso dose. The current Phase 3 study will help determine the short-term and
      long-term safety and tolerability of L606 in this patient population. The study will also
      evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of L606 as compared to Tyvaso, effects on
      exercise ability (6-minute walk distance [6MWD] and Borg Dyspnea Score), quality of life
      (QoL), and treatment satisfaction with L606 in patients with PAH. Part 1 of the study is
      short-term (2-week) evaluation of L606 in patients with PAH. Part 2 of the study will
      continue to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of L606 in patients with PAH. Results of
      Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will be presented in separate clinical study reports and
      clinical study report of Part 1 of the study will be submitted as part of new drug
      application.
