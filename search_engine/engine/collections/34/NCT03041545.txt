      activity levels typically decline throughout treatment. Existing research has primarily
      relied on self-reported activity levels and only captured periodic snap shots or
      retrospective reports of activity levels, which are subject to recall bias. Exactly how
      activity levels change throughout chemotherapy is not known. This study will provide
      minute-by-minute level objective physical activity data across the entirety of the patient's
      chemotherapy treatments. This in depth data will provide a new perspective on the patterns of
      activity levels and help to identify if there are critical times in which to intervene to
      prevent declines in physical activity.

      The investigators will assess the feasibility of the pre-treatment recruitment by documenting
      recruitment rates and participant acceptance of wearing the accelerometer.
