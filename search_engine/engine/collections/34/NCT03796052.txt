      redness, itchiness, and hyperpigmentation. Dry skin and itching are especially common for
      those undergoing chemotherapy and targeted treatments.

      Skincare products containing Avena sativa (oat) kernel flour have a long history of tolerance
      and efficacy in treating various skin conditions involving pruritus (itching) and xerosis
      (dry skin), as Avena sativa (oat) kernel flour is known for its skin protectant properties
      and soothing effects on skin. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a regimen
      of three topical agents containing Avena sativa (oat) kernel flour for cancer patients
      experiencing mild to moderate pruritus and/or xerosis.

      Participants will received the products at Baseline (Visit 1) and return to the clinical site
      at Week 5 +/- 1 week for Visit 2. In addition, questionnaires will be completed remotely
      between Baseline and Visit 2.
