      symptoms and air-ï¬‚ow limitation. Dyspnea is related with daily life activity. COPD patients
      often suffer from dyspnea and exacerbation, which leads to inactivity, deconditioning, and
      poor functional capacity and quality of life. Several interventions have been investigated
      with the aim of improving lung function, decreasing dyspnea symptoms and improving quality of
      life in this patient.

      Tai Chi, an exercise involving both upper and lower extremities, originated from China. Tai
      chi is characterized by posture alignment, weight shifting and circular movements that
      incorporate elements of muscle endurance and strengthening, balance, relaxation and breathing
      control. Among previous studies Tai Chi in pulmonary rehabilitation showed a modest
      complementary benefit in exercise capacity.

      The Tai Chi program is a safe, effective and feasible method to improve exercise capacity and
      health-related quality of life in people with COPD. Short form sun style Tai chi is one of
      the most common styles of t'ai chi. each form can be broken down into several movements which
      make it easy to learn and teach. Compared to some other styles of t'ai chi, SSTC involves
      less difficult movements, such as less deep-knee bending and single leg standing, which may
      make it more suitable for older people.

      Qi Gong is defined as a mind-body exercise that involves whole body movements, breathing
      techniques, postural control, and internal awareness.

      effects of Qi Gong on functional capacity and lung functions in COPD patients , and concluded
      that functional capacity, dyspnea scores and quality of life was significantly improved in
      mild to moderate COPD patients.
