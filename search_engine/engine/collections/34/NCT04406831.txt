        1. To obtain serum samples from patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer at baseline
           before treatment and monthly throughout treatment.

        2. To analyze the miRNA profiles present at each time point.

        3. To determine miRNAs that may distinguish pancreatic patients from unaffected
           individuals. This could be developed into a diagnostic test.

        4. To determine miRNAs whose levels correlate with treatment response, both in patients
           with and without elevations in the serum tumor marker CA 19-9.
