      micronutrient status of VLBW infants who are fed human milk (maternal or donor) supplemented
      with a human-milk-based fortifier with increased protein (Medolac® Human Milk Fortifier). In
      addition, the investigators will compare the findings to retrospectively collected data for
      growth rates and micronutrient status of infants who received human milk fortified with cow's
      milk -based fortifier (Enfamil® Hydrolyzed Liquid Human Milk Fortifier). The investigators
      hypothesize that a human milk-based fortifier with increased protein will support growth at
      recommended levels (weight gain of 12-18 g/kg/day, head circumference 0.75-1.0 cm/week,
      length 0.8-1.1 cm/week)[1-3] and prevent micronutrient deficiency in the VLBW infant

      Aim 1: To determine if VLBW infants fed human milk, maternal or donor, supplemented with a
      human milk-based fortifier with increased protein grow at recommended levels for weight,
      length, and head circumference. To achieve this aim, Z-scores for weight, length, and head
      circumference will be tracked. Measurements will be taken at birth and then weekly until 36
      weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) or discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU),
      whichever comes first. Aim 2: To measure nutritional status in VLBW premature infants fed
      human milk supplemented with a human milk-based fortifier with increased protein. To achieve
      this aim, serum magnesium, potassium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine,
      sodium, calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Vitamin D 1, 25 (OH) 2D, parathyroid hormone (PTH),
      alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, hematocrit will be measured within 24 hours of reaching
      full enteral feedings and repeated seven days later, and then every fourteen days until 36
      weeks PMA or discharge, whichever comes first. Urine magnesium and sodium will be measured on
      the same schedule.

      Aim 3: To compare growth rates and nutritional status of VLBW infants fed human milk
      fortified with a human milk-based fortifier to growth rates and nutritional status of those
      fed human milk fortified with a cow's milk-based fortifier.
