    
      This is a pilot study of a carefully-designed dietary intervention that aims to help overcome
      obstacles to diet research in MS as well as provide needed preliminary data for future
      clinical trials. It incorporates elements with suggested benefits for MS including foods high
      in polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxidants, and excludes those that are
      potentially detrimental such as dairy and saturated fat from meat, refined sugars, and also
      limits salt content.

      The 15 participants randomized to the dietary intervention arm will undergo intensive
      training with a nutritionist and the PI regarding the mechanics of the diet. Menu
      suggestions, recipes, and grocery lists will be provided. This will be followed by regular
      meetings and contact with all study participants by e-mail and phone to maximize dietary
      adherence. The 15 subjects not in the dietary intervention group will have regular meetings
      at the center with a focus on wellness in MS in general. Adherence to the diet will be
      assessed through the use of multiple validated dietary questionnaires as well as through
      biological specimen analysis. Feedback will be requested to provide valuable advice from
      participants that can be applied to future clinical trials. Effects on general health and
      wellness outcomes such as BMI, lipid profile, fasting glucose, hemoglobin a1c, blood
      pressure, as well as effects on fatigue and cognition will be explored. Fecal specimens for
      microbiota analysis and blood samples for immunological profiling will be collected and
      stored for future analysis to help elucidate potential mechanisms for dietary effects.
