    
      Phase 1, single center, open label, multiple-dose study consisting of a screening period
      followed by four weeks of treatment. At least 12 male and female patients, 10 years of age or
      older, with sickle cell disease but otherwise healthy, will be enrolled in the study.

      PK measurements include plasma concentrations of L-citrulline, L-arginine, L-ornithine, and
      L-proline following the first dose of orally administered L-citrulline and after four weeks
      of twice daily administration of the drug.

      PD measurements include intercellular and vascular adhesion molecules (ICAM, VCAM, and
      E-selectin), surrogate markers of sickle cell disease activity, and PAT, a measurement of
      vascular function.
