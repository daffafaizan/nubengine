      program allocated to treatment with either a self-ligating bracket system (Damon Q-slot
      0.022", Ormco Corp,) or a conventional bracket system (Orthos-slot 0.022", Ormco Corp). All
      patients were treated following the same protocol and arch wire sequence: 0.014-inch,
      0.018-inch and 0.014x0.025-inch Damon copper nickel-titanium arch wires (Cu-NiTi; Ormco).
      Lateral cephalograms and study models, taken at prior to treatment (T0) and after alignment
      and levelling (T1), were used to compare the amount of arch expansion and incisor angulation
      changes that took place. In the analysis of results in a single observer analyzes the data
      blindly without knowing which group the patients belonged. Results: Models and cephalograms
      of the patients and both stages(T0-T1) were measured at the data were analyzed in STATA S.E.
      Treatment produce statistically significant increases in transverse arch dimensions
      especially in premolars maxillary (2.8-4.3mm) and mandibullary (2.0-4.2mm) of both group. The
      expansion in the maxillary arch was similar for both groups, but in the mandibular arch was
      greater in the self ligation group in about 2 mm more. Conclusions: The treatment with self
      ligation brackets produced more expansion in the mandibular arch than the conventional
      ligation brackets when used the same arch Damon protocols.
