      predictor or outcome tool to determine who will best benefit from chemotherapy prior to
      surgery. This can be used to determine if Mammostrat assay may be used as a clinical marker
      to identify a subset of women with breast cancer who do not benefit from preoperative
      chemotherapy, either taxane/taxane-like (T) chemo agents or anthracycline-based chemotherapy
      and cyclophosphamide (AC).
