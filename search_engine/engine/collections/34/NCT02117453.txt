      ANCA-associated systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Since statins lower levels of inflammatory
      proteins and cholesterol, we hypothesized that people with ANCA-associated systemic
      necrotizing vasculitis but without indication for statin treatment according to
      recommandations might benefit from statin treatment.
