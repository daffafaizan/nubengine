      steroid injections after lumbar radiculopathy in the many a pain clinic. In this procedure
      corticosteroids and local anesthetics were given to the epidural space with
      fluoroscopy-guided special techniques. The underlying mechanism of action of these epidurally
      administered medications is not clear and Ä±t is believed to be due to anti-inflammatory
      properties of corticosteroids. In addition local anesthetics is thought to be as effective as
      corticosteroids in spinal pain of various origin. So far, many studies have shown the
      efficacy of these injections in acute/chronic pain of cervical radiculopathy. Although mixed
      pain is seen in most of patients, the relationship between pain pattern and treatment
      response is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the treatment responses of the patients who
      were diagnosed with neuropathic pain and the patients who weren't by means of LANSS. It is
      also intended to serach whether the presence of neuropathic pain will help to predict the
      treatment response or not. In this regard, the patients were evaluated with LANSS, SF-12 and
      neck pain and disability scale before the procedure. Categorized as the patients with
      neuropathic pain and the patients without, their treatment responses were compared.
