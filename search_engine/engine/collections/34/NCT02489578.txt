    
      In China, the data about current management of patients hospitalized with CAP in the
      real-life setting is not available,type of pneumonia, selection of initial antibiotic, time
      to clinical stability, antibiotic choice anf modification,clinical outcomes and costs remain
      unclear.

      In this study, we will collect comprehensive information on CAP and HCAP management patterns
      to evaluate the disease burden of hospitalized patients with CAP and HCAP in real life of
      China .to analyze microbiological characteristics,clinical manifestations,antibiotic regimens
      ,adherences to guidelines and effect on outcome in different groups of patients with CAP (>
      and = 65 years, different comorbidities ,risk factors) ,to investigate microbiological
      characteristics,clinical manifestations,antibiotic regimens ,adherences to guidelines and
      effect on outcome in different groups of disease severity with CAP ,to provide the difference
      on microbiological characteristics,clinical manifestations,antibiotic regimens ,and outcome
      between patients with CAP and HCAP ,to understand the current situation of antibiotic regimen
      ,to evaluate influence of different antibiotic regimens on prognosis.
