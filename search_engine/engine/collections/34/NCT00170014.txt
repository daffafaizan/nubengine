      possible clinical applications of the device. Leder et al saw the need for investigating the
      reproducibility of High Temperature Superconducting (HTS-)MCG measurements. They tested 18
      healthy volunteers, stating that assessment of the reproducibility of HTS-MCGs in the normal
      heart is a prerequisite condition for the definition of significant levels of changes which,
      for instance, may be observed in serial measurements of patients suffering from acute
      coronary syndromes. They also pointed out the potentially strong electromagnetic interference
      inside a hospital, likely to be very different from the noise found in engineering
      laboratories where the MCGs are originally calibrated and tested. A respectable
      reproducibility for the MCG measurements is crucial for clinical applications. Leder et al
      studied the reproducibility of QRS complexes, ST segments, and T waves. They found that the
      reproducibility of the measurements in the depolarization phase was high, whereas the
      reproducibility of their repolarization readings was considerably lower. The results led
      Leder et al to conclude that further technical development was needed to improve
      signal-to-noise ratio allowing for clinical application of repolarization abnormalities for
      recognizing Acute Coronary Syndromes. In this study, we will focus on the repolarization
      phase by assessing the reproducibility of the T wave only. Comparison of scores and results
      based on computer analyses will provide the basis for our evaluation. Visual interpretations
      by the two examiners will also be compared.
