      Part I is designed to compare the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
      of the fixed-dose combinations of gemigliptin/metformin HCl sustained release 50/1000 mg
      (25/500 mg x 2 tablets) in comparison to each component gemigliptin 50 mg and metformin HCl
      extended release 1000 mg (500mg x 2 tablets) under fasting condition.

      of the fixed-dose combinations of gemigliptin/metformin HCl sustained release 50/1000 mg
      (25/500 mg x 2 tablets) in comparison to each component gemigliptin 50 mg and metformin HCl
      extended release 1000 mg (500mg x 2 tablets) under fed conditions.
