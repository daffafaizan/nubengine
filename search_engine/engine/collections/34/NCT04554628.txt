    
      All patients will be clinically evaluated for demographic and clinical data. Severity of
      injury and number of surgical interventions will be evaluated using the simplified
      Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-28) and the extent of impact of associated
      diseases on patients' physiological and body organs' functions will be evaluated using the
      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure
      assessment (SOFA) . Higher scores indicate more severe illness and for the TISS-28 score,
      each therapeutic intervention will be assigned 1 to 4 points, and the points will be summed
      daily to obtain the overall score and higher score indicates a higher number of therapeutic
      interventions.

      Diagnosis of AKI Development of AKI within the first 48 hours after ICU admission and its
      staging will be defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria. Each stage
      will be defined by the extent of change in serum creatinine level (∆SCr) as follows: Mild if
      Scr was increased by ≥0.3 mg/ml or ∆SCr was ≥1.5-2-fold from baseline, Moderate if ∆SCr was
      >2-3-fold from baseline and Severe if ∆SCr was increase by >3-fold from baseline .

      Laboratory investigations Blood samples will be sent for estimation of serum creatinine (SCr)
      . Urine samples will be sent for spot creatinine , UNGAL, KIM1.
