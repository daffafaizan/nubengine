      always present in conditions that are ideal for immediate diagnosis, which sometimes
      compromises outcome. Physical examination, laboratory findings and radiography are imperfect,
      resulting in a need for sophisticated test results that delay management.

      Lung ultrasonography is becoming a standard tool in critical cases in the ED.

      the investigators aim to perform ultrasonography on consecutive patients admitted to the ICU
      with dyspnea, comparing lung ultrasonography results on initial presentation with the final
      diagnosis by the ICU team.

      Three items were assessed: artifacts (horizontal A lines or vertical B lines indicating
      interstitial syndrome), lung sliding, and alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion,
      these items were grouped to assess ultrasound profiles.

      This study assesses the potential of lung ultrasonography to diagnose heart failure.
