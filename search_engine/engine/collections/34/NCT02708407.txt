    
      The trial is a multi-centre, prospective, randomised, unblended, controlled trial of
      intermittent PD with a single daily exchange of icodextrin plus best standard care versus
      best standard care for the treatment of severe HF and moderate CKD. A second exchange with
      glucose based solution may be given, should it be required in the investigator's/clinician's
      opinion. Investigators will randomise 130 participants for 32 weeks with randomisation
      stratified by participating centre. Participants will be recruited from specialist-led
      outpatient HF services in 6 NHS trusts and be managed by both cardiologists and
      nephrologists.

      PD catheter insertion will occur according to the participating centre's institutional
      protocol. Treatment begins 1 week after catheter insertion and consists of a single nightly
      exchange.
