      using an insulin pump, and have a hemoglobin A1c level between 7.0% and 10.0%. You will not

      period. Continuous blood glucose monitoring will be performed on three occasions during the
      study.

      Pramlintide will be begun at a single basal rate of 1.5 units/hr. Bolus therapy will be begun
      thereafter per standard manufacturer protocol. Subjects will be monitored for three months on
      basal-bolus pramlintide therapy.
