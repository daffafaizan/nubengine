    
      Determine a bleeding threshold by measuring the blood volume in ml / kg / h collected in the
      drainage system to define moderate bleeding postoperative cardiac surgery and define the
      population.

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the kinetics of moderate SPORT and its impact on anemia and postoperative
      transfusion.

      To evaluate the prognostic impact of the SPO moderate in terms of post-operative
      complications.

      Determine predictors of moderate SPO.
