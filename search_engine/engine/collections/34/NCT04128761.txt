      scores, SES, age, and sex. Based on 8 years of experience recruiting alcohol users into
      studies of comparable length and complexity, 82% of consented participants are anticipated to
      be eligible (i.e., randomized) and 89% of those individuals will complete Aim 1b. Thus, to
      achieve a final sample size of 64, 88 participants will be consented. Participants will
      complete: a baseline assessment (S1), an alcohol self-administration session (S2/S3), and an
      fMRI session (S2/S3). The alcohol self-administration session and the fMRI session will be
      completed in a counterbalanced order and in the presence of assigned narratives (i.e.,
      scarcity or neutral). Participants will be assigned to the scarcity or neutral narrative
      groups. Participants in both groups will be instructed to read the assigned narrative,
      consider it for 15 seconds and vividly imagine that this narrative applies to them.

      Next, participants will complete the primary and secondary outcome measures (e.g., in the
      presence of these narratives complete assessments of delay discounting and alcohol valuation
      and then proceed to the alcohol self-administration or fMRI session, as counterbalanced).
      Participants will also complete assessments of their stress and mood response to the
      narrative intervention, using the Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM) and PANAS for two purposes.
      That is, 1) to monitor participant safety, 2) to measure the mediating ability of affect on
      changes in the temporal window. During all assessments of S2 and S3, text and/or audio
      prompts of the narratives will be presented.
