      number of factors. These interactions have been implicated in protecting malignant
      hematopoietic cells from spontaneous apoptosis and genotoxic stresses such as chemotherapy.
      Key elements are CXCR4, which is expressed on normal stem cells and leukemic blasts, and its
      ligand, stromal derived factor 1 (SDF-1) expressed by bone marrow stromal cells and
      osteoblasts. The CXCR4/SDF-1 axis is essential for homing, retention and mobilization of stem
      cells from the bone marrow microenvironment. Plerixafor is a bicyclam small molecule
      inhibitor of CXCR4 and has been extensively studied by our group and others as a potent stem
      cell mobilization agent both in combination with G-CSF or alone (25, 62). Plerixafor is
      currently being investigated in a phase I/II trial in combination with salvage chemotherapy
      for relapsed AML in an attempt to sensitize leukemia stem cells to chemotherapy. The goal of
      this study is to determine the optimal dose of plerixafor for the treatment of patients with
      high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in combination with G-CSF and azacitidine. We
      hypothesize that plerixafor in combination with G-CSF will detach MDS blasts from the bone
      marrow microenvironment resulting in their increased proliferation and sensitivity to
      azacitidine; thus, improving complete and partial response rates (CR/PR).
