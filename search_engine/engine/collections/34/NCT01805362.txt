    
      Rational:

      Serum aldosterone levels may increase despite blockade of the renin angiotensin system (RAS)
      with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).
      This aldosterone breakthrough might be associated with bad outcomes: left ventricular
      hypertrophy, proteinuria and progression of renal failure. Antihypertensive drugs are given
      either on awaking or at bedtime. RAS is stimulated during nighttime. RAS blockers and
      diuretics given on awaking may stimulate aldosterone synthesis, and favor aldosterone
      breakthrough.

      Objective:

      To show that the frequency of aldosterone breakthrough is lower when RAS blockers are given
      at bedtime compared to on awaking, and to analyze the determinants and consequences of
      aldosterone breakthrough.

      Duration of the study: Inclusion 2 years, follow-up one year, total 3 years

      Design: prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open label, two parallel groups.
