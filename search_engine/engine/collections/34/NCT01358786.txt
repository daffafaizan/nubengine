      breast reconstruction. Forty-eight breast reconstructions were performed using the bipedicled
      TRAM flap. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups of 16 participants each: DN
      group, use of suction drains but no quilting sutures between the remaining abdominal flap and
      musculoaponeurotic layer of the anterior abdominal wall; QS+DN group, use of quilting sutures
      and suction drains; and QS group, use of quilting sutures but no suction drains. In order to
      determine seroma formation, ultrasound examinations were performed on postoperative days 7
      and 14 in 5 regions of the abdominal wall: epigastric, umbilical, hypogastric, right iliac,
      and left iliac regions.
