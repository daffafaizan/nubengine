    
      This is a Phase I, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over pharmacokinetic study designed to
      investigate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene alters the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of a standard regimen of epirubicin and/or it's principle metabolite,
      epirubicinol and cyclophosphamide. The plasma pharmacokinetics of epirubicin/epirubicinol and
      cyclophosphamide when given alone or concurrently with tesmilifene will be examined. Safety
      information for the tesmilifene/ epirubicin and cyclophosphamide combination and for
      epirubicin and cyclophosphamide alone in this patient population will also be collected.
