      HLAantibody (Ab) levels was conducted in five phases differing in bortezomib dosing density
      and plasmapheresis timing. Phases included 1 or 2 bortezomib cycles (1.3mg/m2,6-8 doses), one
      rituximab dose and plasmapheresis. HLA Abs were measured by solid phase and flow cytometry
      (FCM) assays. Immunodominant Ab (iAb) was defined as highest HLA Ab level. Forty-four
      patients received 52 desensitization courses (7 patients enrolled in multiple phases): Phase
      1 (n=20), Phase 2 (n=12), Phase 3 (n=10), Phase 4 (n=5), Phase 5 (n=5).
