      study. In the first stage, subjects who are at least 12 years of age and not more than 16.9
      years (16 years and 11 months) of age with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be
      treated with DFD-06 (at least 20 completed subjects). In the second stage subjects who are at
      least 6 years of age and not more than 11.9 years (11 years and 11 months) of age with
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be treated with DFD-06 (at least 20 completed
      subjects). An attempt will be made to enroll subjects throughout the age range of each cohort
      including the lower age range. DFD-06 will be applied twice daily to all affected areas on
      the body excluding face, scalp, groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas. Subjects must
      have â‰¥10% Body Surface Area (BSA) treated to achieve maximal use exposure.
