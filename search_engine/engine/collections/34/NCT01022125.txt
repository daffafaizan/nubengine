    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all people involved know
      the identity of the intervention), single dose, crossover (volunteers will receive different
      interventions sequentially during the trial) study in healthy volunteers. The trial will
      evaluate the levels of TMC435 in the blood circulation after a single dose of 150 mg TMC435
      as a capsule formulation taken fasted (Treatment A) and following a meal (Treatment B). In
      addition, the study will evaluate the levels of TMC435 in the blood circulation after intake
      of a single dose of 150 mg TMC435 as 2 different tablet formulations (Treatments C and D).
      There will be a 14-day washout period between treatments and a 4-5 week follow-up at the end.
      Each volunteer will receive all four treatments. The main focus of the trial is the
      pharmacokinetic characteristics (how drugs are absorbed in the body, how they are distributed
      within the body and how they are removed from the body over time) of the different
      formulations. This evaluation requires multiple blood samples from Day 1 through 72 hours
      after dosing. Safety assessments (lab work, blood pressure, pulse and electrocardiogram) will
      follow a different schedule and are measured on Day -1 (day prior to taking first dose of
      drug), Day 1 (day of first dosing) and/or Day 4 of each treatment period, and 4 weeks after
      the last treatment. Each volunteer will receive 4 treatments, about 14 days apart from each
      other. Each treatment consists of one single dose of 150 mg TMC435.
