      Primary

        -  To ascertain the safety of donor natural killer (NK) cells, generated from peripheral
           blood hematopoietic stem cells, when given as a single intravenous infusion in patients
           who have undergone HLA-haploidentical familial donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of donor NK cells when given as a single
           infusion.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effectiveness of donor NK cell infusion in preventing tumor relapse and
           graft failure after HLA-haploidentical familial donor BMT.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive donor natural killer cells as a single infusion over 1 hour.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of natural killer cells until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6
      patients experience grade III toxicities or acute graft-vs-host disease.
