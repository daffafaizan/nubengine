      can lead to lung damage, esophageal ulcers, or esophageal cancer. Children and adults whose
      asthma is poorly controlled with inhaled corticosteroids are often prescribed drugs that
      suppress gastric acid production; however, this treatment is expensive and has not been
      proven beneficial. Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor medication that reduces stomach
      acid production. It may also decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations in children with
      poorly controlled asthma. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      lansoprazole at improving asthma control, quality of life, and lung function in children with
      asthma.

      This study will enroll children with poor asthma control who are receiving inhaled
      corticosteroids. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either lansoprazole or
      placebo on a daily basis for 6 months. Study visits will occur at baseline and Weeks 4, 8,
      12, 16, 20, and 24, and participants will be contacted by telephone at Week 2. A physical
      examination, blood collection, and methacholine challenge test will occur at selected visits.
      The methacholine challenge test will be used to help determine the severity of an
      individual's asthma. Lung function and airway pressure testing, questionnaires on asthma
      control and quality of life, medical history review, pill counts, and distribution of
      medication will occur at most study visits. Participants will record asthma symptoms and lung
      function in a daily diary throughout the study. A select group of participants will also wear
      an esophageal potential Hydrogen (pH) monitor for 24 hours to evaluate GERD symptoms and the
      relationship between GERD and asthma symptoms.
