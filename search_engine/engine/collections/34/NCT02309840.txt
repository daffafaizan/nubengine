      by the nonprofit organization Project Bread (www.ProjectBread.org) and the Harvard School of
      Public Health. Project Bread hired a professional chef to work with several schools in a
      low-income, urban school district in Massachusetts to enhance the palatability and nutrient
      profile of the school meals. Four schools were randomly assigned to receive the professional
      chef. Additionally, two schools in that district and four schools in a second school district
      were randomly assigned to receive a behavioral psychology intervention to influence the
      selection and consumption of the healthier foods offered. Selection and consumption were
      assessed at baseline, up to 3 months post-implementation (short-term implementation for
      chef-enhanced meals), up to 4 months post-implementation (long-term implementation for
      behavioral psychology) and/or up to 7 months post-implementation (long-term implementation
      for chef-enhanced meals).

      Primary Aim 1: to examine the impact of introducing healthier, chef-enhanced foods with
      increased palatability on selection and consumption among elementary and middle school
      students. It is hypothesized that there will be an increase in the selection and consumption
      of entrees, fruits, and vegetables in schools where healthier, chef-enhanced foods are
      served.

      Aim 2: to examine the impact of physical modifications to the placement and displays of foods
      in the cafeteria on selection/consumption among elementary and middle school students. It is
      hypothesized that there will be an increase in selection and consumption of entrees, milk,
      fruits, and vegetables when modifications are made.
