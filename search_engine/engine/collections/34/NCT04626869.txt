      important side effect is diaphragm paralysis due to the phrenic nerve being affected. It may
      cause symptomatic dyspnea, especially in patients with limited respiratory capacity. More
      distal brachial plexus blocks have been defined to avoid diaphragmatic paralysis . Thus, it
      is aimed to apply the local anesthetic drug further from the phrenic nerve. With the
      application of ultrasound, the amount of local anesthetic drug was reduced to less than 20
      ml.

      There are studies showing that an effective analgesia, as much as the interscalene block can
      do, can be provided by blocking the suprascapular nerve in the neck region. Although it has
      been shown in a cadaver study that the phrenic nerve can be stained after anterior
      suprascapular nerve block, the clinical effect is not fully known.

      The effect of continuous local anesthetic drug administration on respiratory muscles through
      catheters placed in the peripheral nerve is another matter of concern. The method that will
      not affect the phrenic nerve at all and at the same time provide an effective analgesia is
      still under investigation.

      The aim of our study is to show that the anterior suprascapular block applied with ultra-low
      volume (5ml) in shoulder arthroscopy operations is at least as effective as the interscalene
      block and does not cause diaphragm paralysis. One of the questions that our research aims to
      answer is how the continuous application of local anesthetic drugs affects the diaphragm
      muscle with the insertion of catheters in both regions.
