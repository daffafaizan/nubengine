      lesions. The disorder involves problematic timing, sequence, and spatial organization of
      gestured movements. As a result, patients suffer from incorrect temporal and spatial
      components to movements as evidenced during pantomime of transitive and intransitive
      movements. The errors can be seen in left and right hemisphere damaged patients during
      intransitive movements, but lesions predominate in the left hemisphere for inability to
      pantomime transitive movements. Thus far, damage to parietofrontal circuits has been
      implicated in significantly contributing to this disorder. These circuits, which pave the way
      for sensorimotor processing, are of clear interest in the nature of praxis.

      In the present study, we plan to evaluate further the parietofrontal circuits in these
      patients. Using EEG, we will analyze the movement related cortical potentials (MRCP) in these
      patients compared to controls to evaluate any cortical planning differences. We will analyze
      how the circuits play a role in transitive and intransitive movements in normal subjects and
      patients with Ideomotor apraxia. Each patient will make a series of movement during 64
      channel EEG and EMG recordings. Following recordings, analysis will be made of the event
      related desynchronization (ERD) and the MRCP. Further analysis will look at the activation of
      the parietofrontal circuitry in patients using correlation and coherence methods. For the
      same purposes, MEG studies will be performed to assess similar measures.
