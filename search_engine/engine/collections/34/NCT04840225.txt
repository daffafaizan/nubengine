      patients with bacterial endocarditis (IE), anemia has a prevalence of 55-80%. In a sub-study
      to our POET I trial (RCT with 400 patients with IE, published in NEJM 2019), preliminary data
      show a 5-fold increased risk of death within 6 months and 2-fold increased risk after 3
      years, in non-surgically treated patients with hemoglobin <6.2mmol/L, compared to patients
      with no or mild anemia. Intensified treatment of anemia through e.g. intravenous iron
      infusions, in combination with erythrocyte stimulating agents or new treatments for anemia of
      inflammation, such as IL-6 inhibitors, could possibly improve outcome for patients with IE.

      This study - ANIE - is a prospective study, aiming at further deep-characterizing of anemia
      in patients with IE, and associated outcomes. Degree of anemia of inflammation (AI) and
      iron-deficiency anemia during hospitalization and time to recovery will be assessed. Blood
      samples from 100 patients with IE will be collected during hospitalization and 3 months after
      discharge, i.e. also during expected recovery. Samples will be analyzed for standard markers
      of anemia and inflammation, as well as novel biomarkers for AI, such as IL-6, soluble
      transferrin receptor, erythroferrone and hepcidin. The sample size calculation is based on
      the assumption that the prevalence of AI is 50%, with a confidence interval of 95% and a
      margin of error of <10%. Comparisons will be made to patients with other infections and
      patients with pure inflammation (TAVI and TEVAR patients) and healthy blood donors.

      ANIE is expected to give us an unprecedented insight into disease processes, stages and
      possible therapeutic targets for anemia in patients with IE.

      The results will serve for designing the clinical trial of novel interventions to treat
      anemia in patients with IE, as a novel means to improve the outcome and reduce the high
      mortality in these patients.
