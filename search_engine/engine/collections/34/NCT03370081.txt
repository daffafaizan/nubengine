      rooms. Nevertheless, some patients are still ventilated in post-anesthesia care units during
      awakening period. Alveolar hypoventilation could induce moderate hypercapnia, thereby
      stimulate central ventilatory command. However, this hypoventilation could delay the
      clearance of anesthetic gases. Capnometry monitoring could influence ventilation applied to
      these patients. Recovery rooms nurses would perform moderate hyperventilation in response to
      hign capnometry values. This method could enhance gases elimination, with faster spontaneous
      breathing recovery and extubation. Length of stay in recovery room could also be shortened.
      An objective surrogate of ventilation is maximal End Tidal CO2, if there is no
      alveolo-capillary gradient abnormality (Obesity, Chronic respiratory disease, Cyanogenic
      heart disease). Thus, this study will compare the percentage of patients who reached a
      maximum End Tidal CO2 greater than 45mmHg during awakening period in post-anesthesia care
      unit (PACU) in 2 groups :

        -  first group ("non-blind group") with capnography monitoring see by the PACU nurses

        -  second group ("blind group") with capnography monitoring but PACU nurses cannot see the
           values Other parameters like the time between ventilator's disconnection and the first
           ventilatory cycle in spontaneous ventilation, the time between ventilator's
           disconnection and tracheal extubation or laryngeal mask's withdrawal, the minimal SpO2
           reached after tracheal extubation or laryngeal mask withdrawal or the length of stay in
           PACU are also recorded.
