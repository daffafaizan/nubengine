    
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare hematologic malignancy of aberrant plasma cells.

      There is a high and currently unmet medical need for novel, innovative treatment concepts to
      improve the therapeutic outcome and prognosis of patients suffering from MM.

      There is definitive evidence that MM is susceptible to immune-based therapies from
      pre-clinical investigations and early clinical trials.

      CARAMBA-1 is a first-in human clinical trial of adoptive immunotherapy with autologous SLAMF7
      CAR-T cells in patients with advanced MM that have exhausted conventional therapies.

      The CARAMBA-1 clinical trial is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter clinical trial
      which combines a phase I dose-escalation part with a phase IIa dose-expansion part to assess
      feasibility, safety and anti-myeloma activity of SLAMF7 CAR-T cells.

      SLAMF7 CAR-T cells are manufactured using virus-free gene-transfer using the Sleeping Beauty
      transposon system.

      The CAR-T cell product is formulated to contain equal proportions of CD8 cytotoxic and CD4
      helper SLAMF7 CAR-T cells.

      The CARAMBA project and the CARAMBA-1 clinical trial are supported by the European Union in
      the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.
