      administered after grafting, to prevent the development of acute graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1,3,6, and 11. Patients also receive
      cyclosporine IV twice a day until the patient is eating, then it is administered orally twice
      a day. Cyclosporine begins on day -1 and continues until day 180. The dose is reduced
      beginning on day 50.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Accrual will continue until further notice.
