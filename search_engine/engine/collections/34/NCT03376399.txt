      gastroparesis and interested in receiving a sleeve gastrectomy for weight loss. An often
      intentional outcome of sleeve gastrectomy is an increase in gastric emptying. The
      relationship between how beneficial this outcome could be for diabetic gastroparesis patients
      suffering from delayed gastric emptying is not very well established. The purpose of this
      study is to find out if sleeve gastrectomy surgery will also help with symptoms of delayed
      gastric emptying. This study involves completing the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index
      questionnaire before your weight loss surgery and after surgery at the following time points;
      30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.
