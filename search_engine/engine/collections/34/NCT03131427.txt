      hospitals with special interest and expertise on managing genetic/metabolic liver diseases
      patients across mainland China. The main inclusion criteria for this registration are
      patients who were diagnosed or possibly diagnosed with Wilson's disease, hereditary
      hemochromatosis, hereditary hyperbilirubinemias, inherited cholestatic liver disease or other
      genetic/metabolic liver diseases. At the first time of data entry, demographics, medical
      history, biochemistry and hematology results, radiology reports, diagnosis and treatment
      information were recorded. Patients' whole blood and serum were collected for molecular
      genetic testing and future researches. Then the registered patients will receive standard of
      care and be followed-up every 6 to 12 months. On each visit, biochemical, radiological
      reports, as well as clinical progress were recorded.
