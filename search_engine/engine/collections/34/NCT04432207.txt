    
      Investigational Medicinal Product, IMU-201, consists of drug substance, APi2568, which is a
      B-cell epitope (amino acids 92-110 from PD-1) linked to a promiscuous T-cell epitope (amino
      acid residues 288-302 from measles virus fusion protein) via a 4-amino acid linker
      (Gly-Pro-Ser-Leu), and combined with Water for Injection (WFI) forms the drug product,
      IMU-201, which becomes PD1-Vaxx when emulsified with excipient Montanide ISA 720 VG.

      It is hypothesized that a polyclonal induced B-cell antibody response will be more effective
      or as effective with improved safety over current monoclonal antibody therapy.

      This phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of
      IMU-201 (PD1-Vaxx) as monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expressing non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). The monotherapy dose-escalation of IMU-201 (PD1-Vaxx) will establish the
      optimal biological dose. Once established, the dose cohort will be expanded to a total of 10
      participants. Once the monotherapy optimal biological dose is established and expansion
      complete, the protocol will be modified to include a combination dose escalation with
      standard of care treatment.
