      parallel group clinical trial. The three groups will be randomly assigned to use one of three
      test toothpastes having an identical base formulation but containing respectively either 0%
      nano-hydroxyapatite (HAP) (placebo), 15% nano-HAP or 5% KNO3 (positive control). All dental
      examinations for data collection will be conducted by the same Clinical Examiner.
