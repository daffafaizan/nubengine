      maintenance of anxiety disorders. The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving
      gaze-contingent feedback is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders in clinically
      anxious 6-10 year-olds children. Participants will be assessed using clinical interviews and
      parent- and self-rated questionnaires before and after eight training sessions. Outcome
      measures will be anxiety symptoms and depression as measured by gold standard questionnaires
      as well as structured clinical interviews with children and their parents. Attentional threat
      bias and Attentional control will also be measured to explore potential mediators of ABMT's
      effect on anxiety.
