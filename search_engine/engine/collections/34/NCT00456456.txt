      Pharmacology and Health Promotions Laboratory (BPHP). The study population is 11-17 year
      olds. The 30 minute online survey asks questions about behavior, sleep, and typical food
      consumption. The purpose of this survey is to better understand these habits in young people
      and the effects of these habits on behavior and sleep. This information will provide us with
      a better understanding of the daily habits in young people and guide the direction of future
      research projects.
