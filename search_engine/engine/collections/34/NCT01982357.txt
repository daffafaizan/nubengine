      tell the onset of blood loss. The research can measure blood flow in stable premature infants
      in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit over the duration of several weeks.

      The technologies are Laser Speckle Imaging and Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy.

      Laser Speckle Imaging non-contact imaging technology, is sensitive to blood flow in
      superficial tissues. Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy, a probe-based contact technology like
      pulse oximetry, measures hemoglobin concentrations and states deeper below the skin surface.
