      In 1990, the available data on medication adherence among chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) patients consistently indicated that adherence was a significant problem. This
      was a particularly distressing finding, considering that pharmacological therapy was
      considered the backbone of COPD management in settings where comprehensive rehabilitation
      services were limited. Despite the importance of this issue and a large data base on how to
      enhance medication adherence among medical populations, there had been no empirical
      investigations evaluating the implementation of these strategies with COPD patients.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The prospective, controlled study randomized 230 emphysema and chronic bronchitis patients
      from an urban university medical center into either a "usual care", control group or into a
      self-management skills training program for improving adherence. The training program was
      based on self-management procedures for enhancing adherence which had proven efficacious with
      diverse populations.

      Self-reported and objective measures of adherence were examined during the two month baseline
      period and the one year follow-up in the controlled study. A range of possible covariates
      including demographics, patient characteristics, treatment, and therapeutic outcome variables
      were also collected during the baseline phase and at the 6-month and 12-month follow-up
      visits in the controlled study to evaluate their relationship to the observed adherence
      levels.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
