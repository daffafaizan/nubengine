    
      In this study, the investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of intra-vesical
      antibiotic instillations for the prophylactic treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections
      in menopausal women in comparison with oral suppressive therapy. This is a parallel
      un-blinded randomized-controlled trial. the investigators will randomize post-menopausal
      women with recurrent urinary tract infections to either receive 6-8 intra-vesical antibiotic
      instillations at the office or to receive 3 months of oral antibiotic suppressive therapy.

      In the bladder instillation arm, based on the participant's allergy and antibiotic resistance
      profile, one of the following three antibiotics will be instilled intravesically via a latex
      free BARD® 12 French Foley catheter for a total of 6-8 instillations (2 instillations/week)
      according to the Atlantic Health System Urogynecology Division antibiotic bladder
      instillation standard protocol:

        -  Amikacin-30 mg in 60 ml of sterile water

        -  Gentamycin-80mg in 60ml sterile water

        -  Tobramycin-80 mg in 100 ml of sterile water

      In the antibiotic oral suppression therapy arm, one of the following routinely used
      antibiotics will be prescribed for a total of 3 months according to the American
      Urogynecology Society Guidelines and based on the participant's allergy and antibiotic
      resistance profile:

        -  Trimethoprim daily (100 mg)

        -  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole daily (40 mg/200 mg)

        -  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole every 3 days (40 mg/200 mg)

        -  Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals daily (50 mg)

        -  Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals daily (100 mg)

        -  Cephalexin daily (125 mg)

        -  Cephalexin daily (250 mg)

        -  Fosfomycin every 10 days (3 grams) All medications used in this study are approved by
           the FDA to treat urinary tract infections.

      Participants will be followed for total of 3 months after finishing either treatment course
      by only reviewing their medical records to collect data regarding development of urinary
      tract infections after treatment.

      Primary endpoint/outcome:

      • To compare the number of women developing urinary tract infections during the 3 months
      following treatment between the two groups.

      Secondary endpoints/outcomes:

        -  To compare the rate of antibiotic resistance of isolated pathogens after intravesical
           antibiotic instillation vs. oral antibiotic suppressive therapy

        -  To compare side effects of the two treatment modalities
