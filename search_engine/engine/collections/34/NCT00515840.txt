        -  To assess the effect of breathing retraining on asthma-related health status, asthma
           control and objective indices of asthma severity (bronchial hyper-reactivity (BHR),
           sputum eosinophilia and nitric oxide production) in patients with symptomatic asthma.

        -  To compare the relationship between symptoms of dysfunctional breathing (Nijmegen
           Questionnaire screening score), changes in asthma-related health status and other
           parameters resulting from breathing retraining

        -  To explore the relationship between dysfunctional breathing, baseline asthma symptoms,
           treatment and asthma-related quality of life.

        -  To estimate the cost effectiveness of the breathing retraining intervention
