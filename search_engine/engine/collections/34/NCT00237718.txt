      the hemodialysis population, and several lines of evidence point to their contribution in
      atherosclerosis development. Biomarkers of the inflammatory state such as C-reactive protein
      (CRP) and interleukin-6 are robust predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality in the
      dialysis population. The uremic state is characterized by retention of oxidized solutes
      including reactive aldehyde groups and oxidized thiol groups. It has recently been
      demonstrated that initiation of maintenance hemodialysis does not improve biomarkers of
      oxidative stress or inflammation, suggesting that dialysis alone is inadequate to control the
      atherosclerotic uremic metabolic state. In this study we hypothesize that administration of
      antioxidant therapy will decrease biomarkers of acute phase inflammation and oxidative stress
      while improving the erythropoietic response in hemodialysis patients.
