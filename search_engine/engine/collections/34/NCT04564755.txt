    
      This is a multi-center expanded access protocol (EAP) for the treatment of up to
      approximately 500 adult and adolescent (defined as age < 18 years) patients with moderate to
      severe atopic dermatitis for whom standard, approved medicated topical and systemic treatment
      options are inadequate and who would be suitable candidates for a trial of abrocitinib for
      potential treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The study will also collect
      safety and exploratory efficacy data. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria and none
      of the exclusion criteria may be enrolled into the EAP to receive open-label oral treatment
      with abrocitinib.
