    
      This is an open-label, four-arm lead-in safety and efficacy study in which adavosertib will
      be combined in four separate treatment arms as follows: adavosertib plus gemcitabine (Arm A);
      adavosertib plus weekly paclitaxel (Arm B); adavosertib plus carboplatin (Arm C); and
      adavosertib plus PLD (Arm D). A subset of patients will be evaluated for the safety
      assessment of each treatment arm.

      The adavosertib plus paclitaxel arm (Arm B) will enrol approximately 30 additional patients
      at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging data that
      suggests clinical activity.

      In addition, the adavosertib plus carboplatin arm (Arm C) will enrol approximately 23
      patients overall at selected sites as part of a further efficacy evaluation based on emerging
      data that suggests clinical activity.

      To further optimise the dosing schedule of adavosertib in Arm C, a safety expansion arm
      (referred to as Arm C2) of approximately 12 additional patients will be enrolled at selected
      sites to explore emerging pre-clinical and clinical data that suggest that prolonged
      adavosertib exposure may increase the clinical activity.
