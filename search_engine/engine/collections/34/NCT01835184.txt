      I. To determine a tolerable dose of XL184 (cabozantinib-s-malate) in combination with
      vemurafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) per Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS). III. To determine the response rate
      according to the molecular phenotype.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cabozantinib-s-malate.

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and vemurafenib PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
