    
      All postoperative patients who will be admitted to surgical ICU and develop (PSH) will be
      eligible for evaluation for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Prior to initiation of IV-IT (insulin therapy), blood samples will be obtained to estimate
      base-line Blood Glucose level (BG). BG will be estimated hourly during IV-IT to guard against
      development of hypoglycemic episodes. The assigned IV-IT will continue till reaching the
      target BG for each group and then will be stopped and patients will be shifted to
      subcutaneous (sc)-IT. During maintenance sc-IT, BG level will be estimated 6-hourly to assure
      maintenance of BG within the desired range, otherwise if hyperglycemia recurred or its
      induced complications as hyperglycemic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or infectious
      complications developed, IV-IT will be resumed and BG will be followed-up hourly. The same
      sequence of follow-up will be continued till stability of BG at the targeted level. IV-IT
      will be provided as following :

      Conventional insulin therapy (CIT) will be provided as a continuous infusion of 50 IU of
      Actrapid HM in 50 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride using a pump. Infusion will be adjusted to
      achieve BG level in range of 180-200 mg/dl.

      Intensive insulin therapy (IIT) will be provided as an insulin infusion at rate of 1
      mU/kg/min and will be adjusted to achieve target BG level in range of 80-110 mg/dl.
