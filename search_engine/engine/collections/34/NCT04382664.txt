    
      This is a randomized, open label study to investigate efficacy and safety of UV1 vaccination
      in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab as first line treatment of adult patients with
      histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic melanoma.

      Patients in the experimental arm will receive 8 UV1 vaccinations over 4 cycles of nivolumab
      and ipilimumab. Patients in the control arm will receive 4 cycles of nivolumab and
      ipilimumab. Patients in both arms will start maintenance therapy 6 weeks after the last dose
      of induction therapy, nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks.

      All patients will be followed up until death or until the end of the study.
