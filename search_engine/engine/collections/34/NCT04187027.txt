      in these children is affected by disordered innervation of detrusor muscle and external
      urethral sphincter that may lead to hydronephrosis. Thirty myelomeningocele children with
      neurogenic bladder were enrolled in this study and were assessed for eligibility. Their aged
      between 4 and 12 years. They were divided randomly into two groups. Group (A) which is the
      control group received medical care and standard urotherapy only. And Group (B) which is the
      study group received medical care and standard urotherapy in addition to pulsed
      electromagnetic field therapy for three successful months. All children were assisted using
      urodynamic studies before and after three months of intervention.
