    
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter trial, patients are stratified according to institution,
      number of IMDC risk factors, and combined elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and
      hyponatremia.

      All patients will receive induction checkpoint immunotherapy immediately after inclusion.
      After 3 months or a total of 4 series of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab, whichever comes
      first, the patient will be discussed for resectability at the multidisciplinary meeting
      (MDT). Whether the patient is eligible for cytoreductive nephrectomy is at the discretion of
      the urologist at the local MDT. Patients with ≤ 3 IMDC risk factors and deemed suitable for
      cytoreductive nephrectomy will then undergo randomization. Patients deemed not suitable for
      surgery or have > 3 IMDC risk features at the 3 month evaluation continue systemic therapy
      for 3 months, followed by a 2nd evaluation. Patients with ≤ 3 IMDC risk factors and deemed
      suitable for cytoreductive nephrectomy will then undergo randomization. Patients deemed not
      suitable for surgery or have > 3 IMDC risk features at the 6 month evaluation continue
      systemic therapy. Nivolumab may continue until unacceptable toxicity or total treatment
      length of 2 years from inclusion.

      ARM A: Deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy, followed by maintenance nivolumab.

      ARM B: No surgery, receive maintenance nivolumab alone.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue, blood, and stool collection at baseline, 3 and 6 months, for
      planned translational research.
