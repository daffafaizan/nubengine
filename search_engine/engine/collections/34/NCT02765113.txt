      spasmodic contraction. Continuous spasm can be long or short, the performance of non spasm
      will strongly closed repeatedly. At present, the pathogenesis of blepharospasm is not clear,
      in addition, there is no particularly effective treatment.

      Purpose：compare two different surgical methods, observe the improvement of symptoms and
      prognosis of patients with blepharospasm.

      Scientific hypothesis: At present, the pathogenesis of blepharospasm is not clear, but
      clinical patients with blepharospasm showed bilateral eyelid twitching, eyes open
      difficulties and the symptoms are worse when tension, anxiety, insomnia, light stimulation
      and wind outside stimulation. At the same time, in the clinic，the investigators found that
      facial nerve and trigeminal nerve combing can improve the clinical symptoms of the patients.
      Therefore, the investigators speculated that over activity were related to clinical symptoms
      and corneal reflex pathway of blepharospasm patients.

      Research content: the blepharospasm patients were randomly divided into two groups,
      prospective comparative analysis of two different surgical methods for the treatment of
      blepharospasm. One group of patients were performed facial nerve combing and microvascular
      decompression, the other group of patients were performed facial nerve, trigeminal nerve
      combing with microvascular decompression, to observation of postoperative clinical
      improvement of two groups of patients.

      Expected results:To define a surgical method for the treatment of blepharospasm, and to
      promote the use of the academic and clinical practice.
