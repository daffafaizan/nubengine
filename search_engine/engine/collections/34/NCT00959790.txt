    
      Study design: The study is designed as a randomized, cross-over and parallel, open study.

      Study population: The number of subjects participating in the study will be 32, healthy, lean
      and obese men, aged between 18-45 years.

      Intervention: each intervention lasts four weeks:

        -  High Vegetable treatment: consumption of 200 grams of vegetables daily;

        -  Low Vegetable treatment: consumption of 50 grams of vegetables daily;

        -  An energy restricted diet intervention with the habitual vegetable consumption.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: A 'challenge test' will be used as a physical stress test to
      examine whether subjects show more or less resilience to the test. The reaction and recovery
      of the human system to the exercise test may be used as indicators of health status on
      different biological analyses (transcriptomics; metabolomics; rules based medicine pm).
      Different analyses to measure oxidative stress will be performed. Also standard health
      biomarkers will be determined to examine the intervention effects.
