      as the signs and symptoms of sepsis are nonspecific and can be attributed to non-infected
      aetiologies including exacerbation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, apnoea of prematurity and
      gastroesophageal reflux. Blood culture remains the gold standard for diagnosing septicaemia
      (either bacteremia or fungemia). However, its effectiveness in the population of preterm
      infants is compromised.Given the dire consequences of not treating the sepsis early,
      clinicians tend to have a low threshold for treatment. This leads to overuse of
      antimicrobials, promotion of antimicrobial resistance, exposure of infants to avoidable side
      effects from the antimicrobial treatment, prolonged hospitalisation and increased healthcare
      costs. Hence, there is a need for a clearly defined algorithm for diagnosing LONS and NEC.
      This study aims to examine the diagnostic utilities of a panel of sepsis biomarkers and
      explore if they can be incorporated into a diagnostic algorithm which hopefully, can be
      translated into clinical practice in the future.
