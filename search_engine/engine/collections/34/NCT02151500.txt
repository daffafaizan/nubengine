      contributes to physical symptoms. However, primary care patients with medically unexplained
      symptoms are rarely assessed for the stress and emotions in an comprehensive manner. The goal
      of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of providing an experiential
      assessment interview that targets emotional and stressful experiences in primary care with
      medically unexplained physical symptoms. In this randomized, controlled trial, the
      investigators will compare an interview condition to a wait-list control condition. The
      interview will review patients health history, psychosocial history, make links between the
      two, and help patients identify and express emotions related to conflicts or victimization.
      The investigators hypothesize that helping individuals first identify the links between their
      stress and symptoms will likely increase their awareness and endorsement of the link between
      stress and physical symptoms, including a willingness to engage in stress management
      techniques. It is also expected that helping raise an individual's awareness about their
      symptoms, followed by an experience and expression of unexpressed emotions is likely to
      influence their physical symptoms and psychological status.
