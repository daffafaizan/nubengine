      may pose two major problems especially for the exact delineation of tumour contours:

        -  Respiratory movements, when the tumour is thoracic, may induce an overestimation

        -  The PET's low spatial resolution, linked to the emission of photons

      The usual method to define tumour contours result of three types of delineation usually used:
      the visual contouring, the segmentation based on an activity threshold fixed, and the
      segmentation with adaptive thresholding.
