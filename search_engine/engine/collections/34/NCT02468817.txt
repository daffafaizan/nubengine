      determinant of the decline in iCa and increases in PTH and carboxy-terminal collagen
      crosslinks (CTX; marker of bone resorption). The proposed experiment will address this by
      manipulating the rate of dermal Ca loss (moderate vs high sweating rate) to determine whether
      this is the trigger for the cascade described in Figure 1. This will be achieved by having
      participants perform two identical exercise bouts under different thermal conditions (warm vs
      cool).
