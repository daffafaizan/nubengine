      women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Physicians generally do not prescribe hormone
      replacement therapy (HRT) to women with SLE because of the widely held view that such
      treatment can activate SLE. This practice is based on the greater incidence of SLE in women
      than in men, biologic abnormalities of estrogen metabolism, murine models of lupus, several
      anecdotes of patients having disease flares while receiving exogenous hormones, and a single
      retrospective study in patients with preexisting renal disease. By contrast, recent
      retrospective studies suggest that the rate of flare is not significantly increased in
      patients taking HRT.

      We will examine, in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the
      effect of hormonal replacement with conjugated estrogens on disease activity in
      postmenopausal women with SLE. We will recruit patients from clinics and private practices
      that include over 4,000 women with SLE, most belonging to minority groups.

      We will give patients hormones for 1 year.

      NOTE: This trial has been terminated as of August 2002 upon recommendation of the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB), based on the findings of the WHI Trial. Study subjects have
      discontinued study drug but will continue followup visits to study doctors through May 2003
