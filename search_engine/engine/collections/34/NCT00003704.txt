      combination with pelvic radiotherapy in patients with unresectable, residual, or locally
      recurrent cancer localized in the pelvis. II. Determine the tolerance of this regimen in
      these patients. III. Determine the preliminary evidence of therapeutic acticivity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive oral capecitabine
      twice a day 7 days a week for 6 weeks with concurrent radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is initiated
      on the same day as the initiation of capecitabine and is administered 5 days a week for 5.5-6
      weeks. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 51 patients will be accrued for this study.
