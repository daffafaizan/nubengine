      center like B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell like (ABC) DLBCL. Clinically, the ABC subtype
      has a significantly higher rate of drug resistance and lower survival. The ABC subtype has
      overexpression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) with transcriptional activation of B cell
      lymphoma 2 (bcl-2), which may account for the drug resistance. The ability of NF-kB to
      inhibit responses to cancer therapeutic agents may also contribute to the refractory clinical
      behavior of ABC subtype, and inhibition of NF-kB can synergize with the chemotherapy to kill
      tumor cells. This protocol aims to study the affect of NF-kB inhibition, through proteasome
      inhibition by PS-341, on response to PS-341 and PS-341 with EPOCH chemotherapy in DLBCL. It
      will also assess the affect of PS-341 on NF-kB and BCL-2 tumor expression by microarray, and
      provide information on the specificity of PS-341.
