      Utstein-style guidelines. Te registry included the following information:

      demographic data, comorbidities, whether the arrest was witnessed, the incidence of suspected
      or confrmed trauma, presumed arrest time; presence of bystander CPR, frst documented arrest
      rhythm by the emergency medical service (EMS) provider, any return of spontaneous circulation
      (ROSC), presence of ECPR, the presence of return of spontaneous heart beating (ROSB) after
      CPR, presumed cause of arrest; the application of therapeutic hypothermia and the use of
      coronary angiography(CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),24-hour survival, the
      presence of ROSC more than 20 min, hospital length of stay (LOS), survival to hospital
      discharge,Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral performance category (CPC) score at discharge, and the
      fnal diagnosis at discharge. Te comorbidity score was calculated using the Charlson
      comorbidity index. Te duration of CPR was defned as the time interval from the frst chest
      compression provided by healthcare providers to the termination of resuscitation eforts due
      to ROSC (more than 20 min),ROSB after CPR, or a declaration of death. A favorable neurologic
      outcome was defned as a CPC score of 1 or 2 on the fve-category scale.
