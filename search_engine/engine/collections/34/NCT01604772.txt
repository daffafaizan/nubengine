      I. To determine the confirmed response rate of patients with progressive,
      recurrent/metastatic adenoid cyst carcinoma (ACC) treated with v-akt murine thymoma viral
      oncogene homolog 1 (Akt) inhibitor MK2206 (MK-2206).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and
      safety/tolerability for MK-2206 in these patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore potential genetic/cytogenetic/histopathologic predictors of clinical outcome
      (i.e., response, PFS, OS) to MK-2206.

      II. To explore the hypothesis that MK-2206-mediated Akt inhibition and downregulation of
      v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (c-myb) protein levels in ACC tumors
      correlates to clinical outcome (i.e., response, PFS, OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) once weekly for 4 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3 years.
