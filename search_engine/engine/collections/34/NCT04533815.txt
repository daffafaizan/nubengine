    
      In community (non-VA) NHs [one from each of 3 NH corporations, still to be recruited], our
      multi-disciplinary team proposes to (1) refine the LOCK sleep program to focus on sleep for
      residents with ADRD during this pilot (R61) phase, (2) which will prepare the team for the
      next phase of this NIH-funded grant (the R33 phase) to test the impact and sustainability of
      this intervention for NH residents with ADRD in an incomplete stepped-wedge randomized
      controlled trial.

      THIS CURRENT PILOT STUDY R61 PHASE (1 YEAR; N = 3 NHS; 1 NH PER CORPORATION) HAS THE
      FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. Refine the LOCK sleep program train-the-trainer protocol by implementing and
           pilot-testing in three NHs.

        2. Test and refine the research methods to: effectively identify eligible NHs and
           residents; obtain consent; collect primary data from residents and staff (sleep time via
           actigraph); explore staff impressions of additional sleep measurement devices (Fitbits);
           transfer primary and secondary data to our data center; and merge all data.
