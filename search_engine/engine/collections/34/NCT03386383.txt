      guidelines for cancer survivors, and few interventions to date have focused specifically on
      promoting physical activity among AYAs or capitalized on new technologies to deliver them.
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the feasibility, acceptability,
      and gather preliminary data on outcomes of a 3-month mHealth intervention to promote PA among
      AYA survivors compared to a delayed intervention control group. This project will focus on
      how to best integrate self-monitoring with wearable trackers, increase self-efficacy, enhance
      autonomous motivation, and promote social support in a mobile health behavioral intervention
      that promotes moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) among AYA survivors.
      Participants will be AYA cancer survivors (N=60), diagnosed at age 15 or older and currently
      age 18-39. AYA cancer survivors will be recruited from the three comprehensive cancer centers
      in North Carolina to participate in this study. The behavioral intervention will consist of
      an activity tracker, Facebook group, weekly email lessons, and weekly tailored feedback
      emails. Assessments of objectively-measured physical activity and other outcomes will be
      completed at baseline, 3, and 6 months.
