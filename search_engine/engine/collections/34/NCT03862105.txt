      internet-based mobile health intervention that can prospectively collect PRO data while
      providing timely feedback to patients and clinicians. This mobile health intervention will
      utilize a well-established platform (Twistle) that can be accessed through multiple
      technologies, including laptops, smartphones, and other computer-based systems. The objective
      is to evaluate the feasibility of pre-specified Patient Reported Outcomes and educational
      content in an existing mobile health communications platform which tracks patient symptoms
      and provides real-time feedback to patients and providers following cystectomy discharge.
      Patient Reported Outcome questions and responses will be inputted using validated questions
      with branching logic to drive feedback based upon responses. The intent of this study is to
      evaluate feasibility and acceptability of this mobile health tool following cystectomy
      discharge. Usual care will continue in coordination with this intervention.
