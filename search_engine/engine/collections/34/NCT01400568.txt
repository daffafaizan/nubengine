      airway inflammation can be safely induced by inhaled LPS, the LPS challenge will be repeated.
      If neutrophil airway inflammation after LPS challenge is reproducible LPS challenge will be
      repeated after pre-treatment with a single high dose of inhaled fluticasone propionate.

      To determine airway inflammation, the subjects' exhaled breath will be analyzed by different
      techniques, and blood samples as well as induced sputum will be collected.
