      have glaucoma of varying degree. All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging and other
      study procedures in one single visit. All examinations performed on the subjects are
      non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for marketing in
      Europe and in the U.S. Total study duration is anticipated to not exceed 4 weeks.
