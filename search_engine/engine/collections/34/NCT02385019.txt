    
      Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating safety (Phase 1) and preliminary efficacy (Phase 2) of
      donor regulatory T cells for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host
      disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      Patients must have persistent signs and symptoms despite the use of prednisone or equivalent
      at ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day), for at least 4 weeks without complete
      resolution of signs and symptoms. Occasional patients requiring lower doses of prednisone
      will be eligible if associated with other immunosuppressive drugs.

      Phase 1 clinical trial will include groups of 5 patients sequentially treated with: 0.5 x
      10ˆ6, 1.0 x 10ˆ6, 2-3 x 10ˆ6 donor Treg/kg. Phase 2 clinical trial will include another 5 to
      10 patients treated with MTD.

      Donor Treg will be selected by the following sequential steps:

        1. - negative depletion of CD8 and CD19 cells

        2. - positive selection of CD25 cells
