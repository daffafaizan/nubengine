      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients with high-risk Crohn's disease (CD). The
      regimen includes two types of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) as well as
      alemtuzumab. The regimen will include low-dose immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus
      (Prograf) for one year post-HSCT in attempt to prevent relapse and improve long-term
      remission. Patients will also receive rifaximin (Xifaxan) for six months post-HSCT to target
      abnormal intestinal microbiota that may trigger intestinal inflammation. The ability of these
      experimental treatments to stop relapses and progression (worsening) of Crohn's disease will
      be assessed.
