      disease (CVD), and are 10 times more likely to die from CVD prior to requiring dialysis or
      kidney transplantation. Inflammation, oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction (impaired
      endothelial function and increased large elastic artery stiffness), are highly prevalent in
      CKD and contribute to the high incidence of CVD in this patient population. In addition,
      patients with CKD suffer from high rates of cognitive decline for which we lack effective
      therapies. Thus, therapeutic interventions targeting inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular
      dysfunction in CKD are a priority.

      Wine intake, which is known to be rich in various polyphenolic compounds, might have a
      variety of health benefits. Among these polyphenols, the stilbene derivative resveratrol
      (RSV), a naturally occurring polyphenol found in grapes and red wine, has recently come to
      light, as it has been shown to exert potent anti-diabetic, anti-oxidative and
      anti-inflammatory actions. Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that resveratrol is
      well-tolerated (37) and may confer similar benefits in individuals at high risk of CVD, such
      as improved endothelial function in individuals with metabolic syndrome (i.e. diabetes)

      The primary goal of this application is to determine whether 6 wks resveratrol (RSV)
      supplementation improves vascular function by reducing oxidative stress in a randomized,
      double-blind, cross-over study of 25 patients with diabetic kidney disease. The investigators
      hypothesize that: 1) 6 wks RSV will improve vascular function as measured via BA-FMD vs.
      placebo and 2) that the improvement in vascular function will be related, at least partially,
      to a reduction in oxidative stress.
