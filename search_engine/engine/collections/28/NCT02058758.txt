      non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing breast cancer. CE-MRI has a very high
      sensitivity because the intravenous MR contrast agent highlights regions with increased
      vascularization and vascular permeability compared to normal breast tissues and benign
      lesions. While research continues on improving the specificity of CE-MRI, several other MR
      techniques that do not require an exogenous contrast agent have been shown to provide
      valuable information that can improve the characterization of breast cancers. These
      techniques include magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging, and
      water T2 relaxometry. The long-term goal of this study is to develop these techniques to
      produce quantitative MR-based biomarkers that can be used to supplement or possibly supplant
      the information provided by CE-MRI. This project seeks to facilitate the advancement of these
      advanced, non-contrast techniques. This study uses a piggyback design, in which subjects who
      are already scheduled to receive a CE-MRI study are invited to receive an additional 10-20
      minutes of scanning to help develop these novel methods. This efficient design allows for the
      refinement and assessment of these new techniques with a minimum of risk and inconvenience to
      the patient. With these proposed improvements, these techniques may lead to quantitative
      biomarkers that can guide critical clinical questions in treatment response, diagnosis,
      staging, and high-risk screening of breast cancer.
