      unfiltered nanofat.

      Place and Duration of Study: Plastic Surgery Department, Mayo Hospital, Lahore, from January
      2016 to December 2016.

      Methodology: 48 patients with post burn facial scars were included, age range 4 to 32 years
      with Fitzpatrick skin types between 3 and 4. Patients with hypertrophic scars, contractures
      or keloids were excluded. Scars were assessed by a senior plastic surgeon and the patient on
      the POSAS. Fat was harvested from the abdomen and/or thighs with a 3 mm multi-port
      liposuction cannula (containing several sharp side holes of 1 mm) using Coleman's technique,
      emulsified, and transferred into 1 ml Leur lock syringes for injection into the subdermal or
      intradermal plane. Final follow up was scheduled at 6 months and scar was rated by the
      patient and the same surgeon on the POSAS. Pre and post op scar scores were compared and
      p-values calculated.
