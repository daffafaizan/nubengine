      to compare high dose (600 mg/day) and low dose (300 mg per day) carbidopa blockade with
      placebo. Patients will be randomly assigned to a high-dose/low-dose/placebo sequence,
      lowdose/placebo/high-dose sequence or placebo/high-dose/low-dose sequence. Participants will
      remain on each treatment period for 28-days.

      Aim 1: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of carbidopa in FD patients with particular
      emphasis on the orthostatic fall in blood pressure.

      Aim 2: As proof of concept, examine the hemodynamic effects of carbidopa and determine its
      effects on norepinephrine production, BP variability and paroxysmal hypertension.

      Aim 3: In a dose finding study, compare the effects of low (300 mg/day) and high (600 mg/day)
      dose carbidopa blockade vs. placebo on BP variability and paroxysmal hypertension.
