      mutation or MET amplification(copy number gain â‰¥6.0 ) is detected by NGS method, then
      confirmation of genetic findings by Molecular Steering Committee will be followed. Patient
      can participate in this trial after confirmation of genetic analysis and reviewing other
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.
