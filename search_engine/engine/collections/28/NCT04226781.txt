      As Standard in our clinical Routine the tissue perfusion is measured with fluorescence
      Imaging and Indocyaningreen (ICG). In this study the investigators use the
      Hyperspectral-Camera (HSI-Camera) as new method. The measurements were performed like
      described before, using the TIVITA Tissue system (Diaspective Vision GmbH, Am Salzhaff,
      Germany). This HSI-camera provides hyperspectral images with a high spectral resolution (5
      nm) in the visible and near infrared range (500-1000 nm). A RGB image and 4 false color
      images that represent physiologic parameters are intraoperatively provided by an analysis
      software. This work is focused on tissue oxygenation (StO2), which represents the relative
      blood oxygenation in the microcirculation of superficial tissue layers (approximately 1 mm)
      and the near-infrared (NIR) Perfusion Index, representing tissue layers in 4-6 mm penetration
      depth.

      As Standard method ICG-Fluorescence Imaging is used. After the procedure the Perfusion data
      of both Systems is compared.
