      stem cell transplantation. The incidence and severity of GVHD increase with the degree of HLA
      incompatibility between the host and donor. The most reliable way to prevent acute and
      chronic GVHD is to remove T cells from the graft. However, the incidence of graft failure
      increases with the efficiency of T cell depletion and low T cell numbers are predictive of
      graft failure. Immunomagnetic selection of HLA-mismatched CD34+ progenitor cells has
      demonstrated high levels of T cell depletion and successful engraftment in adult and
      pediatric patients with the malignant and nonmalignant disease.
