    
      This prospective cohort study is part of the ZODIAC (Zwolle Outpatient Diabetes project
      Integrating Available Care) study, which started in 1998 as a prospective observational study
      and includes patients with known T2DM who are treated in primary care.

      The investigators aim to investigate the course of the bodyweight and glycaemic control, the
      years after starting specific SU's, pioglitazone or insulin as add-on therapy, in metformin
      treated primary care patients with T2DM.

      As part of the process called benchmarking, a dataset of quality measures is collected
      annually for all patients participating in the ZODIAC study during the patient's visit to the
      practice nurse and/or general practitioner and sent to the investigators' diabetes centre for
      benchmarking and research purposes once a year.
