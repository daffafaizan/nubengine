    
      The present study is divided into 3 appointments following the standard inpatient stay for
      the index event (STEMI).

      T0: Inpatient stay for index STEMI. Assessment of eligibility for participation in the study:

        -  STEMI diagnosis

        -  Primary PCI

        -  Confirmation at second-day transthoracic echocardiogram and pre-discharge echocardiogram
           of left ventricular dysfunction

        -  Biomarker assay

      Visit 1 (V1): between 30 and 40 days post-STEMI. Clinical evaluation and performance of
      cardiac MRI with paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium) for measurement of infarct
      territory size and myocardial viability.

      Visit 2 (V2): 6 months after STEMI. Clinical evaluation and second cardiac MRI, without
      contrast medium, for measurement of left ventricular volumes and consequently for measurement
      of the presence of adverse left ventricular remodeling.

      Visit 3 (V3): 12 months after STEMI. Clinical re-evaluation with collection of data regarding
      events of interest for secondary endpoint. Performance of transthoracic echocardiogram.

      The examinations and follow-up visits included in this study are part of clinical practice
      for treatment and risk assessment in patients who suffered STEMI with the exception of
      cardiac MRI without contrast medium at 6 months.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data (1 month and 6 months) will be centrally analyzed post
      hoc at the MRI center.
