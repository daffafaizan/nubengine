      regarding efficacy of the VirTele program for upper limb motor control recovery in chronic
      stroke. Secondary objectives are to: i. Determine the effect of the VirTele program on upper
      limb function, quality of life and motivation; ii. Determine the feasibility of using the
      VirTele program with users at home (e.g. adherence, safety, technical difficulties,
      facilitators and barriers); iii. Explore the role that shared decision-making and empowerment
      play in exercise program adherence and progression, and in behavior modification for
      upper-limb use.

      This study will also provide evidence of feasibility for conducting a larger-scale RCT
      comparing different technologies and interventions for chronic stroke rehabilitation.

      A single-blind (evaluator) two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed for this study
      with participants who have had a stroke randomly allocated to: (1) 8-week training with the
      VirTele system.i.e. treatment group or (2) 8-week written home exercise program provided by a
      clinician (GRASP), i.e. exercise control group.
