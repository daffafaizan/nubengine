      weeks before the results of the histology are returned and the clinical treatment is
      initiated. In this research, the investigator intent to show that the mid infrared ATR
      (Assisted Reproductive Treatment) spectroscopy method will provide the physician with
      sufficient information about the CE inflammation status in a considerably shorter period of
      time to allow immediate initiation of the appropriate treatment.
