      and good liver function will be entered in this study. Qualified patients also have positive
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for at least 24 weeks before screening, evidence of
      chronic hepatitis on a baseline liver-biopsy sample obtained within 52 weeks before entry,
      evidence of HBV DNA by any commercial tests at least 4 weeks before screening, an high HBV
      DNA level (at least 20,000 IU/mL) at screening, and a high serum ALT level (1.0 to 5.0 times
      the upper limit of normal) at screening.

      This study involves experimental use of an approved drug (Prednisolone) on chronic hepatitis
      B patients. Patients will be involved in the study for up to 96 weeks from enrollment. There
      is no external sponsor, commercial sponsor nor federal agency on this study. The study will
      be conducted only at Maimonides Medical Center, its GI clinic and faculty practice. About 40
      subjects will be involved in the study overall. All the subjects will be filled up locally.
