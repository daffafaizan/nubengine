      Treatment with immunosuppression drugs helps in retarding the progression of interstitial
      lung disease (ILD) and improves the morbidity and mortality among these patients. Presently,
      cyclophosphamide has been shown to be useful in stabilizing the lung functions among patients
      of systemic sclerosis with ILD. But use of cyclophosphamide is also associated with many
      adverse effects including infections, cytopenias, gonadal dysfunction and malignancies. Use
      of oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in SSc-ILD in recent studies has been shown to be
      effective in retarding progression of ILD among these patients with a better side effect
      profile compared to cyclophosphamide. Contemporary expert opinion dictates that the treatment
      for SSc-ILD needs to be individualized. Generally, intense immunosuppression is required in
      patients with FVC <70% of the predicted. In patients with FVC >70% of the predicted, the need
      for high dose immunosuppression is not clear and varies from center-to-center. The present
      study is designed to determine the efficacy of oral MMF in patients with SSc related early
      ILD. The subjects in this study will be given either oral MMF or placebo and will be
      monitored for their response and adverse events. Informed consent will be taken from the
      subjects before including in the study.
