    
      This protocol is designed to evaluate selected patients with documented recurrent or unusual
      infections and their family members for clinical and in vitro correlates of immune
      abnormalities. It will also allow long term follow up of patients with host defense defects
      and permit us to periodically obtain blood, urine, saliva, skin, breast milk, stool and
      vaginal specimens or wound drainage from such patients or their family members for medically
      indicated purposes and research studies related to understanding the genetic and biochemical
      bases of these diseases. This protocol may help provide patients and materials for the
      development of therapies for these diseases.
