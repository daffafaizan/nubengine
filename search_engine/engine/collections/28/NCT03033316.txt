      Dexamethasone sodium phosphate given as a short term induction therapy in Multiple Myeloma
      patients. It consist of a Phase 1 part with a maximum number of 5 ascending dose levels while
      additional patients will be treated in the Phase 2a part with the recommended phase 2 dose to
      obtain additional safety data and preliminary efficacy data in multiple myeloma patients. For
      the dose escalation phase 1 part, 3 patients per dose level will be enrolled. If one patient
      reaches DLT, another 3 patients will be enrolled in the same dose level. If two or more
      patients reach DLT in one dose level, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined at the last
      dose level beneath DLT. Not more than 5 dose level groups are anticipated for this part of
      the study. MTD will be the Recommended Phase II Dose (RPTD) for the phase IIa part of the
      study. For the phase 2a part, 7 additional patients will be enrolled at the RPTD dose level,
      bringing the total number of patients monitored for responses at this dose level to at least
      10.
