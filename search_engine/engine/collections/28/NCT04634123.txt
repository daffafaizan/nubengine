           root canals , physiological root absorption and failure to find ideal root-filling paste
           absorbs the same degree of root absorption .

        -  Pulpotomy therapy is considered easy , fast and does not include the length of canal or
           periapical region .

        -  The split mouth design will be adopted for the treated samples .

        -  Clinical success criteria :

             1. Absence of spontaneous or stimulant pain

             2. Absence gingival redness , swelling or fistula

             3. Physiological tooth mobility and absence sensitivity to percussion

        -  Radiographically success criteria :

             1. Absence periapical translucence

             2. Absence external or internal abnormal absorption
