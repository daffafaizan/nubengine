      I. Evaluate the effect of combining motexafin gadolinium with daily fractionated radiotherapy
      on 1-year event-free survival of pediatric patients with intrinsic pontine glioma (brain stem
      glioma).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of combining motexafin gadolinium with daily fractionated radiotherapy
      on 1-year overall survival of these patients.

      II. Determine the toxicities of motexafin gadolinium in combination with radiotherapy in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive motexafin gadolinium IV over 5-10 minutes once daily (prior to radiotherapy)
      5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients undergo focal cranial radiotherapy once daily 5 days a
      week for 6 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years and
      then periodically thereafter.
