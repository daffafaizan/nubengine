    
      The study is designed to:

        1. Evaluate the patient-reported sleep latency and patient-reported wake after sleep onset
           after 3 weeks per treatment dose with CHI-921 compared to placebo.

        2. To evaluate the effects of CHI-921 compared to placebo on PSG sleep architecture.

        3. To evaluate the effects of CHI-921 compared to placebo on Patient Global Impression of
           change.

        4. To evaluate the daytime residual effects that may be associated with CHI-921 as compared
           to placebo during the double-blind treatment period using patient's morning and evening
           questionnaire, Clinical Global Impression of change, Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh
           Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale as well as the Rey Auditory Verbal
           Learning Test and Digit Symbol Substitution psychometric tests.

        5. To assess the effect on sleep of abruptly discontinuing CHI-921 compared to placebo
           (during run-out period).

        6. To evaluate the clinical safety and tolerability of CHI-921 compared to placebo.

        7. Evaluation of the accuracy of sleep data obtained by actigraphy as compared to
           traditional PSG.
