      procedures. Anaesthetists have adopted the use of ultrasound to assist in overcoming these
      difficulties. Neuraxial ultrasound is proving to be beneficial in those patients in whom
      identification of interspinous spaces is difficult and most of these patients are obese.

      In our institution, there is a 'standard practice' for neuraxial procedures, with a
      'standard' needle used for first attempts (Whitacre 25G 90mm for spinal, Tuohy 18G 80mm for
      epidural). If the operator has not reached the desired space (spinal or epidural) with the
      needle inserted to 8cm, a longer needle is then considered for further attempts. This exposes
      the patient to at least one extra neuraxial needle insertion. Studies have shown that
      increased needle insertions and redirections are associated with increased complications.

      We hypothesised that a large number of patients with BMI>30kg/m2 would have a depth of
      spinal/epidural space that is greater than the length of the 'standard' needle used.
      Therefore we suggest that practice should change to use the longer needle or a combined
      spinal-epidural on the first attempt in these patients.

      To test our hypothesis, we will assess the ease of palpation of the following anatomical
      landmarks: anterior and posterior iliac crests; lumbar spinous processes; scapulae; and
      sacral cornua. We will then perform neuraxial sonography of the lumbar spine, measuring depth
      to epidural space. Finally we will measure waist circumference in those patients with BMI
      <30kg/m2.
