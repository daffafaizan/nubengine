      electrical bioimpedance device. Cardiac output is measured by the Physioflow® Thoracic
      Bioimpedance Device and TTE before and after PLR. If the attending physician decide to
      administer fluid expansion a new set of cardiac output measurement will be performed before
      and after the volume expansion.
