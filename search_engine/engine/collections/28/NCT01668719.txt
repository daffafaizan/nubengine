      I. To determine the appropriate Phase II dose of elotuzumab to use in combination with
      lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II.
      To assess whether incorporation of the novel agent elotuzumab into the treatment algorithm of
      high-risk multiple myeloma (HRMM) will improve progression-free survival (PFS). (Phase II)
      III. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of this treatment strategy in this
      patient population. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of elotuzumab, followed by a phase II,
      randomized study.

      PHASE I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1,
      4, 8, and 11; lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14; and dexamethasone PO or
      IV on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 (and on day 15 of courses 1 and 2 only). Patients
      also receive elotuzumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of courses 1 and 2 and on days 1 and 11 of
      courses 3-8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive bortezomib SC or IV on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide PO QD on
      days 1-21; dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15; and elotuzumab IV on days 1 and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive bortezomib SC or IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; lenalidomide PO QD
      on days 1-14; and dexamethasone PO or IV on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity (patients who received a course of chemotherapy prior to registration will begin
      protocol treatment with course 2 and receive a total of 7 courses of protocol therapy).

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive bortezomib SC or IV on days 1, 8, and 15; lenalidomide PO QD on
      days 1-21; and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone as in Arm I. Patients
      also receive elotuzumab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of courses 1 and 2 and on days 1 and 11 of
      courses 3-8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone as in Arm I.
      Patients also receive elotuzumab IV on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 6
      years.
