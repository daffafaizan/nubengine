      and sALCL. The study will collect information on therapy and outcome of cHL and sALCL in
      real-life clinical practice.

      The study will enroll approximately 2000 participants. Based on the diagnosis of the disease,
      participants will be assigned to one of the following groups:

        -  Newly Diagnosed and RR cHL Participants

        -  Newly Diagnosed and RR sALCL Participants

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Russia. The retrospective data will be collected
      for the participants with RR cHL or RR sALCL at the time of enrollment and for participants
      with RR cHL or RR sALCL within 3 years prior to inclusion in the study at Visit 1 (Baseline).
      The prospective data will be collected for a period of 2 years from Visit 1 (Baseline) to
      Visit 5 (Month 24, Final Visit), both for newly diagnosed participants with cHL or sALCL and
      participants with RR cHL or RR sALCL at the time of enrolment, and participants with RR cHL
      or RR sALCL within 3 years prior to inclusion in the study.
