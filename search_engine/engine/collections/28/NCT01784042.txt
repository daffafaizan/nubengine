      cancer. Multiple mechanisms are likely to contribute to obesity associated breast cancer
      risk. They include increased insulin like growth factor (IGF)-I bioavailability, oxidative
      stress, raised leptin to adiponectin ratio, and increased inflammatory cytokines which are
      responsible for the creation of a systemic and local hyperestrogenic milieu by induction of
      aromatase and may also be responsible for the reduction in antitumor immunity by stimulation
      of immunosuppressive cells. While derivative chromosome disulfiram (DER) has been shown to
      reverse some of these obesity related phenotypic features, it is not yet established whether
      DER reduces breast cancer risk using validated tissue biomarkers predictive of breast cancer
      development. N:3FA (3-fatty acids) have been shown to ameliorate obesity-induced effects on
      circulating leptin and adiponectin, insulin resistance, endogenous estrogen production and
      inflammation. Although preclinical studies have indicated a protective effect of n:3FA on
      mammary carcinogenesis, the data in humans are inconclusive, likely as a result of the lack
      of controlled clinical trials. Investigators hypothesize that the combination of DER and
      n:3FA will reduce breast cancer risk in an additive/synergistic fashion through their
      complementary effects on the multiple inter-related pathways accounting for the obesity
      associated breast cancer risk. Investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial study
      involving overweight and obese women between the ages of 30 and 55 who are at high risk of
      breast cancer and are found on random periareolar fine needle aspiration to have hyperplasia
      with or without atypia with Ki67 ≥2 if premenopausal and ≥1.5 if postmenopausal. Following
      stratification according to menopausal status they will be randomized to one of four
      experimental groups.
