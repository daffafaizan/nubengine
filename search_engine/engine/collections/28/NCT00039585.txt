        -  Determine the clinical activity of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent or
           relapsed ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer or ovarian low
           malignant potential tumor.

        -  Correlate the biochemical modulation of signal transduction pathways downstream of
           platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-kit tyrosine kinases in biopsy
           tissue with outcome in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate the expression of PDGFR and c-kit in both archival and fresh biopsy tissue
           with response and outcome in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Investigate the potential antiangiogenic activity of this drug in microdissected tumor
           cell and stromal lysates of these patients.

        -  Investigate the potential for collateral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in biopsy
           tissue of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the application of surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization with
           time-of-flight detection (SELDI-TOF) with artificial intelligence bioinformatics to
           serially obtained serum samples for prediction of response in these patients and/or
           toxicity of this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 47 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-20 months.
