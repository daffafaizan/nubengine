      communities. While the majority of current alternative medicine use is the result of interest
      in replacing or augmenting formal medical treatments, several cultures have long-standing
      traditions of herbal medicine use, particularly among older, more traditional members.
      Research in this area has been limited primarily to small-scale studies that identify herbal
      remedies popular in specific cultures. This study observes older Mexican Americans because a
      substantial proportion of this population continue to utilize traditional herbal remedies in
      their everyday life.
