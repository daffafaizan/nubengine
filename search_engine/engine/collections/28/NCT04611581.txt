      negatively affect the quality of life of patients. Although healthcare professionals have
      begun to understand the extent of the problem faced by those suffering apathy or ICDs,
      accurate diagnosis is still difficult, as behavioural symptoms are often multidimensional,
      develop gradually over the course of months and clinical staff have to rely on the
      self-report of the patient or the report of a family member to assess them. To overcome this
      issue, the investigators aim to use information and communication technologies to measure
      apathy and hyperdopaminergic behaviours in PD patients in an objective way, with the ultimate
      goal of improving the management of PD patients.

      To do so, the investigators will use three computer-based tasks that measure effort-based
      decision making, reward processing and emotion processing in PD patients, and assess motor,
      cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in parallel with scales and tests. In some select
      patients, motor symptoms and activity patterns will be monitored with an in-home sensor
      system before and after deep brain stimulation (DBS), and the above mentioned procedures will
      be repeated in a longitudinal design.
