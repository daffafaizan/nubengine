      reactions respective of the examined process, such as stress/anxiety, sports activity, labor,
      etc.

      Women under epidural anesthesia, may frequently feel lack of control over the birthing
      process and difficulty in bearing down effectively, which is a very significant part of the
      second stage of labor.

      Transperineal ultrasound during labor is a standard procedure in many medical centers in the
      world, mainly used to assist obstetricians in evaluating the progress of labor, fetal head
      position and assessing the chances of successful operative delivery. One of the most common
      tools used in transperineal ultrasound in measurement of the angle of progression, which has
      been suggested as a subjective method for assessing fetal station and for predicting
      successful vaginal delivery. A preliminary non-randomized study raised the possibility that
      the use of transperineal ultrasound during labor as a biofeedback tool may shorten the second
      stage of labor.

      The purpose of this study is to examine whether this tool can be used during labor as an
      effective tool for shortening the second stage of labor and reducing the need for
      instrumental delivery, in a prospective randomized design.
