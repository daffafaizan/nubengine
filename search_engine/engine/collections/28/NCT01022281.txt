      normal controls and to evaluate the value of scanning laser polarimetry in the early
      diagnosis and management of exfoliative glaucoma. Prospective study in progress. The
      investigators compare and analyze the scanning laser polarimetry parameters in consecutive
      subjects with exfoliation syndrome and normal intraocular pressure and compared them with
      consecutive normal controls. Randomly selected patients with exfoliation syndrome and normal
      controls undergo a comprehensive ophthalmic exam which includes 3 IOP measurements, corneal
      pachymetry, automated perimetry and assessment of the retina nerve fiber layer with scanning
      laser polarimetry. The investigators hypothesize that patients with exfoliation syndrome may
      show worse scanning laser polarimetry parameters than normal controls and this may prove to
      be an early sign of exfoliative glaucoma development. Evaluation of retina nerve fiber layer
      thickness may help us in identifying earlier those individuals with exfoliation syndrome that
      will develop exfoliative glaucoma.
