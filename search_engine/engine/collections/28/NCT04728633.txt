      To determine the efficacy (clinical response) in terms of disease control rate (DCR)
      (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) with chemoembolization
      of hepatic metastases with 300 mg of carmustine (BCNU) in ethiodized oil in metastatic uveal
      melanoma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To investigate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in uveal melanoma
      patients with hepatic metastases.

      To assess the toxicity of the above treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) by receiving an infusion of
      carmustine dissolved in ethiodized oil and an injection of gelatin sponge. Treatment repeats
      once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for bilobar disease or once every 7 weeks (Q7W) for unilobar disease
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until maximum clinical
      benefit is obtained.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 2
      months for up to 2 years.
