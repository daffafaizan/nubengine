    
      Pain was given subjectively by the patient using the visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS
      consists of a 10 cm line that was grouped into mild (0-3 cm), moderate (4-6 cm) and severe
      (7-10 cm). Tinel's sign was rated as the following: grade 1=none; grade 2=mild, slight
      tingle; grade 3=moderate, very uncomfortable; and grade 4=severe, patient unable to use hand
      because of any stimulation of the neuroma.
