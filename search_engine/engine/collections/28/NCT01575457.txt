      recruit and retain adolescents and young adults and influence future planning behaviors.

      We will address the following research Aims:

        1. To assess the feasibility of a career development program provided to low income
           adolescents and young adults in a pediatric primary care setting.

        2. To assess the receptiveness of adolescents and young adults in pediatric primary care
           setting to future planning interventions.

        3. To assess the impact of a career development program in improving educational,
           workforce, and health attitudes and outcomes for adolescents and young adults.

      The Healthy Futures Program is an interactive, multi-session training program. There will be
      participants in 3 different intervention tracks (College/vocational school, Job, and Career
      Planning). Tracks are assigned to participants based on interest and age. During the
      screening process, participants who are 16 years old or older will be asked if they are
      interested in participating in a program designed to help them apply to college or job
      training services. Based on their preference, they will be assigned a college or job track.
      Participants who are 14 and 15 years old will automatically be assigned to the career
      planning track.
