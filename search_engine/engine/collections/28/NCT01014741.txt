      patients will be required to be in atrial fibrillation on the day of the procedure. Standard
      pulmonary vein (PV) isolation will be performed. Patients will be enrolled in the trial if
      they remain in atrial fibrillation after bi-directional block is obtained in the left and
      right sided PVs. At this point, patients will be randomized to receive 0.25mg of IV ibutilide
      or a placebo (normal saline). Patients will then undergo additional ablation with areas of
      complex fractionate electrograms (CFE) being targeted. The duration of additional CFE
      ablation and use of additional non-PV ablation (i.e. placement of linear lesions) will be
      left to the discretion of the operator. Patients will be followed for 1 year. The primary
      outcome assessed will be freedom from AF at 1 year.
