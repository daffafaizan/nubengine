      anesthesia. Hypotension is induced by decreased preload and contractility due to anesthesia.
      Masimo is a pulse oximetry which shows pleth variability index noninvasively. The
      investigators put the masimo probe before general anesthesia and recorded the values before
      and after beach chair position, The values include arterial pressure, heart rate, blood
      pressure, perfusion index, pleth variability index.

      The primary end point was the predictive value and threshold or pleth variability index for
      hypotension induced by the beach chair position. The occurrence of hypotension was counted by
      using vasopressor. The use of vasopressor was performed when mean blood pressure less than 65
      mmHg or 20% of baseline.

      The investigators planned to recruit 57 patients.
