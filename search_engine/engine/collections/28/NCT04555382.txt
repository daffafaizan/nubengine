      unit of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine between
      August 2020 and August 2022. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global
      Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines as renal function was suddenly decreased within 48 hours and
      serum creatinine increased at least 0.3mg/dL, or serum creatinine increased more than 1.5
      times higher than baseline within 7 days, or urine volume less than 0.5mL/Kg per hour for 6
      hours. The staging criteria of AKI as follows: stage I means serum creatinine higher than
      baseline between 1.5times and 1.9 times, or serum creatinine increased at least 26.5μmol/L,
      or serum creatinine increased more than 1.5 times higher than baseline within 7 days, or
      urine volume less than 0.5mL/Kg per hour for 6 hours; stage II means serum creatinine higher
      than baseline between 2.0 times and 2.9 times, or urine volume less than 0.5mL/Kg per hour
      for 12hours; stage III means serum creatinine higher than baseline 3.0 times, or serum
      creatinine higher than baseline 353.6μmol/L, or started renal replacement therapy. Patients
      who stayed in the ICU for less than 24 hours and whose serum creatinine had increased above
      normal reference range on the first day of ICU were excluded.

      Collecting the blood and urine samples of the patients regularly every twelve hours,
      centrifuging samples in 3000rpm for 5 minutes, freezing at -80℃, all patients' clinical
      information should be recorded by name, age ,sex, BMI index, hypertension, diabetes, cardiac
      disease, and so on. All patients have written informed contents and this study was approved
      by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine.NGAL, CAF and
      L-FABP was measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay with Robust i1000.
