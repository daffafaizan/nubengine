    
      Multinational, randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase III study of 1093 participants (age
      ≥ 18 years) with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed, stage IV squamous-cell NSCLC,
      who have received no prior therapy for metastatic disease, will be randomized on a 1:1 basis
      to receive first-line necitumumab plus chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and cisplatin
      in study Arm A, or gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy alone in study Arm B. Baseline
      radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 21 days prior to randomization
      (first treatment will be administered within 7 days following randomization). Participants
      will undergo radiographic assessment of disease status (computed tomography or magnetic
      resonance imaging) every 6 weeks (± 3 days), until there is radiographic documentation of
      progressive disease (PD). Chemotherapy will continue for a maximum of six cycles in each arm
      (or until there is radiographic documentation of PD, toxicity requiring cessation, protocol
      noncompliance or withdrawal of consent); participants in Arm A only will continue to receive
      necitumumab until there is radiographic documentation of PD, toxicity requiring cessation,
      protocol noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent.

      After the end-of-study-visit (following PD), follow-up information regarding further
      anticancer treatment and survival will be collected every 2 months (± 7 days). For
      participants who discontinue study for reasons other than PD (eg, symptomatic deterioration),
      information on disease progression will also be collected until PD is documented. Follow-up
      will continue as long as the participant is alive, or until the end of the trial.
