      With the increasing number of old patients scheduled for digestive surgery, exploring methods
      to decrease postoperative morbidity is very important. Noninvasive methods may be easier to
      clinically use. Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS)has been proved to
      decrease need for general anesthetics during anesthesia, and to alleviate systemic
      inflammatory response. Considering the morbidity and mortality after surgery is closely
      related to use of anesthetics and inflammatory response,TEAS may be a good selection for
      improving postoperative outcomes.Among the postoperative complications, pulmonary
      complication and systemic inflammatory response syndrome is with higher incidence, so we will
      focus on these two complications in our study.
