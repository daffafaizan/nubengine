      Nowadays, there is no scientific evidence from clinical trials regarding the efficacy or
      safety of different drugs to treat COVID-19 patients, despite some of them evolving to fatal
      severe lung injury due to important inflammatory process secondary to pro-inflammatory
      cytokines. Interestingly, Tacrolimus has been shown to inhibit both pro-inflammatory
      cytokines and, also, human coronavirus SARS-Cov replication, but it has not specifically been
      tested in COVID-19 patients.

      Our working hypothesis is that severe SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pneumonia is secondary to a
      deleterious inflammatory process; so, the use of Methylprednisolone pulses and Tacrolimus in
      hospitalized severe COVID-19 lung injury patients might have a positive clinical effect.

      Given the COVID-19 current health emergency, this study could provide useful evidence to
      treat some COVID-19 patients with Methylprednisolona and Tacrolimus, which might represent a
      new therapeutic option for them. Tacrolimus is a drug with more than 20 years of experience,
      and therefore, its side effects are well known and usually reversible. In addition, since
      tacrolimus is a low-cost and easy to produce at large-scale drug, it could be used to treat a
      large number of patients. The administration of this drugs could not only decrease mortality
      secondary to lung involvement by COVID-19, but also decrease the excessive burden of care
      that intensive care units are bearing.
