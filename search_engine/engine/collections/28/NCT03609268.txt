      for this study. The patients are divided into two groups randomly. Patients in group A
      receive MWA, group B patients receive SBRT. The 3-year progression free survival, 3-year
      local recurrence free survival, 3-year overall survival and other endpoints events were
      recorded and analyzed, to assess whether SBRT is non-inferior to MWA.
