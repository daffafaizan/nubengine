    
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia in
      children. The clinical course is typically self-limited and benign; however, rare cases of
      severe pneumonia can develop despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. The investigators aim to
      study the effects of prednisolone on severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with lobar consolidation
      or pleural effusion in children. Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to
      receive either prednisone 1 mg/kg/d daily for 5 days or none. The primary endpoint was fever
      duration and analysed by intention to treat.
