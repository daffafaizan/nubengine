    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the complete molecular response rate in cohort 1 (newly diagnosed Philadelphia
      chromosome [Ph-positive] and/or BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) and the
      overall response (complete remission [CR]+CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]) rate
      in cohort 2 (relapsed/refractory disease).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other clinical efficacy endpoints (complete cytogenetic response, complete
      molecular response [CMR], event-free survival [EFS] and overall survival [OS]) and safety of
      the regimen.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the role of ABL1 kinase domain mutations on treatment failure and relapse
      in patients with Ph+ ALL treated with blinatumomab plus ponatinib.

      II. To determine the impact of recurrent genomic alterations and ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      expression at diagnosis on relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients with Ph+ ALL treated with
      blinatumomab plus ponatinib.

      III. To investigate the impact of next-generation sequencing-based minimal residual disease
      assessment on relapse-free survival in patients with Ph+ ALL.

      IV. To determine the effect on immune cell subsets in patients with Ph+ ALL treated with
      blinatumomab plus ponatinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) nonstop on days 1-28 of cycles 1-5, and
      methotrexate and cytarabine intrathecally (by spinal tap) on days 1, 15, and 29 of cycles
      1-4. Patients also receive ponatinib orally (PO) daily. Cycles repeat every 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6 months
      thereafter.
