      weight, smoking history and the type of procedures performed during bronchoscopy shall be
      recorded. A written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The patients who
      undergo flexible bronchoscopy would be randomised in a one is to one ratio either to
      nebulized lignocaine (4%) or saline (placebo) nebulization group. Prior to the bronchoscopy
      blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and pulse oximetry saturation will be recorded
      at the baseline Patients in both the groups shall be prepared in a similar fashion except for
      the nebulized lignocaine. Patient, Operator, outcome assessor will be blinded to the
      allocation.

      During the procedure, 1.5ml aliquots of 1% lignocaine will be delivered through the
      bronchoscope using spray-as-you go technique. The patients would be monitored for any adverse
      effects throughout the procedure. The bronchoscopist doing the procedure will be provided 2
      VAS charts to mark the severity of cough and overall procedure satisfaction.

      Post procedure, patients will record the pain experienced while undergoing the procedure on
