      differentiate into chondrocytes, promote endogenous tissue repair, and have potent
      anti-inflammatory properties.

      Early studies show promising clinical results using ADSCs to treat patients with
      osteoarthritis, but no clinical trials have been completed comparing cellular therapy to
      standard arthroscopic treatment.

      The investigators aim to determine whether ADSC transplantation as adjuvant therapy in
      patients with arthroscopic findings of mild to moderate arthritis will result in improved
      clinical outcomes scores at one and two-year follow-up compared to standard arthroscopic
      treatment.
