      temperatures, designed to have a composition of healthy fats (predominantly monounsaturated
      fats and with less than 10% palmitic acid) and to contain an abundance of antioxidants
      typically found in olive oil (phenolic compounds), will improve the vasodilatory response
      that depends on the endothelium, and buffer the inflammatory and postprandial oxidative
      response that is produced by the oils that are being used ever more frequently for frying
      purposes (sunflower oil and oil to which butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) has been added),
      using virgin olive oil exposed to the same heating regime as a reference oil.
