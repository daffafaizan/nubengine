      pathway have been well documented in atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) patients.
      Research in recent years has identified more than 120 different mutations, accounting for
      around 40%-60% of cases, in the genes encoding complement factor H (CFH), membrane cofactor
      protein (MCP), complement factor I (CFI), C3, complement factor B (CFB), and thrombomodulin
      (THBD). A therapeutic approach could be the administration of molecules that
      pharmacologically target complement activation, which is the primary common pathogenic
      mechanism in all genetic forms of aHUS. Eculizumab has been successfully used as prophylaxis
      of aHUS recurrences in subjects with plasma dependent or plasma resistant disease or in renal
      transplant recipients at high risk of recurrence due to CFH, CFI, or C3 complement gene
      mutations. However the drug must be administered chronically and drug spacing or
      discontinuance was associated with disease recurrence in the graft. The C5aR receptor
      antagonist CCX168 could present an appealing alternative to eculizumab for post-transplant
      prophylaxis of aHUS recurrences since it is orally administrable with lower cost of goods. In
      addition, CCX168 is theoretically associated with lower risk of infections than eculizumab
      since the former does not target C5b and leaves the terminal complement pathway intact.
