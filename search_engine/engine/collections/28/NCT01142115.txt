      with spinal cord injury and neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

      Coloplast has developed a new intermittent catheter. In this investigation this new test
      catheter will be compared with SpeediCath by assessing discomfort and pain associated with
      catheterization of healthy men. The reason for choosing healthy men is that many catheter
      users do not have full feeling in their urethra and therefore can not assess the discomfort.

      Healthy men who are â‰¥ 18 years and have no signs of urinary tract infection and do not have
      abnormalities, disease or have had operational interventions in the urinary tract will be
      included. They are recruited through advertisements on the website www.forsoegsperson.dk.
