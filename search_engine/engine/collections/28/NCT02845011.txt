    
      A prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel study was conducted in patients undergoing
      resuscitation with chest compression for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in the mixed
      medical-surgical ICU's of 8 academic tertiary care hospitals in Iran. Patients randomized
      into 2 groups: 1) standard chest compression, 2) chest compression with real-time
      audio-visual feedback using the Cardio First Angel™ (INOTECH, Nubberg, Germany) device.
      Randomization accomplished using Random Allocation Software© (RAS; Informer Technologies,
      Inc., Madrid, Spain). Crossover was not allowed. The patient and data analyzer were blinded.
      The clinical provider was not blinded. The primary outcome was sustained return of
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Secondary outcomes were survival to ICU and hospital
      discharge, incidence of sternum and rib fractures.
