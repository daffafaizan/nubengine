      hypothesis is that taVNS alone (sham rTMS + active taVNS) will induce increases in motor
      cortex excitability (post-stimulation compared to baseline). The investigators expect these
      changes will be of a lesser magnitude than those of TMS alone (active rTMS + sham taVNS) due
      to the indirect mechanistic approach of taVNS. Another aim is to determine whether
      taVNS-paired TMS is more effective at inducing cortical excitability than TMS alone, as it is
      hypothesized that pairing two forms of neuromodulation (active rTMS + active taVNS) will
      increase TMS-induced cortical excitability in the motor cortex when compared to single
      modality approaches (active rTMS + sham taVNS; sham rTMS + active taVNS). Furthermore, it is
      expected that this increase is timing sensitive, and the paired approach will induce larger
      TMS-induced cortical excitability compared to unpaired neuromodulation (active taVNS + active
      taVNS).
