    
      This research study is a Pilot clinical trial, which is the first time investigators are
      examining this study intervention.

      This study tests the safety of the investigational intervention (MRI imaging with
      Ferumoxytol) and assesses the feasibility of identifying malignant lymph nodes (lymph nodes
      that have tumor in them) by comparing the experimental MRI findings with the final pathology
      report from surgery.

      This iron-based agent currently has approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for use in iron replacement therapy, however, its use in MRI imaging is not FDA-approved and
      is thus experimental in this trial.
