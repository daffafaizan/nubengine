      their total body surface area, or their family members will be approached on admission to
      Parkland Memorial Hospital and informed of the study. Those electing to participate in the
      study will be randomized to receive either high-dose vitamin C (66mg/kg/hr for the first 24
      hours, this dosage is based on prior human studies) in addition to the standard resuscitation
      algorithm (as per the Parkland Formula) or to a control group receiving only the standard
      resuscitation algorithm. These subjects will then be followed during their hospital course
      for fluid requirements, urine output, infectious complication rates, liver/renal failure
      rates, abdominal compartment syndrome rates, and outcomes such as ICU days, total hospital
      days, and mortality. All adverse events will be monitored by a data safety monitoring board.
      Currently this is a planned pilot study with a future multi-center study planned based on the
      results of the pilot. These studies will help determine if high-dose vitamin C can be a safe
      adjunct to acute fluid resuscitation in severely burned patients.
