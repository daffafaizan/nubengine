      education control. PST will consist of 6 to 8 sessions, distributed over 6 to 16 weeks,
      teaching participants a structured process of problem definition, generation of potential
      solutions, evaluation and choice of solution, and its implementation. The dietary education
      control will consist of 6 to 8 sessions also, distributed over 6 to 16 weeks. Subjects

      pyramid, types of food and calories recommended for people age 60 and above, tips on shopping
      for healthy food, food preparation, and healthy eating behavior). Subjects will be followed
      up to 2 years. Length of study is 24 months.
