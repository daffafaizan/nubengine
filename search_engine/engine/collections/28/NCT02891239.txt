    
      This study is a prospective clinical study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the
      PicoWay device for benign pigmented lesion treatment.

      Up to a total of 60 healthy candidates, who are seeking treatment/clearance of benign
      pigmented lesions, will be enrolled at up to 3 participating study sites. Subjects will
      receive up to eight (8) PicoWay treatments at 11Â±5 (6-16) week's intervals. Prior to each
      consecutive treatment, the investigator will decide, based on degree of clearance assessment,
      should the subject undergo additional treatment or proceed to the 8-weeks follow-up (FU)
      visit with no more treatments.
