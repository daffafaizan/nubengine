        -  Determine the toxicity of docetaxel and carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive
           stage III or IV ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer in first relapse.

        -  Determine the response rates (complete and partial response) in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine relapse rates and event-free survival and overall survival rates in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 2 . Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 6 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.
