      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dementia is a common problem late in the course of the disease and
      there is no effective therapy. Dementia severely impairs patients'' functional status and
      limits the treatment of the motor manifestations of PD. No effective therapy for dementia in
      PD is available. The pathophysiology of dementia in PD is not completely understood, however,
      as in AD, it is thought to be related to cholinergic dysfunction.

      The proposed study will determine whether a therapeutic intervention with donepezil, an
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, shown to be effective in AD, will improve cognitive function
      in PD. The study is planned as a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      cross-over study of the efficacy and safety of donepezil in PD with dementia. The study is
      being conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Northwestern University
      and NINDS.

      The primary outcome measure in this trial is the change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
      Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog). The secondary outcome measures will include other scales
      of cognitive function, activities of daily living, mood, and quality of life. Tolerability of
      the drug will be assessed based on the side effect profile, specifically, the effect on motor
      performance.
