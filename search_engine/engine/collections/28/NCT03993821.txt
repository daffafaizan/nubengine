      high circulating levels of FGF23, which in turn result in renal phosphate wasting and reduced
      (or aberrantly normal in relationship to elevated FGF23) levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D
      (1,25[OH]2D). Across these disorders the clinical symptoms are similar and often include
      osteomalacia (and, in children, rickets), muscle weakness, fatigue, bone pain, and fractures.
      Burosumab has been FDA-approved for one of these disorders, X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH).
      In single- and repeat-dose clinical studies in subjects with XLH, subcutaneous (SC)
      administration of burosumab consistently increased and sustained serum phosphorus levels and
      tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) and improved radiologic rickets, without a major
      impact on urine calcium levels. Positive results were also observed in a nonclinical
      pharmacology model of XLH. It is hypothesized that burosumab may provide clinical benefit in
      this patient due to the common underlying feature in this patient and in patients with XLH -
      abnormally elevated FGF23 in the context of low age -adjusted serum phosphorous levels.
