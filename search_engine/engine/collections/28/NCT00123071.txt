      Cardiomyopathy is an important cause of chronic disability and death in pediatric patients
      and currently accounts for approximately 50% of cardiac transplants performed during
      childhood. Left ventricular (LV) size and function are important independent predictors of
      outcome, and echocardiography is the primary way to assess ventricular function in children.
      Although there is extensive experience with this technology, data are limited on how
      ventricular function changes over time in children, which is a major impediment to conducting
      controlled trials of therapy in children.

      This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Boards/Research Ethics Boards of all
      participating clinical centers:

      Washington University, St. Louis, MO

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This observational study will prospectively evaluate pediatric patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy who are undergoing clinically indicated echocardiographic evaluation of LV
      function. Patients who undergo at least two echocardiograms 3 to 18 months apart will have
      their studies performed by the same ultrasonographer. All studies will be sent to the core
      laboratory for evaluation of variability in LV mass, volume, and ejection fraction.
