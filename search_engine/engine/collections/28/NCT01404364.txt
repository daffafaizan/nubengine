      with the intensity of pain, and topical eye drops and contact lens therapy are effective in
      many patients. In refractory cases, and without vision, surgical removal of the eye through
      enucleation is considered classical therapy. As less invasive alternatives we have
      cyclodestruction and neurolytic drug injection in order to promote analgesia for a prolonged
      period.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone and
      retrobulbar chlorpromazine as alternatives in the management of This is a prospective study
      of patients with blind painful eyes not responsive to topical treatment and with no
      indication for evisceration seen at the Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Governador
      Celso Ramos (HGCR) in 2010.
