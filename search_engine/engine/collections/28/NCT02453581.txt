      characterize the effectiveness of OZ439 against early blood stage Plasmodium Falciparum
      infection.

      The study was conducted in three cohorts (n=8) using different doses of OZ439. Dose
      escalation took place after review of the observed OZ439 safety and pharmacodynamic outcome
      for the previous cohort by the Safety Review Team.

      Single doses of 100 mg, 200 mg and 500 mg were administered orally to participants in Cohort
      1, Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 respectively.
