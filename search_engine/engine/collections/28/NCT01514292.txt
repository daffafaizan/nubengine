      reference venous sample measurements. The device performance will be primarily evaluated in
      terms of point and rate accuracy of the G4 System in reference to YSI. The trend accuracy of
      the device performance, i.e., continuous glucose error grid analysis, will be evaluated as
      well as the temporal G4 System accuracy at different glucose rates of changes and different
      glucose ranges (hypoglycemic, euglycemic, and hyperglycemic ranges). The primary matched
      paired (Sensor-YSI) measurements will be collected during multiple in-clinic days.
