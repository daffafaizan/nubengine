      management in type 2 patients in India. It will be an interventional post-market,
      prospective, multi-center study with a data review performed after 30 subjects have completed
      the trial.

      During the course of the study, patients will undergo two iPro2 evaluations:

        -  First iPro2 test (Visit 1 [application] & 2 [removal])

        -  Second iPro2 test (Visit 3 [application] & 4 [removal])

      Patient and HCP questionnaires will be administered at Visit 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. These
      questionnaires aim to assess the impact of an iPro2 evaluation on the physicians
      understanding of their patient's metabolic fluctuations and its support of therapeutic
      interventions. They will also investigate the subjects understanding (both pre & post iPro2
      evaluation) of the concept of glycemic variability and the importance of compliance to HCP
      recommendations.
