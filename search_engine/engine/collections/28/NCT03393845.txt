      hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The study will enroll 47 patients to
      evaluate the anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab with fulvestrant as measured by RECIST 1.1
      tumor response and by progression free survival. We expect that if the immune response is
      augmented by the addition of pembrolizumab, significant change in durability of response will
      be noted.

      Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab dosed at 200 mg intravenous infusion in
      combination with standard fulvestrant 500mg intramuscular injection.
