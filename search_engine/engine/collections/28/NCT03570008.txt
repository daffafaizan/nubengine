      activity on microarchitectural bone parameters (porosity and density of cortical and
      trabecular), in prevention of bone fragility among premenopausal women.

      In the present protocol, parameters are measured on four occasions (baseline, 10 days, at 6
      months and at 12 months).

      Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata software (version 13; Stata-Corp, College
      Station, Tex., USA). All statistical tests will be two-sided and p<0.05 will be considered
      significant. After testing for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test), data will be treated
      either by parametric or non-parametric analyses according to statistical assumptions.

      Inter-groups comparisons will systematically be performed 1) without adjustment and 2)
      adjusting on factors liable to be biased between groups.

      Analysis will be performed using anova or Kruskal-Wallis (KW) tests. When appropriate
      (p<0.05), a post-hoc test for multiple comparisons (Tukey-Kramer after anova and Dunn post
      KW) will be used. Linear regression (with logarithmic transformation if necessary)
      considering an adjustment on covariates fixed according to epidemiological relevance and
      observance to physical activity will complete the analysis. Relations between quantitative
      outcomes will be analyzed using correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman) and compared
      with Chi-squared or Fischer test. Longitudinal data will be treated using mixt-model analyses
      in order to treat fixed effects group, time and group x time interaction taking into account
      between and within participant variability.
