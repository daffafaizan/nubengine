      during their lifetime. HPV infection can result in anogenital cancer and genital warts. These
      diseases are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Every year, 471,000 cases
      of cervical cancer are diagnosed worldwide. The 5-year survival for this disease is ~70%. The
      incidence of HPV-related anal cancer has doubled in the last 25 years. Screening programs to
      detect early disease are not available. Genital warts cause significant morbidity. Therefore,
      a prophylactic vaccine that reduces HPV infection will greatly reduce the burden of HPV
      disease. This study aims to demonstrate the immunogenicity of quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18
      vaccination (Gardasil. Merck) by current recommended dose/schedule (day 1, and month 7) in
      CKD stage IV-V patients and to compare the immunogenicity of the vaccine in CKD stage IV-V
      patients and non-CKD subjects in historical cohort data.
