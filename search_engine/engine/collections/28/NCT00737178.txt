      are also at high risk for repeat pregnancy. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are among the most
      effective reversible methods. IUD insertion is routinely planned for at least four weeks
      after medication abortion. This leaves women vulnerable to pregnancy while waiting for IUD
      placement, and many will not return for this visit. While immediate IUD insertion after
      surgical abortion is known to be safe and effective, it has not been studied after medication
      abortion.

      This study will recruit women undergoing medication abortion at Special Gynecology Services
      who desire an IUD for contraception. Women will be randomized to two groups: immediate
      insertion of the copper IUD at the routine one week follow up visit, or delayed insertion of
      the copper IUD at least four weeks after the medication abortion.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare six month IUD prevalence between the
      immediate and delayed IUD insertion groups. Secondary outcomes include comparison of IUD
      insertion rates, continuation rates, expulsion and removal rates, and use of any
      contraception at six months. Pain experienced during insertion and provider ease of insertion
      will be recorded. A diary collected for four weeks following medication abortion will reveal
      the impact of early IUD placement on bleeding and cramping. Lastly, we will correlate
      endometrial stripe thickness and IUD position to outcomes of interest: continuation,
      expulsion, and removal rates.
