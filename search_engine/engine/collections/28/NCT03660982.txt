    
      REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by abnormal behavioral
      manifestations during REM sleep. Previous case-control studies and prospective studies have
      documented the progression of Î±-synucleinopathy neurodegeneration in relation to RBD and have
      identified some biomarkers of predicting neurodegeneration in patients with iRBD, such as
      olfactory dysfunction, color vision deficit, autonomic dysfunction, tonic EMG activity during
      REM sleep, and psychiatric disorder. However, these biomarkers might precede the onset of
      RBD, as a result, searching for biomarkers for the neurodegeneration before RBD onset is
      helpful to map the progression of neurodegeneration. In this regard, the investigators aim to
      study the familial aggregation of RBD and its core features, and compare the differences in
      major biomarkers of neurodegeneration, including percentage of EMG activity during REM sleep,
      cognitive functions, autonomic dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders, between unaffected
      first degree relatives of RBD cases and non-RBD controls.
