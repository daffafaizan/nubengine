    
      Study being carried out in the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Infirmary of
      Edinburgh.

      The study is entitled "Is regular chest physiotherapy an effective treatment in severe, non
      cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis?" This is a small randomised controlled pilot crossover study
      assessing the efficacy of regular chest physiotherapy using an Acapella mouthpiece in severe
      non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. 10 patients will be randomised to receive full
      instruction in use of the Acapella device (twice daily therapy) and ten patients will
      continue with their standard treatment regimen. The study will be conducted over seven
      months.

      At the beginning we will randomly allocate them to receive either the current standard
      treatment regimen for bronchiectasis or to receive instruction in the use of the Acapella
      physiotherapy device for the first 3 months.

      After these 3 months all will receive the current standard treatment regimen for 1 month.

      Following this, those that received current standard treatment will receive Acapella
      physiotherapy device for 3 months and those that received Acapella physiotherapy device will
      stop this and receive current standard treatment for 3 months.

      All participants will be reviewed on 6 occasions (start of study and then at months 1, 2, 3,
      4 and 6). At each review, sputum samples will be collected, routine bloods, spirometry and
      exercise testing performed and health related quality of life questionnaires be completed.

      At the end of the study should patients have felt benefit with the physiotherapy with the
      Acapella device, they should continue using it regularly on a twice-daily basis.
