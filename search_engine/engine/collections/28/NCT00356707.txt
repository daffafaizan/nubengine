      increasingly important public health problem. In 2000, over 78% of African American women
      were overweight, and over 50% were obese. Several factors can contribute to obesity,
      including genetics, diet, and environmental factors. Individuals who live in an environment
      in which it is difficult to maintain an active lifestyle are more prone to obesity. The Black
      Women's Health Study (BWHS) is an extensive long-term study that is gathering data from women
      across the country to examine the occurrence of various diseases among African American
      women. Using BWHS study data and specific information on participants' neighborhoods,
      including street layout and the presence of sidewalks, this study will determine if
      neighborhood environments influence the prevalence of obesity among African American women.

      This study will use already-collected data on physical activity and body mass index of BWHS
      study participants who live in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago; there are no additional
      study visits specifically for this study. A transportation and urban planning expert will
      compile data regarding the pedestrian environment of neighborhoods in all three cities,
      including the nature and density of land use, proximity to parks, presence of sidewalks,
      speed and volume of traffic, and street structure. Census data regarding participants'
      socioeconomic status will also be collected.
