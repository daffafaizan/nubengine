      perform comprehensive breath analysis to identify compounds of interest associated with
      glucose fluctuations. More than 500 different volatile organic compounds can be detected in
      human breath. Compounds such as ethane, pentane and isoprene (hydrocarbons), as well as
      acetone, acetaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol (oxygen-containing compounds), are most
      likely to be relevant and measurable in our study population. Hydrocarbons are stable
      end-products of lipid peroxidation and show only low solubility in blood and therefor are
      excreted into breath within minutes of their formation in tissues. There is evidence for
      increased hydrocarbon production in states of oxidative stress. Oxygen-containing compounds
      such as acetone/acetaldehyde (ketones) are also clinically relevant in the measurement of
      insulin deficient states of catabolism in patients with diabetes. A previous study of exhaled
      isoprene was found to be elevated during hypoglycemia. This study aims to expand on this to
      characterize the full range of changes in concentrations of volatile organic compounds in
      human breath during glucose fluctuations.

      Characterizing this "biochemical fingerprint" of hypoglycemia may provide clues about what
      so-called diabetes alert dogs are detecting as well as improve our understanding of
      hypoglycemia, the physiology behind hypoglycemia unawareness, and potentially identify a
      novel non-invasive measure of blood glucose.
