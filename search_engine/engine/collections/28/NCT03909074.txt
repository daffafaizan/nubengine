      in children aged 36-71 months, and bridging trial between agegroup of 6-35 and 36-71 months.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the experimental

      evaluate the non-inferiority of experimental EV71 vaccine compared to the control EV71
      vaccine in children aged 36-71 months, and the non-inferiority of EV71 vaccine used in
      children aged 36-71 months compared to 6-35 months. The secondary objective is to evaluate
      the safety of the experimental vaccine used in children aged 36-71 months. The experimental
      vaccine is manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd, and the control vaccine is manufactured
      by Institute of Medical Biology Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. 600 children aged 36-71
      months will be randomly assigned in to receive the experimental vaccine or control vaccine,
