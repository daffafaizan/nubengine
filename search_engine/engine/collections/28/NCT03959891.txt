      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipatasertib as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The FDA has approved fulvestrant, the aromatase inhibitors, and palbociclib as treatment
      options for this disease.

      This research study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipatasertib in combination
      with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant with or without palbociclib.

      Resistance to standard of care treatment for people with your type of cancer is common.
      Stopping (inhibiting) an enzyme called Akt in the cancer cells may overcome resistance to the
      standard of care treatment. Ipatasertib is a type of inhibitor that is believed to work by
      inhibiting Akt. Through the different combinations of ipatasertib and the standard of care
      drugs, the chance of cancer cells becoming resistant to the standard of care drugs may
      decrease, causing the cancer cells to stop growing and spreading.
