    
      The design for this study involves the sequential enrollment of patients with documented
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who have had two (2) or more AF episodes for at least 30
      seconds in length within six (6) months prior to enrollment. Target population shall be
      selected from the treatable AF population that meets both inclusion/exclusion criteria.It is
      intended that the Vado Steerable Sheath will be used as part of standard clinical workflow
      procedures, with no procedural deviations relative to other procedures requiring steerable
      sheaths. Individual subjects will be studied during mapping and ablation procedures and
      followed until release from hospital post procedure per institutional standard of care.
