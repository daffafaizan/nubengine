      noted among Chinese American immigrant women (CAIW), but little attention has been paid to
      the effects of family-based (FB) interventions, especially for cervical cancer screening.
      Understanding the role of CAIW's family in promoting Pap screening and other influences can
      lead to the creation of more culturally appropriate screening interventions. The objective of
      this study is to test the effects of a FB intervention on Pap test intention and behaviors,
      Pap test self-efficacy, and perceived benefits and barriers to Pap tests among under-screened
      CAIW aged 21-65. This pilot test of the FB intervention will be conducted using a randomized
      controlled design with two groups only, experimental and control groups. Interventions will
      be delivered by bilingual and bicultural CAIW trained facilitators. Post-test and follow-up
      telephone surveys will be conducted at 2 weeks and 6 months after the intervention.
