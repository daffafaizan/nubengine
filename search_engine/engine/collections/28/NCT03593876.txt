      the feasibility of an adapted form of strategy training for people with communication
      impairments after acute stroke. The investigators will recruit people with aphasia due to
      stroke admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation units and administer the adapted form of
      strategy training one session per day 5 days per week for 10-15 sessions. The investigators
      will assess the feasibility of the intervention based on feedback from participants and
      therapists. These data will serve as pilot data to inform the design of a future clinical
      trials for people with cognitive impairments after stroke, including people with
      communication impairments. These efforts will allow the investigators to test new models to
      support optimal interventions for individuals with stroke-related cognitive impairments,
      including people with communication impairments who are among those most vulnerable for
      long-term disability.
