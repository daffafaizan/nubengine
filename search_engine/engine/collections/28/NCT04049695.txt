      attention, and concentration (known as cognition). Increasing physical activity has been
      shown to improve cognition in adults; however, little is known about whether this is helpful
      for cancer survivors as well. This study will test whether a physical activity intervention
      can improve cognition in breast cancer survivors and help the development of physical
      activity guidelines for cognition in breast cancer survivors.
