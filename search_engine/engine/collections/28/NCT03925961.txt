      operative and post operative experience to help patient's in participants' recovery. For
      example, the surgical community has focused on pathways such as Enhanced Recovery After
      Surgery (ERAS), to improve patient's outcome and surgical experience. Despite this emphasis,
      little has been described in the literature as to how surgeons can improve a patient's
      experience by counseling participants on what participants can expect before, during, and
      after the surgery.
