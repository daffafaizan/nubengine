      causing significant morbidity and mortality. GDM is a metabolic disease that develops in
      pregnancy, and may result in complications in the pregnant women, similar to other patients
      with diabetes. The prevalence of GDM varies in relation with the population and the
      diagnostic criteria. Diabetes affects 6-9% of pregnant women; 99% of the cases have GDM, and
      diabetes is diagnosed before pregnancy in the remaining 1% [(pre-gestational diabetes
      mellitus (pre-GDM)]. Hearing loss is one of the most common birth defect in newborns. The
      incidence of congenital hearing impairment is 2-3 per 1000 births. Early diagnosis and
      treatment is very important for the development of auditory pathways and protection of
      cognitive functions. Therefore, newborn hearing screening programs have been in use in a
      number of countries. Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and auditory brainstem
      response (ABR) have been identified as basic convenient and applicable tools for neonatal
      screening of hearing.

      Suboptimal glycemic control during pregnancy has adverse fetal effects. Congenital
      malformations, preterm birth and neonatal respiratory distress in the newborn are more
      common, at varying rates, pre-GDM and GDM. Compared to the normal population, the risk of
      congenital malformations is 1.9-10 fold higher in presence of pre-GDM, and 1.1-1.3 fold
      higher in presence of GDM. Despite our awareness on these important complications, the effect
      of intrauterine hyperglycemia on hearing of the newborn has not yet been studied in detail.
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) often causes hearing impairment, however little is known whether GDM
      is an antenatal risk factor for cochlear damage and hearing loss.
