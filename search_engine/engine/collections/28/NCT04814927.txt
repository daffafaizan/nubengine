    
      This clinical study will complete approximately 12 healthy, non-pregnant, HIV-uninfected
      women aged 18-50 years per contraceptive arm, who are at low risk for sexually transmitted
      infections (STIs) at two clinical sites, for a total of approximately 96 completed
      participants. The study will examine changes from baseline, pre-contraceptive dosing to post
      contraceptive dosing of cervico-vaginal mucosal safety and adverse events.

      Participants at each site will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to one of four, marketed, approved
      contraceptive dosing forms: Levonorgestrel (LNG) 52 mg. Intrauterine System (IUS), Copper
      Intrauterine Device (IUD), etonogestrel (ETG, Nexplanon, Implanon) contraceptive implant, or
      DMPA SC contraceptive injection.

      Enrollment is expected to take approximately 8 months and each participant is expected to
      complete the study within 4 months.
