    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of bintrafusp alfa in combination with
      docetaxel versus (vs) docetaxel alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival of bintrafusp alfa in combination with docetaxel vs docetaxel
      alone.

      II. To evaluate overall response rates of bintrafusp alfa in combination with docetaxel vs
      docetaxel alone.

      III. To evaluate duration of response of bintrafusp alfa in combination with docetaxel vs
      docetaxel alone.

      IV. To evaluate the safety of bintrafusp alfa in combination with docetaxel vs docetaxel
      alone.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate PD-L1, TGF-beta, and TMB as potential predictive markers of clinical response
      in tumor biopsies and in plasma.

      II. To evaluate biomarkers associated with inhibition of TGF-beta and PD-L1. III. To evaluate
      the changes in immune system using mass cytometry in response to TGF-beta and PD-L1
      inhibition.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and bintrafusp alfa IV over
      60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bintrafusp alfa IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who experience disease
      progression may crossover to Arm I and receive bintrafusp alfa alone.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 5 years.
