    
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) refers to a group of lung conditions
      characterized by airways inflammation, small airways obstruction and progressive loss of lung
      function. There are 900,000 people diagnosed with COPD in England and Wales but allowing for
      under-diagnosis, the true prevalence could be 1.5 million. Sufferers are extensive health
      care users; where COPD is the second most common cause of emergency hospital admission in the
      United Kingdom with direct National Health Service costs over £800 million per year.
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation programs (PRPs) aim to provide education and support for patients
      whilst improving clinical outcomes, however, attendance to these programs can be low.

      This study aims to trial a series of digital films aimed at educating patients about their
      condition from the comfort of their own home. Approximately 80 patients eligible for PR will
      be allocated to an experimental condition to receive a series of 10 digital films alongside
      their standard 7-week PR, solely to receive 10 digital films, or to a control condition in
      the form of standard PR (no digital films). Outcome measures such as PR attendance, hospital
      admissions, quality of life (QoL), disease knowledge, psychological need satisfaction and
      motivation will be measured pre and post. Analysis of this data between the experimental and
      control conditions pre-post intervention will provide useful information regarding the
      efficacy of digital film prescriptions as an adjunct to usual PR, or on its own, and the role
      this may play is encouraging PR attendance.
