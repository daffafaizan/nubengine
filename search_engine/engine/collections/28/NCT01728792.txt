      of various dosing schedules, routes of administration, and delivery methods in healthy
      flavivirus-seronegative adults living in a dengue non-endemic country.

      The study enrolled 80 participants. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the five
      treatment groups:

        -  Group 1: TDV SC injection on Day 0 in each arm using needle/syringe

        -  Group 2: TDV IM injection on Day 0 in each arm using needle/syringe

        -  Group3: TDV IM injection on Days 0 and 90 using needle/syringe

        -  Group 4: TDV SC on Day 0 in each arm using the PharmaJet Stratis™ device

        -  Group 5: TDV IM on Day 0 in each arm using the PharmaJet Stratis™ device

      This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was up to 5 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic including a
      final visit at Day 120 for a safety follow-up assessment.
