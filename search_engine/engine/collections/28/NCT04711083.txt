      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a prevalent illness showing a heterogeneous
      symptom presentation, which ranges from low clinical suspicion to evident limitations in the
      quality of life. The main reasons for this variability relate to its potential association
      with major concomitant diseases, which include diabetes and a variety of cardiovascular
      pathologies. (1).

      Also, OSA is a known risk factor for many comorbid disorders, causing resistance to
      conventional treatments and increasing the risk of mortality, which multiplies health care
      expenditures and even though the distribution of comorbidities differs between men and women,
      their effect progressively increases with OSA severity (2,3) Occurrence of apneic events and
      Reduction in blood oxygen and elevations in blood carbon dioxide are sensed by chemoreceptors
      in the brain and carotid bodies, which trigger brief microarousals and result in sleep
      fragmentation (4).

      Nocturnal reduction in blood oxygen has also been independently associated with the
      development of worsened glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes (4).

      Aim of the work:

      to assess the correlation between nocturnal oxygen desaturation assessed by overnight pulse
      oximetry and glycemic control in diabetic patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

      Material and Methods:

      This study will be conducted on all patients referred for evaluation of sleep related
      breathing disorders. All Medical files were reviewed. Data collected included .full medical
      history, demographics, measurements of weight and height, body mass index in kg/m2, neck
      circumference (NC), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, measurements of overnight pulse
      oximetryglyceminc control (measurement of glycated HB, fasting and 2h postprandial blood
      sugar)The diagnosis that was concluded after a polysomnography study.
