      laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is attracting increasing attention. SILS is considered to be the
      next major advance in the progress of minimally invasive surgical approaches to colorectal
      disease that is more feasible in generalized use. In most previous studies, SILS for
      colorectal cancer was feasible and short-term safe compared to conventional laparoscopic
      surgery (CLS) . However, there is still controversy over its potential better cosmetic effect
      and less postoperative pain. Moreover, the long-term oncologic outcomes are still
      inconclusive as only a few studies showed long-term survival data. Up to now, most studies
      were limited to their retrospective nature and small samples. So more studies, especially
      large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the best indications for
      SILS for colorectal cancer.
