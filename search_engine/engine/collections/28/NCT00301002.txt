    
      Palmar plantar pustulosis is a chronic, disabling skin condition which is difficult to treat
      since it is often recalcitrant to current treatments and associated with high recurrence
      rates. This condition appears to be a T lymphocyte mediated condition and is thought by some
      to be a subtype of psoriasis. Alefacept affects T cell activation and induces apoptosis of
      memory T cells. It has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris
      and may be associated with prolonged remissions. There is extremely limited experience with
      use of Alefacept in Palmar Plantar Pustulosis. This pilot trial should provide additional
      information concerning its use for this indication.
