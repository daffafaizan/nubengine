      shortage of cadaveric donors and the rising number of patients awaiting liver
      transplantation. The long-term survival rates of LDLT are now comparable to that of deceased
      donor liver transplantation. Currently, two-thirds of all liver transplants performed in Hong
      Kong are LDLT.

      The ultimate goal of LDLT is to guarantee donor safety while optimizing the best possible
      recipient outcome. Donor liver steatosis is a well-known factor which could influence graft
      function and long-term outcomes of the recipient allograft, and also affects donor hepatic
      recovery. When needed, pre-operative liver biopsy is often used for the quantitative
      assessment of donor steatosis, with LDLT not recommended when steatosis exceeds 30%.
      Nonetheless, liver biopsy is limited by its invasive nature, sampling error and
      intra-observer variations. Imaging evaluation for the quantification of steatosis via
      ultrasonography or computed tomography also has various pitfalls. There is currently no
      universal consensus on the ideal method in assessing donor steatosis.

      Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a novel non-invasive method to quantify hepatic
      steatosis using ultrasonic attenuations to postulate fat content. It has been demonstrated to
      have good correlation with the degree of hepatic steatosis in both Western and Asian
      populations. The investigators aim to evaluate the application of CAP in the donor workup of
      LDLT and to investigate for its association with post-transplant outcomes.
