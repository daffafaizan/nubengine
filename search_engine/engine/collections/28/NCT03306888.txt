      change intervention in people with early-mid stage HD (Engage-HD). In a study conducted in
      the United Kingdom, self-reported physical activity, self-efficacy for exercise, and
      cognition were increased for those in the coaching intervention group compared to a social
      contact control group. This intervention has not yet been applied to individuals with
      pre-manifest (prior to onset of clinical symptoms) and early stage HD, where it may be most
      critical to engage in exercise. To date, no study has prospectively evaluated a physical
      activity intervention to facilitate exercise uptake in these earliest stages. This study will
      explore the feasibility and acceptability of the Engage-HD intervention in 14 individuals
      with pre-manifest and early stage HD. The intervention will entail one face-to-face coaching
      session (approximately 1 hour), and three remote video sessions (via secure Webex connection
      via computer or smart phone, or phone call if internet/smart phone is not available to
      participant) lasting approximately 20 minutes. Participants will also be given FitBit
      wearable activity monitors to allow for self- monitoring of physical activity for use during
      the 4-month intervention. Participants will be evaluated at baseline and again 4 months later
      on a range of exploratory outcomes including physical activity, self efficacy,
      disease-specific motor and cognitive function, walking endurance and strength. Results from
      this study will be used to make relevant adaptations to prepare for a multi-site randomized
      controlled trial.
