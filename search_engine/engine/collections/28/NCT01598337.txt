    
      Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a commonly used revascularization strategy in
      patients with severe coronary artery disease. Saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) are the most
      frequently used conduits for this procedure. Unlike arterial grafts, SVGs are particularly
      susceptible to occlusive thrombosis during the first post-operative year, which exposes
      patients to increased risks of death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization.

      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of antiplatelets (Tirafiban and Prasugrel) on
      the incidence of early and intermediate graft patency after CABG. Patients will undergo
      planned cardiac Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) predischarge (at 1 week) and
      CTA/coronary angiography (CAG) at 6 months to 1 year follow-up. CTA at baseline
      (predischarge) and follow-up CTA/CAG at 6-12 months after CABG will be used to evaluate graft
      patency.
