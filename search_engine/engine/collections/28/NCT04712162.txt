      under general anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway were enrolled. All cases were randomly
      divided into two group (desflurane or sevoflurane). Each group had 30 cases. Primary outcome
      was time to awakening. Secondary outcomes were time to wash-out of volatile anesthetics, time
      to extubation, irritation after awakening, and modified Aldrete score.

      Statistical analysis was performed by using Kaplan-Meieir curve and log-rank test for time to
      adequate depth of anesthesia and time to awakening; t-test for time to wash-out of volatile
      anesthetics; chi-square test for depth of anesthesia by PRST score, irritation after
      awakening and Aldrete score; Fisher test for adverse effects of volatile anesthetics.

      The research was approved by Gia Dinh People Hospital ethics committee
