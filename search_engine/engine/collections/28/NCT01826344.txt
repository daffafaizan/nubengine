    
      AnacondaTM Custom Fenestrated Devices (CFD) are designed for the endovascular repair of
      abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) for cases where the aneurysm extends superiorly very close
      to or involving the renal arteries, leaving insufficient neck length for infrarenal device
      sealing. The non-CE marked devices are custom designed based on CT scan data of the patient's
      aorta and regulated in accordance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) and
      associated country specific regulations as applicable.

      The proximal end of the AnacondaTM fenestrated body device is positioned suprarenally, where
      it seals and fixates in the vessel by means of rings comprised of multiple turns of fine
      nitinol wire, attached to the fabric with polyester sutures, creating a self-expanding stent
      which provides a conformable seal with the vessel wall and assists in anchoring of the
      device. Nitinol hooks provide secure fixation within the suprarenal aorta. The saddle shape
      of the rings allows the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or celiac artery to be accommodated
      in the valley of the top ring saddle in some cases.

      The objective of the registry is to provide long term (5 year) safety and effectiveness data
      of all patients who consent to their data to be used in the registry. This data aims to
      demonstrate that the Vascutek AnacondaTM Custom Fenestrated Stent Graft is safe and effective
      in patients with a short infrarenal neck of <15mm or juxta-renal abdominal aortic aneurysms
      who, in the opinion of the treating physician, are anatomically suitable for the AnacondaTM
      Custom Fenestrated Stent Graft.
