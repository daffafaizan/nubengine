      in Parkinson's disease (PD). FoG highly impairs mobility, causes falls, and reduces quality
      of life. Given the limited effectiveness of both the dopaminergic therapy and the deep brain
      stimulation on this symptom, it represents a challenge in the field of rehabilitation. In the
      last years, some studies described the effectiveness of aquatic therapy on balance
      dysfunction in patients with PD, correlating it to the safe conditions offered by the aquatic
      environment and to the physical properties of water. Nevertheless, the issues concerning the
      feasibility and the effectiveness of aquatic therapy for the treatment of FoG have never been
      addressed before. The aquatic environment may act on the sensorial peripheral receptors, thus
      widely stimulating the proprioceptive system. PD patients show an altered processing of the
      proprioceptive information that could potentially underline FoG. The investigators aim at
      investigating the effects of aquatic therapy for the treatment of FoG in PD patients
      undergoing a Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment (MIRT), whose effectiveness
      on several motor and functional parameters has been already demonstrated.
