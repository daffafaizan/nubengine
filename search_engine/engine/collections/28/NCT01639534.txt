      your normal care. This study will measure new biomarkers (biomarker is a specific
      distinguishing feature used to measure or indicate the effects or progress of a disease or
      condition) of neurologic stress called xanthine, hypoxanthine, and inosine. Blood will be
      drawn as a part of the study to measure these biomarker levels in your blood. This blood will
      be analyzed i the laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University and possibly at a future
      date at another institution. No names will be associated with the blood sample
