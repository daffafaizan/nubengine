      positive end expiratory pressure(Peep) by increasing inspiratory time. Moreover, the increase
      of Pmean was not accompanied by the further increase of peak airway pressure (Ppeak) and
      airway plateau pressure (Pplat), while the application of external peep accompanied with the
      increase of Pplat increased the risk of barotrauma . High level of Peep increased cardiac
      load and decreased cardiac output. A number of studies have found that the hemodynamic
      stability of patients can be achieved when IRV regulates the inspiratory / expiratory ratio
      in an appropriate range (I: E < 2:1). Therefore, the inverse ratio is considered to be
      superior to Peep in terms of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics.
