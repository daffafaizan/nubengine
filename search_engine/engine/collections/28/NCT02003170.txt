      every 88 children and dyslexia affects up to 15% of the population), the etiology of such
      disorders is not known. The purpose of this investigation is to identify common etiologies of
      neurodevelopmental disorders (i.e., speech delay, global developmental delay, autism) and
      determine if it is possible to find early indicators of the diagnosis and foster the
      potential for a better prognosis of these disorders. At this time the investigators examine
      patients with neurodevelopment disorders with various medical investigations, but the results
      of these investigations are not systematically evaluated. One of the goals of this research
      is to systematically examine this information in order to identify patterns of test
      abnormalities that have not been previously described. Another goal of this research is to
      identify the common etiologies typically identified by the medical evaluation, so we can
      further refine our approach. In addition, the investigators now have the ability to evaluate
      biological samples for biomarkers that have potential to be diagnostically useful.
