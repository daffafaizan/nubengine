      weeks. The exercise intensity will be monitored by the physiotherapist as determined by the
      participant's ability to complete 10 repetitions for a particular exercise and its difficulty
      of execution perceived by the modified Borg scale (CR-10). The exercises are performed with
      load between 60-80% of their capacity, the load will be increased from 2 to 10% when the
      patient can perform 14 full repetitions in the last series. It will be set to 30 seconds of
      rest between reps and 2 minutes between sets of exercise.

      Both groups will perform prior heating exercises bike for 5 minutes with moderate intensity
      with the Borg scale. Then there will be one stretche repetitions held for 45 seconds of
      muscle groups: hamstrings, quadriceps, abductors, adductors and gastrocnemius. Thus, they
      will be performed strengthening exercises in extension and knee in open kinetic chain and
      squat.

      The Posterolateral Hip Complex (PLC) add hip abduction exercise, Clam exercise and external
      rotation exercise. Studies prior point out that these exercises are among those withhigher
      electromyographic activity of the gluteus medius and maximus muscles.

      The Anteromedial Hip Complex (AMC) add hip adduction exercise, adduction with a ring between
      the thighs and internal rotation exercise.

      The exercises will be carried out to load 60-80% of 1 repetition maximum 8-12 reps, 1-3 sets
      and 2-3 times a week. All exercises are performed without worsening pain and intensity of
      exercise will be controlled according to the perceived exertion scale of Borg.
