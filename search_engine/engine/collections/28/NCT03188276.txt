      examined before DAAs therapy (0w) and at weeks 4 (4w) and weeks 12 (12w) and weeks24 (24w) of
      the therapy. The percent age of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and NK cells of the
      peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. The investigators discuss the relationship
      between direct acting antiviral treatment effect and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and NK
      cells activity in chronic hepatitis C.
