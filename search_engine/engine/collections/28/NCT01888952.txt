      activity of PDE4 and results in the modulation of AKT/mTOR pathways in patients with B-cell
      hematologic malignancies. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for the purpose of
      determining the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers as related
      to GC resistance. Samples are obtained at baseline prior to starting study treatment, on Day
      8 before the administration of the Day 8 study drugs (prednisone and roflumilast), and on Day
      15. If a bone marrow biopsy is also performed prior to study treatment or at any time during
      treatment, a sample will be sent for analysis. Normal PBMC (and bone marrow when it is
      obtained) will be examined for changes in key targets related to the inhibition of PDE4 and
      potential reversal of glucocorticoid resistance. Biomarker blood samples will be analyzed in
      order to characterize the pharmacodynamics of roflumilast alone and in combination with
      prednisone on PDE4 activity and on biomarkers, such as phospho-AKT, phosphorylation levels of
      mTOR targets.
