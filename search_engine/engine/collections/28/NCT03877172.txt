    
      Single centre, physiological crossover clinical trial in 40 patients in the immediate
      postoperative period after lung resection, equipped with a NAVA catheter to monitor diaphragm
      electrical activity (EAdi) and assess the effects that HFNC have on the respiratory drive and
      work of breathing as compared to conventional facemask oxygen therapy. Once in the
      postoperative care unit (PACU) and 1) after recovery from anaesthesia, 2) cardiorespiratory
      stable and 3) pain-free (see below), the intervention will start. The study will assess the
      effect of HFNC and oxygen via face mask on EAdi and diaphragm function, as measured by
      ultrasonography. HFNC and oxygen via face mask order will be randomized in a sequence (A-B or
      B-A) with the aid of a website (www.randomization.com). Each intervention will last for 30
      minutes. The oxygen-inspired fraction (FiO2) will be adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry
      (SpO2) between >92%. In the case of the high-flow nasal cannula, the study will be carried
      out with a flow of 50 L/min.

      EAdi signal will be continuously monitored and its signal later exported to a laptop for
      further analysis. At the end of the 30-minute period, a blood sample will be obtained for gas
      analysis from the arterial line and the investigators will perform a diaphragm
      ultrasonography. Ultrasonography will consist of measurement of diaphragm thickness and
      thickening on the right side during quiet breathing and diaphragmatic excursion on both
      sides.
