        -  Determine the response rate in patients with paclitaxel-refractory locally advanced or
           metastatic esophageal cancer treated with sequential paclitaxel and flavopiridol.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Obtain pharmacokinetic information about this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and flavopiridol IV continuously over 24
      hours on day 2 weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 1 and 2, and then every 2 courses
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-18
      months.
