    
      The patients included in this study with an acute coronary Syndrome be admitted to the
      emergency room and receive treatment with enoxaparin. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
      treatment in this indication is usually spread over a week. The experience of the study
      intends to focus only on the first injection administered in selected patients.

      Two assays are carried out, including an assessment of the anti-Xa activity initially before
      injection of enoxaparin, and 4 hours after administration of the first syringe.

      Clinical monitoring is intrahospital from the date of hospitalization of patients included
      until emergency exit (transfer to another service, or return home)

      Tolerance assessment (clinical and biological) is performed during follow-up.
