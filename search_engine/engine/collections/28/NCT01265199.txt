    
      This is an open label, multi-center, dose escalation study to determine the MTD of oral
      AT-406 combined with daunorubicin and cytarabine in patients with poor-risk AML. Treatment
      with AT-406 will be administered to up to 60 patients at approximately 7 investigational
      sites in the US. Patients will be enrolled in open label sequential cohorts of up to 12
      patients to determine the MTD of AT-406 in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Dose
      finding will occur during the induction cycle of the regimen. AT-406 will not be administered
      in consolidation cycles. Patients who require re-induction during initial treatment will be
      removed from the study and replaced (if needed) in order to assess at least 3 evaluable
      patients at each dose level.

      Clinical and laboratory parameters will be assessed to evaluate the toxicity of AT-406. In
      addition, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PDy) blood samples will be analyzed for
      plasma concentrations and PDy effect of AT-406, respectively.
