      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of CXCR2 and NGFR transduced tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TIL) for treating metastatic malignant melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether CXCR2 transduction enhances the ability of TIL to migrate to melanoma
      tumors.

      II. Determine the levels of CXCL1 and CXCL8 chemokines produced by melanoma tumors and assess
      whether this correlates with the tumor localization of CXCR2 transduced TIL.

      III. Characterize the clinical response and correlate with migration of CXCR2 transduced TIL
      to the tumor and levels of CXCL1 and CXCL8 at the tumor site.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -7 and -6,
      fludarabine phosphate IV daily over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1, and CXCR2-transduced
      autologous TIL and NGFR-transduced autologous TIL IV over up to 4 hours on day 0. Patients
      then receive high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8-16 hours on days 1-5 (up to 15
      doses) and 22-26 (up to 15 doses).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 6 and 12, every 3
      months for a year, and then annually for up to 15 years.
