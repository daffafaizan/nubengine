        -  Determine whether calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-γ (CaMKIIγ) activation
           (autophosphorylation) is associated with specific clinicopathological variables and
           outcomes in blood and bone marrow samples from patients with previously untreated
           primary acute myeloid leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Blood and bone marrow samples are analyzed by western blot using SDS-PAGE and
      immunoblotting using anti-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-γ (CaMKIIγ) and
      anti-phosphospecific (Thr286, 287) CaMKIIγ antibodies with signals detected via
      chemiluminescence. CaMKIIγ activation levels are linked to clinical variables within the SWOG
      database.
