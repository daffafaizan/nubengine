      tolerance test (OGTT) in 2nd trimester and followed up for 1month. A total of 60 GDM patients
      were expected to be enrolled. Using the double-blind method, they were randomly divided into
      two groups: experimental group and control group. Both of the two groups were provided
      medical nutrition treatment by nutritionist after GDM was diagnosed and CGM equipment (San
      MediTech CGM-303) was worn. Blood and urine samples were collected. At the following two
      days, oatmeal (SHIZHUANG) was used as extra meal at 10:00am and 15:00pm in both groups. In
      the next 4 weeks experimental group was provided with the domestic nutrition product
      (SANZ®KINGWILL), while existing products (GLUCERNA SR®) for control group as their extra
      meals at 10:00am and 15:00pm. In the last day, CGM equipment (San MediTech CGM-303) was
      removed and blood and urine samples were collected.
