      treatments by clinicians for a given medical condition. Unwarranted variance in healthcare
      has been associated with prolonged length of stay, diminished health and increased cost.
      Practice variation in the management of asthma can be significant and few investigators have
      evaluated strategies to reduce this variation. We hypothesized that selective redesign of
      order sets using different ways to frame the order and physician decision-making in a
      computerized provider order entry system could increase adherence to evidence-based care and
      reduce population-specific variance.
