    
      A single-center study with Norwegian nationwide enrollment. Data is based on questionnaires,
      patient journals, clinical examination, a set of functional tests and biomarkers, and patient
      reported outcomes. Clinical/ paraclinical tests are repeated after 2-years in order to
      measure disease progression. Both skeletal muscle, heart and respiratory function will be
      examined. At baseline there will also be performed a sleep study in order to find if they are
      prone to sleep-disordered breathing.
