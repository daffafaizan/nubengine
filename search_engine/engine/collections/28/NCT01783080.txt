      depressed individuals who continued to have impaired social functioning. The primary goal was
      to demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and retention, and obtain an open pilot sense as to
      whether there are benefits from this brief psychotherapy approach in this population. The
      investigators also planned to refine measures and estimate the effect size of any treatment
      response to estimate power and sample size with the goal of completing a future controlled
      study.
