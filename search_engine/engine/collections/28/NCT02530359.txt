      specific treatment for this pathology; the pathophysiology is related to inflammatory pathway
      and strategies that modulate this are potentially useful. The Pirfenidone (PDF) is an
      anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory treatment, in animal models has shown a beneficial effect
      on the recovery of renal function immediately after administrated. The investigators propose
      a triple blind clinical trial,in which septic AKI patients will be randomized in three arms,
      all receive conventional treatment KDIGO guides, groupPDF 1,200 will receive PDF 600mg every
      12 hrs per mouth, group PDF 600 will receive 600mg in the morning and placebo equivalent at
      night and Group Placebo will receive placebo every 12 hrs, all for 7 days. The Investigators
      analyze the recovery of renal function as a primary objective, as a secondary objectives
      clinical variables associated with renal recovery, biochemical variables, inflammatory,
      molecular variables and measurement of PDF in blood will be analyzed. Patients will be
      follow-up for 7 days and 28 days after randomization.
