        1. To use OCT to determine the type of plaque (plaque rupture, plaque erosion or calcified
           nodule) most associated with the presence and severity of MVO (as measured by IMR and
           cardiac MRI).

        2. To use OCT to investigate the relationship between the extent of tissue protrusion and
           the amount of residual stent thrombus with the presence and severity of MVO (as measured
           by IMR and cardiac MRI).
