    
      Secondary objectives:

      The following parameters will be evaluated :

        -  Evolution of CD4 cells and CD8 cells

        -  Tolerance to treatment

        -  Emergence of resistance mutations at time of virological failure

        -  HIV viral load measured with ultrasensitive assay (threshold 1 copy/mL) at Day 0, Week
           8, Week 32 and Week 56

        -  Influence of total DNA at Day 0 on the occurrence of virological failure or blip

        -  Plasma levels of dolutegravir(Tivicay®) and lamivudine in participants with virological
           failure

        -  Adherence to treatment

        -  Quality of life

        -  Medico-economic aspects

        -  Dolutegravir(Tivicay®) and Nucleosidic Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) levels,
           and HIV viral load in semen in a subgroup of 20 participants.

      Methodology:

      Pilot trial, multicentric, national, prospective, no randomized and no comparative.
