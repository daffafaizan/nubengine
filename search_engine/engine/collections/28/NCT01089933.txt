      of the early stages of the disease. The recovery from surgery can be associated with severe
      disabling pain persisting beyond 12 months after surgery. Research in pain has shown that
      early intervention of acute pain can prevent long term chronic pain.

      At The Ottawa Hospital, patients receive either paravertebral blocks or wound infiltration
      with local anesthetic for postoperative pain management. We would like to compare these two
      methods of pain control to determine an analgesic technique that will reduce acute and
      chronic pain, and maximally improve long-term functional recovery and patient's quality of
      life.
