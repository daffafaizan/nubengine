      Symptom severity was assessed by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) at
      weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Stable response is defined as a reduction of 50% or more of the
      HAMD-17 score at week 4 and week 6 of treatment. Receiver operating characteristic curve will
      be used to determine the cutoff point of the percentage of HAMD-17 score reduction between
      stable responders and nonresponders at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4.
