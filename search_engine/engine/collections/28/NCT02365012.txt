      receive midodrine or placebo then crossed over to the opposite treatment after three weeks (2
      weeks on midodrine or placebo plus one week wash out period). The control group will consist
      of participants with OH and PD being treated with midodrine. Basic demographic data including
      will be collected from the medical record of each participant after consent. At each study
      visit, each participant will undergo traditional measurement of blood pressure and heart rate
      as well as measurement of beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate using CNAPâ„¢ during
      valsalva maneuver and in response to standing for 5 minutes after sitting. Symptoms of
      orthostatic intolerance will be measured during the study visit using Domain 1 of the
      Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for Parkinson's Disease (NMSS). At the initial study visit,
      participants will also be administered first dose of midodrine or placebo. Supine sitting,
      and standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rates will be measured
      immediately before and 1 hour after the administration of drug or placebo. This blood
      pressure monitoring process will take place at each of the four study visits.
