      detecting active inflammatory lesions, and measuring brain atrophy to assess
      neurodegeneration. Recent years of MRI research have generated strong evidence of gray matter
      (GM) involvement in MS, resulting in the reclassification of MS as a whole-brain disease.
      Similar to white matter (WM), a primary target of MS pathology in GM is myelin, the
      protective sheath insulating the penetrating axons within GM and extending brain connectivity
      all the way to the neuronal bodies.

      This aim of this research is to examine if the associations between imaging measures of GM
      disease and cognitive performance can establish GM-based imaging correlates predicting the
      disease course and accurately assessing treatment results.

      This observational research will enroll adults diagnosed with MS both with and without
      cognitive impairment. Subjects will be asked to complete a single research visit that
      includes the administration of a MRI scan and a neuro-cognitive testing session.
