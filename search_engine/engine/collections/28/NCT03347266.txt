      transmission by glycine in the spinal cord, resulting in a reduction of pain transmissions to
      the brain. 5HT2A blockage decreases descending serotonergic facilitatory modulation on pain
      transmission by the brain and reduces nociceptor activation in peripheral nerves, which are
      primary sources of pain in post-surgical pain. VVZ-149 has been shown to have comparable
      efficacy to morphine in well controlled (blind, complete randomization with a positive
      control) animal studies using rat models of post-operative pain and formalin-induced pain.
      The PK/PD study in animals indicates that therapeutic plasma concentration in human subjects
      will be 600-1,900 ng/ml. A clinical Phase 1 study performed in healthy subjects has shown no
      clinically significant adverse events up to a plasma concentration level of 3,261 ng/ml other
      than brief symptoms of mild nausea or dizziness, and mild somnolence when the plasma exposure
      level is more than 2,000 ng/ml.
