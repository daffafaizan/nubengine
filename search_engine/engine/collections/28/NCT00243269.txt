      acupressure bands will expect less treatment-related nausea, which will subsequently result
      in less treatment-related nausea compared to patients who do not receive such information.

      This study extends prior research by utilizing a randomized controlled trial in a clinical
      environment to examine the efficacy of an intervention that is specifically designed to
      reduce patients' response expectancies concerning nausea development from cancer treatments,
      and, thereby, reduce nausea.

      The objectives of this study are as follow:

        1. To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
           expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management will result in reduced
           chemotherapy-induced nausea.

        2. To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
           expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management will result in increased
           health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients receiving emetogenic chemotherapy.

      To provide preliminary data on whether a two-tiered strategy to increase patients'
      expectancies for nausea prevention and/or management is more effective than a single-tiered
      strategy in reducing chemotherapy- induced nausea.

      The study contains the following arms:

        1. Control handout and control tape.

        2. Active handout and control tape.

        3. Control handout and active tape.

        4. Active handout and active tape.
