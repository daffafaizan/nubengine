      mono-center studies have shown promising results with the previous generation of the
      self-expandable STENTYS stent (paclitaxel eluting stent, delivered via withdrawal of a
      sheath).

      The TRUNC study aims at assessing at large scale the Xposition S in the treatment of ULMCA
      disease. The Xposition S is a sirolimus eluting stent, mounted on a balloon delivery system.
      The study aims at collecting clinical practice routine data from 200 patients.
