    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      intravenous dose of Imprime PGG versus placebo when administered to healthy adult subjects by
      assessing the frequency, type, and severity of treatment emergent adverse events.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. to determine the pharmacodynamics of a single intravenous dose of Imprime PGG when
           administered to healthy adult subjects by assessing the number of subjects who
           experience a 15% or more increase from baseline in the percentage of neutrophils with
           primed CR3; and

        2. to derive the pharmacokinetic profile of a single intravenous dose of Imprime PGG when
           administered to healthy adult subjects by assessing the plasma concentration of Imprime
           PGG versus time.
