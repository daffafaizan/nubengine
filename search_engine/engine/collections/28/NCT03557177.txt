      cancer treated with platinum based chemotherapy to diminish the substantial risk of
      subsequent cardiovascular events. A future randomised trial of statin therapy in these
      patients is under consideration and results from this pilot study will inform its design.

      Before moving towards interventional studies the proposed pilot study will enable a better
      understanding of the nature, time-course and dose-dependent effects of the mechanisms
      contributing to increased cardiovascular risk.

      Single-centre, prospective pilot study assessing the cardiovascular effects of treatment with
      orchidectomy or orchidectomy plus cisplatin based chemotherapy for testicular cancer.
