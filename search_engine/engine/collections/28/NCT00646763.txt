      which are cytokines, or growth factors. The doctor may also choose to use these growth
      factors in combination with chemotherapy to increase the number of stem cells in the blood.
      Both options are established and are effective in increasing the number of stem cells in the
      blood.

      Patients will receive one shot under the skin twice a day for approximately 12-15 days after
      receiving chemotherapy through the time your cells are being collected. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to receive growth factors administered either to their abdomen or to their
      extremities. Both shots will always be given either in the abdomen or in the extremities.
