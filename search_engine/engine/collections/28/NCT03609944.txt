    
      This is a sham-controlled, single blinded with a blinded outcome assessment, multi-center,
      randomized clinical trial of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with minor
      papilla endoscopic sphincterotomy (miES) for the treatment of recurrent acute pancreatitis
      (RAP) with pancreas divisum. ERCP with miES is often offered in clinical practice to patients
      with RAP, pancreas divisum, and no other clear risk factors for their acute pancreatitis
      episodes. The hypothesis is that obstruction at the level of the minor papilla is one cause
      of RAP in pancreas divisum; miES will relieve the obstruction, thereby reducing the risk of a
      recurrent attack(s) of acute pancreatitis. The trial requires a total sample size of
      approximately 234 subjects, and a planned enrollment period of approximately 3.5 years with
      total planned study duration of 5 years (minimum follow-up of 6 months, maximum follow-up of
      48 months).
