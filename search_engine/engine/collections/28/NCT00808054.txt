    
      It is a randomised controlled clinical trial, double blinded, with the purpose to compare the
      use of eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (lidocaine and prilocaine) and/or the oral
      solution of glucose 25% in the prevention and treatment of pain in preterm neonates with
      gestational between 28-37 weeks old.

      The pain evaluation will be done using NIPS scale, and also physiologic variables (HR, MAP,
      oxygen saturation level and crie) during two painful procedures performed in the neonatal
      intensive care units:arterial puncture (n=30) and peripherally inserted central catheters
      (n=30). All procedures will have clinical indication and will not be implemented by the
      researcher.The newborns will be randomized into three groups: A (EMLA and glucose; n=20),B
      (EMLA AND placebo; n=20) and C (anesthetic cream placebo and oral glucose; n=20).

      All newborns will be subjected to some kind of therapeutic intervention, the objective of
      this study is validate the application of control measures and treatment of pain for these
      two procedures that cause mild and moderate pain.
