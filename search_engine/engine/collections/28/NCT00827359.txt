           before beginning the study medication.

        -  Everolimus tablets will be taken orally once a day. Participants will undergo a physical
           exam and will be asked questions about their general health and specific questions about
           any problems they might be having. Photographs will be taken of the tumor to assess the
           response to treatment. This will be done by a CT or MRI scan. Blood tests will be
           performed every 4 weeks. In addition, blood for research purposes will be done on day 1
