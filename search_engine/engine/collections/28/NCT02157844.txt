      the screening visit and includes review of the informed consent and a DXA scan and the second
      and third visit for the study days. For the first test day, 3 hours of the subjects time will
      be for urine and blood sample collection, and to stable isotope administration (deuterated
      water, isotopically labeled amino acids). Subjects are allowed to go home after and eat
      normally. On the second study day, subjects will arrive early that morning. For the duration
      of the study, subjects have to lie in the bed (except for bathroom privileges). They can
      watch tv or bring and use a book/tablet. The research nurse or study staff will be present in
      the human subject area to assist the subject if necessary. Subjects are not allowed to eat or
      drink during the second test day, except for the test drink (meal) and water. One IV catheter
      will be placed in a vein of the arm/hand for blood draws. The hand will be placed in a hot
      box during blood collection. Another IV catheter will be placed in the contra-lateral forearm
      for a primed and continuous infusion of isotopes (isotopically labeled amino acids and
      glycerol). Each day, a total of 80-100 ml of blood will be obtained. Stable isotopes will be
      ingested and infused on the first test day and added to the test drinks and infused on the
      second day. On the second test day, subjects will fill out questionnaires. After completion
      of the study, we will provide the subject with a meal.
