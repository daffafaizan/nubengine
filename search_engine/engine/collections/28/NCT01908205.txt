      for social cognition and function, as well as likely involved in anxiety modulation and
      repetitive behaviors. The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator of this study
      have previously documented: 1) an association between ASD and a single nuclear polymorphism
      of the oxytocin receptor gene, 2) ability to measure oxytocin levels in the blood by enzyme
      immunoassay and 3) preliminary data to support safety and efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in
      the treatment of social deficits and repetitive behaviors in adults with autism. A medication
      treatment targeting the core deficits of ASD in childhood is highly valuable because it could
      influence the developmental trajectory and make further psychosocial interventions possible.
      In this context, we propose a randomized placebo controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in
      children and adolescents with ASD.
