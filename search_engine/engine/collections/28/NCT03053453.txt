      outcome of patients and comparing to that of patients with a standard technique. The study is
      also designed to evaluate the difference between passive, soft tissue controlled, pressure
      balance and muscle activated pressure balance. Prior to the randomized study, there will be
      an observational pilot of 25 patients. These patients will not be randomized and will receive
      standard of care anesthesia. The reason for the 25 pilot patients is to perfect the sensor
      guidance so all subsequent study patients will have a streamlined, consistent measurement.
