      esophagus causes troublesome symptoms, such as heartburn and acid regurgitation.

      Proton pump inhibitors, as acid suppressor, are the agents recommended as the first-line
      treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, approximately 20-30% of patients have
      insufficient effect on this therapy alone.

      DA-5204 is a medicine based on Artemisia asiatica 95% ethanol extract. DA-5204 has been
      administered to treat gastritis and gastric ulcers with antioxidative and cytoprotective
      actions on gastric mucosal damage. Therefore, we expect DA-5204 to be effective in reflux
      esophagitis (esophageal mucosal injury).
