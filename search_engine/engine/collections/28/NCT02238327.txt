      disease. We will determine the prevalence and risk factors for lung dysfunction as quantified
      by pulmonary function testing in HIV+ subjects. We will build on our existing longitudinal
      cohorts while adjusting for important co-variates such as antiretroviral therapy (ART),
      smoking history, co-infections, and illicit drug use. Evaluations will be scheduled at
      baseline, 18 months, and 36 months. (6, 12, 18 and 36 months for ART initiators at the UCSF).
      Study visits will consist of blood draw, questionnaires, pulmonary function testing, 6-minute
      walk test, CT of the chest at visit two. Oral specimen collection and glycocalyx and
      echocardiogram (visit two) at the Pittsburgh site only.
