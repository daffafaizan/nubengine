      criteria will be treated with the Cypherâ„¢ sirolimus-eluting stent. All patients will have a
      repeat angiography at six months post-procedure and will be additionally followed clinically
      at 1, 6 and 9 months and up to 3 years. The results of this study will be compared with the
      outcome of the GAMMA I / II as the historical control.
