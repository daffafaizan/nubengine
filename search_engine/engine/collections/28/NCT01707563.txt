    
      Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in
      the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). Penetrance of FBN1 mutations is complete but intra and inter
      familial clinical expressivity is extremely variable. The underlying mechanisms for
      variability are not understood. An interesting mechanism is that the expression level of the
      wild type and/or mutated allele may play a role in the determination of variability.

      Principal objective : To evaluate in Marfan patients, if FBN1 expression level (non-mutated
      or mutated allele) modulates the clinical expression of the disease in individuals from
      families with clinical variability (intrafamilial) and in independant probands
      (interfamilial).

      Judgment criteria : Correlation allelic expression level-phenotype Method : In Marfan
      patients with a FBN1 nul allele, FBN1 RNA will be extracted from a fibroblast culture.
      Allelic FBN1 expression level will be performed by quantitative RT-PCR and then compared with
      clinical evaluation.

      Number of subjects : 160 subjects, 45 Marfan patients in 15 independent families, 5 patients
      with the same mutation, 30 with a private mutation leading to a nul allele and 80 non Marfan
      subjects.

      Perspectives : To search the predictive factors of severity in order to ameliorate precocity
      of taking care.
