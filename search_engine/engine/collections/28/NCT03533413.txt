      pain occurs in 30%-50% of patients undergoing thoracotomy .Interventional therapies include
      epidural or intrathecal drug injection, intercostal nerve block, sympathectomy, rhizotomy,
      and percutaneous cervical cordotomy. Rhizotomy refers to the selective segmental destruction
      of the dorsal sensory rootlets to interrupt pain perception by the spinal cord. This could be
      accomplished either neurosurgically, chemically or using selective percutaneous procedures
      such as cryoanalgesia and radiofrequency (RF) ablation.There are many technical difficulties
      in approaching the deep-seated thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) through the transforaminal
      route.The spine is kyphotic - with the tip at T6 - and slightly scoliotic to the right side
      even in normal subjects . Spinous processes are acute, especially at T5-T8 level. Besides,
      broad and wide laminae together with narrow intervertebral foramina are other obstacles .The
      intervertebral foramina are further masked by the facet joints and the crowdedness of the
      costovertebral and the costotransverse joints .For all these factors, more guidance - other
      than conventional fluoroscopy - may improve the success of the transforaminal approach to the
      thoracic DRG. The investigators hypothesize that joining CT scan with fluoroscopy to guide RF
      ablation through the transforaminal route can enhance its efficacy and safety in relieving
      the intractable pain of chest malignancies. The current study aimed to compare the results of
      thermal radiofrequency ablation (TRFA) of the thoracic DRG under combined CT and fluoroscopy
      guidance with the classic standard fluoroscopy technique.
