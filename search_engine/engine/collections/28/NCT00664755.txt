      systematically investigating the impact of short-term ovarian hormone fluctuation on females
      as they try to quit smoking with the aid of either transdermal nicotine patch (TNP) or
      varenicline. Each participant will receive a standardized impulsivity evaluation and a
      laboratory-based cue reactivity assessment before the initiation of smoking cessation.
      Progesterone and estrogen levels will be measured at each of nine visits, thereby providing
      an index of reproductive hormone variation over the course of each participant's quit
      attempt. This novel approach of integrating a human laboratory cue reactivity paradigm
      directly with a treatment outcome study will permit us to assess whether or not smoking cue
      reactivity has predictive utility with respect to cessation outcome. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive one of two active pharmacotherapeutic interventions for smoking
      cessation: TNP vs. varenicline in a randomized, single-blind, double dummy design. While TNP
      has demonstrated modest efficacy in improving smoking cessation outcomes, there is some
      evidence that its efficacy may be more robust in men as compared to women. This project will
      provide important information about a) the impact of ovarian hormone levels on smoking
      cessation outcomes, b) the relationship between smoking cue reactivity and smoking cessation,
      and c) comparison between a new pharmacotherapeutic agent and TNP in women.
