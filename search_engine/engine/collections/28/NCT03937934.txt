      enrollment in the study. Once all participants are enrolled, they will be given weekly boxes
      of food which includes materials for a nutritious recipe and extra fruit and vegetables for a
      total of 6 weeks. The SNAP-Ed Educator and SHIP Public health coordinator will be present at
      food pick up to answer questions about the boxes, food preparation, etc. They will be given
      the option of participating in grocery store and farmer's market tours, as well as sign up
      for text messaging of nutrition information and recipes. At the end of 6 weeks, they will be
      asked to participate in a focus group. At baseline, 3 months and 6 months, they will be asked
      to complete a survey on lifestyle behaviors and food choices.
