      surgery. Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: control and investigational. All
      surgical patients will have failed non surgery options for 6 months (physical therapy,
      lifestyle changes, anti-inflammatories, injections) Patients in the "control group" will
      receive the standard surgery (open lateral epicondylectomy) . Patients in the "experimental
      group" will receive the same surgical treatment, with the addition of the bioinductive patch.
      This patch will be implanted during surgery. Then, using a combination of ultrasound studies
      and other measures, the investigators will assess how well the patch works compared to
      surgery alone.
