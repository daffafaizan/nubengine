      (cross-over), double-blind study that will assess effects of varenicline on brain activation
      while performing certain tasks. Prior to beginning the study, participants will complete an
      health and physical screening to determine final eligibility. Following a medication run-up
      and a 3.5 day abstinence period, participants will complete study period 1 (an fMRI scan
      while performing attention, working memory and emotion tasks). After a 14 to 21-day washout
      period the study procedures will be repeated with placebo (order of study medication
      counterbalanced). After completion of both study periods, all participants will be offered a
      13-week quit smoking program with varenicline.
