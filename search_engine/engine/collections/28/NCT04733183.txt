    
      Open label, randomized, controlled phase II study preceded by a safety run-in part in
      subjects with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma.

        -  Safety Run-in Part: Six (6) patients will be treated with 1000 mg/m2 dacarbazine (DTIC)
           on Day 1 every 3 weeks plus 13 µg/kg L19TNF on Days 1, 3 and 5 every 3 weeks to test for
           safety of the combination. Should unacceptable toxicities occur in ≥ 2 patients during
           an observation period from Day 1 to Day 21 (first cycle), enrollment will be stopped at
           this dose level and 6 patients will be treated sequentially with DTIC at 850 mg/m2 on
           Day 1 every 3 weeks plus 13 µg/kg L19TNF on Days 1, 3 and 5 every 3 weeks.

        -  Tumor Activity Evaluation Part

      Approximately 86 patients will be enrolled and parallel assigned in a 1:1 fashion to one of
      two different arms, as follows:

        -  Arm 1: Patients will receive DTIC on Day 1 every 3 weeks plus L19TNF on Days 1, 3 and 5
           every 3 weeks.

        -  Arm 2: Patients will receive DTIC on Day 1 every 3 weeks. During the conduct of the
           study, detailed safety parameters will be routinely reviewed by the DSMB.
