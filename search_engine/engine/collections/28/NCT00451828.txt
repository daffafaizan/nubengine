      there is considerable inter-individual variation in statin efficacy, and it would be
      desirable to identify markers that would be predictive of the magnitude of beneficial
      response. The effect of statin most strongly associated with improved clinical outcomes is
      reduction in LDL cholesterol. The CAP study was a six week non-randomized, open label study
      of simvastatin 40 mg/day in a group of 335 African-American and 609 Caucasian volunteer
      subjects. Measurements of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, as well as other markers of
      cardiovascular disease risk, were obtained at the screening and entry visits, and after four
      and six weeks of simvastatin treatment. Both baseline measurements and changes in response to
      simvastatin therapy are being used to test for associations with genetic polymorphisms.
      Significant findings are being replicated in other study cohorts.
