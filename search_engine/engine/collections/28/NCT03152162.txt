      System. The study will include a minimum of 100 subjects across up to 10 sites. The patients
      enrolled in this study may represent the first cases of the iTotal PS KRS implanted at a
      particular site; data collected for the first 15 patients at each site will be analyzed
      separately from the rest of the enrolled population. This will provide visibility towards
      determining if there exists a learning curve in the implantation process of the iTotal PS
      KRS. The study sites will be located in the United States.
