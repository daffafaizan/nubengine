    
      Rationale: An electronic nose (eNose) is an artificial olfactory system that analyses volate
      organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. Exhaled human breath is mainly composed of
      inorganic compounds, inert gases and VOCs. VOCs are exhaled in very low concentrations and
      reflect pathological processes such as inflammation, oxidation, infection and neoplasms. The
      perspective is that metabolic and biochemical processes in several pathological situations
      cause different endogenous VOCs to arise, were they can serve as non-invasive biomarkers for
      certain diseases.

      Primary objective: To evaluate if the use of an additional breath test (AeonoseTM) for
      patients with a positive FIT-test can reduce the number of unnecessary colonoscopies.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. External validation of results for CRC and (advanced) adenoma detection established in a
           previous studies (second study not yet published). (15)

        2. To evaluate if VOC profiles in breath are similar at two different time points.

        3. Acceptance rate of using the AeonoseTM device for VOC analysis in participating
           patients.

      Study population: Patients between the ages of 55 and 75 years old with a positive FIT-test
      referred for a colonoscopy procedure.

      Estimated sample size: 750 participants

      Intervention: Participants will be asked to breath through the AeonoseTM for 5 minutes during
      pre-colonoscopy intake and just prior to the procedure to assess reproducibility (with >2
      weeks in between). There are no risks, nor benefits for the participants.
