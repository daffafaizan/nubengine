      scores, SES, age and sex. Based on our 8 years of experience recruiting this population, we
      expect approximately 66% retention among eligible participants. Therefore, we will enroll
      approximately 107 participants in order to conclude with 64 completers. Participants will
      complete: a baseline assessment (S1), an alcohol self-administration session (S2 or S3), an
      fMRI session (S2 or S3). The alcohol self-administration session and the fMRI session will be
      completed in counterbalanced order. At the beginning of S2 and S3, participants in both
      groups will be prompted to generate positive events and related cues through a
      researcher-administered interview-based questionnaire. EFT group participants will be asked
      to think about and describe the most positive event that could realistically happen at each
      of 7 delays in the future (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, 5 years, and 25 years).
      In contrast, participants randomized to the CET condition, will be asked to think about and
      describe the most positive event that occurred at each of 7 time points from the recent past
      (last night from 7pm-10pm, yesterday between 4pm-7pm, yesterday between 1pm-4pm, yesterday
      from 10am-12pm, yesterday between 7am-10am, the night before last between 7pm-10pm, and
      evening before last between 4pm-7pm). For each time point, the participant will be asked to
      integrate the event and sensory information into concise textual and/or auditory cues to be
      used in subsequent behavioral tasks. Cue generation will occur prior to both self
      administration and fMRI sessions (S2 and S3) to maximize the relevancy of cues at both
      sessions.
