      into two groups (groups B and C). A group of usual care patients will be included primary to
      the intervention (group A). The groups are:

      A. Usual discharge with regular discharge letter to the GP. The GP, together with the
      community nurse, is responsible for the palliative care, including referral to a specialist
      palliative care team, hospice, hospital, etc., if necessary

      B. Discharge with referral to a specialist palliative care team. This is a patient-centred
      shared care model in which the palliative team helps to organise the patient's treatment and
      care

      C. Discharge with extra effort put into improving the communication between the hospital and
      the GP. The GP will receive a phone call from the doctor who is discharging the patient, a
      detailed discharge letter, written information about the patient's type of cancer and acute
      oncological symptoms, name and phone number of the community nurse and name and phone number
      of a specialist in palliative medicine, who can be contacted for advice. This is a shared
      care model, where focus is on supporting the health care professionals.
