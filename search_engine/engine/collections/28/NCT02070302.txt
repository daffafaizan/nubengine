    
      This is a pilot study, to assist with determining appropriate BOTOX速 (onabotulinumtoxin A)
      dosing and injection locations in patients suffering from CTS.

      Outcome measures will be obtained at follow-up at 6, 12, and 18 weeks post BOTOX速
      (onabotulinumtoxin A) injection and post saline injection using the same scales and
      instruments at baseline, namely Levine scale, JAMAR pinch dynamometer, EDX/NCS and NMUS.
      These measurements will be used to identify the effectiveness of BOTOX速 (onabotulinumtoxin A)
      in decreasing thenar muscle strength, appropriate BOTOX速 (onabotulinumtoxin A) injection
      dosing, and ability to decrease the inflammation, median nerve dysfunction, edema, symptoms
      of pain, numbness, and tingling often with associated with CTS.
