      will be included. Single-doses of 1 tablet of Naproxen sodium 275 mg and Nalgesin 275 mg will
      be given on separate treatment visits to healthy adult participants under fasting conditions.
      A crossover design is chosen in order to allow within-subject comparisons of treatments. To
      minimize the risk of carry-over effect, the washout period between the study drug
      administrations is set to 7 days. The study is open-label because the primary data collected
      are concentration measurements that cannot be expected to be affected by a participant's
      knowledge of the product administered.
