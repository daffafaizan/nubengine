      highest incidence in East Asia. Current American Stroke Association (ASA) and European Stroke
      Organisation (ESO) guidelines recommend bridging therapy with IVT for all eligible patients
      before indicating endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for those with large vessel occlusions
      (LVO). Nevertheless, the decision to use IVT on stroke patients with LVO is still debatable,
      with many arguments against and supporting combined therapy or direct mechanical
      thrombectomy. At present, guideline in our hospital advocates the use of IVT in all patients
      who meet eligibility criteria and present within the 4,5 hour window for anterior circulation
      stroke and within 24 hour window for posterior circulation stroke. Due to the overcrowded
      nature of our center as a high-end specialization establishment in Vietnam, it is noted that
      our door-to-groin time is sub-optimal. This fact inadvertently prolongs the time of action of
      intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator before the re-assessment of occlusion site on
      interventional radiography. Therefore, it is possible for us to better estimate the
      reperfusion effectiveness of IVT as well as analyse other factors that might have an
      influence on this rate. The goal of our study is to determine the recanalization rate of IVT
      and related predictor factors in AIS patients.
