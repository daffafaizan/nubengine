      To assess the anti-tumor activity of Doxil by assessing response rates in patients with
      hormone refractory prostate cancer with or without dexamethasone pre-treatment.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess and estimate in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with Doxil
      with or without pre-treatment dexamethasone: 1) overall survival 2) toxicity, 3) quality of
      life parameters, 4) dose intensity administered in both treatment groups.

      Study Design:

      We will perform an open labeled, parallel, randomized phase II study using a two-stage design
      to determine if there is sufficient anti-tumor activity in either arm to warrant further
      study. Assumptions made in this study: an unacceptable overall response rate is </= 10% and
      we will pursue further study if the overall response rate is >/= 30%. The overall response
      rate for this study will be based on the total number of responses observed defined as:
      complete responses + partial responses (both by RECIST)+biochemical responses (in patients
      with no measurable target lesions a >/= 50% decrease in PSA for >/= 4 weeks). Fifteen
      patients will be randomized in the first phase (to both Arm 1 and Arm 2). No further patients
      will be accrued if <2/15 responses are noted in a given arm. Ten additional patients will be
      enrolled if >/= 2/15 responses are observed. If there are >/= 5/25 responses then further
      studies will be pursued with that regimen. We will determine the overall incidence and
      severity of toxicities in both arms.

      Treatment:

      Arm 1: Doxil: Dose: 50 mg/m2, IV. Frequency: day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 2: Doxil: Dose:
      50 mg/m2, IV. Frequency: day 5 of each 28 day cycle. Arm 1 only: Dexamethasone: Dose: 12 mg
      bid po. Frequency: days 1,2,3,4,5 of each 28 day cycle.

      Number of Cycles for both Arm 1 and 2: until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.
