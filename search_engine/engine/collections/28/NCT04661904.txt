      Nevertheless, there remains no effective medication or intervention been approved in
      postoperative delirium. Recent research suggests that continuous theta burst stimulation
      (cTBS) has shown positive effect on improving global cognitive function in multiple mental
      disorders. However, the effects on cognitive function in postoperative delirium remain
      uninvestigated.
