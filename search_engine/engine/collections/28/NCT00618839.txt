      escalating amounts of StrataGraft skin tissue in patients with complex skin defects requiring
      sequential debridement and temporary wound coverage with biological dressing prior to
      autografting. The specific objectives of this phase I/IIa clinical trial were to assess the
      safety of StrataGraft skin tissue using a predetermined panel of clinical and laboratory
      endpoints and assess the efficacy of StrataGraft skin tissue by comparing the ability of
      StrataGraft skin tissue to the standard of care, human cadaver skin, to condition complex
      skin defects for subsequent autografting. In three cohorts of five patients each, the maximum
      amount of StrataGraft skin tissue applied to excised full-thickness skin wounds was increased
      sequentially from 0.5% to 1.0%, and then to 1.5% TBSA. Equivalent study wound areas on each
      subject were treated with StrataGraft or cadaver allograft for one week, at which time the
      allograft tissues were removed and the wound bed was evaluated. Infection and appearance of
      the temporary allogeneic skin tissue were evaluated at every study session until autograft
      placement. The wound was covered with split-thickness skin autografts when the wound was
      judged ready to accept an autograft. Autograft take was assessed two weeks after autograft
      placement.
