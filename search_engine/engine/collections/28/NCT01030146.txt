      history and ask you questions to see if you qualify for the study.

      This study follows the standard of care in managing patients with allergic rhinitis. You will
      undergo allergy testing with the skin prick test (SPT), a baseline NPIF (Nasal Peak
      Inspiratory Flow, where we ask you to breath in a mask) measurement, and a baseline
      assessment with the mRQLQ (Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire)
      questionnaire. You will be asked to continue drug treatment with nasal steroid along with the
      NeilMed Sinus Rinse low-pressure pump with isotonic saline as an add-on treatment. You will
      be given supplies and instructions on the use of the NeilMed Sinus Rinse low-pressure pump
      with saline to be performed twice a day for two months. You will be asked to come back at the
      end of 1 month and 2 months, where you will complete another mRQLQ and NPIF assessment. In
      addition, you will be asked to return low-pressure nasal irrigation bottle for testing of
      bacteria and fungi at the end of 1 month and 2 months. This is a safety assessment for back
      wash contamination.

      If you are unable to return for scheduled clinic visits, questionnaires will be mailed with
      self-addressed stamped envelopes with follow-up phone calls to ensure study compliance and
      minimal attrition C. Duration The time to answer the survey questionnaires will take no
      longer than 20 minutes on each visit. The entire duration of the study is no longer than 8
      weeks
