      Specific causes of this problem, however, have been difficult to identify, as BMFS occur
      sporadically. For the same reason, few studies have been conducted to find out more about
      these diseases and to develop more appropriate and effective therapies. Aplastic anemia (AA)
      is the most common of all BMFS. Other types of BMFS include the following: myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS); paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH); pure red cell aplasia (PRCA);
      amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura (ATP); and large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL
      leukemia). Though AA is the most common of the BMFS, all BMFS are closely related in terms of
      their symptoms and characteristics. This study will collect clinical and laboratory data from
      people with BMFS to identify the characteristics and biological markers specific to each
      disease as it evolves. This information will assist doctors and researchers to devise better
      therapies and diagnostic tests that will help improve the management of BMFS and cytopenias.

      Participants in this observational study will report to the study site for an initial
      screening visit, followed by study visits every 6 months for at least 5 years. At each visit,
      participants will be interviewed and examined by a physician. Laboratory tests, including
      blood collection and a bone marrow aspirate, will also be performed. Data collected for this
      study's database will be used to determine the prevalence of clinical events and laboratory
      abnormalities over the course of disease, to study the evolution of disease parameters and
      symptoms, and to evaluate current therapies and diagnostic tests.
