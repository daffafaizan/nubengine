    
      This study is designed as a parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial to determine
      if recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) patients treated with Bevacizumab plus drugs
      predicted by the ChemoID assay will have better outcomes than patients treated with
      standard-of-care control therapy (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician).

      Upon obtaining informed consent, all eligible participants affected by 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
      relapse of EOC regardless of platinum sensitivity (both platinum sensitive and resistant)
      will have a tumor biopsy or a cancer-positive fluid collection sample to undergo ChemoID drug
      response testing with multiple FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to a standard treatment arm with control treatment
      (Bevacizumab plus chemotherapy chosen by the Physician from the provided list), or to a study
      arm of Bevacizumab plus FDA-approved drugs selected by the ChemoID drug response assay.

      A stratified randomization approach for treatment arm assignment will be used with strata
      based on relapse number, platinum sensitivity, and study site to ensure balance within these
      cells.
