      the success of treatment and the progression of disease in prostate cancer. The method used
      to measure tumor oxygen levels in prostate cancer is to place a needle in the prostate itself
      through the rectum. Blood oxygen level dependent imaging (BOLD MRI) is a special MRI
      technique that allows indirect assessment of oxygen levels in blood. This technique is
      non-invasive, involving no needles. BOLD has not been applied in humans in prostate cancer.
      The purpose of this study is to develop a MRI-BOLD technique that allows us to non-invasively
      measure changes related to tumor hypoxia in prostate cancer. This technique may provide
      information that will be an independent predictor of patient survival, tumor recurrence and
      likelihood of treatment response in prostate cancer
