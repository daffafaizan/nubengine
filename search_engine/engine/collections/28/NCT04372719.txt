    
      In Part 1, the primary objective is to determine the viral challenge strain dose that has an
      acceptable safety profile and an observed attack rate of >60% (i.e., at least 8 out of 12
      subjects should be infected). After Part 1, a formal interim analysis will be performed to
      select the viral challenge strain dose for Part 2 by evaluating the primary objective of Part
      1. In case no viral challenge strain dose can be selected, the study will not proceed to Part
      2.

      In Part 2, the primary objective is to determine the infectivity rate in healthy volunteers
      of the selected viral challenge strain dose for use in subsequent human challenge
      intervention studies.

      All subjects will be screened prior to viral inoculation to assess their suitability to enter
      the study. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical centre for a single intranasal
      inoculation with influenza A (H3N2). In this study, up to 64 healthy subjects will receive
      the investigational challenge agent: 36 subjects in Part 1 and 18 or 28 subjects in Part 2.
