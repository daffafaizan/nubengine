      collaboration with central clinical and mechanistic outcomes with public health implications
      both epidemiological and therapeutic in the context of the pandemic of COVID-19, an emerging
      disease, which quickly disrupted health services including Brazil's Unified Health System
      (SUS), as well as the entire productive force and economy worldwide. Because it is recent,
      the basic evidence related to infection, such as incubation period, time of transmissibility,
      and seroconversion, is little known and the proposal's goals have the potential to redirect
      the vaccine. Exploring bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) that presents significant potential for
      immune activation, with recognized safety in decades of previous experience and clear
      potential in the context under analysis, with low cost and available, ensuring wide
      accessibility, especially in the context of SUS, on which it depends especially the most
      vulnerable portion of the Brazilian population, notably in the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Non-specific effects of BCG caused by monocyte epigenetic reprogramming may result in
      increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, conferring innate (trained) immunity and
      protection against viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 with the potential to positively
      impact clinical evolution, viral elimination, and seroconversion of COVID-19 patients.
