      largest comprehensive cancer centre in Europe. In addition to an in-house drug development
      program, phase I - phase III clinical trials of novel anti-cancer agents are hosted. In order
      to investigate the optimal use of novel molecularly targeted agents, access to clinical
      tumour samples is needed in order to determine which particular cancer type expresses a
      molecular "signature" that may indicate potential therapeutic utility. Understanding such
      signatures should accelerate the registration of new drugs for routine cancer therapy;
      offering the potential of selecting those patients with tumour types most likely to benefit
      from therapy. Furthermore, new insights into disease biology may be gained.

      Main research question/ objective - Are there features of primary melanoma or lymph node
      metastases that predict subsequent clinical outcome better than existing markers?
