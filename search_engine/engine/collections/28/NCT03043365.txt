      (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which vary in
      their relationship to cardiovascular disease risk. LDL, for example, is proatherogenic,
      whereas HDL is cardio-protective. Long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids (LCMUFA), fatty
      acids over 18 carbons in length with a single double bond, have been shown in mice to
      decrease proatherogenic lipoproteins, such as LDL, and reduce atherosclerosis. This study
      will test the hypothesis that LCMUFA supplementation in humans will favorably alter the
      lipoprotein lipid profile in regard to cardiovascular disease risk. In addition, we will
      assess other parameters related to lipoprotein composition and function, as well as other
      biomarkers related to coagulation and inflammation, which have previously been shown to be
      affected by supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids.

      This clinical research project is designed as a pilot, randomized, double-blinded, crossover
      study that will investigate the effect of a fish oil enriched with LCMUFA on lipoprotein
      metabolism. Subjects will receive control fish oil enriched in oleic acid, a monounsaturated
      fatty acid (C18:1), or a fish oil supplement produced from Saury fish (rich in LCMUFA) for
      approximately 8-10 weeks, with a wash out period of 8-10 weeks between the two arms of the
      study. The study consists of 4 outpatient visits when laboratory or research samples and CAVI
      tests will be performed. A 7-day food diary, pill count, and red cell membrane fatty acid
      levels will be monitored to assess compliance.
