      biospecimen repository and associated clinical database to be used as a resource for dystonia
      and related disease research. The second goal is to create and validate various rating scales
      for focal dystonias to be used during a typical clinical examination. Across sites, the
      investigators hope to enroll at least 5,000 adult patients.

      Subjects of this study will be asked to complete a neurological exam which will be
      videotaped, complete some questionnaires, and donate a blood sample. A study visit will take
      between 45 minutes and 1 hour depending upon which portions of the study a subject completes.
      A subset of subjects will be asked to return no more often than once a year for a one hour
      follow-up visit.
