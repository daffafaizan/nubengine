      body while SvO2 measures mixed venous oxygen saturation from the lower and upper half of the
      body. ScvO2 is more conveniently measured and less risky than Sv02 measurement although a
      central venous catheter is needed. ScvO2 gives knowledge about the balance between the
      delivery of oxygen and oxygen consumption in the body. Interest in ScvO2 monitoring in
      anesthesia and critical care has been debated. However, ScvO2 is still recommended as a major
      hemodynamic target of early resuscitation of critically ill patients. Even if ScvO2
      measurement is far less invasive than SvO2 measurement through pulmonary artery catheter, it
      is accompanied with morbidity.

      VO 100 medical device from Mespere LifeSciences allows a non-invasive measurement of SjvO2
      using the NIRS technique. Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) is a measurement of the
      amount of oxygen left in the venous system after the brain has removed the oxygen that it
      needs.

      On the same principle that a positive relationship between ScvO2 and SvO2 has been shown,
      what the investigators are trying to do is to show a positive relationship between SjvO2 and
      ScvO2 in order to possibly use in the future SjvO2 measured by VO 100 as a noninvasive
      surrogate of ScvO2.
