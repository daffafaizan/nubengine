      a Miller or Macintosh blade. Videolaryngoscopy is a widely accepted pediatric airway
      management. Videolaryngoscopes (VL) provide an indirect view of glottis without the need to
      align the oral, pharyngeal, and glottis structures. Some types of VLs provide also direct
      view of glottis with indirect view. Videolaryngoscopes can be used as a teaching tool for
      learners as they can visualize all the anatomical structures of larynx at the same time with
      the performer. VLs may facilitate the learning of endotracheal intubation in inexperienced
      users in the pediatric population. There are limited data on the use of videolaryngoscopes by
      anesthesia providers and medical personnel who are inexperienced in the use of
      videolaryngoscopes.
