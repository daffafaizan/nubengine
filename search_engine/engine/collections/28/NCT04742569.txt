      test characteristics. The sample size is derived from the minimum number of COVID-19 subjects
      required to evaluate algorithm sensitivity and specificity. A sample size of 200 true
      positive COVID-19 infections is anticipated to assess device predictive analytics. Assuming a
      six-month enrollment period, a 15 percent patient lost to follow-up rate, and a positive
      COVID-19 infection rate of 10 percent within the study population, a sample size of 2,352
      subjects will be enrolled in this prospective study.

      Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes of interest are performance of the BioSticker
      multiparameter vital signs wearable and the sensitivity of the BioCloud-based algorithms in
      detecting early onset of active COVID-19 related signs and symptom in subjects prior to or
      coincident with a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test and the specificity of the BioSticker
      algorithms in distinguishing positive diagnosis of infection from negative diagnosis of
      infection among subjects. COVID-19 infection will be confirmed by both participant
      affirmation and diagnostic laboratory testing. Additional primary outcome is the intuitive
      presentation of affirmative diagnostic results from the BioSticker early detection
      algorithm(s).

      Secondary Outcomes: The secondary outcomes of interest include correlation of biometric data
      indicators to individual-level experiential feedback reported through participant
      symptom-tracking and diagnostic questionnaires.
