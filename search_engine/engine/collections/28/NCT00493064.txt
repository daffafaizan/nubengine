      treatment for retinal vein occlusions than the current commonly used approach of repeated
      intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog) injections. The types of retinal vein
      occlusion that are being studied include central (CRVO), hemi-retinal (HRVO), and branch
      (BRVO) retinal vein occlusion. Niacin, (Nicotinic Acid, not Nicotinamide)a B-vitamin, has
      lipid lowering and vasodilating properties. The combination of Niacin and Prednisolone
      Acetate steroid eye drops as a non-invasive treatment approach was developed by the Principal
      Investigator. The Niacin dilates the retinal vessels, hopefully encouraging earlier
      collateral vessel formation aimed at bypassing the venous obstruction, thus restoring venous
      outflow. The Prednisolone Acetate steroid eye drops are aimed at reducing vascular leakage
      and therefore the macular edema in the eye while the Niacin is taking effect.
