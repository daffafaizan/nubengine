    
      * Purpose

      To compare the safety and oncologic feasibility of open versus laparoscopic distal
      pancreatectomy for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) of the body and
      tail.

      * Study method

      Multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial Noninferiority analysis Patients
      diagnosed with PDAC of the body and tail, without evidence of distant metastasis or direct
      invasion of adjacent organs, will be randomly allocated to either the open distal
      pancreatectomy group or the laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy group. Postoperative outcomes
      and survival data will be analyzed.

      * Number of subjects

      Sample size was calculated based on 2 year survival after pancreatectomy.

      pA: 2 year survival of open distal pancreatectomy pB: 2 year survival of laparoscopic distal
      pancreatectomy

      Null hypothesis: The 2 year survival of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is inferior to
      that of open distal pancreatectomy. H0: pA-pB≥δ

      Alternative hypothesis: The 2 year survival of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is not
      inferior to that of open distal pancreatectomy. H1: pA-pB<δ

      2 year survival of pancreatectomy (Shin et al, 2015) is 55.9% for open and 64.3% for
      laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.

      When α=5%, 1-β=80%, δ=10%, and one-sided analysis is performed with a power of 80%, the
      required number of subjects is 111 for each group.

      With a drop rate of 10%, the final number of each group is 122, with a total of 244.

      * Primary and Secondary endpoints

      Primary endpoint: 2 year overall survival

      Secondary endpoint: R0 resection rate, 2 year disease free survival, 2 year recurrence rate,
      complication rate, postoperative hospital stay, operative time, estimated blood loss
