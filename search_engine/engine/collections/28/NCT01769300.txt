      titration, clinicians caring for children with ADHD whose families are initiating stimulant
      medication at that practice will be followed.

      Two groups will be compared; an intervention group, which will receive the intervention-the
      clinical decision support (CDS)--, and a control group, who will not receive CDS. Over a
      6-month period, the CDS will support guideline-based medication titration to achieve optimal
      symptom control with minimal side effects. The study will track the care delivered to
      affected children by the practitioners and will assess the endpoints of symptom reduction and
      side effects. There will also be a sub-study within the larger study which will give the team
      a better understanding about the pros and cons of consenting parents over the phone.
