      and a femoral artery, inserting an RF probe that will destroy the nerve fibers in contact
      with the wall of the renal artery with a very small electric current.

      The method utilizes the energy emitted by a miniaturized device positioned at the end of a
      catheter. This catheter is positioned in the arteries going to the kidneys.

      Sympathetic overactivation, is reduced by renal denervation in drug-resistant hypertension.
      Several studies conducted in patients without heart failure showed that renal denervation
      reduces left ventricular hypertrophy beyond its only effect on blood pressure.

      Chronic over activation of the sympathetic nervous system is a major component of heart
      failure and involves efferent and afferent pathways between brain and many organs.

      The purpose of this Clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      EnligHTNâ„¢ Renal Denervation System in the treatment of patients with chronique heart failure.

      All patients will be on stable maximal tolerated pharmacological therapy for HFC prior to
      denervation.

      After the procedure all patients will be monitored as inpatients for 3 days so that
      hemodynamic disturbances could be identified. Baseline measurements, including BNP, echo
      Doppler VO2 and six minutes walk test will be repeated before discharge from hospital.

      After discharge patients will be followed up weekly for 4 weeks and then after 3 and 6
      months. At the end of the study, bnp, echo Doppler Vo2 and six minutes walk test will be
      repeated, they also will be asked to categorize themselves as feeling worse, the same, or
      better in comparison to their preprocedural state.
