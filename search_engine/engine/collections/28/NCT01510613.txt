      AL amyloidosis who did not achieve a complete response after initial treatment with both an
      alkylating agent (Melphalan or Cyclophosphamide) and Bortezomib will be enrolled. Patients
      who received 1 previous treatment, but who could not be treated with alkylators and/or
      Bortezomib due to contraindications, will be eligible. Twenty-eight patients will be enrolled
      in the study. The patients will be treated with the combination of Pomalidomide and
      Dexamethasone given orally in 28 day cycles continuously, i.e. until hematologic or organ
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. There will be 2 dose levels of Pomalidomide (2 and 4
      mg/day). A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used. If less than 2 of 6 patient
      experience dose limiting toxicity at dose level 1, then all other patients will be treated at
      dose level 2. There will be 2 dose levels also for Dexamethasone (20 and 40 mg/week). The
      dose of dexamethasone will be adjusted on an individual basis, considering fluid retention
      and repetitive ventricular arrhythmias at baseline, as well as Dexamethasone-related adverse
      events. The study comprises 3 periods: screening, treatment (with evaluations of response at
      the end of every single cycle) followed by the end-of-treatment evaluation and follow-up.
      After giving written informed consent, subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for
      enrollment in the study and baseline evaluations will be performed. Treatment will be
      continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed. After treatment
      discontinuation, patients will be followed for survival and any possible Second Primary
      Malignancies signals for 2 years.
