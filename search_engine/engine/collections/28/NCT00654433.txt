      child's normal cells including their bone marrow (which forms blood cells) in order to
      prepare their body for the umbilical cord blood transplant. The cord blood transplant is
      intended to rescue your child's bone marrow from the bad effects of the procedure. The child
      will receive 80% of a standard cord blood transplant followed by 20% supplemental stem cell
      called ALD-101.

      The study will evaluate if these cells (ALD-101) will repopulate the bone marrow more rapidly
      after transplant. This would shorten the period of time that the transplanted subject would
      be at risk for infection and bleeding and would also decrease the number of red blood cell
      and platelet transfusions needed.

      ALD-101 has been used as a supplement to cord blood transplant in twenty-eight children with
      genetic diseases and malignancy in one previous clinical study that is on-going.

      The main purpose of this research study is to test whether a portion of cord blood cells that
      have been separated from a cord blood unit (ALD-101) will increase the speed at which normal
      levels of circulating blood cells are re-established after transplant. This is the
      experimental part of this study. ALD-101 is also being tested to see if it is safe.
