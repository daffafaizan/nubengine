    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the intracranial objective response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] or
      partial response [PR] by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases [RANO-BM])
      with sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer
      with brain involvement.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate bi-compartmental progression-free survival in this population. II. To evaluate
      overall survival in this population. III. To assess safety and tolerability of sacituzumab
      govitecan (IMMU-132) treatment in this population.

      IV. To evaluate ORR by hormone-receptor (HR) subgroup (HR+, HR-).

      BANKING OBJECTIVE:

      I. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sacituzumab govitecan intravenously (IV) over 1-3 hours on days 1 and 8.
      Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study registration, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year
      and then every 6 months for 1 year.
