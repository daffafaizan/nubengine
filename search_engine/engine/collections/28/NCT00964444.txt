      delivered. This device is a platform with special sensors. The doctor or midwife stands/sits
      on the platform while delivering the baby, and using a simple physical principle: for every
      action, there is an equal an opposite reaction. Prior to building the prototype and starting
      the study, the system and concept has been patented (US patent 6,684,165). In reality, this
      is not really a medical device since it does not touch the patient and does not have any
      effect on the delivery itself. It is merely a new type of external observation of the
      delivery of a baby that happens to produce useful information (the force that is exerted when
      the baby is delivered).
