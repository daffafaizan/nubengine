      of up to 20 patients will be enrolled. Patients having undergone unilateral cataract surgery
      with implantation of a posterior chamber monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) who are interested
      in participating in the study will be provided an informed consent form prior to screening.
      Screening/Baseline procedures which include best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp
      examination, conjunctival injection, and intraocular pressure (IOP) by tonometry will be used
      to determine eligibility just prior to cataract surgery on Day 0. Eligible subjects will
      undergo iontophoresis treatment immediately post-cataract surgery on Day 0 and Day 7, and
      will return to the clinic for examination on Days 1, 14, and 28.
