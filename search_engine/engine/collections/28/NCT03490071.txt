    
      87 physically active patients (18-55 years) with (LHGP) who were enrolled in a
      cross-sectional study (Diagnosis and functional limitations in the young to middle-aged
      physically active population with long-standing hip/groin pain: A cross-sectional study)
      during the period October 2014 to January 2017 will be recruited to this longitudinal cohort
      study.

      A research coordinator will contact the patients and provide them with written and oral
      information about the study. Patients who accept to participate will electronically complete
      the following questionnaires. The same questionnaires were included at baseline, i.e., in the
      cross-sectional study.

        -  Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS)

        -  HSAS - Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS)

        -  Patient Specific Functional Scale

        -  Medical Outcomes Study short form 36 (SF-36)

        -  K-10 questionnaire

        -  Self-Presentation in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ)

        -  Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) Additional questions about
           treatment, medication, patient satisfaction and perceived change in hip function will be
           included.

      For descriptive purposes, the mean difference (95% CI), or median (quartiles), between
      baseline and follow-up assessments will be used as appropriate. Separate linear regression
      models will be used to evaluate the change in each variable compared to baseline values.
