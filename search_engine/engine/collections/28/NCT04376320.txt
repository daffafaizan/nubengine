      as a method of Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) for reconstruction of atrophic alveolar ridges.

      Materials and Methods: The current study is a prospective controlled clinical trial,
      conducted on 14 patients, having about 7 mm of vertical bone height in the posterior mandible
      above the inferior alveolar canal. They are divided into 2 equal groups, each consisting of 7
      patients. The first group receives customized ceramic membranes with a vertical height 5 mm
      above the crest of the ridge to tent out the soft tissue matrix, while in the second group,
      tenting of the soft tissue is done by fixation of two tenting screws, particulate bone graft
      is packed then covered by collagen membrane that is fixed by bone tacks (modified sausage
      technique).
