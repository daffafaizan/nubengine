      patients scheduled to undergo SAVR and 50 adult patients scheduled to undergo TAVR. Subjects
      who satisfy Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria will be approached for informed consent. Those who
      give informed consent will be enrolled. After induction of anesthesia, a computer program
      will be used to randomize patients to one of the 2 treatment groups.

        1. SAVR patients will get either Warfarin or aspirin

        2. TAVR patients will get either Warfarin or aspirin.

      Patients will be seen at 4-6 weeks postoperatively for Transthoracic ECHO (TTE), 4
      dimensional (4D), Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scan and review of medical
      history. Phone follow up at 6,9 and 12 months post-operatively.

      Data from this pilot study will enable us to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized
      controlled clinical trial to investigate the phenomenon of reduced leaflet motion/subclinical
      valve thrombosis and, possibly, its clinical importance
