      out phase. The screening visit of all volunteers before study start included volunteer
      information, signature of informed consent, anamnesis, medical history, ECG and blood routine
      analysis.

      Efficacy parameters were measured at visit 1, 2, 3, and 4. Endothelial function and
      postprandial endothelial Reaction was tested using EndoPAT (validated diagnosis tool). Blood
      pressure was measured by volunteers over a period of 7 days before each visit. As additional
      parameters homocysteine and ADMA (assymmetric dimethyl arginine) were determed. For safety
      evaluation AEs (Adverse Events), CC (compliance control), tolerability, blood routine
      parameters and vital signs were assessed.
