      However, empirical studies which have investigated the competence-outcome relationship were
      only based on correlational analyses. Therefore, these studies are inappropriate for the
      investigation of causal relationships. In previous studies, feedback on therapists'
      competencies was found to be suitable for enhancing such competencies. Therefore, in the
      current research project, competence-feedback should be used to enhance therapeutic
      competencies systematically, in order to investigate the causal impact of these competencies
      on therapy outcome. Using a randomized controlled study design, n = 58 treatments of patients
      with depression were to be conducted under a feedback-condition, in which the therapist would
      receive feedback five times within 20 treatment sessions. The competence-feedback includes
      detailed feedback about 14 different aspects of therapist behavior. The control group
      includes n = 58 further treatments within which therapists do not receive any
      competence-feedback (treatment as usual; TAU). In order to ensure comparability of both
      treatment conditions (regarding an observation situation), the therapists in the TAU
      condition should also receive feedback, but only after the treatments are finished. We
      hypothesize that the feedback-group is superior to the TAU-group and that their treatments
      lead to significantly better therapy outcome. Moreover, we use mediator analysis to analyze
      whether the group-outcome relationship is mediated by therapeutic competencies or by the
      quality of the therapeutic alliance. The results are highly relevant for clinical process
      research, psychotherapy training and for the dissemination of treatment approaches in routine
      care.
