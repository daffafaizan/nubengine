    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate of interleukin-12 in previously treated patients with
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease.

      II. To determine the in vivo regulatory effect of interleukin-12 on Fas lingand (FasL)
      expression on patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics: low grade
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular small cleaved, follicular mixed, small lymphocytic, and
      variants) versus intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular large, diffuse large,
      diffuse mixed, immunoblastic, peripheral T-cell, and mantle cell) versus Hodgkin's disease.

      Patients receive interleukin-12 subcutaneously twice a week. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-105 patients will be accrued for this study.
