      high ratio of α2/α1-activity and an almost fourfold shorter half-life than clonidine.It's
      sympatholytic, sedative, and analgesic properties makes DXM a useful anaesthetic adjuvant for
      general anaesthesia. While there are some reports of the beneficial effects of DXM on
      anaesthetic requirements and haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation, the effect of
      a single preoperative injection of DXM in terms of attenuating haemodymanic responses to
      surgical stimulation in robot-assisted thyroidectomy is unknown.

      When a robotic thyroidectomy using the bilateral axillary breast approach (BABA) technique is
      performed, subcutaneous tunnelling in the neck and anterior chest, which is defined as
      hydrodissection, is mandatory. Unfortunately, the procedure leads to significant haemodynamic
      responses, such as increases in blood pressure and heart rate.

      We hypothesised that preoperative DXM administration would attenuate the haemodynamic
      responses to hydrodissection. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a single
      preoperative administration of DXM on haemodynamic responses to hydrodissection in robotic
      thyroidectomy by comparing the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of remifentanil
      needed to maintain haemodynamic stability during hydrodissection between DXM and control
      groups. We also investigated the effects of preoperative DXM administration on total doses of
      remifentanil and propofol administered intraoperatively.
