      more effective than benzodiazepines. Using propofol infusion in low doses during spinal
      injection in CS did not adversely affect the Apgar scores or the neurological and adaptive
      fetal outcomes. The general consensus is that procedural sedation is not a routine for spinal
      interventions, but required for anxious patients. Our hypothesis is that, with the high
      prevalence of maternal anxiety during cesarean section, ensuring painless comfortable spinal
      anesthesia may increase the acceptance rate of regional anesthesia during cesarean section.
