      tibial shaft fractures, however the secondary effects of this technique on the articular
      cartilage of the knee is unknown. Additionally, the incidence of intra-articular knee
      pathology in the face of tibial shaft fractures has not been described in the orthopedic
      literature. An undiagnosed cruciate/collateral ligament injury can result in post-traumatic
      arthritis, as well as a delay in justified ligamentous reconstruction of the knee, causing
      further injury. Long term sequelae of now commonplace suprapatellar nailing on the
      patellofemoral joint of the knee have been sparsely elucidated in the literature.

      The primary objective is to determine the consequences of suprapatellar tibial nailing on
      cartilage of the patellofemoral joint.

      As a secondary objective, this study will seek to determine the incidence of intra-articular
      knee pathology following tibial shaft fractures in patients presenting to Orlando Regional
      Medical Center.
