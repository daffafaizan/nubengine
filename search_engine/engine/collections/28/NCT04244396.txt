      clinical investigation. Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to 15 sites in
      South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and India. Centers in other countries within APAC
      may be approached for participation in the clinical investigation as needed. Subjects will be
      followed for 15-months after their initial ablation procedure. The primary effectiveness and
      safety endpoints will be evaluated through 15-months. A core lab will independently assess
      AF/AFL/AT recurrence via Holter monitoring at the 6-month and 15-month follow-up visits. All
      serious adverse events (SAEs) will be independently adjudicated by qualified physicians not
      participating in the trial
