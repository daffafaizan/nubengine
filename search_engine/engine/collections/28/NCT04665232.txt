      its kind for the provision of luteal phase support (LPS) in patients undergoing IVF.

      The the high solubility and rapid absorption of the new preparation are enhanced using
      cyclodextrins that are starch residues with no therapeutic activity and with a particular
      molecular structure that closely resembles a 'cap'.

      Once absorbed after injection, the progesterone molecule is immediately dissociated from its
      cyclodextrin 'cap', remaining free in the circulation as if produced endogenously by the
      ovaries.

      In comparison to progesterone-in-oil preparation, the new aqueous solution administered by
      s.c.route resulted in a 3 fold higher and more rapid progesterone peak serum concentrations.

      The immunomodulating effects of progesterone are mediated outside of the pelvic cavity, on
      the peripheral cell of the immune system. For this reason only the injection procedure has
      this advantage Furthermore, the faster absorption rate and the higher peak serum
      concentration should increas the systemic immunomodulatory effect of subcutaneous
      progesterone compared to the vaginal and intramuscular administration
