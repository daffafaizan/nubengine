    
      Background:

      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has altered the natural history of HIV disease
      in children.

      The pediatric cohort in this country offers a tremendous opportunity to understand the effect
      of HIV and ARTs on key developmental and maturational processes.

      A thorough understanding of the impact of HIV and ARTs on these long-term processes is
      extremely relevant as ART programs for HIV-infected children are being developed around the
      world.

      Objective:

      To explore the clinical features and impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy in an
      HIV-infected pediatric cohort.

      Eligibility:

      Known HIV disease and followed in the NCI pediatric HIV program as of December 2004, or
      HIV-infected sibling of a participant.

      Elgibility for the cardiac sub-study is expanded to include any person with HIV acquired in
      infancy or young childhood who is older than 7 and meets other inclusion criteria.

      Eligibility for cardiac sub-study will also include HIV uninfected subjects (18-30 years of
      age) who will server as a control group.

      Design:

      Serial evaluations of pubertal development, bone mineralization, body composition and fat
      distribution, hepatic, renal, and cardiac status, and behavioral, cognitive, and
      academic/vocational outcome.

      Findings may be shared with the multicenter Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study and lead to more
      intensive, focused substudies.
