      care in Germany. HF is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the Western
      world. In the chronic course of heart failure, affected patients are committed to morbidity,
      lifelong therapy and high risk of cardiac decompensation, also associated with high
      mortality.

      Heart failure patients, who visited the Cardiology Department of the University Hospital
      Wuerzburg, shall be analyzed with regard to all clinical data and outcome. This retrospective
      work should help to better understand the three groups HFrEF (EF < 40%), HFmrEF (EF 40-49%)
      and HFpEF (EF>50%) and help identifying similarities and differences between the groups.

      Hereby we hope for progress in diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic aspects of heart
      failure.
