      family donor is the treatment of choice for a wide variety of malignant and non-malignant
      disorders. Unfortunately, only 25% of potential recipients have an HLA matched related family
      donor, leaving approximately 75% of potential recipients requiring alternative sources of HLA
      matched allogeneic stem cells. One potential source of HLA matched allogeneic stem cells is
      from unrelated adult donors that have been identified in the national and international donor
      registries. However, several limitations restrict the uniform utilization of unrelated
      allogeneic adult donors including ethnic background of the recipient, acuity and timing of
      planned allogeneic transplant, availability of donor, and high risk of severe acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (III/IV), among others. The investigators have recently
      identified a new alternative source of allogeneic stem cells, unrelated cryopreserved
      placental/cord blood stem cells.
