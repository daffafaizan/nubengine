      antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. However, data
      are limited on the safety, toxicity, and adverse effects that maternal ART may have on
      infants born to HIV-infected women. This study will monitor the adverse effects and potential
      benefits of maternal ART on these infants.

      No antiretrovirals will be given in this study. This study will last 18 months. Infants will
      be enrolled in the study within 48 hours of birth. There will be 6 study visits starting at
      study entry and every 6 weeks thereafter. Infants will undergo blood and urine collection,
      and medical history assessments will occur at every visit. Mothers will also be evaluated at
      these visits.
