      inflammatory response that exacerbates peri-operative life-threatening complications and
      multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. These features can prolong the stay in the CICU. Many
      peri-operative clinical risk factors contribute to those adverse outcomes resulting in
      prolonged CICU stay. If the investigators can create a model to identify the effects of these
      intra-operative clinical risk factors to prolonged CICU stay
