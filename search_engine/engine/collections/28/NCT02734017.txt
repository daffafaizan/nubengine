      not clearly demonstrated. Moreover, the impact of medication reconciliation in the pediatric
      population is poorly studied.

      In such context, it is important to demonstrate the effectiveness of the medication
      reconciliation as part of a standardized medication review process, in pediatric and in the
      elderly, on all cause readmissions in a large randomized control clinical trial. The
      standardized medication review process includes medication reconciliation, treatment review
      and medication liaison service.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of the standardized medication
      review on the rate of readmissions and/or death at 30 days following initial hospitalization
      discharge.

      Methods/design: The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total 1400
      hospitalized patients will be randomized in two groups:

        1. group receiving a pharmacist-led standardized medication review (experimental group);
           and

        2. group not receiving the medication review (control group).

      The patients will be followed up at 30 days after initial hospitalization. Outcome measures
      include the number of readmissions; patient satisfaction, quality of medical admission
      prescription and number of consultation after initial hospitalization.

      Discussion: A randomized controlled trial will provide the highest level of evidence on the
      impact of pharmacist-led standardized medication review.
