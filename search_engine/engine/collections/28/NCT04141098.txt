      efficacy data for the minimally invasive PerQdisc Nucleus Replacement Device (NRD). Patients
      will have degenerative disc disease (DDD) in one or more lumbar discs. The NRD is used for
      surgical replacement of a single nucleus pulposus between spinal lumbar discs L1-S1 using an
      anterior or lateral transpsoas approach. Currently the surgical gold standard involves spinal
      fusion of the affected vertebral bodies, reducing range of motion and increasing stress on
      other vertebral bodies. The goal of nucleus replacement is to reduce chronic low back pain by
      maintaining disc height while preserving range of motion.
