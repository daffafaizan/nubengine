      university hospitals. This team, including high ranked, internationally renowned scientist
      from both clinical and basic sciences, will make a framework for PhD candidates and will
      ensure the patient cohort. Patients with paroxysmal AF and SA will be examined with an
      extensive diagnostic battery including advanced cardiac imaging tools allowing a proper
      description of the heart. Then a Reveal that continuously monitor the rhythm of the heart
      will be inserted, allowing the influence of SA, physical activity, inflammatory parameters,
      and other external variables on total AF burden to be examined. The patients will then be
      randomized to treatment of SA with a CPAP or not, and the AF burden recorded 6 months before
      ablation and 6 months after.

      The present investigations carried out, are expected to results in better understanding of
      the interaction between AF and SA and may lay the scientific basis for better diagnostic and
      therapeutic approaches for patients with AF. In addition, given the advantage of continuous
      RevealÂ® recording of the patient's heart rhythm, the present study will examine possible
      triggers of AF such as activity level and inflammatory substances, and examine the role of
      structural abnormalities in the heart as assessed by echocardiography for the triggering of
      AF episodes. An overall aim is therefore a better phenotyping of the patient which could aid
      in a more person-specific treatment approach, with direct consequences both for the
      individual patient and for the society.
