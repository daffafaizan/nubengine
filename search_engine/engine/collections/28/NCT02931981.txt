      prognosis in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Serum was collected from 50
      patients with GIST. Serological levels of DKK4 were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA). The sensitivity and specificity was compared with modified NIH risk criteria.
      A 3-year follow-up was monitored to evaluate the correlation between DKK4 serum levels and
      relapse-free or overall survival. The expression of DKK4 in GIST tumor tissues was also
      evaluated using immunohistochemistry staining.
