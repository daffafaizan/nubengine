        1. To demonstrate implementation feasibility and fidelity of the Duke community-based
           intervention model into an online model. The investigators hypothesise that the
           evidence-based implementation strategy tested in the US with Parks and Recreation will
           be adaptable for use at Duke-National University Singapore (NUS) with Singapore Sport,
           leading to online implementation within a 3-month period, and children in the
           intervention will receive up to 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per
           session.

        2. To meet current recommendations for intensity of obesity treatment. As compared with
           usual care, the investigators hypothesise that children in the online intervention will
           be more likely to receive >25 hours over 6 months of treatment.

        3. To estimate the effectiveness of the online intervention. Children who participate in
           the online intervention, as compared with usual care, will demonstrate improvements in
           health outcomes at 6-months, including cardiorespiratory fitness, weight-related quality
           of life and stabilisation or reduction in BMI at 6 months.
