    
      Aim 1 (Primary Outcomes): To test the effectiveness of an addiction-based weight loss
      intervention, embodied first as a smartphone app with telephone coaching (AppCoach) compared
      to (1) addiction model based weight-loss app alone (App) and (2) multi-disciplinary in-clinic
      weight loss intervention (Clinic) on weight outcomes of overweight and obese adolescents at
      3, 6, 12 and 18 months post enrollment.

      Hypothesis 1a: Participants who complete the six month AppCoach will have a greater decrease
      in their zBMI and %BMIp95 compared to baseline at completion of the 6 months intervention,
      than those receiving App or Clinic.

      Hypothesis 1b: Participants who completed the six month AppCoach will have greater decrease
      in their zBMI and %BMIp95 compared to baseline at 6 and 12 months post intervention
      completion compared to App and Clinic.

      Aim 2 (Secondary Outcomes): To compare the effects of AppCoach on addictive eating behaviors,
      motivation and self-regulatory behaviors at completion of the intervention and 6 and 12
      months post intervention.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to App or Clinic, AppCoach will result in lower YFAS-c scores, higher
      motivation and improved self- regulatory behaviors scores when evaluated at completion of the
      intervention and 6 and 12 months post intervention.

      Aim 3 (Mediators): To test whether baseline traits and behaviors mediate the effect of
      AppCoach compared to App and Clinic.

      Hypothesis 3: Higher baseline YFAS-c scores lower executive function scores and previous
      history with mobile platforms will mediate the efficacy of AppCoach and App.

      Aim 4: To conduct a real-life economic analysis (costs, cost-savings and non-monetary
      benefits) of delivering AppCoach compared to 1) App and 2) Clinic.

      Hypothesis 4: An addiction-based weight loss mHealth intervention will be more cost-effective
      than weight-loss coaching alone and in-person delivery of multidisciplinary weight-loss
      intervention.

      Research Design Methods:

      Study Design:

      Pre-Screening:

      Clinic Recruitment:

      Newly referred patients to the interdisciplinary clinics will be pre-screened for eligibility
      prior to their first clinic visit by an on-site clinical research coordinator (CRC). Those
      participants who meet eligibility criteria will be contacted via phone by the on-site CRC.
      The CRC will briefly introduce the study aims and intervention and request the youth and
      family to consider participation to be fully discussed at the first visit. The CRC will
      obtain the eligible participants' email address and send them a recruitment email.

      Initial Visit:

        1. On-site CRC will meet with eligible participants and provide details about the study
           procedures, obtain written consent from one parent/guardian and assent from each
           participant and answer any questions the participants and there parent may have.

           a. In order to standardize the study description, the CRC will first play an
           introductory video clip describing the study, the participant responsibilities and
           follow-up requirements.

           b. Upon obtaining verbal and written consent from one parent or guardian and verbal and
           written assent from each youth to participate in the study participants will be
           randomized to one of 3 intervention arms (AppCoach vs. App vs. Clinic)

        2. All consenting participants will complete a battery of surveys (Refer to Measurements

      3).

      e. The referring provider will receive a letter informing them that the youth they referred
      to the weight management clinic will be participating in this study for 6 months and then
      will be offered enrollment back into the initial referral program is desired.
