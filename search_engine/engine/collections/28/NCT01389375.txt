      hemostasis and immobilization when compared to manual compression following coronary
      angiography. This effect is beneficial in patients presenting with chronic back pain,
      prostate enlargement, mental impairment or other disorders that preclude prolonged bed rest.

      However, adequately powered large scale randomized trials with vascular closure devices
      remain a gap in the scientific literature.

      This trial compares, in a randomised design two novel vascular closure devices (FemoSeal &
      ExoSeal) versus manual compression after coronary angiography. This study is aimed to
      investigate if novel vascular closure devices are noninferior to manual compression regarding
      access site complications.
