      by Epo and a reduction of 30% by autologous (shed blood) transfusions (CS or D) with a power=
      0.9 and an alpha= 0.05, inclusion of 2250 surgery patients (in a worst case scenario of high
      standard deviations) are required for intention-to-treat analysis.

      Knee surgery patients are not randomized for cell saver (no intra-operative blood loss).
