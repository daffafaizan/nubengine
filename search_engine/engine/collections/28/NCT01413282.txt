      Therefore it is important that individuals with acute chest pain are accurately assessed
      without delaying appropriate treatment. Acute coronary syndrome is only one cause for sudden
      chest pain, which is a very common complaint in the ER. Other life threatening causes such as
      pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection may also be the cause, although most chest
      discomfort has a benign reason (musculoskeletal, hyperventilation, oesophageal reflux, etc).

      The current work-up of suspected acute coronary syndrome, based on presentation, symptoms,
      ECG and biomarkers, is not efficient and results in unnecessary diagnostics and hospital
      admissions, as well as errors or delayed diagnoses, in a substantial number of patients.
      Computed tomography angiography (CTA) images atherosclerosis, coronary obstruction as well as
      myocardial hypoperfusion. We hypothesize that early use of CTA is of incremental value and
      allows for accurate and immediate triage of patients with acute chest pain.
