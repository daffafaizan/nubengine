      of rapamycin (mTOR), has been shown to be effective in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis
      (LAM). It stabilizes lung function, resolves chylous effusions and lymphangioleiomas and
      shrinks angiomyolipomas. The current study is to understand better the short-term action of
      the drug by following the effects on potential biomarkers in blood and urine. Patients with
      LAM will have samples taken prior to administration of first dose of the drug, at 1 hr and
      then at 23 hours after the drug (trough level). At 3 and 9 months, samples will be obtained
      at trough and 1 hour after the dose. Molecular and cellular analyses will be performed to
      look for potential biomarkers.
