           treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks (28 days) during which time they will be taking

           performed: Complete physical examination including a neurological exam; vital signs; a
           review of current medications and symptoms; blood samples; a pregnancy test for women of
           child-bearing potential; self-administered quality of life questionnaire; brain MRI or
           CT scan.

        -  Participants may continue taking temozolomide until their tumor grows or if they
           experience unacceptable side effects.
