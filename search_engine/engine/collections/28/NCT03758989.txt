      MRD, as measured by ctDNA in patients with early stage DLBLC.

      Patients will be treated with standard chemoimmunotherapy and radiation based on the recently
      completed SWOG S1001 study, however no radioimmunotherapy will be used (NCT01359592).
      Response to treatment will be determined by contemporary Deauville criteria. Assessment of
      ctDNA (non-invasive disease monitoring) will be determined at diagnosis and will continue at
      pre-defined specific time points after therapy is complete.
