      serious short and long-term consequences. Currently, few replicable, evidence-based
      preventive services exist for such families, particularly within the context of the
      patient-centered medical home. CAPPS, a targeted problem solving intervention that addresses
      key risk and protective factors for child neglect, has the potential to improve key parenting
      skills and overall wellbeing, ultimately improving outcomes for high-risk children.

      This is a multi-center randomized controlled efficacy trial of Child Abuse Prevention Problem
      Solving (CAPPS), a targeted intervention designed to address specific stressors faced by
      low-income parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) and to enhance family
      strengths previously been shown to reduce the risk of maltreatment. The study will enroll 250
      parents of CSHCN who receive primary care in a network of urban patient-centered medical
      homes. The specific research aims are to 1: Decrease referrals to child protective services
      for neglect and increase adherence to recommended medical care; and 2: Decrease perceived
      social isolation, difficulty navigating complex services, and caregiver burden and enhance
      family strengths, including parental resilience, social connections, access to support in
      times of need, and knowledge of parenting and child development.
