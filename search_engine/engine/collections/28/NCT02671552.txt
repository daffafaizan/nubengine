      I. Evaluate if contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be used to successfully evaluate the
      cryoablation (cryosurgery) of renal cell carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound provides a reliable tool for the
      characterization of renal masses prior to cryoablation.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare harmonic imaging (the current industry standard for contrast imaging) with
      subharmonic imaging (a novel, improved contrast imaging technique) in the two aims listed
      above.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive perflutren protein-type A microspheres intravenously (IV) and then undergo
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging the morning prior to cryosurgery and at 3-4 months post
      treatment during MRI or CT follow up.
