      world. There are a lot of controversial information published during recent years about NSAID
      cardiosafety. It is still unclear do NSAIDs develop cardioprotective or cardiotoxic effects
      in acute and chronic heart disease patients. Aim of the study was to investigate safety and
      efficacy of Lornoxicam, nonselective COX-inhibitor, in patients with acute coronary syndrome
      without ST-segment elevation (NSTEACS) and to evaluate the influence of Lornoxicam on
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6, IL-10 levels.
