      but still leave a percentage of participants with incurable disease. New alternatives for
      participants whose disease is refractory to existing therapies is needed.

      IMC-A12 is a monoclonal antibody which binds to special receptors known as insulin-like
      growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR). This binding action has been shown to inhibit the growth
      of a variety of human tumor cell lines.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of IMC-A12 by itself or with Cetuximab
      (ErbituxÂ®) in participants with Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head and Neck Cancer that has spread
      to other parts of the body, and to determine how long the drug remains in the body. The study
      will also look at what side effects IMC-A12 may cause when a participant is receiving
      treatment.
