      aberrant nociceptive impulses that the brain interprets as pain. Neuropathic pain (NP)
      affects 40 to 70% of people with SCI and is a very disabling clinical condition. Many
      treatment options have been offered, but provide limited effects, leaving people with SCI
      with a reduced quality of life. The study team believes that Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR)
      neurorehabilitation has the potential to be an effective treatment for chronic neuropathic
      pain. For this reason, the objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a
      virtual reality device to decrease chronic neuropathic pain in individuals with spinal cord
      injury.
