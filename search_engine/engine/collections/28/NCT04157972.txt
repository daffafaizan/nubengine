    
      This is a crossover study assessing the short-term effects of SIMEOX and PEP device on static
      hyperinflation in patients with COPD.

      Patients will perform lung function tests (to assess the residual volume and functional
      residual capacity) before, after and 30 minutes after a 20-min long session of SIMEOX or PEP
      (depending of randomization).
