    
      In Phase 2, the investigators propose to develop the SBIRT Training & Support Tool with two
      components: (1) online SBIRT Training for call-center and face-to-face practitioners
      conducting alcohol SBIRT and (2) SBIRT Support Tool with mobile/web interactive alcohol
      screening tools and brief intervention protocols to facilitate use of SBIRT by practitioners.
      The SBIRT Training component will provide practitioners with the skills, knowledge,
      motivation, and self-efficacy to: (a) screen their clients for unhealthy alcohol use with
      validated screening tools; (b) provide brief, motivational interviewing-informed
      intervention; and (c) make appropriate referrals. The training program will incorporate the
      Phase 1 content and expand the curriculum to include the use of additional validated alcohol
      screening tools. Content for alcohol SBIRT will be derived from NIAAA evidence-based
      materials.

      The SBIRT Support Tool will provide a mobile/web interface for practitioners to use
      interactive screening and brief intervention forms with (a) prompts for validated questions
      in the screening or brief intervention; (b) motivational interviewing-informed dialogue
      suggestions; (c) online resources (i.e., standard drink list; importance, confidence rulers);
      and (d) alcohol education and referral information. The practitioner will use the SBIRT
      Support Tool to (a) screen clients for alcohol use with interactive validated screening
      tools; (b) provide brief intervention for individuals based on their screening score; and (c)
      provide referral to treatment for individuals based on their screening score.
