    
      A review of the clinical records of patients diagnosed with TA with more than 3 criteria of
      the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and undergoing some surgical procedure by the
      Surgery Service of the National Institute of Cardiology "Ignacio Chávez", in a period of time
      comprised between 1977 and 2016 was done. Patients of any gender and age who had been
      operated on by a surgical procedure registered in their medical record were included.
      Patients intervened in other institutions were excluded. The surgical event was classified
      into 6 groups: 1) organ-preservation surgery (mainly renal autograft); 2) Bypass
      (revascularization of affected organs or segments with Woven Dacron graft); 3) Replacement
      (replacement of affected aortic segment with a Woven Dacron graft); 4) Cardiac Surgery
      (direct procedures in heart); 5) Exclusion (resection of an affected organ (nephrectomy)),
      and 6) Other.

      Inflammatory activity was evaluated according to the Dabague-Reyes criteria, in which a score
      greater than or equal to 5 is considered as active inflammation (9).

      Statistical analysis: Variables with a loss of the sample data greater than 20% were
      excluded. The categorical variables were described by percentages and prevalences and the
      comparison were done by chi square or Fisher's exact test. A statistically significant level
      was considered when an error α <0.05 was found. Parametric numerical variables are described
      by measures of central tendency and the comparison is made by Student's T test. The survival
      analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier. Ethical aspects were considered according to the
      Helsinky declaration.
