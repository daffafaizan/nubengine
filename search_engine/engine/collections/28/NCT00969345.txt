      calculated with the spontaneous approach, both with the softwares developed in Milan by
      Alberto Porta in a non-invasive way.

      The frequency domain analysis of heart rate, respiration and systolic blood pressure were
      conducted, consisting of calculating the power spectral density with the minimum error
      predicted by Akaike's algorithm. Spectral power was then subdivided into two bands of
      physiological interest: low - (LF 0.03-0.15 Hz) indicating predominant sympathetic
      modulation, and high - (HF 0.15-0.5 Hz) frequency, indicating parasympathetic modulation of
      the heart. The fraction calculated dividing LF by HF (LF/HF ratio) provided information of
      sympathovagal balance to the heart. The spectral analysis of Systolic Blood Pressure provided
      information of the vasomotor tone, and the integration of heart rate information with these
      data also provided information about the spontaneous baroreflex gain.

      Other questionnaires used were: Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Questionnaire, Stress Symptoms
      Questionnaire by Marilda Lipp - validated in Brazil, and Beck's anxiety and depression
      inventories.
