      (HAART), with CD4 levels between 150-350 and HIV plasma viral load < 5000, for at least 12
      months and despite continuous anti-retroviral treatment. The patients will be randomly
      divided into two groups, one that will get the T cell vaccination, and the other that will
      serve as controls. The T cell vaccine will be prepared from autologous T cells that responded
      by specific proliferation to recombinant CD4, further expanded in vitro by IL-2, and then
      fixed by glutaraldehyde. Each vaccine portion will consist of 10,000 such cells suspended in
      saline and given subcutaneously every three months during the first year of the trial. The
      outcome measures will be CD4 levels, specific immunity to HIV antigens, immune activation
      profile and HIV plasma viral loads, determined sequentially during the 24 months of the
      trial. These outcome measures will be compared between the experimental and the control
      groups, to determine if this mode of treatment is effective in influencing CD4 levels as an
      additional mode of treatment during HIV infection.
