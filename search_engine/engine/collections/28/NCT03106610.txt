      Each study cycle is 14 days (2 weeks).

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive nivolumab by
      vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-3.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive nivolumab for up to 3 cycles before your scheduled surgery. You will no
      longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits (described below).

      Study Visits

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3 and at the visit before your surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked to complete 2 quality-of-life questionnaires. These will take about 10
           minutes to complete.

        -  If you can become pregnant, urine or part of the above routine blood sample will be used
           for a pregnancy test.

      Surgery (Cystectomy):

      About 8 weeks after you join the study, you will have surgery for bladder cancer. You will
      sign a separate consent form that describes the surgery and its risks.

      Follow Up:

      About 4 weeks after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked to complete the 2 quality-of-life questionnaires.
