      with 13,500 new survivors expected annually. However, chronic or long-term side effects
      (e.g., secondary malignancies, metabolic syndrome, cardio-pulmonary toxicities) can reduce
      quality of life and lead to premature death. The investigators propose that diet and fitness
      are two critical factors for healthy survivorship given their broad impact on late effects
      like obesity, fatigue, and metabolic syndrome. Despite the promise of comprehensive lifestyle
      interventions for children who are overweight or obese, research with survivors is limited by
      small samples and inconsistent effects. Novel research supports a key role for the
      gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome in regulating weight and health outcomes, yet no studies
      have examined the "obesogenic" microbiome in the context of lifestyle interventions for
      survivors of childhood cancer. The objective of this RCT is to examine the efficacy of
      Harvesting Hope for Kids (HH4K), a biobehavioral intervention delivered in the context of a
      university-based, cancer survivor garden, to increase produce intake and physical activity in
      survivors and caregivers. Families will be randomized to participate in HH4K or enhanced
      usual care. Dietary patterns, physical activity, cardiometabolic indices, family outcomes,
      and GI microbiome will be assessed and the HH4K group will demonstrate greater improved than
      enhanced usual care.
