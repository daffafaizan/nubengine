      plaque instability and subsequent rupture, which can lead to the development of acute
      coronary syndromes. Elevated levels of serum inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) represent independent risk factors for further cardiovascular
      events. Raised resting heart rate (HR) has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular
      events. Ivabradine is a new HR-reducing agent, which has demonstrated antianginal and
      anti-ischemic properties in patients with stable angina. In an atherosclerosis model,
      selective HR reduction with ivabradine has been shown to decrease markers of vascular
      oxidative stress, to improve endothelial function, and to reduce atherosclerotic plaque
      formation. We hypothesized that the addition of ivabradine to standard medical therapy has a
      beneficial effect on markers of inflammatory stress in acute coronary syndrome patients.
