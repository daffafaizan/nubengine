      mechanics. Especially in the eldery, decreased pulmonary function might aggravate negative
      response to pneumoperitoneum. Alveolar recruitment maneuver had been reported of improving
      arterial oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics. Investigator designed this study for
      comparision of the incidences of pulmonary complications after applying alveolar recruitment
      maneuver or not during peumoperitoenum for laparoscopic surgery in the elderly patients.
