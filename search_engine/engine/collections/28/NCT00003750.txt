        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of hu14.18-interleukin-2 fusion protein in children
           with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma or other GD2-positive tumors.

        -  Determine the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the fusion protein in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of the fusion protein on systemic immune modulation in these
           patients.

        -  Quantitate the antifusion protein antibodies in patients treated with fusion protein.

        -  Evaluate antitumor responses resulting from this fusion protein regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive hu14.18-interleukin-2 (hu14.18-IL2) fusion protein IV over 4 hours once
      daily on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
