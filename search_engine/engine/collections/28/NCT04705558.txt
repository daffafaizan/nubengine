      than normal but lower than the diagnostic criteria of type II diabetes and in most of the
      cases, this ultimately leads to the development type II diabetes. It has been estimated that
      the number of pre-diabetic cases will increase to more than 470 million people worldwide, and
      this is understandably a worrying trend . Many studies have been done on diabetes patients.
      However, little is known about the pre-diabetic conditions.

      Diagnosed Prediabetes was stated as any participants who did not have diabetes but who had
      fasting plasma glucose level of 100 - 125 mg/dL, an HbA1c level of 5.7% - 6.4%, or 2-hour
      plasma glucose level of 140 - 199 mg/dL.

      Treatment of pre-diabetes and prevention of the development of pre-diabetes to T2DM,through
      lifestyle intervention mainly includes nutritious dietary and exercises.

      Combining a ketogenic diet with exercise is a powerful way to reducing insulin resistance,
      control blood glucose levels and achieve weight loss. As ketogenic diets are nowadays
      predictable as being useful, there is presently a shortage of research studies examining just
      how useful the combination of exercise and a ketogenic diet
