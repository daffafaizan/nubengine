      assigned to receive a series of ten 30-minute phone calls every two weeks from a counselor.
      150 will be assigned to an attention-matched comparison arm, and will receive 10 sessions in
      a didactic telephone group. 150 will be assigned to a information-matched control arm and
      will receive the book Living Well with HIV & AIDS. Letters will be sent by AIDS Service
      Organizations inviting interested clients to call the study's 800 number to learn more about
      the study and to be screened for enrollment. Posters and brochures will also be posted in
      public areas of the ASOs. The individualized intervention combines problem-solving, with
      motivation and self-management. This trial will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      multi-component intervention on both specific HIV behavioral outcomes and
      non-disease-specific outcomes.
