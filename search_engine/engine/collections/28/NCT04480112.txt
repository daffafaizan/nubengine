      communication technologies during COVID-19 pandemic in the cognitive status of
      socially-isolated older adults with and without cognitive impairment. An estimated 150 total
      participants will be recruited over the course of 1 year: 50 healthy older participants, 50
      patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and 50 patients with mild AD.

      This study employs an AB/BA crossover design (2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment design) where
      A will be the intervention phase and B will be the passive control phase. Each period will
      occur over a duration of 1 month. Participants will either receive an intervention designed
      to provide participants with more social interaction during a time of social distancing and
      highly limited in-person social interactions (Intervention Group) or will not receive the
      intervention (Control Group). The investigators will conduct pre- and post-
      neuropsychological testing to assess changes in cognitive status (e.g., memory, language,
      executive functioning) in the intervention group after each intervention phase.
      Neuropsychological tests assessing changes to cognition will be completed prior to
      participant assignment to the Intervention or Control Group. Following this assessment, the
      first phase of the intervention will begin, and the initial intervention group (Group A) will
      receive the intervention, and the other group (Group B) will act as a control group. After
      the intervention phase has ended, both groups will be assessed again using neuropsychological
      tests. Following the re-assessment, Group B will receive the intervention, and Group A will
      act as a control. After the second intervention phase has ended, both groups will be assessed
      once more using neuropsychological tests.
