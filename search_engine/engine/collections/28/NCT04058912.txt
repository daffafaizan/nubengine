      development of endometriosis and the effect of the presence of endometrioma on ovarian
      reserve due to decreased PTEN expression are considered. This study was designed to compare
      ovarian PTEN-AKT-FOXO3 gene expression and ovarian reserve in patients with underwent surgery
      caused by endometrioma and those who had ovarian pathology due to other benign causes and
      PTEN-AKT-FOXO3 gene expression level will be evaluated by RT-PCR analysis.
