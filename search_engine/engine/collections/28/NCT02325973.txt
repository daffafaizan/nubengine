    
      Prospective, multicentre study designed to evaluate IMR ability to predict events occurrence,
      defined as Cardiovascular death, re-MI, re-hospitalization for HF, resuscitation or ICD
      appropriate shock, during a 1 year follow-up period.

      All participants will have the culprit lesion treated following clinical practice and
      guidelines; Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and IMR will be measured after the primary PCI
      procedure to evaluate treatment success and myocardial viability. Non-culprit lesions will be
      functionally evaluated through FFR index and will be treated if FFR will show functional
      stenosis. FFR and IMR will be measured to evaluate treatment success and myocardial
      viability. Patients will be followed-up at 1m, 6m and 1y periods.
