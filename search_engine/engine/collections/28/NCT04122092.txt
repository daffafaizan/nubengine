      in the bone marrow after a clinical response has been measured and the patient is in
      remission. A patient who tests "MRD negative" after treatment for myeloma has less than one
      myeloma cell per million bone marrow cells. Data from recent clinical trials suggest that
      patients with such a low level of disease may be less likely to experience a relapse of their
      condition than patients with higher levels. In recent years, MRD testing is now be applied in
      the management of patients receiving standard therapies for the disease.

      Chromosomal instability(CIN) results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis,
      leading to structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic
      heterogeneity that acts as a substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that
      tumors with aneuploidies and polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with
      metastasis, treatment resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that
      60%-80% of human tumors exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively
      correlates with tumor stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor
      specimens. Due to the ubiquity of CIN in cancer cells and cancer cell releasing DNA into
      peripheral blood (PB) when apoptosis, it is a potentially non-invasive way to detect CIN in
      PB cfDNA from the MM patients to character MRD level. UCAD is a new method to detecting CIN
      in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting cfDNA from PB, analyzing DNA by
      low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by bio-information techniques, and
      finally optimizing the management of MM patients.
