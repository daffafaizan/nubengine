      contrast media volume to 60ml of 270mg Iodine (mgI)/ml iodixanol or less to accomplish
      sufficient intravascular attenuation for comprehensive CT assessment prior to TAVR. The study
      will also evaluate the effects of contrast media administration on our subjects' kidney
      function by performing serum creatinine measurements at baseline, as well as at three days
      and thirty days after contrast media administration.
