      reserve (CFR) will be measured in stable angina patients before coronary intervention.

      Relationship between angiographic characteristics of patients and FFR, IMR, CFR will be
      analyzed. Comparison of risk factors and prognosis between parameters will be also analyzed.
      This study will evaluate that which parameter is correlate with disease severity and risk
      factors of patients.
