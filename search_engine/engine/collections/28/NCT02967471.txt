      mortality. To improve the early diagnosis of ARDS, there is an urgent need for novel
      biomarkers of ARDS. This project aims to detect novel biomarkers from peripheral blood ,
      which can improve the early diagnosis and develop a more efficient therapy to enhance ARDS
      patient survival rate. Clinical data and blood sample were recorded before treatment and
      after treatment. Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III) scores were
      calculated at enrolment. Different kinds of lymphocytes from blood samples would be detected
      by flow cytometry ,which could be used for discovering high sensitivity and specificity ARDS
      biomarker.

      Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: 18 years and older Genders Eligible for Study: Both
      Accepts Healthy Volunteers: Yes Sampling Method: Probility Samples

      Study Population Patients who have ARDS and admitted in hospital

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      ILC2 and ILC3 number from peripheral blood of ARDS patients

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      APACHE III score [ Time Frame: baseline, 1week, 2 weeks ] PaO2/FiO2 ratio[ Time Frame:
      baseline, 1week, 2 weeks ] Mortality or multi-organ failure [ Time Frame: 1 month ]

      Groups:

        1. Mild ARDS PaO2/FiO2=201～300 mmHg，and PEEP or CPAP≤5 cm

        2. Moderate ARDS PaO2/FIO2=101～200 mmHg，and PEEP≥5 cm H2O

        3. Severe ARDSPaO2/FIO2≤100 mmHg，and PEEP≥10 cm H2O
