      (T1) and 12 weeks following hospital discharge (T2) from the respective anesthesia depth
      level. Bispectral index monitoring (BIS) was performed from the awake state to complete
      recovery in all subjects.

      Hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined by routine
      automated laboratory techniques. Lymphocyte proliferation was analyzed by SASPA flow
      cytometry analysis. In brief, 100 µl EDTA blood were stirred with 10 µl FITC and PE marked
      antibody mixture containing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD 16, CD45, CD28, CD27, CD 56.

      Monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis activity was measured separately in macrophages of fresh
      heparinized whole blood using flow cytometric test kits.

      Proteomics of monocytes was done synchronously.
