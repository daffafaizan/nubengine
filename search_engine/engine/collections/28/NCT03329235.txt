      osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification were randomly divided into 3
      groups to receive either PRP or HA. Group A received intra-articular injection of PRP 2 ml
      combination with medial tibial plateau and medial femoral condyle injection of PRP 2 ml (once
      more 2 weeks later). Group B were treated with 2 ml of PRP intra-articular injection every 14
      days for a total of two injections. Group C received intra-articular injection of hyaluronic
      acid 2 ml every 7 days for five injections. All patients were evaluated by the Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) score before
      the treatment and at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th and 18th months.
