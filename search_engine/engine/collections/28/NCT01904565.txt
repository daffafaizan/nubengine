    
      Hyperthermia would be delivered at Kantonsspital Aarau (KSA) with superficial or deep
      hyperthermia treatment units as may be appropriate. All patients would undergo a
      pre-hyperthermia treatment planning and a temperature of around 41.5 Centigrade to 42.5
      Centigrade would be aimed during hyperthermia sessions.Hyperthermia would be delivered once a
      week and the treatment sessions would last for around 60 minutes of active heating.

      Proton bean therapy would be carried out at Center of Proton Therapy, Paul Scherrer Institute
      (PSI), Villigen using scanning beam proton therapy. A preoperative dose of 55 - 60 Gray
      equivalent (GyE) or those considered for radical treatment, 72-76 GyE would be delivered, 5
      days a week at 1.8 - 2 Gy/fr.

      On days of both hyperthermia at KSA and proton therapy at PSI, the time interval between the
      two treatments could be 90 to 150 minutes, taking into consideration the time to travel
      between the two institutions. Hyperthermia in these days would follow proton beam therapy.
