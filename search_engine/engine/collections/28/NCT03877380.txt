      of autonomy.

      A regular assessment of autonomy in the elderly should be carried out in order to implement
      ABS as early as possible. The aim is to set up the necessary home help to avoid or delay
      institutionalisation.

      It therefore seems essential to place oneself on the side of the beneficiaries and their
      relatives in order to identify the difficulties encountered during a first ABS application
      and their expectations as to the role of the general practitioner during this application?
