        -  Determine the prognostic significance of MUM-1, lymphoma-associated macrophages, and
           regulatory T cells in patients with follicular lymphoma treated on clinical trials
           SWOG-8809, SWOG-9800, or SWOG-9911 representing pre- and post-monoclonal antibody
           therapy protocols.

        -  Determine whether these factors have similar prognostic significance in patients treated
           with chemotherapy alone vs chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy on these
           clinical trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected tissue samples from patients are analyzed by immunohistochemistry, gene
      expression profiling, and quantitative analysis for MUM1 expression, lymphoma-associated
      macrophages, FOXP3-positive regulatory T cells, CD68, and CD163.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 318 samples will be accrued for this study.
