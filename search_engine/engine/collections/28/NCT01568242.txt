      measure the vitreous temperature at different stages of the procedure (capsulorrhexis,
      hydrodissection, phacomulsification, irrigation/aspiration and intraocular lens (IOL)
      implantation). Room temperature also registered during every step. At the end of the surgery,
      oral temperature will be measured.
