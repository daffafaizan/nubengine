    
      This is a multicenter, open label, phase II study of everolimus as a second or third line
      therapy for the treatment of advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma, which will also
      evaluate Merlin/NF2 loss as a biomarker to predict sensitivity to everolimus. Patients who
      have disease progression after one or two prior chemotherapy regimens will be eligible. In
      the first stage of this design, 19 patients will be accrued. If 6 or less patients among the
      first 19 patients show clinical benefit, then the study will be terminated and declared
      negative. If 7 or more patients show clinical benefit, than an additional 20 patients will be
      accrued to the second stage. At the end of the study, if 17 or more patients show clinical
      benefit out of a total of 39 patients enrolled, the regimen will be considered worthy of
      further investigation.
