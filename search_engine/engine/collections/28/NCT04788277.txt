      I. To detect prostate cancer cells, shed in voided urine, using the optical imaging method
      developed in our laboratory, which targets vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 1
      (VPAC1) receptors expressed on prostate cancer cells and validates the results with
      prevailing condition of the patients/volunteers and evaluate diagnostic accuracy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish if the malignant cells as a percent of total cell shed in the urine.

      II. To establish the fluorescence intensity around malignant cells. III. To establish if the
      VPAC protein quantity in shed malignant cells correlate with the aggressiveness of the
      disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of urine samples at baseline during standard of care
      office/clinic visit.
