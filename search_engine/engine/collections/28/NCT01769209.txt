    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Determine the response rate of bortezomib in combination with a chemotherapy backbone of
      doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride), vincristine (vincristine sulfate), PEG-asparaginase
      (pegaspargase), and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the rate of complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete platelet recovery
           (CRp) on Day 29 after re-induction.

        -  Determine progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years after re-induction.

        -  Determine failure-free survival (FFS) at 1 year after re-induction.

        -  Overall survival (OS) at 1 year after re-induction.

        -  Assess safety and tolerability of the study drug.

        -  Determine whether bortezomib induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in circulating acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blast cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; doxorubicin
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1; pegaspargase IV or intramuscularly (IM) on Days 5
      and 22; vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) daily on
      Days 1 to 14; cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on Day 1 and methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on
      Day 15. Patients with central nervous system disease receive intrathecal treatment per
      investigator's discretion.

      Participants are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years after completion of study
      treatment.
