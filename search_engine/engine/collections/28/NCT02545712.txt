      to excipients and what excipients they are possibly exposed to. They have shown that
      practically all neonatal patients receive one or more drug containing an excipient, known to
      be harmful. This observational study will look at both registered drugs and extemporaneous
      pharmaceuticals as possible sources of excipients. Based on information provided by the
      manufacturer (ex. the index-list), the investigator will calculate the amounts of excipients
      administered to the patient a week after hospitalisation. The investigator will calculate the
      blood alcohol content when the neonatal patient are exposed to ethanol and/or propylene
      glycol.

      By grouping the patients according to age and subgrouping according to diagnosis/affected
      organ system and compare the amount of excipient exposure in each group, the study aims at
      identifying the most vulnerable neonatal and/or pediatric patients in terms of the amount and
      identity of excipients accumulated in the patient.

      The study will use a descriptive, parametric statistic analysis to identify

        -  an average exposure rate (concentration i mg/l or amount in mg) of each of the listed
           excipients

        -  how much the average patient in each age-group is exposed to each excipient

        -  how much the average patient in each "affected organ system"-subgroup is exposed to each
           excipient
