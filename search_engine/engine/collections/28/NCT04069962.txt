      Assessment (CGA) process coordinated by a geriatric team in combination with intensive
      patient coaching compared to the current standard of care, which is CGA coordinated by an
      oncology team. The Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework, developed to test complex
      interventions, is used to design this study. A multicenter randomized controlled trial will
      be conducted in two academic hospitals (UZ Brussel - UZ Leuven) with a follow-up at 3, 6 and
      12 months after the start of systemic therapy. Patients will be recruited in both academic
      hospitals in the period between the cancer diagnosis and the start of the systemic therapy.
