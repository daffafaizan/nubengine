      (taking a single image), or dynamic (taking a series of images) of the foot, will be made. In
      the latter case, the observation will be done after a brisk walk of 6 min. The instruction
      given to patients will be to go the furthest in 3 min and then come back in 3 min, all while
      walking. The observation will be made by cameras without contact. These thermal cameras are
      non-invasive and non-ionizing, there is no risk related to their use. The camera will be
      placed on a tripod, a few tens of centimeters from the foot, and connected to a laptop (for
      the images acquisition). A wooden box, painted black, will be placed around both feet to
      protect the scene from parasitic thermal radiation that can disturb temperature variations.
      Foam will protect the skin / wood interface. Electric resistances, fixed on the box, will be
      placed in the field of vision of the thermal camera to guarantee the good treatment of the
      images. These resistors will never be in contact with the patient. The area filmed by the
      camera will be limited to the sole arch and, sometimes, the hand of patients to see if a
      thermal anomaly is also present on this member.
