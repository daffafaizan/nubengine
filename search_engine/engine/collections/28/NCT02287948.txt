      symptoms; in subjects with moderate disabilities for balance, the deterioration of the static
      and dynamic control of balance is an important and basic symptom of disease progression.

      From a clinical point of view, the reliability of being able to discriminate patients who
      have the highest probability of falling than those with lower probability is crucial to
      develop a program aimed at the prevention of falls.

      Potentially the parameters measured wiht torque platform can be an objective, reliable and
      accurate for discriminating patients with the highest probability of falling than those with
      low probability, and may be useful to highlight the deficits and improvements in the ability
      to maintain balance after specific rehabilitation. However posturographic systems represent a
      significant cost, require a dedicated and qualified personnel to use. A possible solution to
      not use force platforms could be the implementation of software to interface with the
      Nintendo Wii Fit Balance Board (WBB) with a personal computer.

      The platform Nintendo Wii Fit presents a set of sensors lower compared to a traditional force
      platform, but can represent a valid economic alternative to more complex systems, in addition
      to being already used as a rehabilitation tool in the literature in more than one study.
      Studies in healthy subjects have valid information on the study of the center of pressure
      (COP) obtained from WBB showing that the path lengths of the COP obtained from the WBB were
      valid and well correlated with those recorded by a dynamometric platform.
