      cardiovascular or metabolic diseases as assessed by a medical history and a comprehensive

      years), and weight stable (+/-2kg) for at least 6 months prior to beginning the study.

      and/or cancer and presently taking medications for these conditions, who are pregnant or may
      be pregnant, are allergic to milk products or are anorexic or bulimic were excluded from
      participation. Each participant provided informed written consent in adherence with the
