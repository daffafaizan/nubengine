      after a single dose of sprouts, and evaluate the importance of the gut microbiome on these
      parameters. Some subjects will receive broccoli sprouts that are grown in deuterium oxide, a
      commonly used non-toxic, non-radioactive label for vegetables (Tang, Qin et al. 2005), so
      researchers can identify metabolites in blood and urine that are directly from consumed
      sprouts. The investigators plan to feed subjects a standardized breakfast and either broccoli
      sprouts or alfalfa sprouts (control) and look at the presence of metabolites and activity in
      the blood and urine 3, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours following intake as well as changes in
      microbiome composition.
