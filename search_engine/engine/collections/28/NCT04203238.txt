      Reversion to normal blood glucose concentrations reduces the incidence of diabetes by 56%.
      Healthy eating patterns such as the DASH and the Mediterranean Diet have shown that high
      intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes or pulses, and potatoes are associated
      with cardiometabolic health. In contrast, dietary patterns rich in meat and sugar-rich foods
      are associated with increased risk of mortality, type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease.
      These findings suggest that it may be prudent to replace certain foods with fruits and
      vegetables rather than simply embrace plant-based diets. Small changes that bestow health
      benefits are likely to be sustainable in the long-term. The objective of the present
      application is to develop a diet intervention to reverse insulin resistance in an overweight
      or obese population. The central hypothesis is that in the context of an overall healthy
      eating pattern, potatoes and pulses will not differ in the glycemic and insulinemic
      responses, lipid profile, and hsCRP concentration they elicit.
