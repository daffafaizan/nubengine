      instability, peripheral vasodilation, and diabetes insipidus in organ donors, requiring the
      use of high doses of inotropes. Inotropes may cause ischemic injury to organs and
      intramyocardial ATP stores, resulting in organs unsuitable for transplantation, as well as, a
      reduction in post-transplant organ function. Therefore, some clinicians advocate the use of
      triple hormonal therapy in potential organ donors.

      Since intravenous T3(the intracellular active form of thyroxine) is unavailable, oral or
      intravenous T4 must be used, requiring the conversion of T4 to T3at the cellular level. This
      conversion is impeded by glucocorticoids which also are administered to organ donors for
      their immunomodulating effects. Since oral T3 is readily available, our first question is
      whether oral versus intravenous administration of T4 is comparable. If so, our next study is
      to determine the efficacy of oral T3 versus oral T4. Our hypothesis is oral T3 is superior to
      oral T4.

      Our study therefore will determine whether or not the oral route is suitable for
      administration of thyroid replacement therapy. The study will compare the pharmacokinetics of
      oral versus intravenous T4 administration in organ donors, as well as, determine its ability
      to wean intropes in this patient population.
