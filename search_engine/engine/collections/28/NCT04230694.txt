      1) Test the health impact of CGM of inpatients as defined by rates of hypo- and hyperglycemia
      and the derivative of time in appropriate glucose range. Forty (40) patients will be
      randomized 1:1 into one of two conditions. In the treatment condition, patients will receive
      a Dexcom Gen6 device and the clinical staff (i.e., nursing and medical staff assigned to the
      patient's care) will be trained to use readings from the Dexcom Gen6 for the management of
      the patient's glucose levels below 100. In the control condition, patients will receive a
      Dexcom Gen6 device, but the clinical staff (i.e., nursing and medical staff assigned to the
      patient's care) will not have access to the readings and will provide usual care (four
      glucose checks per 24 hours and use of insulin or other diabetic agent ordered by the
      admitting and rounding providers to determine glucose management).

        1. Hypothesis 1: Patients in the treatment condition will experience fewer episodes of
           hypoglycemia as compared to patients in the control condition as measured by the Dexcom
           Gen6 readings.

        2. Hypothesis 2: Patients in the treatment condition will experience less frequent
           hyperglycemia events as compared to patients in the control condition as measured by the
           Dexcom Gen6 readings.
