      urolithiasis are associated with anatomic or metabolic abnormalities or urinary tract
      infection . PNL can be performed safely and effectively in children by experienced surgeons,
      resulting in a high stone-free rate and lower requirement for ancillary treatment. In adults,
      PNL is performed under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. In pediatric age group,
      fluoroscopic guidance was preferred in most of the reported studies. However, fluoroscopy
      exposes the patient to radiation. The International Commission on Radiological Protection
      recommends that whole body exposure in adults should be limited to an effective dose of 20
      mSv per year over 5 years. In young children, it is particularly important to protect the
      developing gonads and thyroid gland, as the long-term effects of exposing these organs to
      radiation are still unclear. In contrast to fluoroscopic guidance, ultrasound guidance does
      not expose the patient to radiation, it also can provide real-time monitoring during the
      puncturing procedure. The path and depth of the needle, and the anatomy in and around the
      kidney, are clearly visible on ultrasound examination
