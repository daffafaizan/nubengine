      initial study design with discussions about the different variables to be included into our
      prospective database started during 2014 PancreasFest held in Pittsburgh, PA in late July
      2014 under the sponsorship of Collaborative Alliance for Pancreatic Education and Research
      (CAPER). Following this, a datasheet with variables was created, distributed through the
      initial participants, and further suggestions and edits were made. We now plan to move ahead
      with a web based seminar. All previous participants, as well as new investigators/centers
      that have shown interest in participating throughout the world will be invited.University of
      Pittsburgh will be responsible for collecting all required regulatory documents from other
      sites. Developing templates for questionnaires and other data collection forms. Will train
      approved sites on procedures. The coordinating center will be the recipient of de-identified
      data and will not be involved in the collection of data.

      Note that copies of training records, licenses, certificates should be maintained in the
      study regulatory binder and are subject to audit by the Research Conduct and Compliance
      Office (RCCO).
