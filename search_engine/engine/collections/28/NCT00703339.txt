      hypertension (PH) associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Each cohort of four
      subjects will receive a single dose of inhaled treprostinil sodium. Cohorts will be enrolled
      sequentially, starting with the lowest dose of 18 mcg. Each cohort escalate by 18 mcg
      increments, resulting in four cohorts of 18, 36, 54, and 72 mcg doses. Decisions to escalate
      to the next dose cohort will be based upon the data from the previous completed lower dose
      cohort of four subjects. Approximately 16 subjects are expected to receive study drug,and
      approximately four center in the United States with expertise in IPF will participate in this
      study.
