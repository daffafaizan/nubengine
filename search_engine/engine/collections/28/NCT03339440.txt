      nutrition education and support (in addition to normal clinical care) affect children's
      health. The investigators will be looking at changes in child BMI, physical activity,
      nutrition, and overall health. The investigators also hope to better understand biological
      differences in metabolism and the microbiome (the bacteria that grows normally on and in the
      body) in children with high BMI who are making lifestyle changes.
