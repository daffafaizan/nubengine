    
      -  Before induction of GA, all patients will receive sciatic, obturator, lateral femoral
           cutaneous and femoral nerve blocks.

        -  The femoral nerve block will be performed using 15ml of ropivacaine which concentration
           relied on the response of the previous patient.

        -  Based on biased-coin design up-down sequential method: when a patient has a negative
           response, the next patient will receive a concentration 0.01% w/v higher. However if he
           has a positive response, the next patient will be randomized to receive either the same
           ropivacaine concentration or a concentration 0.01% w/v less.

        -  Patients with pain free recovery will be considered to have positive response.

        -  Patients' responses will be analyzed to calculate the MEAC90
