      Intervention: education on self-assessment of joints that included initial brief patient
      training on tender (TJC) and swollen (SJC) joint counts, followed by US feedback every 3
      months versus standard care without education. Patient and physician independently performed
      28-joint counts at each visit. Outcome variables: (Primary) Percentage of patients with good
      agreement with physician derived swollen joints (prevalence-adjusted bias adjusted kappa,
      PABAK>0.6). Other variables: Agreement in SJC (Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement),
      feasibility/patient satisfaction survey and disease activity score (DAS28) at 6 months.
