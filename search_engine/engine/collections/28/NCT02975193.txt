      (PD) patients that are undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) as routine standard of care.

      Screening: For healthy control participants, investigators will approach adults, aged 18-90,
      for possible involvement in our study. Potential participants will be asked if they have ever
      been diagnosed with a movement disorder, psychiatric disorder, or dementia. For PD patients
      undergoing evaluation for DBS, investigators will first consult with their neurologist and
      neurosurgeon. Next, investigators will approach the participant and explain the study.

      PD Participants: As part of the usual DBS process at University of Florida (UF), PD
      participants will be asked to participate in this trial. There are three evaluation time
      points: before surgery, during surgery, and possibly after surgery. Before surgery, the PD
      patients will complete standardized questionnaires and be trained on a computer game to
      assess cognition. During surgery, the participants will play the same computer game while
      brain signals are recorded. When the patients return to University of Florida for DBS
      programming visits within 48 months after surgery, they will repeat the standardized
      questionnaires and computer game once again.
