      critically ill patients, and elevated IAP can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH).
      Literature suggests that IAH is common in patients with septic shock and that there is an
      association between the presence of IAH and acute kidney injury (AKI) in this group. Mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) and IAP together help determine the abdominal perfusion pressure
      (APP) of organs and tissues within the abdominal cavity. Current clinical guidelines for
      septic shock encourage targeting MAP of 65-70 mmHg with the use of vasopressors after volume
      resuscitation. However, it remains unclear if hemodynamic support targeting APP: (a) reduces
      development of acute kidney injury (AKI), (b) decreases progression of AKI, or (c) improves
      renal recovery rate compared to standard care for severe septic shock patients. A novel Foley
      catheter and monitoring device, the Accuryn Monitoring System, is capable of detecting
      physiologic changes in temperature, urine output (UO) and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP).
      These data streams are captured continuously by a device that is minimally invasive and at a
      high frequency which, in combination with MAP, allow for a simple calculation of abdominal
      perfusion pressure (APP). The purpose of this study is to assess kidney function and recovery
      in septic shock patients and elevated IAP when targeting treatment to maintain APP â‰¥ 60 mmHg
      as compared to standard of care targeting MAP of 65-70 mmHg.
