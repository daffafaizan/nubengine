      related to risk for smoking and recalcitrance for quitting. The investigators lab has
      demonstrated that the abstinence-induced reinforcing effects of cigarette smoking are more
      pronounced in ADHD smokers. However, in spite of these increases and demonstrated differences
      in withdrawal severity, interventions that provide reinforcement contingent on abstinence
      appear to work well for smokers with ADHD. To date, no studies have explicitly investigated
      how motivational processes are associated with smoking cessation attempts in ADHD smokers.
      The proposed pilot research is therefore highly innovative since it will evaluate how these
      processes change and influence outcomes during two different kinds of smoking cessation
      interventions. The project will also provide important pilot data on potential differences
      between ADHD and non-ADHD smokers in the context of a contingency management (CM) trial,
      which will help guide the development of more refined and targeted cessation interventions
      for this high risk group of smokers.
