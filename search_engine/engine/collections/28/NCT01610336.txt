      capmatinib in combination with 250 mg gefitinib in patients with NSCLC patients with
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and cMET dysregulation and showing disease
      progression following EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) therapy. Dose escalation
      started with a dose of 100 mg/day to a maximum of 1200 mg/day, as capsule or tablet
      formulation. Successive cohorts of patients were to receive increasing doses of capmatinib in
      combination with a 250 mg once daily (qd) dose of gefitinib until the MTD/RP2D of capmatinib
      had been determined. The Phase II dose expansion part consisted of 400 mg capmatinib twice
      daily (bid), as either capsules or tablets, in combination with 250 mg gefitinib.
