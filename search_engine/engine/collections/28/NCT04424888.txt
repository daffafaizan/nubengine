      System in medical food studies. The Freestyle Libre Glucose Sensors will be used to follow
      subject's 8-day glucose trajectories over the course of a 5-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 2x2 crossover, medical-food experiment. The medical food has been
      designed to increase butyrate production and promote the health of the colonic mucin layer.
