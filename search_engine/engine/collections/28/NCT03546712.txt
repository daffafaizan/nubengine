      will locate a point on the forearm of the blinded child by a black marker pen. Then the child
      will be asked to relocate the point with the help of red marked in blindfolded state. The
      distance between black point and red point (in cm) will be noted as the acuity of tactile
      localization. 15 areas in upper limb will be selected and PPTL will be performed on them. The
      fifteen areas are, phalanges of the palmer area of the little finger (palm 1), phalanx of the
      middle finger of the Palmer area (palm 2), phalanx of the thumb area of palm (palm 3), first
      dorsal interosseous (palm 4), mid last part of the forearm (forearm 1), middle of the medial
      forearm (forearm 2), medial side of the forearm (forearm 3), the lower portion of the arm
      (arm 1), middle posterior of arm (arm 2), lateral side of upper arm (arm 3), lower portion of
      medial arm (arm 4), middle portion of arm (arm 5), the median upper arm (arm 6), lower side
      arm (arm 7), and upper side of arm (arm 8). Mean of three readings will be used for
      estimating the normative reference value of tactile localization by PPTL technique.
