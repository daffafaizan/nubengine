      often taken as an outpatient procedure. Prior to biopsy, the skin is cleansed and injected
      with a numbing solution. These injections can be quite painful in this sensitive area.

      Ice has been used as topical anesthesia in a number of sites, including the cornea, the skin,
      and particularly in the mouth prior to anesthetic injections. However, there is no evidence
      for using ice anesthesia prior to injections of the vulvar tissues.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of using ice as pre-treatment prior to
      the injection of local anesthetic for vulvar biopsy.
