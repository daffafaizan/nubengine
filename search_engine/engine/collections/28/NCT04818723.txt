      Hospital & the Institute of Child Health, Multan. A total of 96 patients aged 1-10 years with
      steroid sensitive Idiopathic NS were assigned into two groups (48 patients in each group).
      The case group received montelukast 5mg daily at bed time while the control group was not
      given montelukast. Steroid treatment protocol was the same for the two groups as per
      institutional guidelines. Patients were monitored and followed for the response to treatment
      and evidence of relapse over the study period (minimum 12 months).
