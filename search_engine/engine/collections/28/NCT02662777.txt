      consequences for the affected patients. Different parameters, like the size, location, time
      to diagnosis of the lesion, but also the general condition of the patient, have a significant
      influence on the clinical outcome of the patient. Often this situation is accompanied by
      symptoms of sepsis and a significant morbidity rate with corresponding substantial mortality
      rate. For this reason the treatment of this clinical situation is often a challenge for the
      clinician.

      Besides surgical examination and the endoscopic stent system, good experiences have been
      obtained with the Endo-SPONGE® therapy for the lower gastrointestinal tract. In the future
      the endoluminal vacuum therapy for the upper gastrointestinal is available, too, with
      Eso-SPONGE®.

      Eso-SPONGE® represent an innovative therapy concept for the treatment of this problem in the
      upper gastrointestinal tract, which can contribute significantly to the reduction of
      morbidity and mortality of the patients.

      The overall success rate of endoscopic esophageal vacuum therapy in the literature ranges
      from 80-100%. Currently only cohort studies including a small number of patients have been
      performed and published. Therefore an international, prospective and multicenter registry was
      designed to collect clinical evidence for Eso-SPONGE treatment concept in a large population
      under daily clinical routine.
