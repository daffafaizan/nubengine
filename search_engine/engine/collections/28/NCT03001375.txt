      the most common surgery operated in laparoscopic colorectal surgeries, However the most
      debatable question in such type of operations that is it mandatory to do splenic flexure
      mobilization or not? In the literatures colorectal surgeons divided into 2 teams, those with
      splenic flexure mobilization in laparoscopic left colorectal resection to have tension free,
      well vascularized anastomosis On the other hand those against splenic flexure mobilization
      reported that omitting this step does not significantly affect the leakage rate, morbidity or
      the oncological outcomes In this study, we evaluate the necessity of splenic flexure
      mobilization in laparoscopic anterior resection for upper rectal tumors and its impact on the
      operative time, total morbidity, leakage rate, oncological safety and continence level
