      of referrals to gastroenterology departments in Denmark.

      The possibilities for treatment for IBS are limited. Treatment strategies that involve the
      microbiota provide symptom relief in some IBS patients. Several studies have demonstrated
      that the composition of the gut microbiota in IBS patients is different from healthy
      controls.

      Probiotic interventions has shown promising results, but it currently remains unknown which
      probiotics are effective and which are not.

      A new probiotic bacterium, Bifidobacterium breve Bif195 (Bif195) has been identified and has
      shown great effects on preventing enteropathy and ulcers on the gut mucosa in healthy
      volunteers given acetylsalicylic acid, and thereby Bif195 has also shown a potential in
      reducing gut permeability defects. This bacterium has not yet been investigated in IBS
      patients.
