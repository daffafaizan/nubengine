      flow and energy utilization and increased myocardial fibrosis as compared to age and gender
      matched hypertensive and healthy controls. The investigators will test their hypotheses by
      comparing measurements of myocardial blood flow, energy utilization, and fibrosis between
      three subject groups (HFpEF vs hypertension vs healthy). Myocardial blood flow will be
      quantitated from nitrogen (N)13-Ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) and gadolinium
      enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, both at rest and stress following coronary
      vasodilation with regadenoson. Myocardial energy utilization will be quantified with
      11C-acetate PET imaging and myocardial fibrosis will be assessed with gadolinium enhanced CMR
      and alterations in myocardial T1. Echocardiography will be utilized to quantify cardiac
      diastolic function.

      It is anticipated that the results of this proposed study will provide a foundation that will
      inform future studies aimed at identifying novel preventive or therapeutic agents in HFpEF.
