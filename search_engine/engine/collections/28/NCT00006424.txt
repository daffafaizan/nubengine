      health and disease. The overall hypothesis is that it is possible to identify neuroimaging
      patterns reflecting reorganization in the human cerebral cortex using fMRI and that it is
      possible to obtain information on the mechanisms underlying some of these plastic changes by
      using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA. This information is potentially
      important for the understanding of mechanisms of cortical reorganization operating in humans.
      Patients and normal volunteers will be scanned at rest and during performance of different
      tasks. These studies should provide new information on mechanisms of human plasticity. The
      MRI techniques used for that purpose are functional MRI (fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and
      conventional MRI with magnets between 1.5 and 4 tesla.
