      structures of the brain and spine, outcome remains poor and the majority of children die from
      this disease. The current study will use a new treatment approach based on each patient's
      tumor gene expression, whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted panel profile (UCSF 500 gene
      panel), and RNA-Seq. This treatment strategy has shown promising results in adult patients
      with solid tumors and is currently being explored in children with DIPG, neuroblastoma and
      other solid tumors. The current study will test the efficacy of such an approach in children
      with HGG for which outcomes remain dismal.
