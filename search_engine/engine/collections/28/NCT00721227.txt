        -  Subject will be informed about the nature of the research, given the Informed Consent
           Document (ICD) to read, and if the subject understands and agrees to the procedure will
           be asked to sign a written informed consent (the ICD).

        -  Subjects will undergo reduction gastroplasty by gastric plication in which a section of
           the stomach will be infolded by multiple rows of sutures.

        -  Subjects are followed for 12 months to evaluate outcomes and potential complications.
