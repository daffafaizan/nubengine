      the posterior capsule, the role of IOL material and optic design remain crucial in
      determining its development. The single-piece Acrylic IOLs with a hydrophobic surface have
      been widely used in practice. The single-piece Acrylic IOLs with a hydrophilic surface became
      commercially available more recently. Although there is a study that compared the single
      piece hydrophobic and the single piece hydrophilic IOL, it was conducted on the older
      generation of the hydrophilic IOL. Moreover, experimental and clinical study has been
      performed to evaluate the posterior capsule opacification between the Hydrophilic acrylic IOL
      with a sharp optic edge design excluding the optic-haptic junction, versus the newer
      generation hydrophilic IOL design which has an improved 360-degree sharp edge, with results
      favouring the latter design. There is little data that compares the single-piece Acrylic IOLs
      with a hydrophobic surface to the newer generation single-piece Acrylic IOLs with a
      hydrophilic surface. Because the IOL characteristics play a crucial role to prevent posterior
      capsule opacification (PCO), it is of clinical importance, as well as investigational
      interest to assess the PCO following implantation of these IOLs. We conducted a prospective,
      randomised, intra-individual study to compare the 3 year postoperative PCO results of the
      single-piece hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs versus the newer generation single-piece hydrophilic
      Acrylic IOLs in patients undergoing bilateral cataract surgery.
