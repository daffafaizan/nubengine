      rifaximin and simvastatin would be effective in patients with decompensated cirrhosis to
      prevent ACLF development Considering that statins have been scarcely investigated in patients
      with decompensated cirrhosis due to a concern of potential higher liver and muscle toxicity
      in this population, a first LIVERHOPE_SAFETY clinical trial (unpublished) was undergone to
      assess safety and toxicity of statins with decompensated cirrhosis.

      As a preliminary result of the LIVERHOPE_SAFETY clinical trial, it was concluded that the
      dose of Simvastatin 20mg per day plus Rifaximin is not associated to a higher risk of liver
      or muscle toxicity in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and simvastatin 20 mg was
      established for the LIVERHOPE_EFFICACY study.
