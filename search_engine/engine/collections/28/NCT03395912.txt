      preventing pain after cesarean section, as opposed to treating pain that has already started.
      The infiltration of surgical wounds by local anesthetics is accepted as an effective method
      for preventing pain after various operations. In this study women who are admitted for a
      cesarean section will be randomly allocated into 2 groups. In the study group after the
      closure of the fascia above the rectus muscles, and before closing the skin, both sides of
      the incision (top and bottom) will be infiltrated by 30 ml of 0.25% BUPIVACAINE and ADRENALIN
      at 1: 200,000 concentration and then closing the skin. In the control group, the skin will be
      closed without infiltration.
