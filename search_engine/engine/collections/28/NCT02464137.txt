      localized by examination and standard diagnostic CT, MR, and PET-CT imaging. Prophylactic
      coverage of uninvolved at-risk mucosal and nodal drainage basins will be strictly disallowed.
      The initial dose cohort will be treated to a total of 42.5 Gy in five equal fractions
      delivered every other day over a two week period (biologically equivalent to 66 Gy delivered
      in 2 Gy daily fractions), drawn from our successful institutional experience with similar
      dosing and fractionation for early-stage larynx SBRT. Escalation of total dose will proceed
      in 2.5 Gy increments, up to a final target dose of 50 Gy.
