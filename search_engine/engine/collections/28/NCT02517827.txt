      260 subjects will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either
      directional atherectomy and drug coated balloon angioplasty (optional with
      stentimplantation), and surgical endarterectomy for treatment in symptomatic
      (Rutherford-Becker class 2 to 4) common femoral artery disease. All subjects will undergo
      repeat duplex-ultrasound measurements 6, 12, and 24 months to assess the primary endpoint of
      Binary Restenosis. Follow-up visits are scheduled 6, 12, and 24 months.
