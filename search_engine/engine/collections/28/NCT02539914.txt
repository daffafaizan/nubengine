      tasks and the investigators aim to understand the benefits of using this principle in
      cognitive and upper-limb motor rehabilitation following stroke. For this purpose, the
      investigators developed a VR attention task in which the user has to find a target image
      within a variable number of distractors by controlling a virtual arm. In some levels of the
      task the target has to be memorized, hence training both attention and memory. The target
      stimuli are positive images based on the individual preferences of each user.

      40 participants within the first 6 months after stroke will be randomly allocated to one of
      two groups: 1) VR motor-cognitive task or 2) standard rehabilitation. The VR motor-cognitive
      task group will use the above described virtual task customized to each user in terms of the
      positive content. This also includes selected music that will be introduced in half of the
      sessions. The standard rehabilitation group will undergo conventional motor and cognitive
      rehabilitation. The intervention consists of 12 sessions of 45 minutes administered within a
      4-6 weeks period. The participants will be evaluated using a number motor and cognitive
      assessment scales at baseline, end of the intervention and a 1-month follow-up.
