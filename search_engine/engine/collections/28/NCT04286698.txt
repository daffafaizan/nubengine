      Turkey. HNC related treatments such as lymph node dissection, tumor excision, chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy, and cancer itself can cause head and neck lymphedema (HNL). The incidence of
      HNL due to HNC treatments (surgery, chemotherapy and chemoradiation) has been reported to be
      between 48% and 90%.

      A recognition of HNL has been growing in recent years, but HNL is still much less recognized
      than upper and lower limb lymphedema and is easily ignored by both patients and health care
      providers. Therefore, in many cases, the diagnosis and treatment of HNL may be delayed, or
      patients cannot access treatment. In routine practice, after HNC, the self-absorption of HNL
      is generally expected. Clinical experiences have confirmed that HNL develops 2-6 months after
      cancer treatment and regresses in some patients over time.

      A variety of physiotherapy approaches have been shown to prevent and minimize physical,
      functional, emotional, and social disorders resulting from HNL. However, complex decongestive
      physiotherapy (CDP) is considered a gold standard treatment method for lymphedema. This
      method consists of manual lymph drainage (MLD), skin care, compression therapy, and
      therapeutic exercises. Although there are many studies about the effects of CDP on upper and
      lower limbs, there is only a limited number of studies about HNL and CDP in the literature.
