      "do-nothing". In the arm "incentive to vaccinate", vaccination campaigns will be carried out
      with face-to-face interviews of nursing home workers in order to achieve more than 80% of
      vaccination coverage. In the "do-nothing", nursing home workers will be vaccinated as usual.

      The main endpoint criterion is all-cause mortality of residents. Population sets will be all
      residents who will be present at start of the influenza season (-2 weeks) or who will be
      admitted during the influenza season (+ 2 weeks). Onset and end of influenza season will be
      given by regional influenza surveillance system. Secondary criteria are hospitalizations of
      residents, morbidity of nursing home workers. A cost-effectiveness ratio of influenza
      vaccination will be calculated.
