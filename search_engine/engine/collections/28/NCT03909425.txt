      aflibercept has transformed the outlook for patients with this sight-threatening disease.

      In clinical practice, eye doctors commonly use a "treat and extend" approach to treatment in
      which the interval between aflibercept injections is gradually increased once there is nAMD
      disease quiescence.

      It is uncertain about the ideal retinal imaging biomarkers doctors should use to define
      disease remission or inactivity; and therefore extend treatment intervals. Increased
      certainty of the ideal biomarker would also avoid stopping treatment too soon.

      The scan the investigators will be performing (OCTA imaging) detects blood flow within the
      choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) - the immature blood vessel network which causes nAMD.
      This scan is therefore a potentially powerful way of determining if the disease is active or
      quiescent. Disease activity on this device can be defined as a blood flow pattern which
      suggests an active CNV or lesion growth.

      By better defining disease activity using OCTA, eye doctors would be more confident in
      continuing and defining a treatment plan for nAMD.
