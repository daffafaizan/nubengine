    
      Retinal vascular anomalous complex represents a distinct form of neovascularization in
      patients with age-related macular degeneration.

      The study investigated the changes in retinal vascular network using optical coherence
      tomography angiography, a novel and non invasive diagnostic technique that allows to better
      understand the pathophysiologic mechanism of this neovascularization.
