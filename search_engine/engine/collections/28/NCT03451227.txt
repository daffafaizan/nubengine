      some time, and there is increasing evidence that ablation may be superior to medical
      management. As populations age, the rate of AF is likely to increase and therefore the
      numbers of ablations performed for this arrhythmia will also be expected to increase.

      Ablation procedures can vary in length from one to more than 6 hours in duration and require
      the patient to keep still so as not to influence the mapping procedure.

      Options for anaesthesia care include a general anaesthetic or sedation. Several studies have
      evaluated the safety of sedation for ablation, using combinations of fentanyl, midazolam and
      propofol. These demonstrate that the ablation procedures are well tolerated under deep
      sedation.

      Dexmedetomidine is an attractive potential agent for this role due to its favourable
      respiratory pharmacodynamics and good sedation profile. Dexmedetomidine is a short acting
      relatively specific alpha-2 receptor agonist (alpha 2: alpha 1 = 1300:1). It has been shown
      to have very little effect on respiratory parameters, even at high doses.In addition, it may
      offer some analgesic properties and therefore minimise the need for narcotic based agents.
      the investigators will compare dexmedetomidine infusion and fentanyl bolus with remifentanil
      infusion midazolam bolus.
