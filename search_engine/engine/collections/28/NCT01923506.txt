      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with an upper limit of 45 Gray (Gy) in 5
      fractions, in the delivery of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the prostate
      fossa.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess acute and late toxicities from treatment.

      II. To assess biochemical progression-free survival.

      III. To collect prospective quality-of-life data related to bowel, urinary, and sexual
      health.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive 5 fractions of SBRT over 1.5 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days and then
      periodically for 3 years.
