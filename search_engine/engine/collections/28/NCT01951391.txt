    
      The timeline for the patients will be as follows:

      On Day 0, after being given a witnessed, written, informed consent, a medical history and a
      limited physical exam will be performed. If using certain topical products and medications
      that are not allowed during this study, patients may be asked to withhold them for the
      remainder of the study. The study doctor or study coordinator will explain which medications
      and activities are not allowed during this study. Baseline bacterial swabs from the bilateral
      volar forearms will be collected followed by application and rinsing of a hand wash with an
      antimicrobial compound (benzalkonium chloride or triclocarban) on the right forearm, and a
      cleanser without an antimicrobial compound (control) on the left forearm. 200 microliters of
      water/hand wash will be applied to the volar forearms and lather generated for 15 seconds
      using a gloved hand. The lather will be allowed to stay in contact with the skin for an
      additional 30 seconds. The total contact time will be 60 sec. The forearm will be rinsed with
      running tap water for 15 seconds, air-dried for 5 minutes and the skin surface will again be
      swabbed for bacteria 10 minutes after the wash. The same procedure will be repeated on the
      2nd volar forearm with the opposing wash. Subjects will then have repeat skin swabs at 6
      hours +/- 1 hour and at 24 hours +/- 6 hours after washing. Subjects will be instructed to
      avoid rigorous exercise/swimming, significant sun exposure (i.e. sunbathing), cleaning the
      forearms with other antibacterial products, and showering during these 24 hours.
