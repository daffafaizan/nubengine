        -  Compare the change in depression severity in cancer patients with mild to moderate
           depression treated with sertraline vs Hypericum perforatum.

        -  Compare the severity of somnolence, nausea, and insomnia in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the impact of these regimens on fatigue in these patients.

        -  Correlate hyperforin concentrations with change in depression severity in patients
           treated with Hypericum perforatum.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to level
      of depression (mild vs moderate), concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no), and TNM stage (I, II,
      or III vs IV). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sertraline daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral Hypericum perforatum daily. In both arms, treatment
           continues for 4 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Measurements of depression, somnolence, nausea, insomnia, fatigue, and hyperforin
      concentration are assessed at baseline, and at 1, 2, and 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 250 patients will be accrued for this study.
