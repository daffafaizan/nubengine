      assessment, and bowel preparation were prospectively collected and recorded in the online
      Redcap software. Final results of polyp histology were also collected. The video library was
      then independently reviewed for quality assessment by 3 experienced gastroenterologists.
      Videos that passed the initial quality assessment were then independently evaluated using the
      Discovery-AI system.

      Aim of the study was to evaluate overall performance of Discovery-AI system for polyps of
      various size, morphology and pathology utilizing a prospectively developed video library.
