    
      Observational prospective multicenter study Primary outcome: To analyze the efficacy and
      tolerance of NIV and HFNC in patients admitted to intensive care unit, or intermediate catre
      unit for acute respiratory insufficiency for whom a a do-not intubate order decision was
      taken upon admission or after extubation if the patient initially received mechanical
      ventilation.

      Secondary outcomes: To analyze the efficacy and tolerance of NIV and HFNC according to the
      following reason for ICU admission: chronic obstructive pneumopathy decompensated COPD,
      severe heart failure, evolutive cancer or hematologic malignancy; to analyze tolerance and
      acceptability of different techniques; to analyze the duration of the oxygenation methods
      use; to analyze the modalities of eventual withdrawing life support therapies and the
      associated sedative and opioid treatments; to analyze the satisfaction for the use of the non
      invasive technique by the relatives and the caregivers; to analyze mortality at D28 and D90
      and quality of life at 3 and 6 months in surviving patients
