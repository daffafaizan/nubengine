    
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-shortening genetic condition among Caucasians in
      the United States. Individuals with CF have an altered gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota,
      which may be a result of chronic systemic inflammation and infection, frequent use of
      antibiotics, and/or medically prescribed and habitual high-fat/high-calorie diets.

      The study will assess if administration of high-dose vitamin D and a commonly used prebiotic
      (inulin) is effective to reduce gastrointestinal dysbiosis and to improve critical intestinal
      functions in Cystic Fibrosis.
