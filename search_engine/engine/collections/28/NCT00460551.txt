      zalatumumab fixed dose 8 mg/kg. Part 1B was planned as zalutumumab dose-titration and Part 2
      adding a comparator. The trial was prematurely closed for enrolment when patients had only
      been enrolled in Part 1A due to published results showing increased toxicity from induction
      chemotherapy without any survival benefit.
