      airway disease which causes dyspnea, wheezing, coughing and increased secretions in airways.
      Thoracic and respiratory mechanics are impaired, respiratory muscle strength and functional
      exercise capacity is decreased in patients with COPD. As a result dyspnea, limitation in
      activities of daily living, postural impairments, muscle length-strength relationship changes
      and increased mechanical loads on respiratory muscles occur. In literature it has been
      demonstrated that Kinesio Taping have therapeutic effects on respiratory functions and
      functional exercise capacity in patients with chronic neurological diseases who has
      additional respiratory impairments. Although there are several studies in literature
      investigating the effects of facilitation and inhibition taping techniques applied on
      respiratory muscles in patients with COPD, effects of thoracic and postural mechanical
      correction techniques as an alternative treatment modality in patients with COPD have not
      been investigated yet. In present study, effects of thoracic mechanical correction and
      facilitation taping techniques in patients with COPD will be investigated, and data will be
      collected for effects of thoracic mechanical correction taping on pulmonary parameters in
      patients with COPD.
