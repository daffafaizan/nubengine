      low effectiveness of corticosteroids. Despite high response rate to systemic immunosupressive
      agents, long term survival in this group is poor due to recurrent septic episodes and gut
      colonization with multidrug resistant bacteria. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a
      healthy allogeneic donor, allows to restore numerous local and systemic microbiota functions,
      including immunomodulation and thus to reduce/stop the manifestations of GVHD. The
      therapeutic mechanism of action of FMT is based on competition for nutrients between obligate
      and pathologic bacterial strains, direct growth inhibition of the pathological pathogens,
      host immune system modulation, especially T-reg homeostasis, through interaction with the
      normal microbiota.In this pilot trial we combine FMT with ruxolitinib and steroids, one of
      the most effective option for refractory GVHD.
