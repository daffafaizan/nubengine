      FDA approved Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating factor (G-CSF). Very small embryonic-like stem
      cells (VSELs) are found in the testis and ovary. VSELs are stem cells that have noticed to
      survive chemotherapy induced gonadal failure. Data from animal studies showed that
      stimulation of these stem cells result in generation of the affected gonads. Studies on mice
      have shown a promising stimulating effect of Filgrastim on recovery of spermatogenesis and
      oogenesis after chemotherapy-induced gonadal failure (in 2013, 2014, and 2015).
