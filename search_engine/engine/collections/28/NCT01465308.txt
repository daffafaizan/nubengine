      of ionising radiation to oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosa gives rise to radiation
      epithelitis towards the second and third weeks of conventional fractionated radiotherapy.
      Likewise, salivary flow may decrease by approximately 50% during the first week of
      radiotherapy and upwards of 80% by the seventh week of treatment. Acute radiation-induced
      xerostomia is associated with inflammatory reaction. The study will include an intervention
      and a control group, one receiving honey prior and after the radiotherapy and the other group
      not receiving honey at all.
