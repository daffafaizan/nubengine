      disease burden across the lifespan. Recurring abdominal pain is the most prevalent and
      distressing symptom. Pain severity reduces health-related quality of life for individuals
      with CP and is associated with increased fatigue, anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower
      general health status, and reduced physical and role functioning. Medical therapies for CP
      pain have limited efficacy. Cognitive-behavioral interventions (CBT) offer safe and effective
      alternatives to pharmacological treatments for pain management. In other chronic painful
      conditions including gastrointestinal disorders, CBT interventions have been effective for
      reducing pain and pain impact including disability and depressive symptoms. CBT is
      traditionally provided by trained psychologists working with individual patients one-on-one
      or in small groups. Access to CBT is limited by availability of providers, with long waiting
      lists at centers offering CBT. The Internet is an ideal medium to provide pain
      self-management interventions that are low-cost and sustainable, and internet-based CBT has
      shown efficacy in children and adults with chronic pain, allowing clinics to greatly extend
      their reach to patients. The purpose of this study is to test the acceptability, feasibility,
      and preliminary efficacy of an Internet-delivered CBT pain self-management course for adults
      with acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis pain.
