    
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric
      disorders in children and adolescents. It is characterized by inattentive, hyperactive,
      impulsive behaviour and neuropsychological deficits. In 40-60% of cases emerge in childhood
      and persists into adulthood.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the response on cognitive testing of healthy persons
      compared to adults with or without medication against ADHD. As a secondary endpoint a more
      robust diagnosing method combining advanced imaging methods with neuropsychological
      evaluation is tested.

      Neuropsychological testing, functional MRI and spectroscopy will be performed. Statistical
      analysis will assess differences in the functional magnetic resonance imaging, spectroscopy
      and neuropsychological evaluation results between three groups: 1) group of healthy
      volunteers, 2) participants with ADHD with medication and 3) participants with ADHD without
      medication.
