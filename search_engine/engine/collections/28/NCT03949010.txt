      patients with MPS related to upper trapezius TPs and randomized the patients to KT treatment
      group with space correction technique and home exercise program (KSCT, n=20), KT treatment
      group with muscle inhibition technique and home exercise program (KMIT, n=24) and control
      group (CG, n=27) which received home exercise program only. Patients were evaluated by
      numerical rating scale (NRS) for their average and maximum pain intensity, Turkish version of
      neck disability index (NDI), and short form-36 (SF-36) scales. Statistical tests were
      conducted at the 0.05 significance level for all outcome measures.
