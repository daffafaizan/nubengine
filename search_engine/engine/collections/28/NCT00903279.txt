      surgery will significantly reduce healthcare costs to the VA by reducing the number of MRSA
      positive patients who need to be isolated and or closely monitored, and allow healthcare
      providers to better predict the patient's requirements. In addition, the application of
      molecular methods will facilitate faster tracking of MRSA postoperative infections.
