      except for patients with MRLN metastasis, are randomly assigned to receive MRLN sparing or
      prophylactic irradiation . Patients in MRLN sparing group will not routinely receive MRLN
      irradiation to 56Gy/33Fr; while patients in MRLN prophylactic irradiation group will always
      receive MRLN irradiation to 56Gy/33Fr. Our primary endpoint is local relapse-free survival
      (LRFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), incidence of out-field recurrence
      rate, toxic effects, and quality of life (QOL).All efficacy analyses are conducted in the
      intention-to treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive
      their randomly assigned treatment.
