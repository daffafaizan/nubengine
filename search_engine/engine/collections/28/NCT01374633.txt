      Sevoflurane, an inhaled anaesthetic drug is commonly used in operatory room. Thanks to a new
      device, the Anaconda, it now can be applied to intensive care patients. His advantages a
      rapid elimination after administration stops, which can allow an early neurologic evaluation,
      very important for traumatic brain injury patients.We will study the effect of sevoflurane
      administration on ICP of TBI patients. Patients admitted for severe TBI (Glasgow come scale <
      8), equipped with ICP sensor, elder than 18 years old will be include. A sedation with
      sevoflurane will be administrated during 12 hours instead of classical intra venous sedation
      with midazolam, depending on BIS score. ICP evolution will be characterised in success if <
      30 mmHg or failure if ≥ 30 mmHg.6 patients will be included for the first phase. The study
      will be stopped if the failures are ≥ 2. Otherwise, 27 patients will be included. Study will
      be stopped if failures number ≥ 5 before the end if the inclusion period.
