      death. Left-ventricular ejection fraction < 30% is associated with a 5-year mortality > 70%.
      Therefore, new strategies and therapies towards treatment of heart failure are needed.

      Heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction can develop in CHD beyond the area of
      myocardial infarction. Some of these patients develop myocardial autoantibodies, which have
      been shown to exert a negative inotropic effect. Their elimination by immunoadsorption has
      been shown to improve left ventricular function in dilatative cardiomyopathy. Immunoglobulins
      are substituted to minimize infection risk at a level, which has been shown not to effect
      cardiac function. This intervention might also ameliorate cardiac function in patients with
      heart failure due to other origins. This study therefore aims to evaluate the effect of
      immunoadsorption with subsequent immunoglobulin substitution.
