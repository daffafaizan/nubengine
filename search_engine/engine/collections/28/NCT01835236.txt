      Primary

      -To evaluate the efficacy in terms of overall survival (OS) at 24 months of a
      chemotherapy-free dual HER2-inhibition with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (first-line) followed
      by T-DM1 (second-line) and of a chemotherapy-containing dual HER2-inhibition with trastuzumab
      and pertuzumab (first-line) followed by T-DM1 (second-line) in patients with HER2-positive
      metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate other efficacy parameter

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of the two treatment strategies

        -  To evaluate the Quality of Life (QoL)

        -  To learn how patients are treated after trial treatment

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to hormone receptor
      status (positive vs negative), prior trastuzumab (never or >12 months vs â‰¤12 months after
      last infusion), visceral metastases (present vs absent) and site. Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.
