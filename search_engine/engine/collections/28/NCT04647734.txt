      biochemistry, ECG, DXA, OGTT, Pulmonary function, VO2max, RM, plasma volume, AX3, CGM,
      echocardiography, cardiac MRI.

      After baseline testing, participants will be randomly allocated into one group receiving
      standard of care (control group) or a group performing supervised high-intensity interval
      training three times a week over a period of 12 weeks. The randomization procedure involves a
      computer-generated block randomization schedule in a ratio of 1:1 stratified by sex by an
      independent person. Following the 12-week intervention period, both groups will complete a
      series of follow-up tests (as baseline testing). A 1-year follow-up experimental day is also
      planned in order to evaluate fitness, cardiac and pulmonary structure and function.
