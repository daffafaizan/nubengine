    
      This is non-randomized, parallel-cohort, prospective, multicenter (when more than one
      hospital works on a medical research study), observational study to describe the treatment of
      T2DM with canagliflozin during the Holy Month of Ramadan. Observed participants will be
      participants with T2DM (at the time of enrollment) who are being treated with either
      canagliflozin or any sulphonylurea, each administered on a background therapy of metformin
      with or without a DPP-4 inhibitor within clinical practice, and who intend to fast during the
      Ramadan period. On enrollment, patients will enter one of two parallel treatment cohorts
      based on their ongoing T2DM therapy: canagliflozin and metformin with or without a DPP-4
      inhibitor will be the treatment of interest, while any sulphonylurea and metformin with or
      without a DPP-4 inhibitor will serve as the reference standard treatment. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
