      so far. Currently, the short form of the Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI-SF) was used
      most frequently internationally. In Germany there is no validated translation of the AMI-SF.
      However, in order to be able to systematically record the cognitive side effects of ECT in
      clinical practice as well as in research in the German-speaking area, it is important to have
      validated test procedures that can be successfully used in repeated measurements. In this
      study, the German version of the AMI (D-AMI), i.e. the specificity of the German short
      version of the autobiographical memory in patients with depression will be investigated. It
      is also known in healthy people that autobiographical memory contents can no longer be called
      up over time. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether a change in
      autobiographical memory over the course of time in depressed patients differs from healthy
      control subjects. It should also be shown whether this German short version for examining
      autobiographical memory (D-AMI) can be carried out.
