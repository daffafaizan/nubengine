      I. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach by determining the 1-year progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To evaluate day 100 non-relapse mortality.

      III. To determine the incidences of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
      chronic extensive GVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days -5 to -3 and intermediate-dose melphalan IV over 15-20 minutes on day -2.
      Patients also undergo low-dose TBI on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      80 with taper to day 180 (related donors) or on days -3 to 100 with taper to day 180
      (unrelated donors). Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27 (related
      donors) or thrice daily (TID) on days 0-40 with taper to day 96 (unrelated donors).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months,
      and then annually thereafter for 5 years.
