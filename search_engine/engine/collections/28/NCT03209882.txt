      been indicated that hypoactivity of the prefrontal cortex plays a major role in the disrupted
      neural circuitry of mood and cognition.

      Transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) is a neural type of photobiomodulation that
      can elevate neuronal metabolism by exciting cytochrome c oxidase (CCO). Veterans with PTSD
      will receive prefrontal TILS interventions once-per-week for six weeks. They will also
      receive an additional sham intervention (laser power = 0) that will be randomly assigned into
      the first two sessions. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (bbNIRS) will be used to
      directly assess the CCO changes during every TILS/sham session.

      Veterans' prefrontal functions will be evaluated with three short-term memory tasks before
      and after each intervention. The prefrontal activities will also be imaged by functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to objectively assess the functional changes due to
      TILS/sham interventions.
