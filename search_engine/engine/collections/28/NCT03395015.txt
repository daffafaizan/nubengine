      reconstruction as well as the repair of lip and nasal soft tissue defects.

      From an esthetic point of view, the primary repair, usually performed between 9 and 18 months
      of age, prepares the patients to grow into childhood and succeed in life without focusing on
      their deformity.

      An increasing number of outcome measure rating systems has been raised, suggesting a lack of
      consensus to a reliable, validated and reproducible scoring system for facial aesthetics in
      cleft patients. Many templates and lay panel scoring systems have been described, yet never
      fully validated. Advanced 3D imaging technologies may produce validated outcome measures in
      the future, but presently there remains a need to develop a robust method of facial aesthetic
      evaluation based on standardised patient photographs.

      The aim of the study is to to determine and compare the level of agreement among examiners'
      subjective aesthetic evaluation of full-face and nasolabial region 3-D images of CLP patients
      following primary lip repair by laypeople, developing some recommendations for a consistent
      scoring protocol.
