      aspirin and loading dose of one of P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (e.g., 600 mg clopidogrel, 60 mg
      prasugrel or 180 mg ticagrelor) preferably ≥2 hours before the intervention. These loading
      doses can be waived for chronic antiplatelet users, and prasugrel or ticagrelor can be used
      instead of clopidogrel. Choice for P2Y12 inhibitors will be left to responsible physicians'
      discretion, and this decision will be based on the patient/lesional characteristics.
