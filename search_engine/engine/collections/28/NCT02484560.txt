      resulting in an absence of dystrophin which ultimately leads to progressive muscle
      degeneration. Patients with DMD progressively lose functional abilities of movement, breath,
      and eventually the ability to circulate blood. Currently, there is no cure for DMD, although
      several strategies are being tested for treatment, none have yet proven to be sufficient.
      Children with DMD are generally divided into two groups based on severity or progression of
      the disease, non-ambulatory and ambulatory. Ambulatory patients are capable of walking
      independently while non-ambulatory patients cannot walk independently.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Allogenic Mesenchymal Stem Cell
      Therapy in Ambulatory and Non-ambulatory Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and
      determine its suitability as a form of treatment.
