      safety profile. Based on possible therapeutic effects, we decided to lead an Investigation
      into Beneficial Effects of high-dose Interferon Beta 1a, Compared to low-dose Interferon Beta
      1a (the base therapeutic regimen) in Moderate to Severe COVID-19.

      Previous studies demonstrate that IFN-β 1a could be used against some coronaviruses including
      avium infectious, bronchitis virus, murine hepatitis virus, and SARS- CoV because they are
      susceptible in vitro or in vivo. In a current study, the efficacy of IFN-β 1a in COVID-19
      patients were evaluated, and they found than IFN-β 1a reduced the disease symptoms.

      The present study is a randomized clinical trial, with the approval of the ethics committee
      will be conducted on patients who have a positive test confirming COVID-19 in Loghman Hakim
      Medical Education Center in Tehran.
