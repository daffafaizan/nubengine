      a package containing a cover letter explaining the study, a consent form, an assent form if
      applicable, a questionnaire (designed to evaluate longer-term outcome measures including the
      occurrence of recurrent endocarditis, late surgical intervention or the need for
      re-operations) and a self addressed stamped envelope to be used to return the consents and
      the questionnaire. The data will then be entered into a database and analyzed.
