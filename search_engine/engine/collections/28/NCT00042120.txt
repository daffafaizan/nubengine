      a focus on environmental determinants. We propose to investigate the relationship between
      Parkinson's disease and exposure to pesticides and other factors by conducting a nested
      case-control study in the Agricultural Health Study.

      The Agricultural Health Study is a cohort study of 52,000 licensed pesticide applicators and
      32,000 of their spouses, conducted in North Carolina and Iowa. It is a joint effort of the
      National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the
      US Environmental Protection Agency.

      The studies proposed here take full advantage of the Agricultural Health Study. We believe
      that this work could provide a critical and dramatic next step in furthering our knowledge of
      environmental determinants of PD, and thereby take us closer to our goal of finding its
      cause(s)
