      Primary

        -  To determine if the delivery of external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation
           (APBI) based on gold fiducial markers is more accurate when compared to the delivery of
           radiotherapy based on bony anatomy in women with early-stage, node-negative breast
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the migration of fiducial markers during a course of APBI.

        -  To quantify the change in the volume of the seroma (lumpectomy) cavity during a course
           of APBI.

        -  To compare overall operative time for suturing fiducial markers into place vs current
           standard method of placing surgical clips.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo planned lumpectomy with gold fiducial marker placement (if
      procedure not already performed). Patients who meet the post lumpectomy criteria for continue
      treatment in this study proceed to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Between
      15-80 days after surgery, patients undergo 3-dimensional APBI (may be intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy) using CT-guided planning (with gold fiducial markers placed at lumpectomy) once
      daily, 5 days a week, for 15 days.

      Patients undergo fluoroscopy weekly to determine real-time movement of bony anatomy and
      fiducial markers and cone-beam CT weekly to determine any change in volume of seroma cavity.
