      season (Sept-Nov) of 2015. 15 students per grade-level (grades 1-8), were invited to
      participate. Following enrollment, students were evaluated at baseline for
      screening-and-treatment, and followed-up 1, 2 and 6 weeks later. At each follow-up visit, a
      blood sample was obtained for microscopy and molecular detection of parasites and students
      were interviewed about bed net use the night prior, current or recent illness, and use of
      antimalarial treatment. At the final visit, a mRDT and hemoglobin test were repeated, and
      parents were interviewed and portable medical records ("health passports") were reviewed to
      identify intercurrent fever or malaria treatment.
