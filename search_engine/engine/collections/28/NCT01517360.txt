      interpret socially relevant information. These deficits in social cognition can lead to
      misunderstanding the intentions of others and failing to interpret social signals that are
      important for successful social interactions. The relationship between social cognition and
      functioning has led our group to develop a research agenda that includes understanding the
      neural underpinnings of social cognitive deficits, measuring these impairments using
      brain-based biomarkers and clinical assessments, and enhancing our Social Cognitive Skills
      Training program to improve social cognition and promote recovery.

      Oxytocin, which is a hormone and neurotransmitter, is believed to impact social cognition
      through increased orienting toward and attending to socially salient visual features. There
      is also evidence that oxytocinergic signaling is impaired in schizophrenia. With this
      research, we hope to learn whether administration of oxytocin will improve different aspects
      of social cognition by examining the effects of oxytocin versus placebo administered
      intranasally before each of 12 sessions of a social cognitive skills training program on
      measures of independent living, work and social functioning.
