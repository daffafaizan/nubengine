      During each treatment subjects will receive both Infini and LaseMD treatments. Treatments
      will be provided according to a protocol-specific treatment protocol in which an Infini
      treatment will be provided first, followed by a LaseMD treatment. A telephone contact will be
      completed at 3 days following each treatment to assess for adverse events. One follow-up
      visit will be conducted at 90 days following the last study treatment. Outcome measures
      include clinician grading and subject satisfaction post-treatment. Pre-treatment study
      photographs and D90 study photographs will be obtained.
