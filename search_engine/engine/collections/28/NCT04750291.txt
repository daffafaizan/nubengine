      biceps tendon: a double-blinded randomized controlled trial Précis: Double-blinded randomized
      controlled trial with 20 people. Randomization in 2 arms of 10 people. 3 visits will be
      planned with a meantime of 3 months after the infiltration with botulinum toxin type A
      (BTX-A) or placebo that will be administered at the 2nd visit.

      Objective: The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of an infiltration with
      botulinum toxin in the biceps muscle after tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon for
      pain and disability reduction.

      Endpoint: The primary endpoint is a pain reduction as measured by the Visual Analogue pain
      scale (VAS) and a reduced disability as measured by the quick DASH (Disabilities of the Arm,
      Shoulder and Hand).

      Population: 20 people who underwent an arthroscopic tenotomy of the long head of the biceps
      tendon and are having post-operative pain in the biceps muscle.
