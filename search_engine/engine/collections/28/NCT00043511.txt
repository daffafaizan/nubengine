      parasite derived antigens. Early clinical experiences with HIV DNA vaccines in humans
      indicate: 1) the tolerability and short-term safety of DNA at doses up to 5000 mcg in humans
      are excellent; and 2) there is potential for immunogenicity.

      The pGA2/JS2 DNA vaccine is part of a planned prime/boost regimen of a DNA vaccine prime
      followed by a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine boost. In studies in monkeys, a
      combination of a DNA vaccine and an MVA vaccine protected the monkeys against disease caused
      by a monkey virus similar to HIV. The current study is an initial investigation of the safety
      and immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine given alone. The pGA2/JS2 DNA vaccine expresses gag,
      protease, reverse transcriptase, env, tat, vpu, and rev.

      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. People in Group A receive either 2 injections
      of a lower dose (300 mcg) of the DNA plasmid vaccine or the placebo control. People in Group
      B receive either 2 injections of a higher dose (3000 mcg) of the DNA plasmid vaccine or the
      control. Group B will be enrolled only if the vaccine is found to be safe and well-tolerated
      during the initial 2-week evaluation of all participants in Group A. Participants receive
      vaccinations administered at Months 0 and 2. All vaccinations are administered by
      intramuscular (IM) injection in an outpatient setting. Participants have about 10 clinic
      visits during this study, including the screening and injection visits. Participants give
      blood and urine samples at study visits. They are tested for HIV before entering the study
      and 4 more times during the study. Women who can become pregnant may undergo up to 3
      pregnancy tests during the study period.
