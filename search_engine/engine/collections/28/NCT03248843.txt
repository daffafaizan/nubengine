      in Japanese patients with advanced and metastatic solid tumor.

      The dose escalation will follow the widely used 3+3 design. Cohorts of 3-6 subjects will be
      enrolled sequentially at escalating doses of 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg weekly. Dose
      escalation will continue until identification of MTD up to a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg. MTD is
      defined as the highest dose studied at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects has experienced a
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1. The enrolled patients are managed under
      hospitalization for DLT observation period (C1 28 days). If no DLTs occur in a cohort of 3
      subjects, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3
      subjects in a cohort experiences a DLT, that cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If only 1
      of the 6 subjects has a DLT, then the next cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at the next
      higher dose level. If 2 or more DLTs occur within a cohort, then that dose level will be
      above the MTD, and the previous lower (tolerated) dose level will be considered the MTD if ≤
      1 in 6 subjects has a DLT.

      A subject who withdraws from the study during Cycle 1 for reasons other than a DLT will be
      replaced.

      Subjects will be monitored for safety and efficacy throughout the study. After radiological
      tumor assessment at Screening, the first radiological assessment of tumor response status
      will be performed at Week 12 (± 1 week), unless there is clinical indication warranting
      earlier radiologic imaging. The same imaging technique used at baseline has to be used
      throughout the study.
