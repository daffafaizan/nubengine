      program that simultaneously target diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. We hypothesize
      that pharmacist-led group interventions on a weekly basis for 4-weeks then on a monthly basis
      for 5 additional months may achieve concomitant reductions in hemoglobin A1c, lipids and
      blood pressure. We are proposing a pilot randomized controlled study to test the efficacy and
      feasibility of this approach.
