      response to combination of immunotherapy with targeted therapy in FH-deficient renal cell
      carcinoma, therefore we intented to perform this single-arm phase II clinical trial to
      evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of Sintilimab injection combined with Inlyta in
      FH-deficient renal cell carcinoma.
