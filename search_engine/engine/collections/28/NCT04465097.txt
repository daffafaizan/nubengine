      neoadjuvant strategy in estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer patients.This study
      will recruit 30 patients. The 30 patients will receive 25 mg exemestane QD for 26 weeks.
      Tucidinostat will be prescribed 30 mg BIW from week 3 to week 26. During neoadjuvant
      treatment biopsy, CEUS and MRI will be perfomed according to protocol to evaluate the
      therapeutic results. Genetic testing will also be performed before and after neoadjuvant
      treatment to explore the predictive value. MRI evaluated ORR is primary end point. CEUS
      evaluated ORR, pCR, AE and RCB are secondary end point.
