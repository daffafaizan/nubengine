    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, open label, Phase IIa trial of RP-1127 (Glyburide for
      Injection) in 10 patients with a severe anterior circulation ischemic stroke who are likely
      to experience clinically significant brain swelling.

      Subjects will receive RP-1127 (Glyburide for Injection), delivered as an IV bolus followed by
      an IV infusion for 72 hours.

      Subjects will have a baseline (pretreatment) MRI scan as standard of care, and three follow
      up MRI scans (at 24+12 hours, 48+12 hours, and 72±12 hours). Since recanalization may have an
      effect on outcome, the results of vascular studies, obtained as part of standard of care and
      defined as CTA, MRA or catheter angiography of the head and neck, will be recorded.
      Additionally, clinical endpoints such as the NIHSS, GCS and FOUR Score (baseline, 24±12 hour,
      48±12 hour, 72±12 hour and 7±1 days) and mRS (30±5 days and 90±7 days) will be assessed.
      Safety parameters will be assessed through Day 7 or discharge (whichever is sooner), and then
      again at Day 30±5 and Day 90±7.

      Study participation is expected to last 90±7 days.
