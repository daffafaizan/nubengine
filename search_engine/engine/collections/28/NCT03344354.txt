      clinical investigation in which the perforation rate of surgical gloves from four different
      manufacturers will be evaluated in double-gloving fashion. Study clinicians who will directly
      in the sterile field, with a similar surgical procedural work scope will be asked to use
      gloves from the four manufacturers of surgical gloves: Molnlycke Health Care, Ansell,
      Medline, and Cardinal - while performing those surgical procedures. The types of procedures
      under which the study gloves will be put in use are prosthetic joints arthroplasty and
      implantation (i.e. orthopedic), trauma surgery, neurosurgery, colorectal and cardiothoracic
      surgery.

      All gloves under evaluation in each phase will be assessed for perforation rate and overall
      failure on the basis of binomial responses (Y/N) looking at five time points:

        -  glove failure pre-donning (after removal from pack, prior to donning)

        -  glove failure during donning (putting the gloves on)

        -  observed intraoperative glove failure

        -  glove failure during doffing (glove removal)

        -  post-procedure: glove perforation and failure determined using a standardized water leak
           test

      No patient data will be assessed.
