    
      In a previous study (AFLUCO2) in healthy volunteers with saline-induced hypoaldosteronism,
      the investigators found that single doses of both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone induced
      a significant decrease in the pressor response to phenylephrine, probably due to a rapid
      non-genomic vasodilatory mechanism, and that these effects were additive.

      The investigators also showed that, at the doses used in septic shock, hydrocortisone induced
      more pronounced mineralocorticoid effects than fludrocortisone and also induced systemic
      hemodynamic effects whereas fludrocortisone did not.

      The investigators now want to perform a dose-response study under normal conditions (ie
      without saline-induced hypoaldosteronism) and after repeated administrations, to determine
      the optimal dose of fludrocortisone that allows an increase in the pressor response to
      phenylephrine and to characterize its concomitant hemodynamic and biological effects.

      This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over, 4-periods (fludrocortisone 100
      μg/day, 200 μg/day, 400 μg/day, or placebo) study aims to investigate hemodynamic and
      biological effects of fludrocortisone administered orally during 5 days, in healthy
      volunteers.

      Each period will be separated from the next one by a washout interval of at least 14 days.
