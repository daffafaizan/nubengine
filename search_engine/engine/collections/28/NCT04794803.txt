    
      This clinical trial is an adaptive phase 2/3, randomized, controlled multicenter study on the
      efficacy and safety of Reparixin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19
      pneumonia. 48 patients are planned to be enrolled in Phase 2 and an estimated total of 111
      patients are planned to be enrolled up to the end of Phase 3, with a randomization 2:1
      Reparixin vs Control (Standard of care).

      In the phase 2 segment of this study, patients are randomized 2:1 to Reparixin oral tablets
      1200 mg (Group 1, active treatment) or standard of care (Group 2, control arm). In case of
      worsening (e.g. need of ICU and/or mechanical ventilation) after the first 24hrs, patients
      are offered a rescue medication with no restriction from the sponsor and fully based on their
      physicians' judgement.

      In the phase 3 segment of this study, it is planned that patients are randomized 2:1 to
      Reparixin or standard of care. The Phase 3 design will be reassessed and decided based on the
      results of the Phase 2.
