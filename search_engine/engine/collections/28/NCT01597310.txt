    
      This is a single center open label study to assess the effect of Dexpramipexole on the PK of
      Warfarin in Healthy Volunteers. The goals of this study are as follows: to assess the effect
      of dexpramipexole on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of warfarin, to assess the safety and
      tolerability of dexpramipexole when administered alone, and with warfarin, and to assess the
      PK of dexpramipexole when administered alone; to explore the influence of genetic variation
      on the PK and international normalized ratio (INR) of warfarin when administered alone, and
      with dexpramipexole; and to explore the influence of genetic variation on the PK of
      dexpramipexole when administered alone.
