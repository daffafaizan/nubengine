      its treatment-related life threaten toxicity limit its use for those patients.

      Tarceva monotherapy have been demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival and
      disease progression free survival when used for the treatment of patients with metastatic
      NSCLC, after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. It is well tolerated without
      the side effects usually associated with chemotherapy.

      Based on the encouraging results reported from the SLCG phase II study reported the efficacy
      of Tarceva as first line treatment for metastatic NSCLC with EGFR mutation patients would
      prolong overall survival, delay disease progression and be well tolerated, mOS reached 27
      months, ORR reached 71%. Besides, with different mechanism and more tolerable than chemo,
      Tarceva may provide an important treatment alternative for local advanced pts with EGFR
      mutation.
