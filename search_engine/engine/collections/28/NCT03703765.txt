      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed. No register of non-included
      patients will be kept.

      In included patients, in parallel to the routine ultrasound investigation for which the
      patient is referred, the evaluation of the variation of the volumes of the lower limbs with
      the volumetric 3D scanner will be performed as explained later in arm description.

      Usual ongoing treatments are obtained by history and recorded. The end of the visit is the
      end of the participation of the subjects.
