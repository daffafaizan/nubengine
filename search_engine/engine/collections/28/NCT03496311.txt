      to plasma progesterone concentrations. We hypothesize that pregnancy-related haemodilution,
      inducing a reduction in CSF Strong Ion Difference (SID), might have a role in the development
      of pregnancy-related hypocapnic alkalosis.

      Samples of CSF and arterial plasma of pregnant women with gestational age > 35 weeks
      undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective caesarean section will be analyzed for blood gases,
      pH, electrolytes, osmolality, albumin and haemoglobin concentration. In addition plasma
      copeptin levels will be analyzed. The same measurements will be performed in fertile,
      non-pregnant women undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective surgery.
