    
      Approximately 30 JIA patients who meet all eligibility criteria and who are expected to
      require daily administration of an NSAID for up to 24 weeks will be enrolled. A subset of
      approximately 6 patients will participate in a single dose PK study at Day 0 with an
      abbreviated PK profile performed at Week 4 if possible. Multiple dose PK sampling will occur
      in all enrolled patients.
