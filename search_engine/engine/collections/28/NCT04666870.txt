    
      To investigate the relationship between axis length (AL) and refractive error (RE). 894 eyes
      with low hyperopia to emmetropia (-0.50D ≤ spherical equivalent (SE) ≤ +2.00D), comprising
      1007 eyes with moderate to high myopia (-11.00D ≤ SE ≤ -4.00D) were analyzed in this study.
      Cycloplegic RE was measured with the autorefractor, AL was measured with the IOL master.
      Association between AL and refractive error were evaluated by linear regression analysis. The
      mean of AL and its correlation with SE, sex, and age were evaluated.
