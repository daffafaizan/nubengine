      determined by the result of the last one. In the case of block failure, the concentration
      will be increased by 0.025%. Conversely, block success will result in either a reduction in
      concentration by 0.025% (probability 11%) or no change in concentration (probability 89%). A
      blinded assistant will assess sensory and motor blockade in each nerve territory ( the
      median, radial, ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves) at 10-min intervals up to 30 min after
      completion of the block. Finally, MEC90 is calculated by isotonic regression.
