      To compare the following parameters between the 3 groups:

        -  plasmatic proteasome concentrations

        -  plasmatic proteasome proteolytic activity

      To explore the potential relationships between:

        -  plasmatic proteasome concentrations

        -  plasmatic proteasome proteolytic activity

        -  plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibody concentrations

        -  measures of disease severity for dermatological auto-immune diseases

      To characterize plasmatic anti-proteasome auto-antibodies in patients suffering from bullous
      pemphigoide and other dermatological auto-immune diseases (other bullous auto immune
      diseases: pemphigus, cutaneous lupus, ...).

      To characterize the expression and the activity of proteasomes in skin samples, in plasma and
      in circulating mononuclear cells in patients with bullous pemphigoide.
