      Intervention consists of a combination of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy and
      arousal-based Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy. During the latter component, the
      physiological variables of participants, such as pulse rate and EEG, will be continuously
      monitored and presented as feedback to them. Participants will have to deliver speeches to
      videotaped audiences while striving to regulate their physiological arousal.
