      as the control sample and statistical reference. During the induction phase, the patient is
      fitted with non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, three-lead ECG, pulse-oximetry and
      peripheral intravenous device. Data and vital signs are recorded and an infusion of
      crystalloid (NaCl 0.9% or Ringer's acetate) is given during the procedure until the beginning
      of the operation. Total amount of fluid is also recorded before and after the spinal
      anesthesia.

      In addition to the current clinical standard, for the second arm of the study, a
      trans-thoracic echocardiography is performed before spinal anesthesia, with the aim of
      assessing the patient's volume status; the exam is performed to assess size and collapsing of
      the Inferior Vena Cava during breathing cycle. According to different pre-established
      parameters, the patient is defined as fluid-responsive or unresponsive. If the patient is not
      responsive, investigators proceed to spinal anesthesia; otherwise they proceed to
      administration of crystalloid bolus (500 ml of NaCl 0.9% or Hartmann's solution). The patient
      may receive another bolus so as to reach a non-responsive pattern for echocardiographic
      evaluation.
