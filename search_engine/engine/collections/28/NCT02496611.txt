      and durability of cardiometabolic risk factor improvements among adolescents with severe
      obesity following a meal replacement induction period. The investigators hypothesize that
      adolescents with severe obesity receiving GLP-1RA treatment following a short-term meal
      replacement induction period will demonstrate superior maintenance of initial BMI reduction
      52 weeks following randomization compared to those assigned to placebo (primary endpoint) and
      that a higher proportion of those assigned to GLP-1RA treatment vs. placebo will maintain ≥5%
      BMI reduction from baseline to the 52-week time point (secondary endpoint). Moreover, GLP-1RA
      treatment will result in superior maintenance of initial reductions of body fat (total,
      visceral, and subcutaneous), blood pressure, triglycerides/HDL ratio, inflammation, oxidative
      stress, postprandial glucose-insulin response, insulin resistance, β cell dysfunction, and
      arterial stiffness at 52 weeks.

      Secondary Objectives Investigate the mechanisms by which GLP-1RA treatment facilitates weight
      loss maintenance and identify predictors of response to treatment. The investigators
      hypothesize that compared to placebo, GLP-1RA treatment following a period of meal
      replacement will reduce appetite (and related hormones) and gastric emptying rate, and will
      increase satiety (and related hormones) and resting energy expenditure at 26- and 52 weeks
      following randomization. Moreover, based on our preliminary work, the investigator
      hypothesize that appetite (and appetite-related hormones) following the meal replacement
      period and female gender will be associated with superior weight loss maintenance with
      GLP-1RA treatment.
