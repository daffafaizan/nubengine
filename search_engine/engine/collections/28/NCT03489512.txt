    
      A multicentre, open-label clinical trial of two groups comparing cutaneous asepsis with
      chlorhexidine gluconate at 2% + isopropyl alcohol 70% in relation to the placement of central
      venous catheters (Study group) with standard asepsis with aqueous chlorhexidine at 2% (Group
      Control). The incidence of catheter related bacteremia, the incidence of colonization of the
      skin and the incidence of colonization of the central venous catheter will be evaluated.

      The patients will assigned to the treatment group depending on where and when they are
      treated (site A or site B) and will continue the treatment until the end (continuous design):
      the patients of Site A will receive the first treatment option and those of Site B will
      receive the second treatment option during the first 6 months. After this, a rest period of 1
      month will be established, during which patients will not be recruited and any of the two
      cutaneous aseptic methods will be used indiscriminately, in the opinion of the responsible
      nursing staff. After the resting period, the treatments will be reversed during the following
      6 months.
