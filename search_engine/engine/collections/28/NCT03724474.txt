      the impact of a 3 month randomized controlled feasibility pilot intervention - the
      Bio-behavioral systems to Motivate and Reinforce Heart Health trial (Be SMART) on changes in
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep among mid-life adults between ages 50
      and 64 years.

      Aim 1 will examine the acceptability of the Be SMART system. We will conduct a 6-week proof-
      of-concept study in 10 mid-life adults to specifically examine recruitment plausibility,
      adherence and attrition rates, satisfaction, and implementation fidelity.

      Aim 2 will quantify the impact of the Be SMART intervention (n=30) on changes in MVPA and
      sleep metrics compared to a Fitbit-only condition (n=30) among mid-life adults (N=60).
      Hypothesis 2a: At 3 months, participants in the Be SMART condition will show significantly
      greater weekly minutes of MVPA compared to the Fitbit-only condition, controlling for
      baseline. Hypothesis 2b: At 3 months, participants in the Be SMART condition will be
      significantly more likely to report adequate sleep duration, shorter sleep latency, and
      earlier sleep timing, compared to the Fitbit-only condition, controlling for baseline.

      Aim 3 will explore the extent to which changes in MVPA and sleep metrics impact blood
      pressure changes among mid-life adults (N=60). Secondly, this study will quantify the extent
      to which Be SMART participants (n=30) achieve their weekly goals and if goal achievement
      impacts changes in blood pressure at 3 months. Hypothesis 3a: Changes in MVPA and sleep
      metrics will be related to changes in blood pressure. Hypothesis 3b, the degree of goal
      achievement will be related to changes in blood pressure.
