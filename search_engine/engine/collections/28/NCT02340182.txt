      nonsurvivors die in a state of immunosuppression. The gut microbiota exerts numerous
      beneficial functions in the host response against infections. Gut flora components express
      microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which
      are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by neutrophils and
      macrophages. MAMPs from the intestinal microbiota constitutively translocate to the
      circulation and prime bone marrow derived neutrophils via PRRs. Antibiotic treatment, which
      is standard of care for all patients with sepsis, depletes the gut microbiota and leads to a
      diminished release of MAMPs and other bacteria derived products. This causes diminished
      priming of systemic immunity, which may attribute to sepsis associated immunosuppression and
      an increased susceptibility to invading bacteria.

      Objective: To investigate the role of the gut microbiota in the systemic priming of immune
      effector cells

      Study design: Within-subject-controlled intervention study in human volunteers

      Study population: Twelve healthy male subjects, 18-35 years of age

      Intervention: All subjects will be treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (ciprofloxacin,
      vancomycin, metronidazole) for seven days, in order to deplete the gut microbiota. Blood and
      faeces will be sampled before, 24 hours and 6 weeks after the 7-day period of antibiotics.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Laboratory parameters for inflammatory responses, functional
      assays (ex vivo stimulation assay) and gut microbiota composition.
