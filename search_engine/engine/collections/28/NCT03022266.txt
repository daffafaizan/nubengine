      are taken. Elements of medication adherence include: 1) the proportion of prescribed drug
      taken or %PDT (primary outcome); 2) the proportion of days with the correct number of doses
      taken; 3) the proportion of doses taken on time, in relation to a prescription-defined time
      interval between successive doses; 4) the distribution of inter-dose intervals; 5) the number
      of drug holidays; and 6) the longest interval between two doses [Vrijens et al. British
      journal of clinical pharmacology. 2012;73(5):691-705]. Medication adherence will be assessed
      in all participants using EM technology manufactured by CleverCapsÂ®. Electronic Monitoring
      (EM) is more sensitive, reliable and valid than other measurement techniques such as pill
      counts, self-reports, or clinical judgment [Vrijens et al. Expert review of clinical
      pharmacology. 2014;7(5):633-644]. In this study the investigators will monitor a single drug,
      aspirin, in MI patients prescribed aspirin on hospital discharge.

      In addition to measurement of medication adherence using an EM device, the investigators will
      measure adherence using the Wellth cell phone app in the intervention arm. Participants in
      the intervention arm will also be asked to track their medication-taking habits by uploading
      photos of their medications at the appropriate dosage times using the Wellth app.

      Readmissions will be measured using the EMR and by interview to capture events outside the
      Penn system. Events will be classified according to timing (e.g. 30-day readmission) and
      cause (e.g. cardiac, all-cause). This study is not designed to detect a statistically
      significant difference in readmissions.
