      continuous or repeated observations of health outcomes) exploratory study (biomarkers,
      clinical and physiological parameters for participants with asthma and COPD are observed for
      the first time). This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will include healthy
      participants and participants with mild, moderate, and severe asthma. Part 2 will include
      healthy nonsmokers, healthy asymptomatic smokers, and participants with moderate and or
      severe COPD. Study participants will undergo medical tests that will include pulmonary
      function testing, assessment of airway reactivity, bronchoscopy procedure, blood samples for
      routine laboratory tests, biomarkers and DNA evaluation (for some study participants),
      induced sputum collection, and exhaled nitric oxide collection. Safety evaluations will
      includes assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram,
      vital signs, and physical examinations.
