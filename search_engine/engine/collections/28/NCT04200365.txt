      cell transplantation outcome, with cGVHD being associated with decreased quality of life.
      Suppression of the immune system with corticosteroids forms the basis of first-line therapy
      for management of GVHD, but sustained responses are usually seen in less than 50 percent of
      patients and there is no standard second- or third-line treatment for steroid refractory
      cGVHD. Identification of novel therapeutic targets are needed to improve outcomes.
      Therapeutic potential has been shown by a JAK inhibitor in the treatment of steroid
      refractory GVHD. Itacitinib is a novel, selective inhibitor of the JAK family of protein
      tyrosine kinases and will be studied here in patients with steroid refractory cGVHD.
