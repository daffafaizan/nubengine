      healthy volunteer, and the role of progesterone in renal adaptation to potassium depletion.
      Practically, healthy volunteers will be submitted twice to two periods of normal Na+/ high K+
      diet (control period) followed by a normal Na+/ low K+ diet sustained by a pharmacological
      treatment with Kayexalate (K+-depleted condition). The subjects will be treated with either
      RU486 or a placebo, according to a randomization. The adrenal response will be evaluated
      after stimulation by Synacthen at baseline and at the end of each experimental period. A
      Synacthen test will be also done in 10 patients suffering of chronic hypokalemia linked to a
      hereditary tubulopathy inducing renal K+ leak called Gitelman syndrome and their plasma
      steroid profile will be established.
