      frontline treatment has improved considerably over the last decade, first by the advent of
      fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC), and more recently by the addition of the anti-CD20
      antibody, rituximab, to FC. Although FC-based regimens are considerably more effective than
      Chl, they are also associated with greater toxicity which makes them inappropriate for less
      fit patients. This is an important consideration, given that CLL predominantly affects older
      people who tend to have more co-morbidity. Although a single-arm phase II study (Roche
      MO20927; NCRI CLL208) has shown that R-Chl is safe and effective, there are no phase III data
      proving the benefit of adding an anti-CD20 antibody to Chl. This question is currently being
      addressed by a phase III RCT of Chl with or without ofatumumab (GSK OMB110911 / COMPLEMENT-1
      / NCRI CLL7). Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD20 antibody that binds to an epitope
      distinct from that of rituximab and produces more complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The
      RIAltO trial is a direct follow-on to the NCRI CLL7 phase III RCT trial in less fit patients
      and therefore the Ofatumumab dose has been selected to mirror the regimen used in that trial.
