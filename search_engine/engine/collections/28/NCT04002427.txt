    
      This is a single centre, open-label, single period study in 6 healthy male and non-pregnant,
      non-lactating female subjects to determine the mass balance recovery after a single
      intravenous (IV) dose of [14C]AZD7594 and to generate samples to enable metabolite profiling
      and structural identification of AZD7594 in plasma, urine and faeces. It is planned to enrol
      6 subjects to ensure data in at least 4 evaluable subjects. A subject will be considered
      evaluable if they have provided mass balance and PK samples for up to 48 h after drug
      administration.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 28 days before
      dosing. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit in the afternoon on the day
      before dosing (Day 1). Subjects will be dosed on the morning of Day 1 in the fasted state (8
      h overnight fast). Before oral inhalation of AZD7594 using the Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI), all
      subjects must demonstrate their ability to use the DPI as intended. Subjects will receive
      training with an empty DPI at screening, Day -1 and pre-dose (optional) in accordance with
      study specific instructions. Each subject will receive a single inhaled 792 µg nominal dose
      (720 µg delivered dose) of AZD7594 followed by an IV dose of 30 µg [14C]AZD7594 containing
      6.7 kBq (180 nCi) carbon-14 (14C) as a 1 h infusion. The infusion of the IV dose will be
      started approximately 15 min after the inhaled dose. Subjects will remain resident in the
      clinical unit up to 168 h post dose (up to Day 8).

      Whole blood, plasma, urine and faeces will be collected from pre-dose until discharge (168 h
      post-dose; Day 8). Any accidental sources of elimination (eg emesis) will be collected and
      sent to the mass balance laboratory for total radioactivity analysis.
