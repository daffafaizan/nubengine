      correlated with the percentage of wrong answers in a Tone-Matching Task test. The main
      objective is to assess this correlation. Our other objectives are to assess correlation
      between AHRS as well as other symptoms scales and psychoacoustic tests assessing intensity,
      length discrimination of non-verbal tones and self-monitoring abilities. Impact of
      therapeutic procedures (neuromodulation, psychotherapy) conducted independently of our study
      on these psychoacoustic tests will also be assessed.

      Methods: 30 subjects with schizophrenia will be included. Clinical and psychoacoustic
      measures will be carried out at J-0. In the case of patients receiving therapeutic procedures
      independently of our study, new clinical and psychoacoustic measures will be carried out at
      J+7 and J+30.
