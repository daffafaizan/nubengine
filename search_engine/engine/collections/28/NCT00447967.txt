      rates of 5-FU-based combination chemotherapy are higher than single agents (10-50%) but more
      toxic. The combination of 5-FU/LV and LOHP has demonstrated an ORR of 43%, median TTP of
      approximately 6,5 months and OS of 8,6 months in phase II trials, with an acceptable
      toxicity.

      Irinotecan (CPT-11) is effective as salvage treatment in metastatic gastric cancer and has a
      synergistic activity with LOHP in preclinical trials
