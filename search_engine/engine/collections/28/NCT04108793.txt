      morbidity, mortality, and substantial economic costs. Successful operative treatment of hip
      fracture patients is necessary for the optimization of post-op mobility and functional
      recovery of the patient. Rehabilitation after surgical stabilization of a hip fracture is
      crucial in order to restore pre-fracture function and to avoid long-term
      institutionalization. The probability of long-term confinement can be as high as 25% if the
      fracture is not fixed.

      The combination of high incidence of fall and a high susceptibility to injury is a major
      public health concern among elderly population. This propensity for fall-related injury in
      elderly persons stems from a high prevalence of co morbid diseases such as osteoporosis and
      age-related physiological decline (e.g. slower reflexes) that make even a relatively mild
      fall, potentially dangerous The development and implementation of effective strategies to
      minimize disability and falls among older people is an urgent public health challenge due to
      the increasing proportion of older people in the global population. Besides, for many
      individuals, the risk of falls and disability after hospital discharge decreases with time.
      However, for a significant proportion, this is not the case. Many patients after discharge
      are readmitted with second fracture to the hospitals due to lack of acute rehabilitation
      programs. Therefore, we have designed a post-discharge home-based physical rehabilitation
      intervention program to minimize disability and falls in this high-risk elderly population.
