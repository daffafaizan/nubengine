      Escalation to the next cohort will occur when three patients have received at least one
      infusion at the highest scheduled dose level, and at least one patient has completed the
      entire five week dosing schedule. Cohorts will be enrolled at a maximal dose level of 3, 4,
      6, or 8 mg/kg/week. Initial therapy will last for 5 weeks. Responding patients will receive
      additional infusions every two weeks x 4 at the maximal dose for each specific cohort.
