      especially in patients who have undergone surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect
      which is the most common congenital heart disease. How this bundle branch block effects the
      right ventricle of the heart on a long-term basis for this group of patients, is still
      unknown.

      As a part of a PhD-study we therefore will try to illustrate this by echocardiography, MRI,
      exercise testing and other investigations 15 to 20 years after the surgical procedure. The
      study population thus consists of three different groups: 1. Patients whom undergone surgical
      closure of ventricular septal defect without postoperative right bundle branch block, 2.
      VSD-operated patients with right bundle branch block and 3. Healthy controls with no
      significant medical issues matched on age and sex. By carrying out the tests mentioned the
      right ventricles systolic function, diastolic function, the patients maximal exercise
      capacity and a lot of other parameters will be evaluated in the three groups of patients and
      compared amongst each other. The perspective therefore is the ability to point out a specific
      group of patients with an inferior outcome and with a possible need for further intervention.
      An additional perspective is to increase the awareness of protecting the bundle branch during
      the operation.
