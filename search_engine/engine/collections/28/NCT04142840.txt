      agitations are investigated mainly in children.For adults,previous studies were almost about
      the efficacy of premedication on preventing emergence agitation. Once emergence agitation
      happens, there is still no guidelines established to recommend the medication usage in the
      post-anaesthesia care unit.So high-quality prospective clinical studies are required to
      provide evidence for emergence agitation treatment.

      Dexmedetomidine and propofol are both widely used in general anesthesia and can be acquired
      easily.When emergence agitation occurs,both injections are common choices in daily clinical
      administration on emergence agitation.To the investigator's knowledge ,propofol with a very
      quick onset is superior for anesthesia goals, but is without analgesia effects.While
      dexmedetomidine can produce sedation,analgesia,anxiolysis.So the investigators propose the
      hypothesis here that dexmedetomidine is prior to propofol on the treatment of emergence
      agitation in adults patients after general anesthesia.Therefore this research is undertaken
      to verify the hypothesis.
