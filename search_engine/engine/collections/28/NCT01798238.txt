           50% of treated Type 2 diabetic subjects do not reach currently accepted goals for
           HbA1c(Oral communication, American Diabetic Association, 2008)Subjects are frequently
           prescribed agents which can cause hypoglycemia, and/or weight gain.

        -  In many countries, the most commonly prescribed primary oral diabetes drug that does not
           cause hypoglycemia or weight gain, is metformin, but metformin can cause
           gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and
           loss of appetite and other symptoms, and rare but life-threatening lactic acidosis.

        -  This decrease in the Power of Hydrogen Ions of the blood (<7.25) and the increase in
           blood lactate (> 5 mmol / L) is associated with a reduced kidney failure and if there is
           kidney impairment, decreased metformin clearance and thus accumulated metformin may
           occur lactic acidosis more frequently. Also there is inconvenience, such as adjusting
           metformin dose depending on patient's condition.

        -  MP-513 is expected to be safely used as a treatment for type 2 diabetes because it has
           no risk of hypoglycemia and/or weight gain which are reported in pre-existing diabetes
           therapies and no inconvenience related to dose adjustment depending on patient's
           condition, and no cases of fatal side effects.

        -  Furthermore the inhibitory effect on Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV was stronger and half-life
           was longer compared with other dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors in non-clinical trial,
           and blood glucose moderating effects are proven to be clinically significant in clinical
           trials conducted in Europe and Japan in that its development as a therapeutic agent for
           patients with type 2 diabetes is considered to be promising.

        -  Based on these previous studies, the objective of this study is to investigate the
           efficacy and safety in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus that is not adequately
           controlled with exercise and diet.
