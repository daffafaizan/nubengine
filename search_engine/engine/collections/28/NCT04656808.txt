           team will provide contact data of potential participants. In addition, information of
           the project will be made available through posters, news, and internet (e.g., social
           networks).

        2. Previous to the assessment each participant will be randomly allocated to the
           intervention conditions (guilt focused intervention (GFI) and cognitive behavioral
           therapy (CBT)) following the CONSORT recommendations. Randomization will be made through
           random numbers using computerized procedures.

        3. Once contacted, caregivers will be requested to sign an informed consent and, if the
           inclusion criteria are met, the interview will take place. Interviews will be conducted
           by trained psychologists blinded to the project aims and hypothesis.

        4. The interviews will consist in questions and questionnaires specifically selected for
           the project.

        5. The intervention conditions have been developed following previous studies by the team
           or recognized researchers, or following previous research studies in the topic of
           caregiving stress or related topics (e.g. psychotherapeutic strategies for reducing
           distress).

        6. The interventions will take place in group format (maximum 8 participants per group).
           Each intervention will consist in 8 weekly sessions plus 3 booster sessions in a 5 month
           period.

        7. Participants will be assessed again after the intervention (2 months) and at the
           follow-up (6 months).
