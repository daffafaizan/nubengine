      indicators; ii) compare the chronic effects of each exercise type on selected cardiovascular
      indicators; iii) provide information on the association between acute and chronic effects of
      each exercise type; iv) provide insight into possible mechanisms of effectiveness of each
      exercise type; v) identify the most safe and effective exercise type for patients with
      coronary artery disease.
