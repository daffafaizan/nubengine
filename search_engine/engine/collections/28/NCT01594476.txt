      at 3 weeks postpartum, compared to the usual 6 weeks postpartum, is associated with greater
      uptake of the IUD by 3 months after delivery. Many women do not return for a follow up visit.
      We will investigate whether they are more likely to return and to receive an IUD if the
      follow up visit is earlier. Measures of 6 month IUD continuation, subject acceptability,
      safety and efficacy will also be examined. This prospective, randomized, controlled trial
      will enroll approximately 240 women at our academic tertiary care hospital in the United
      States. Participants will be recruited from women who deliver a live-born singleton infant at
      greater than 32 weeks gestation and who have indicated interest in obtaining intrauterine
      contraception. Subjects will choose to receive either a levonorgestrel-containing IUS
      (Mirena) or copper T380A IUD (ParaGard). Enrolled subjects will be randomized to IUD
      placement at either 3 weeks (+/- 3 days) or 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) after their delivery date.
      Women will be followed by phone contacts at 3 months and 4 months and will have a clinic
      visit with an ultrasound at 6 months after delivery. The IUD position in the uterus and the
      uterine size will be assessed at 6 months.
