    
      This is a multicentre, Phase III trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a 2 week
      drug-free run-in period, followed by a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment
      period.

      During the run-in period, the subject's bowel habit will be documented and the existence of
      constipation confirmed. At the start of this period, all existing laxative medication will be
      withdrawn and subjects will be instructed not to change their diet or lifestyle during the
      trial. Subjects will be allowed to take a laxative (Dulcolax) as a rescue medication
      throughout the trial, but only if they have not had a bowel movement for three or more
      consecutive days. No Dulcolax or enemas should be taken within 48 hours prior to the start of
      double-blind treatment and 48 hours following the start of double-blind treatment. Subjects
      will enter the double-blind period if constipation is shown to be present during the run-in
      period.

      If the definition of constipation is not met during the 2-week run-in, the subject will be
      considered ineligible for the double-blind period and will be discontinued from the study.

      During the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled period, subjects will be treated for
      12 weeks with either 2 mg or 4 mg R108512 or placebo, given once daily before breakfast.
