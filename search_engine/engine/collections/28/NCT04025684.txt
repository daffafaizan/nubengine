      arm, parallel design, clinical methodology development study to investigate the plaque
      removal efficacy of marketed manual toothbrushes in healthy, dentate participants. Changes in
      plaque level will be evaluated after first brushing, after two further single brushing events
      (Days 7 and 28) and following 7 and 28 days usage (twice daily brushing with assigned
      toothbrush treatment).

      Supra-gingival plaque levels will be assessed using two established clinical measures: the
      Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index (RPI) and the 6-site Turesky Modified Quigley and Hein
      Plaque Index (TPI). Participants will abstain from oral hygiene for a period of 12-18 hours
      prior to each assessment visit. Participants with Day 0 pre-brushing mean RPI overall ≥ 0.6
      will be stratified by their Day 0 pre-brushing RPI score (lower: mean RPI overall ≥ 0.6 to ≤
      0.8; higher: mean RPI overall; 0.8 to 1.0) and randomized to study treatment (Visit 2).

      To standardize oral hygiene practice, eligible participants will complete a lead-in period
      (minimum 5 days) prior to Visit 2 during which they will brush with the toothbrush and
      regular fluoride toothpaste provided.

      The safety and oral tolerability of each study toothbrush will be monitored after first use
      and over the 28-day usage period by review of reported treatment emergent adverse events
      (TEAEs).
