      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Capmatinib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are using the study drug called Capmatinib.
      Capmatinib is a specific blocker of the cMET protein. This protein acts as a trigger to start
      a series of events in your cells in what is known as the C-Met pathway. Patients with MET
      exon 14 skipping have activation of the MET pathway. By blocking MET, Capmatinib may slow or
      stop the growth and/or survival of cancer cells. Capmatinib is not yet FDA approved for the
      treatment of people with this type of cancer. It is not known if capmatinib will be effective
      in people who have previously had other drugs that block the cMET pathway. This study will
      help us understand how capmatinib works in the body and what capmatinib does to cancer. Any
      potential harmful effects of capmatinib will also be studied.
