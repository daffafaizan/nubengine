    
      This is an observational study. Data collected will include records of continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) based glucose, insulin delivery, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG),
      and maternal and fetal outcomes from pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. These data will be
      used to: (1) develop and refine algorithms for an AP system tailored to the needs of pregnant
      women with type 1 diabetes, (2) to serve as a comparator group for concurrent AP protocols,
      (3) describe Dexcom G6 CGM data throughout the pregnancy, and (4) describe insulin changes
      which occur in pregnancy.
