      associated with significant comorbidities, affecting cardiovascular health, cognitive
      development and quality of life. Its main cause is adenotonsillar hypertrophy, but some
      co-factors such as obesity, orofacial dysfunctions and craniofacial abnormalities contribute
      to the severity of symptoms or their persistance after adeno-tonsillectomy.

      Aim : Myofunctional therapy has been shown to reduce Apnea-Hyponea indexes (AHI) of children,
      and can serve as an adjunct to other therapies, but the level of compliance is a limiting
      factor. The investigator's aim is to evaluate two methods of oral reeducation in a group a
      children scheduled for adeno-tonsillectomy (in association with nasal hygiene) and to compare
      them with nasal hygiene alone (control group).

      Methods : The design of the study is a randomized Controlled Trial, enrolling 60 children
      with significant obstructive sleep apnea and divided into 3 groups : Group 1 following daily
      oral exercises (+nasal hygiene), Group 2 using of a flexible oral appliance during quiet
      activities and sleep (+nasal hygiene), and Group 3 using nasal hygiene alone (control group).
      The objective assessment of sleep parameters is performed at home using an ambulatory device
      (AHI, desaturation index, minimal oxygen saturation, flow limitation, snoring), before and
      after therapy, in a 3 months interval. An orthodontic and craniofacial assessment, the
      examination of orofacial functions and tongue/lip strength measurements (IOPI system), as
      well as quality of life questionnaires (OSA-18) are also performed on participants, before
      and after therapy.
