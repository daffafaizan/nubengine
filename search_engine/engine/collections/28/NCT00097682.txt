    
      This study seeks to inform deliberation of ethical issues related to financial conflicts of
      interest in clinical research through empirical data obtained from patients participating in
      cancer studies. In particular, this study endeavors to describe and summarize the views of
      patients about both individual and institutional financial conflicts of interest pertaining
      to clinical research. This study will assess awareness of financial conflicts of interest and
      the current safeguards in place to manage financial ties; assess the impact of hypothetical
      financial conflicts of interest on a research subject's decision to participate in a clinical
      study; identify the reasons that financial conflicts of interest either do or do not
      influence patients' research participation; summarize views regarding the presence of
      financial conflicts of interest and what limits should be in place to manage them; identify
      interests about disclosure of these financial conflicts of interest; describe demographic
      characteristics of subjects enrolled in the survey and evaluate the impact of demographic
      information on subjects' views regarding financial conflicts of interest. Participants will
      be recruited from all phases of oncology studies being conducted at 5 sites, the National
      Cancer Institute in Bethesda, MD; the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA; the Fred
      Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA; the University of Colorado Cancer Center in
      Denver, CO, and the Columbia University Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center in New
      York, NY. The primary methodology for the study is an in-person administration of a
      questionnaire.
