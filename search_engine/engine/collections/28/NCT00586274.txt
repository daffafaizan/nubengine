      "CD45 (YTH-24 and YTH-54) and CD52 (Campath 1H) Monoclonal Antibody Conditioning Regimen for
      Allogeneic Donor Stem Cell Transplantation of Patients with Fanconi Anemia" (H-9938 IND#
      7233) and will become eligible to receive allodepleted T Cells following engraftment. What
      follows is a summary of the treatment plan including initial transplant phase as well as
      generation and infusion of allodepleted T cells.

      Preparative Regimen for Patients with Fanconi Anemia:

      The study will be open to patients who received a haploidentical PBSCT on the MAFIA protocol
      and for patients who failed to engraft and receive a second haploidentical transplants with
      alternate conditioning consisting of ATG, Fludarabine, TBI (450cGY single dose) and Cytoxan.

        -  3 YTH 24/54 400ug/kg over 6 hr

        -  2 YTH 24/54 400ug/kg over 6 hr

        -  1 Rest

        -  0 CD34-selected PBSC infusion

      Stem Cell Infusion: One day after the completion of pretransplant conditioning therapy (day
      0), CD34+ cells will be infused through a central venous catheter as outlined in CAGT SOPs.

      This study will begin with a dose of T cells known not to cause GvHD even in haploidentical
      recipients, even when the T cells administered have not first been allodepleted. Dose
      escalation will follow a traditional up and down method, but as results become available they
      will be used to determine subsequent dose levels by the continual reassessment method.
      Initially, 2 patients will be entered beginning at dose level 1. Each and every patient will
      receive up to three additional injections of T cells at the same dose, at monthly intervals,
      provided there is no evidence of grade 2 or higher GVHD, until total T cell numbers are >
      1000/ul.

      Dose level -1 (1 x 10^3 T cells/Kg); Dose level 1 (1 x 10^4 T cells/Kg); Dose level 2 (1 x
      10^5 T cells/Kg); Dose level 3 (1 x 10^6 T cells/Kg); Dose level 4 (5 x 10^6 T cells/Kg)
