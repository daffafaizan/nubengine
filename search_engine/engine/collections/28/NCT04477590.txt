    
      Objective: The purpose is to study in a group of adults with metabolic syndrome and obesity,
      the effects of altering timing between exercise training, meals and their habitual medication
      on the improvement in the factors that compose the metabolic syndrome (i.e., hypertension,
      insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia). The main objective is to find the
      most efficacious combination between exercise training and the timing of their habitual
      pharmacological treatment, and meal ingestion for lowering those factors.

      Methods and design: Cross-over randomized double-blinded, pretest-posttest control group
      experimental design. The project will be developed in a single center with the collaboration
      of the regional public health system (SECAM).

      Subjects: Will be referred by their primary care physicians to our study unit or will be
      recruited by advertisements in local media.

      Up to 180 subjects, all of them with metabolic syndrome will be recruited (>25% women).

      Measurements:

      Specifically, we will study if the cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations to aerobic
      training that result in amelioration of metabolic syndrome factors are potentiated by correct
      timming of meal and medicine around exercise training time.
