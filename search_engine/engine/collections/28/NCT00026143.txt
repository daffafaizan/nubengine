      I. To estimate the clinical response rates in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma
      treated with rhIL-12 and interferon alfa-2b.

      II. To estimate the progression-free survival in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma
      treated with rhIL-12 and interferon alfa-2b.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure serum levels of interferon-gamma. II. To measure levels of JAK-STAT signaling
      intermediates in patient PBMCs and tumor samples.

      III. To analyze interferon-alpha-induced STAT signaling in patient PBMCs. IV. To determine
      the expression of IFN-regulated genes in patient PBMCs and tumor tissues.

      V. To determine the pattern of gene expression induced by treatment with IL-12 and
      interferon-alpha using DNA microarray techniques in patient PBMCs.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive interleukin-12 IV over 5-15 seconds on day 1 and interferon alfa
      subcutaneously on days 2-6. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are reassessed after 6 courses. Patients with a complete response receive
      2 additional courses. Patients with a partial response or stable disease continue treatment
      in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.
