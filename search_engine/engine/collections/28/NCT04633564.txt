      biosimilar to European Union and US licensed Avastin (hereafter referred to as Avastin),
      which is approved as first line treatment in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP)
      for patients with Stage IV unresectable, recurrent or metastatic nsNSCLC. This randomized
      equivalence study is designed to meet the global regulatory requirement for approval of a
      biosimilar product. For this study, both MYL-1402O and Avastin are considered investigational
      medicinal products (IMP).
