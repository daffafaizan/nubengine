        1. IM-SCORE - a score quantifying the extent of intestinal metaplasia at GOJ, which uses a
           4-tier system based on the number of glands and the number of biopsies with features of
           IM. The score has been developed in a pilot study (manuscript under submission) and will
           be validated in this study

        2. Methylation markers- assessed by a PCR-based method (Methylight) on Cytosponge samples.

        3. P53 status.

        4. TFF3 protein expression.
