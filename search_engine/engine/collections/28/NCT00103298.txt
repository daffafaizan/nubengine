      Primary

        -  Determine the response and duration of response in patients with previously untreated
           unresectable liver metastases secondary to colorectal cancer treated with isolated
           hepatic perfusion with melphalan followed by leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and
           fluorouracil.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the patterns of recurrence (liver vs systemic) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate health-related quality of life with length of survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo exploratory laparotomy. Patients with evidence of carcinomatosis
      not previously visualized on scans but found on surgical exploration are removed from the
      study. All other patients then undergo isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP). Once IHP is
      established, melphalan is administered intra-arterially over 3-5 minutes and then circulated
      throughout the liver for 1 hour. Approximately 6-12 weeks later, patients receive systemic
      chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours and fluorouracil IV continuously over 22 hours on days 1-2. Courses with systemic
      chemotherapy repeat every 14 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after laparotomy, after completion of systemic
      chemotherapy, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every
      3-4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
