      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Clopidogrel is the most popular
      thienopyridine. Following the 300mg clopidogrel loading dose (LD) at first day, patients take
      75mg maintenance dose (MD) to inhibit platelet aggregation after coronary stent implantation.
      600mg high LD inhibit platelet aggregation more rapidly and strongly than standard LD and
      prevent thrombotic event around the PCI. Similarly high MD inhibit platelet aggregation more
      strongly. Interindividual variability of clopidogrel anti-platelet effect has been reported.
      In Japanese, there are many non or hyporesponders to clopidogrel compared to the Western
      population. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of high dose clopidogrel as
      the antiplatelet therapy on inhibition of platelet aggregation in Japanese patients scheduled
      for PCI due to ischemic heart disease.
