    
      This is a phase 3, open labeled, prospective cohort study to evaluate the molecular testing
      of pyrazinamide susceptibility in optimizing the MDR-TB treatment regimen. Approximately 100
      participants will be given the molecular detection of pncA and rpsA mutations and divide into
      to the pyrazinamide sensitive comparator group and the pyrazinamide resistant group based on
      the susceptibility results. For the pyrazinamide sensitive group, the regimen contains six
      months of chemotherapy with pyrazinamide, amikacin, levofloxacin, plus prothionamide,
      followed by six months of pyrazinamide, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, plus prothionamide. For
      the pyrazinamide resistant group, the regimen contains six months of chemotherapy with
      isoniazid, amikacin, levofloxacin, plus prothionamide, followed by eighteen months of
      isoniazid, levofloxacin, clarithromycin, plus prothionamide.

      The participants will be followed up to 24 months after the start of the treatment. The
      primary outcome is the sputum culture conversion and the adverse events. Safety evaluations
      that will be performed are the routine lab tests, blood glucose, hearing , vital signs, ECG,
      reporting of adverse events, physical examinations and X-rays.
