      PICU. These agents can provide calmness, hypnotic effect, pain alleviation, cooperation,
      immobilization and synchronizing ventilatory support.

      Prolonged use of the agents can lead to withdrawal symptoms when the drugs are weaned.

      Incidence of withdrawal syndrome is about 50%. Withdrawal syndrome can lead to unnecessary
      and costly diagnostic tests, prolongation of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, and
      increasing of suffering. Prior study showed the longer duration of sedative drugs, cumulative
      dose of medications and younger age were the risk factors of withdrawal syndrome. Additional,
      some study showed the sedation protocol can reduce the incidence of withdrawal syndrome.
      However, no worldwide standardized sedative weaning protocol including our hospital.
