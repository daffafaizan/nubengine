      esophageal squamous carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma.
      Prognosis of esophageal squamous carcinoma is usually poor and surgery is the only radical
      treatment. However, the optimal therapy pattern for local advanced esophageal carcinoma is
      still unclear. Part of the patients that clinical staging as T4 and presents multiple lymph
      node metastasis and esophageal carcinoma with large diameters are initially diagnosed as
      boundary resectable, which means patients may be able to undergo R0 resection. However, for
      patients who are diagnosed as boundary resectable esophageal carcinoma, there are still no
      sufficient studies implicate that how to improve R0 resection rate by neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. DDP in combination with 5-FU and docetaxel regimen(DCF) was reported as
      effective neoadjuvant chemotherapy in treating esophageal squamous carcinoma. However,
      studies also showed that the DCF regimen caused severe adverse reaction. The mechanism of
      paclitaxel is similar to docetaxel while with less adverse events than docetaxel. Based on
      the research situation mentioned above, the investigators decided to conduct a phase II
      clinical trial to further explore the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel in combination with
      DDP and 5-FU (TPF) regimen in treating locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
