      provided to Yale University dining hall employees on smoking quit rates and quit attempts at
      the end of six weeks of treatment. It is hypothesized that participants from the test site
      will have higher rates of smoking cessation and quit attempts compared to participants from
      the control site. In addition, this study will examine the number of participants who enroll
      in the smoking cessation program who successfully quit smoking at 6 months.

      There will be 3 test sites and 3 control sites in this study (broken down into 3 pairs of
      test/control). Each test site will be matched to on a control site. Self-reported smoking
      status will be obtained for all participants in the test and control sites at 3 time points
      (baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months). The study start time for each pair will be delayed by 4-8
      weeks for feasibility issues.
