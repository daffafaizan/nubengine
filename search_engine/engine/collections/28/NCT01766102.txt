      patients are eligible to participate. This includes a medical history and an assessment of
      the patient's breast abnormality by mammogram and/or ultrasound and/or breast MRI. Patients
      will not need to undergo any extra procedures apart from those needed by the patient's
      surgeon to plan the patient's breast surgery. If the screening process shows that a patient
      is eligible to participate in this research study, the patient will be enrolled and the study
      will proceed on the day of surgery. If a patient does not meet the eligibility criteria the
      patient will not be able to participate in this research study.

      Patients will be assigned to one of two arms of this study on the day of your surgery.
      Because no one knows which of the breast specimen imaging options is best, patients will be
      "randomized" into one of the study groups: the Standard Specimen Mammography arm or, the
      Intra-operative Specimen Mammography arm. Randomization means that the patient is put into a
      group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither the patient nor the surgeon will choose
      what group the patient will be in.

      If the patient is in the Standard Specimen Mammography arm, the patient's breast specimen
      (biopsy or lumpectomy) will be taken to the Breast Imaging department for a mammogram, which
      is the way breast specimens are typically imaged. If the patient is in the Intra-Operative
      Specimen Mammography arm, the patient's breast specimen will be imaged right in the operating
      room at the time of the surgery. The patient's images will also be linked to the Breast
      Imaging department, so the radiologist can confirm the surgeon's findings.
