    
      This study is a prospective, single-arm phase II clinical study to evaluate the effectiveness
      of IBI318 combined with lenvatinib in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell
      lung cancer who failed first-line PD-1/PD-L1 And safety research. After screening and meeting
      the inclusion criteria, they will receive IBI318 combined with lenvatinib until the disease
      progresses, death, toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, new anti-tumor
      therapy is started, or the treatment is terminated for other reasons specified in the plan.
      During the treatment, RECIST v1.1 was used for clinical tumor imaging evaluation, once every
      6 weeks; after 24 weeks of medication, evaluation can be done every 8 weeks.

      Subjects receiving IBI318 combined with lenvatinib have the first evidence of imaging PD
      according to RECIST v1.1. If the subject is clinically stable, there is no evidence of rapid
      imaging progress, and the investigator assesses that it can continue from the study If the
      patient is benefited from the drug, the subject can continue the current study treatment, and
      the imaging evaluation must be repeated at least 8 weeks (Â± 7 days) later for confirmation.
      If PD is confirmed by re-assessment, the subject should stop the study treatment; if PD is
      not confirmed, the study treatment will continue, and the assessment will be carried out at
      the time point of the imaging examination plan specified in the plan until the PD is
      confirmed by imaging.
