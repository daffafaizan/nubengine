      functioning intervention, entitled Unstuck and On Target (UOT), adapted for use in community
      mental health clinics. Minimizing the impact of executive functioning deficits in youth has
      broad public health implications, including improving the effectiveness of mental health
      services for youth such as those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Improved executive functioning also has the
      potential for improvement in real-world functioning, including daily living skills, mental
      health, and educational outcomes. Although UOT is an established evidence-based intervention,
      the effectiveness of this intervention in mental health settings has not been established.
      Therefore, the primary aim is to collect data on implementation outcomes of the adapted
      intervention, including feasibility, utility, and therapist fidelity, in mental health
      settings. The secondary aim is to collect data on the preliminary effectiveness of UOT
      adapted for mental health settings. This study has the potential to make a significant impact
      by building local capacity to serve school-age children with executive functioning deficits
      in routine service settings, and advancing the science on the effectiveness of an established
      evidence-based practice (UOT) for specific services settings. It will also produce
      generalizable knowledge about implementation that can be applied for this population/setting.
