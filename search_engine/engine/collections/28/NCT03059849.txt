      remission will be followed with fecal calprotectin monitoring every 3 months. Patients with a
      sustained rise in calprotectin who maintain clinical remission will be offered an opportunity
      to have an increase in adalimumab for three months. Patients who use the three months of
      increased adalimumab dosing will be compared to patients who do not use increased dosing to
      determine if relapse rates differ between these two groups.
