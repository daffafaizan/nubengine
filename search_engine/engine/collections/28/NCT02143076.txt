    
      This research study will evaluate HU adherence using an electronic storage device (Wise
      device) compared to caregiver report, youth report, lab values, and pill-count adherence
      measures. The investigators will ask participants to store their medication in the Wise
      device and answer questions about their use of the device during normal clinical care visits.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

        -  To examine feasibility of the WISE device by estimating a) rate of consent to the study,
           b) rate of WISE device use, c) rate of WISE device failure, and d) the perceived
           acceptability of using the WISE device, as reported by caregivers and youth.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

        -  To estimate the association between HU adherence as measured by the Wise device, to a)
           caregiver-report, b) youth-report, c) lab values, d) pill-count, and e) Medication
           Possession Ratio (MPR) adherence measures.

      Evaluation of study outcomes will be stratified by age group: (1) infants/toddlers, ages 0-7
      years; (2) school age, ages 8-12 years; and (3) teen, ages 13-17 years.

      At study enrollment, participants will be asked to complete one questionnaire and will
      receive instructions on how to use the Wise device. They will be asked to use the Wise device
      over the following two months. A study team member will contact each participant by phone
      within seven days of study enrollment to monitor participant use of the Wise device and to
      answer any questions. Participants will be asked to return the Wise device in two months at
      their normal clinic care visit. At this visit, participants will be asked to complete two
      more questionnaires and, as part of standard clinical care, a pill count/bottle weight will
      be completed by the pharmacy.
