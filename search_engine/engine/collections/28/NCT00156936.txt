    
      From the date of successful completion of Study ALK21-006 (base study [NCT01218997])), all
      subjects, including those who received oral naltrexone during the base study, were given the
      option to enroll in this extension study.

      Study investigators ensured that subjects were opioid-free and did not demonstrate evidence
      of withdrawal prior to administration of VIVITROL therapy. If the investigator suspected
      recent clinically significant opioid use, a naloxone challenge test was performed. The
      naloxone challenge was not performed in a subject presenting clinical signs or symptoms of
      opioid withdrawal or in a subject whose urine contained opioids.
