      the prognosis for Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).Intraoperative bleeding remains a major
      concern during liver resection. The most often used hepatic vascular control methods at
      present are hepatic pedicle occlusion(Pringle maneuver), hemihepatic vascular
      clamping,segmental vascular clamping and total hepatic vascular exclusion (THVE).However,all
      these methods have shortcomings. Pringle maneuver cannot prevent bleeding from hepatic veins
      and leads to ischemia-reperfusion injury of the liver; Hemihepatic vascular clamping cannot
      prevent bleeding from hepatic veins as well, and from the remnant (nonoccluded) liver. THVE
      is a technically demanding technique that requires surgical and anesthetic expertise and may
      lead to hemodynamic intolerance as well as increased morbidity and hospital stay. Total
      hemihepatic vascular exclusion(THHVE),completely isolates the right or left hemiliver
      ipsilateral to the lesion that requires resection from the systemic circulation,has the
      advantage of preventing backflow hemorrhage or air embolism without having to resort to caval
      blood flow interruption of THVE.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if THHVE can raduce bleeding,reduce the incidence of
      complications and improve the patient's free survival and overall survival compared with
      other occlusion methods.
