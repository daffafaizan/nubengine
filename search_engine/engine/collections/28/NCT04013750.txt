      therapy and the use of modified constraint induced movement therapy are the most effective
      treatment strategies. The investigators aimed To analyze effect of modified constraint
      induced movement therapy on upper extremity functions and quality of life of subacute and
      chronic phase stroke patients with right/left hemisphere damage.

      A total of 40 patients (20 patients with right hemiplegia and 20 patients with left
      hemiplegia) were enrolled in our prospective, randomized and controlled trial. Patients were
      randomized in to three groups. The first group consists of 10 right hemiplegia patients and
      the second group consists of 10 left hemiplegia patients. First and second group of patients
      had 10 sessions of constraint induced movement therapy as groups of 4, 5 days a week. Each
      patient had modified constraint induced movement therapy 1 hour a day with professional
      support and performed home program by themselves 3 hours a day. Patients' less affected hands
      were limited by the help of a glove %50 of the time they were awake. 10 patients with right
      hemiplegia and 10 patients with left hemiplegia formed the control group and these patients
      were in line for inpatient rehabilitation programme. Patients were examined before treatment,
      just after treatment and 3 months after treatment using Box-Block Test, cubes lined, card
      turned and object gripped in 30 seconds, time it takes to grip and carry a water filled glass
      to their mouth and putting it back, Motor Activity Log (MAL), Stroke Impact Scale, Fugl-Meyer
      Motor Assessment Scale. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test and Friedman test were used for intragroup
      comparison of data and Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare data between groups.
