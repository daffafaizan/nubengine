      respiratory infections in children which contribute to more than 60% of pediatric outpatient
      cases. In pediatric internal medicine outpatient cases, trachitis/bronchitis, acute upper
      respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, acute tonsillitis and asthma are the most common
      diseases torturing pediatric patients.

      Children are prone to recurrent respiratory infections which may impose heavy burdens on
      their families. Ten million children under 5 years old are killed by recurrent respiratory
      infections every year. In China, daily outpatient visits of children with recurrent upper
      respiratory tract infections account for 10%-20% of the total daily outpatient visits for
      respiratory diseases. The outpatient medication for pediatric patients is found of
      non-compliance issues. According to the data in 2014, more than 33.8% of pediatric patients
      of all ages were given off-label medication, and more than 30% were given off-label
      medication in treatment.
