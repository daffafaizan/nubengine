      intervention for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Using Hi-LoÂ® Evac
      endotracheal tube (Hi-Lo Evac; Mallinckrodt; Athlone, Ireland), dysfunction of suction lumen
      and subsequent failure to aspirate the subglottic secretions is not uncommon. The objective
      of this prospective observational study is to determine the causes and the incidence of
      suction lumen dysfunction of Evac endotracheal tube.
