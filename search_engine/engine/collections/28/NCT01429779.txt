    
      Rationale:

      The routine use of laxatives after liver surgery as part of an Enhanced Recovery After
      Surgery (ERAS®) programme enhances recovery of gastro-intestinal function and early tolerance
      of oral nutrition. The use of Macrogol (Movicol®) as laxative during one week prior to
      partial liver resection will further enhance early return of gastro-intestinal function and
      accelerate functional recovery.

      Objective:

      The aim of this study is to accelerate recovery after liver surgery by enhancing intestinal
      passage through the preoperative use of Movicol®

      Study design:

      The Orange-III trial is a multicentre randomised controlled trial to aim whether the
      administration of 1 sachet of Movicol® during one week preoperatively and 2 sachets of
      Movicol® postoperatively will further enhance early recovery compared to the administration
      of 2 sachets of Movicol® postoperatively only, following liver surgery. All patients will be
      managed within an ERAS® programme of perioperative care.

      Study population:

      Patients requiring a partial liver resection (two or more segments), 18-80 yr old.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The main objective of the Orange-III trial is to provide evidence on early recovery of
      gastro-intestinal function defined as time to first intake of solid food continued for more
      than 24 hours after the use of Movicol® during one week prior to partial liver resection
      within an enhanced recovery programme. Secondary objectives are recovery of gastro-intestinal
      function defined as time to first stools and time to continuous intake of clear fluids for
      more than 24 hours, functional recovery, hospital length of stay and patient activity level.
