      maintaining mobility and independence. In the US, osteoarthritis (OA) is the primary cause of
      disability in adults, with no medical or surgical therapeutic intervention known to restore
      the degenerated cartilage. The loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with age, is also
      linked to increased risk of other diseases, risk of falls, and decreased quality of life.
      Therefore, OA and muscle loss together are primary contributors to age-related decreases in
      mobility and independence. Evidence suggests a decrease in muscle quality is associated with
      or precedes primary knee OA, suggesting that these two conditions may share a common cause.
      We will treat 50-65 year old people with mild or moderate OA in both knees, and reported loss
      of muscle strength, with a supplement already available for use in humans to reduce oxidative
      stress and inflammation. The supplement is called PB125. In this pilot clinical trial, we
      will measure the ability of muscle to make energy, measure mobility (walking and standing)
      and strength, and assess pain following PB125 or placebo treatment.
