    
      This is an open-label, phase II study of PTK787/ZK222584 designed to determine the safety and
      efficacy of PTK787/ZK222584 in the treatment of imatinib-resistant GIST. The PTK787/ZK222584
      dose used is 1250 mg daily. Six patients will first enter the study using a two-stage
      approach. If clinical benefit is obtained in >1 of 6 patients, 9 and 30 additional patients
      will be entered into the protocol (a maximum total number of 45 patients will be entered).
      Clinical benefit is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following 3 measures: 1)
      objective response to PTK787 (a confirmed or unconfirmed partial response [PR] or a complete
      response [CR]); 2) metabolic response defined as >50% decrease in the standardized uptake
      value (SUV) of FDG uptake in >1 FDG-avid lesions in one or more of the patients; or 3)
      stabilized disease for 3 months or longer accompanied by symptomatic or performance status
      improvement. Medical history, current medical conditions, weight, height, and an
      electrocardiogram are recorded prior to the study entry. Other baseline examinations include
      a chest X-ray, hematologic tests, a coagulation panel, serum chemistries, urine analysis, a
      serum pregnancy test and a radiological assessment of the tumor. Tumor response is monitored
      with imaging at 4- to 8-week intervals. Hematological tests and serum chemistries are
      evaluated at 1- to 4-week intervals, and adverse events are collected continuously. Research
      blood tests are collected at the times of tumor evaluations. Dose adjustments are carried out
      as per the protocol. Patients who benefit from the study treatment will be treated with
      PTK787/ZK222584 until treatment failure.
