    
      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
           oral TP-1287 in patients with advanced metastatic or progressive solid tumors who are
           refractory to, or intolerant of, established therapy known to provide clinical benefit
           for their condition.

        -  To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future studies with TP-1287

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To establish the pharmacokinetics of orally administered TP-1287

        -  To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of TP-1287 by objective
           radiographic assessment

        -  To study the pharmacodynamics of TP-1287 therapy
