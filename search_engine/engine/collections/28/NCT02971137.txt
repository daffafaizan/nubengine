      cessation efforts. Smoking cessation among patients with chronic medical illnesses
      substantially decreases morbidity and mortality; yet, many patients (>50%) with chronic pain
      continue to smoke.

      This study aims to test the telephone delivery of a cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI),
      for smoking cessation among Veteran smokers with chronic pain. Proposed is a randomized
      comparative effectiveness trial with a two-group design in which 370 Veteran smokers with
      chronic pain will be randomized to either: 1) smoking cessation plus CBI (SMK-CBI), an
      intervention that includes a proactive tele-health intervention combining evidence-based
      smoking cessation counseling augmented with behavioral approaches for coping with pain and a
      tele-medicine clinic for accessing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), or 2) smoking
      cessation telephone counseling control (SMK Control), a contact-equivalent control that
      provides standard smoking cessation telephone counseling and a tele-medicine clinic for
      accessing NRT.
