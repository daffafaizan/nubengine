    
      1. Using hand held PDAs, we will develop an obesity risk screening and counseling system
           for 4 through 10 year olds attending primary care well child visits. Screening results
           will be summarized immediately by the PDA and will prompt the clinician to provide brief
           counseling messages tailored to each childís obesity screening results, including the
           familyís and the childís readiness to change behavior

        2. We will evaluate the specific content and quality of clinician obesity counseling
           provided at the well child visit through parent surveys before and after implementation
           of the PDA screening and counseling program.

        3. To support action by families after the office visit, we will develop a post-visit
           intervention package of newsletters and materials that are tailored to child/family
           obesity risk behaviors and parental readiness to change.

        4. We will evaluate the impact of this post visit intervention program in a 6 month trial
           focused on children identified at well child screening to have BMI >85%. 200 Families
           will be randomized to receive either a series of mailed supports over 3 months versus a
           single generic-content mailing. We will determine the respective impact of these two
           levels of post-visit support on stage of change, parental action on key obesity risk
           behaviors, and stabilization of BMI z scores after 6 months.
