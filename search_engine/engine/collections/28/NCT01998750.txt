    
      This is a clinical and genomic study designed to investigate monogenic causes of severe early
      childhood obesity.

      Participatns with severe early onset obesity will be identified by screening of the clinical
      database or referred for the study. These subjects will be invited to participate in the
      study. After obtaining informed consent, the investigators will obtain history on the proband
      and the family, and perform a brief examination in addition to collecting genetic material.

      Targeted sequencing of genes associated with monogenic and syndromic forms of obesity will be
      performed using next-generation sequencing. In selected individuals with favorable family
      history, exome or whole genome sequencing will be performed. Functional analysis of newly
      identified variants will be performed where possible.
