      is a hypercoaguable state which remains in the first 24 hours postdelivery. Unfortunately
      results obtained by the existing studies that attempted to establish reference values for TEG
      suffer considerable bias.

      The aim of this study will be to determine the range values for thomboelastography in
      pregnant women. Since there is no available information on the expected distribution of the
      outcome, a sequential design will be used. The main endpoint of the analysis will be a
      reliable estimate for the outcome expected in healthy women after labor. The investigators
      will state their target estimate as being reliable when the ratio between the estimate and
      its standard error is smaller than 2.

      During labor, 2 hours after delivery and 24 hours postpartum, a venous blood sample will be
      taken from eligible women for thromboelastographic determination. Whole blood nonadditive TEM
      will be performed on the TEM-A automated thromboelastometer (Framar Biomedica,Rome, Italy) to
      obtain the four classical TEM parameters: reaction (R) time, k time, alpha angle and maximum
      amplitude (MA).
