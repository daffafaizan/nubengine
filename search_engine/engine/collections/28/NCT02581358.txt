      transverse planes. Quantitative assessment of curve severity in scoliosis is important for
      patient management. At present, Cobb angle measurement in the frontal plane using standing
      postero-anterior X-ray radiograph is the gold standard for scoliosis evaluation. Taking x-ray
      involves irradiation and is not without risk especially over repeated exposures for follow-up
      visits. With advancement of ultrasound technology which is radiation-free and noted to be
      useful as a tool for musculoskeletal imaging, an ultrasound system designed for evaluation of
      spinal deformity called Scolioscan has been developed. It comprises of a freehand 3D
      ultrasound imaging system with an enhanced frame structure for supporting the patient to
      maintain the posture during scanning and a software for measuring curve deformity in terms of
      Cobb angles. Previous studies on validity of ultrasound assessment for back deformity
      involved a pilot group of subjects. Based on these promising pilot results, we plan to carry
      out a formal study to investigate the validity of Scolioscan for quantitative assessment of
      curve severity in scoliosis using x-ray radiograph as the gold standard for comparison.
