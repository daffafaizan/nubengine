      Trauma Unit of University Hospital of Bari. All the patients underwent an all-inside
      semitendinosus (ST) tendon autograft ACLR with Arthrex TightRope cortical fixation.

      The clinical outcomes (modified Cincinnati Rating System Questionnaire (mCRSQ), Tegner
      Activity Level Score (TALS), Tegner Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale (TLKSS)), the self-reported
      psychological scores (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) and the ACL Return to Sport after
      Injury (ACL-RSI) score) and biomechanical outcomes (stability, jump, coordination and fatigue
      tests) were assessed postoperatively at 18 months.
