    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate whether overall survival (OS) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      surveillance alone is not inferior to MRI surveillance combined with prophylactic cranial
      irradiation (PCI) for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare cognitive failure free survival (CFFS) rate up to 12 months after randomization
      between the arms.

      II. To compare brain-metastasis-free survival between the arms. III. To compare OS between
      the arms within the subgroups of patients with limited-stage and extensive-stage disease.

      IV. To compare cognitive failure free survival (CFFS) rates at the assessment times between
      the arms.

      V. To compare the cumulative incidence of cognitive failure with death as a competing risk
      between the arms.

      VI. To compare the frequency and severity of toxicities between the two arms.

      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE:

      I. To collect blood for banking.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo conventional or hippocampal avoidance PCI over 20 minutes 5 days per
      week for 2 weeks. Patients also undergo MRI scan at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.

      ARM II: Patients undergo MRI scan at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.
