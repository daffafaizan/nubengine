      written consent the patients will be tested with wearable sensors on their occiput and C6
      vertebra during gait. Healthy controls will be recruited from students and employees at the
      Western Norway University of Applied Science and go through the same protocol as the
      patients.

      The investigators will measure the relationship between the two sensors to explore how
      patients with dizziness move their-on-trunk during gait.

      The projects main hypothesis is that patient with dizziness have reduced attenuation of
      gait-associated head oscillations with increased coupling of head-on-trunk motion, compared
      to healthy controls. The neck does not compensate for trunk movements, causing the head to
      follow the movement of the trunk.
