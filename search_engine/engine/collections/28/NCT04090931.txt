      titanium (SENT) archwires in terms of their effectiveness in aligning teeth, possibility of
      inducing root resorption, and patient perception of pain during the initial phase of
      treatment.

      Subjects and Methods: Orthodontic patient aged 12 years or over with lower anterior crowding
      of 3-6 mm. who need treatment without extraction, were randomly allocated to the HANT and
      SENT archwires groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Archwire sequence in both groups was
      0.014-inch and 0.016-inch, respectively. Each archwire was placed for 4 weeks. Outcome
      measures included the amount of crowding using Little's irregularity index (LII), apical root
      resorption, and pain perception. The effectiveness of alignment was tested using 2X2 mixed
      factorial ANOVA, while root resorption and pain perception were tested by the Mann-Whitney U
      test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P<0.05).
