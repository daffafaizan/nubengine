    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival in colorectal cancer patients after hepatic
      resection of liver metastases and FOLFOX or leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan
      hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy [+/- Bevacizumab], or capecitabine and oxaliplatin
      (XELOX),followed by intravenous (IV) yttrium-90 (90Y) M5A anti-CEA antibody.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the feasibility and toxicities of such adjuvant therapy following resection
      and/or ablation of liver metastases and FOLFOX chemotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the biodistribution, clearance and metabolism of 90Y and 111In (indium-111)
      M5A administered IV.

      OUTLINE:

      FOLFOX* + BEVACIZUMAB CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin
      calcium IV over 2 hours, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours, and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes. Treatment repeats for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY (RIT): Within 4-12 weeks after completion of post-hepatic resection
      therapy chemotherapy, patients receive yttrium Y 90 DOTA anti-CEA monoclonal antibody M5A IV
      over 25 minutes. Treatment repeats every 6-10 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE:*Patients previously failing oxaliplatin regimen receive FOLIFIRI chemotherapy
      comprising irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium over 2 hours,
      fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes.
      Treatment repeats for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
