      sensor locations in respect to signal quality, sensor fit to site location and fluid
      responsiveness. PVI will be measured at 3 different sensor sites: the fingers, ear lobes and
      forehead. The ability to predict fluid responsiveness will be analyzed using cardiac output
      as the reference value.
