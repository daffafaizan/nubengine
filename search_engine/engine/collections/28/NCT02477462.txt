      laboratory data and blood samples for research purposes on 45 PBC patients and 50 male and
      female NAFLD patients. PBC and NAFLD diagnosis and clinical status will be evaluated by
      magnetic resonance (MR) elastography, transient elastography (FibroScanÂ®) and blood lab
      analysis including anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA),
      immunoglobulins, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and
      coagulation measures). Additionally serum and blood will be obtained from the patients on the
      first visit and at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 & 24. Serum and blood samples will be used
      to measure serum cytokine abundance and transcriptome analysis. For comparison, 95 age (+/- 5
      years) and sex-matched controls without PBC will be recruited for a clinical laboratory,
      cytokine, gene expression analysis. Control subjects will have blood drawn at a single time
      point.
