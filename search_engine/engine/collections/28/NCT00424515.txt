    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate of patients with metastatic mucosal, acral/lentiginous,
           or chronically sun damaged melanomas to treatment with of imatinib.

        -  To determine the time to progression.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate c-kit mutational status with response to therapy.

        -  To evaluate the use of FDG-PET scanning in determining early biologic response to
           therapy.

        -  Tolerability of imatinib.

        -  To assess amplification of c-kit status through quantitative PCR and/or FISH and other
           related molecular pathway targets.

        -  To correlate c-kit amplification status with response to therapy.
