      depression. Screening of pregnant women's mental condition before giving birth, early
      identification of pregnant women with symptoms of prenatal depression, and providing
      appropriate interventions may play an important role in reducing the incidence of postpartum
      depression. Ketamine is an NMDA-receptor antagonist. In recent years, many studies confirmed
      that ketamine has a significant antidepressant effect. As a stereoisomer of ketamine,
      s-ketamine has similar effects to ketamine in anti-depression. In clinical application,
      s-ketamine has stronger analgesic effect, better anesthetic effect and lower incidence of
      adverse psychological reactions. We speculate that, for pregnant women with prenatal
      depression, low-dose s-ketamine infusions after childbirth may reduce postpartum depression.
      Evidence is lacking in this regard.
