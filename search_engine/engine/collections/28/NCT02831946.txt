      closure using a 1:1 allocation algorithm. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to
      group allocation. Scar evaluation was performed after two months.

      Primary outcome measures were Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) summary
      scores 2 months after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were, duration of surgery, and
      development of hematoma, seroma, surgical site infection (SSI) or wound disruption.

      Data were analyzed according to the intention to treat principle.
