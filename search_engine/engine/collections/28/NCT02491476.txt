      Partial Epilepsy or RPE). Patients with RPE suffer from social and occupational disability,
      an increased risk associated with seizures (traumatic brain injury, accidents), but also a
      higher risk of sudden unexplained death (2 to 3 times higher) than the general population.
      Moreover, the medical and social burden of these patients is heavy, representing a
      significant cost to society.

      In some cases, surgical treatment with resection of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) can be
      proposed. The presurgical evaluation includes various investigations seeking to clarify the
      location of the EZ; but this approach is sometimes insufficient and the definition of the EZ
      then requires invasive exploration through intracerebral EEG recording (stereo-EEG, SEEG).
      This latter technique is currently the preferred standard to define the EZ. It involves
      implanting electrodes in the brain areas suspected to belong to the seizure network. 50 to
      70% of patients investigated with this technique will have epilepsy surgery.

      In recent years, a series of studies in animals and humans have suggested that some
      oscillations, very short and at very high frequency (> 250 Hz), called "fast ripples" (FRs)
      could be a good biomarker of the EZ (for a review see Zijlmans et al, 2012). The FRs are more
      easily recorded from microelectrode (diameter: 20-40 microns).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new medical device designed by DixiMedical to
      record FRs, combining micro and regular clinical electrodes.
