      screening period to confirm eligibility, patients will be randomized to either the RPM system
      group, or the usual care group. Both groups will be followed for 52 weeks until the end of
      study. There are only 4 planned study visits and patients will continue on their usual
      treatment.

      The remote patient monitoring system will issue an alert to the clinical site once the
      established threshold change has been reached. The alert notification will require the
      clinical site to contact the patient and treat the patient based on clinical judgment and
      clinical practice. Patients in the usual care arm will be managed through their normally
      nurse/physician contact.
