    
      TAK-875 is being developed at Takeda Global Research and Development, Inc. as an adjunct to
      diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in participants with T2DM.

      This study will determine whether administration of glimepiride alters the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of TAK-875, and whether TAK-875 affects the PK of glimepiride.
