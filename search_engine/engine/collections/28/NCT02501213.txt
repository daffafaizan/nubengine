    
      Patients eligible for the trial and having signed their consent to participate will be
      randomized to arm A or B.

      Treatment order is randomly attributed to patients at the 1st paracentesis, after the
      reception of the laboratory results necessary to evaluate SAAG value. Randomization is
      stratified 1:1 according to SAAG values (â‰¥ or < to 11g/L) and Systemic treatment (yes or not)

        -  Patients randomized to arm A will be observed until the next episode requiring
           paracentesis (due to clinical symptoms : abdominal pain or heaviness, dyspnoea,
           orthopnoea, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, early satiety, gastro-oesophageal reflux, lower
           limb and genital oedema), at which time they will receive arm B (diuretics), in absence
           of contra-indication to diuretic treatment.

        -  Patients randomized to arm B will receive diuretics until the next episode requiring
           paracentesis, at which time they will receive arm A (observation).

      Patients will have a physical assessment within 24 hours prior to the start of treatment,
      once every two weeks for patients randomized in arm A and each week for patients randomized
      in arm B, at cross-over and at the end of the study. Patient will also have a biological
      assessment within 24 hours prior to the start of treatment, twice a week for patients
      randomized in arm B, at cross-over and at the end of the study. Finally, they will address a
      quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C15-PAL) prior to the start of treatment, at cross-over
      and at the end of the study.
