      stride length variability in different gait conditions (e.g., normal speed, normal speed with
      dual task, fast speed and fast speed with dual task) between healthy individuals and patients
      who suffer from chronic ankle instability.

      the measurements will be collected using the OPTOGait system installed on a treadmill.
