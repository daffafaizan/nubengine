      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity(s) (DLTs) and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of
      BAY 43-9006 given orally.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary evidence of tumor response to BAY 43-9006 in patients. II. To assess
      the pharmacokinetic profile of BAY 43-9006. III. To characterize the preliminary profile of
      adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters in patients treated with BAY 43-9006.

      IV. To assess effects of BAY 43-9006 on various cellular properties of leukemic blasts
      exposed to drug in vivo and in vitro.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-14 or 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) may be considered for retreatment with sorafenib
      for up to an additional 6 courses upon disease recurrence provided the duration of CR is
      longer than 1 month.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that which 2 of 3 or 2 of
      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for up to 1 year.
