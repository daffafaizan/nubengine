      immune cells and lead to decreases in blood biomarkers and improvements in clinical
      parameters. Specific Aim 1 will examine the levels of the predictive biomarker, chemokine
      ligand 9 (CXCL9), and related transcripts, and determine whether they decrease in
      participants over time while taking Acthar. Specific Aim 2 will test whether the biologic
      changes measured in blood correlate to clinical markers, including lung function and symptom
      scores. Since the investigators have found that CXCL9 predicts clinical course, they
      hypothesize that CXCL9 transcript levels in the blood will decrease over time in pulmonary
      sarcoidosis participants whose clinical outcome measures improve with Acthar.
