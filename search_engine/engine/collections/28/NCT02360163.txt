      surgical procedures that might be required to deliver fluids into the blood of critically ill
      patients simply because the patients' veins cannot be located through the manual technique.

      The ultrasound assisted technique will increase accessibility to small veins that might be
      missed via the manual technique. The technique of using an ultrasound machine to assist the
      administration of fluids into a patient's veins is called ultrasound guided peripheral
      intravenous access (USGPIVA), while the traditional technique that uses only sight and touch
      to locate a patient veins without machine assistance is called the traditional landmark
      technique (TLT). The investigators will compare the effectiveness of USGPIVA with TLT in
      terms of reducing complications and costs.
