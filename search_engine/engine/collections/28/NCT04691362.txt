      peroperative and postoperative hemorrhagic complications. The original character of our study
      lies in the serum dosage of tranexamic acid, allowing to correlate the primary objective
      (blood loss) with this one. The investigators will focus on the reduction of the risks
      associated with the administration of intravenous medicines, the economic aspect and the ease
      of use.
