      multifaceted, perioperative infection control program on S. aureus transmission and SSIs. A
      multifaceted infection control program was implemented over 8 months (November 2018 to June
      2019). A prospective cohort impact study was then conducted over 8 months (July 2019 to March
      2020) to compare the incidence of within-case S. aureus transmission (primary outcome) and
      surgical site infection (secondary outcome) before (4.5 months) and after (3.5 months)
      implementation of surveillance feedback.
