      and MM are unclear. Obesity, in turn, is closely associated with obstructive sleep apnea.
      Interestingly, the key risk factors for both sleep apnea and MM are overlapping (age, sex,
      race and body mass index). During the apnea, or cessation of normal breathing, arterial
      oxygen saturation falls. This can occur as often as 60 times per hour, resulting in chronic
      intermittent hypoxia (CIH). In preliminary studies, investigators exposed C57BL/6 mice, that
      are typically resistant to engraftment of malignant plasma cells to CIH, followed by
      injection of malignant 5TGM1 cells. With CIH, 5TGM1 cells homed to bone marrow, and engrafted
      and expanded, resulting in lethal disease. These mice had key features of the myeloma
      phenotype, including bone damage and gammopathy. Investigators explored potential mechanisms
      by which CIH promote MM progression by performing whole bone marrow RNASeq analysis. They
      found pathways relevant to angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and stromal cell development
      (including dendritic cells and eosinophils) to be upregulated. This is an exciting and
      potentially translational finding because these elements are also upregulated in the bone
      marrow of human myeloma patients. Investigators also found upregulation of B cell and plasma
      cell development and differentiation pathway, and downregulation of B-cell apoptosis
      pathways. Taking these preliminary findings together, the overarching hypothesis is that CIH
      increases oxidative stress, thereby supporting B cell maturation and changing the bone marrow
      stromal microenvironment to drive the progression to MM.
