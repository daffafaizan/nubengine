    
      This is a non-randomized prospective open-label cohort study in patients with COVID-19 who
      require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The active treatment group will consist of
      patients who are treated OLE therapy while on mechanical ventilation.

      Results from subjects in the active treatment group will be compared to retrospectively
      collected results from patients treated with standard care with no OLE therapy.

      Subjects in the control group will be identified from the population of patients previously
      admitted to the two study sites with COVID-19 infection who required invasive mechanical
      ventilation but were not treated with OLE therapy. Subject data will be collected
      retrospectively from the medical record.
