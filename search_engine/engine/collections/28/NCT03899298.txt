      Orthopedic, Neurologic, Urologic, Autoimmune, Renal, Cardiac and Pulmonary Conditions will be
      included.

      The study has been approved by an Alion accredited Institutional Review Board, Solutions IRB,
      as of March 2019.

      Depending on the condition, patients may receive a series of therapies via one or more of the
      following methods: intravenous, injection, intra-nasal and/or nebulizer. R3 has several "best
      practice" therapy protocols that participating practices will follow. Should a patient have
      conditions that fall into more than one condition category, he or she can still be included
      with the protocols being received for each condition(s).

      Here is a specific administration for each condition category:

        1. Orthopedic Condition = Injection

        2. Neurologic Disease = IV Infusion and Intranasal Procedure. The exception is with
           Peripheral Neuropathy, where participants receive a series of injections along with an
           IV Infusion Procedure.

        3. Urologic = Injection

        4. Autoimmune = IV Infusion

        5. Cardiac = IV Infusion

        6. Pulmonary = IV Infusion plus Nebulizer

        7. Renal = IV Infusion

      Pre, Intra and Post procedure data acquisition will occur at various time frames up to 10
      years. Follow up time-frames will measure changes occurring from baseline post procedure at 1
      month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months
      and then on average each year, up to 10 years. Patients will pay for procedures, and no
      randomization will occur.
