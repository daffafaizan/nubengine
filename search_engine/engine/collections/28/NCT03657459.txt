      fatigue, dyspnea and edema. In previous research, patients did not recognize worsening HF,
      due to 3 primary reasons: (1) danger signs were non-specific and misinterpreted as stress, an
      external force or another comorbidity, (2) danger signs were unrecognized due to the subtle
      nature of worsening status, or (3) when patients eliminated or minimized activities that
      prompted danger signs, they interpreted the results as improvement in status. Lack of
      recognition of HF danger signs and lack of understanding of how to control and minimize
      danger signs could lead to their escalation and prompt all-cause and HF-related health care
      resource utilization (HCRU). Investigators hypothesize that patients must understand HF
      danger signs to have self-confidence in recognizing them and in taking steps to minimize or
      eliminate their occurrence post hospital discharge. The purposes of this trial are to
      determine if video education in HF danger signs recognition and control prior to discharge
      (and post-discharge) reduces all-cause and HF-related health care resource utilization. The
      intervention will be administered during hospitalization, and patients and family members
      will receive a link to a website and a DVD to review videos as often as desired
      post-discharge. The primary end-point is 30-day HF-related hospitalization. 732 patients (658
      + 10% attrition) with decompensated HF will be enrolled from multiple hospitals.
