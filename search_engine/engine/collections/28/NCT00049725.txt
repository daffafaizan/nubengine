      system destroys platelets, the blood cells responsible for clotting. A number of standard
      treatments exist to decrease the destruction of platelets, including drugs such as the
      steroid hormone prednisone, or removal of the spleen. Over a third of adult patients will not
      maintain adequate platelet counts with these treatments. Alternative treatments may be
      indicated due to bleeding symptoms or baseline platelet counts less than 20,000/ul, a level
      at which spontaneous serious bleeding can occur. Therapy for chronic ITP is generally
      effective in less than 30-50% of patients, however, and most of these agents have significant
      toxicities with long-term use, are expensive, or their administration interferes with daily
      activities.

      Daclizumab is a humanized anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody that works by
      targeting and impairing activated T lymphocytes, a subset of white blood cells that has been
      thought to be involved in the development and maintenance of ITP. Daclizumab is a
      well-tolerated and time-limited therapy, and is easily administered on an outpatient basis.
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of daclizumab as either a sole agent in the
      treatment of chronic, symptomatic ITP, or as a treatment that might allow a decrease or
      discontinuation of medications such as prednisone.
