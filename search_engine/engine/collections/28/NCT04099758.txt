      mindfulness of the breath meditation practice lasting 10 minutes or 2) an audio-recording
      control of the same length. State measures of mindfulness, hope and gratitude will be taken
      immediately before (baseline) and after the intervention/control. In addition, the study will
      also measure trait mindfulness at baseline.The primary hypothesis is that engaging in a brief
      mindfulness practice will result in beneficial changes in state hope compared to control.
      Other hypotheses are that: engaging in a brief mindfulness practice will result in beneficial
      changes in state gratitude compared to control; that the effect of mindfulness practice on
      state hope will be statistically mediated by change in state mindfulness; that the effect of
      mindfulness practice on state gratitude will be statistically mediated by change in state
      mindfulness; and that baseline trait mindfulness will statistically moderate the effect of
      mindfulness practice on change in state mindfulness in the above mentioned mediation models
      (i.e. that moderated mediation will be observed).
