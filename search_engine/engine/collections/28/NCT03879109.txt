      5-10% rate of locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC), with an overall survival rate of 40% at
      5 years after complete resection. Curative surgery of LRRC requires multi-visceral resections
      which are associated with significant post-operative morbidity of 60%. Despite the
      combination of a potential curability and the high post-operative morbidity, there are
      currently neither good data from prospective randomized studies regarding optimum
      preoperative treatments for LRRC nor is there data assessing the efÔ¨Åcacy of response to any
      such treatments. Moreover, the widespread use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy for primary cancer
      introduced a new problem: the treatment of LRRC in previously irradiated area. Some studies
      investigated various modalities of reirradiation and showed acceptable late toxicity and
      encouraging outcome. GRECCAR 15 would be the first prospective randomized trial so far to
      evaluate the interest of pelvic reirradiation for LRRC, in previously irradiated patients.

      The objective is to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by pelvic
      reirradiation versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone on the rate of curative surgery (R0) in
      previously irradiated patients with LRRC.

      Patients will be followed every 4 months during 2 years, and every 6 months the last year
      with chest, abdominal and pelvic scan and tumour markers.
