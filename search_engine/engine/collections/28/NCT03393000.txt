    
      During the radiation treatment period subjects will receive:

        1. Focal radiation delivered as 60 Gray/30 fractions scheduled at 2 Gray/day for 5 days
           each week (Monday through Friday) for 6 weeks.

        2. Temozolomide 75mg/m2 orally once daily (usually administered the night preceding each
           radiation session) starting the evening before the first radiation session over a period
           of 42 calendar days with a maximum of 49 days.

        3. TSC 0.25 mg/kg IV for 3 days each week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) administered between
           45 to 60 minutes prior to each radiation session.

      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis is required during Temozolomide + radiation
      administration, regardless of lymphocyte count and is to continue until recovery of
      lymphocyte count to less than or equal to Grade 1.

      During the 28-day rest period all subjects will receive no treatment.

      During the post-radiation 6-cycle temozolomide treatment period subjects will receive:

      All subjects will receive: 28-day oral temozolomide (150 mg/m2 first cycle and 200 mg/m2 all
      subsequent cycles as tolerated) administered on Day 1-5 (Monday through Friday) of each
      28-day cycle.

      Controls: Will receive oral temozolomide at night at home per the standard of care.

      Subjects randomized to TSC: Will receive TSC 1.5 mg/kg (or the dose recommended by the Data
      Safety Monitoring Board) 1.5 to 2 hours before their temozolomide dose during the daytime for
      3 days during the first week of each 28-day cycle (Days 1, 3, 5: Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
      The Tuesday, Thursday doses will be given at night at home. Long-acting antiemetics may be
      administered prior to daytime temozolomide dosing on Days 1, 3, 5.

      In accordance with the FDA directive of August 22, 2017 the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of TSC at doses between 0.25 mg/kg and up to 1.5 mg/kg in combination with
      concomitant temozolomide will be assessed via a dose escalation run-in prior to initiating
      the randomized trial.

      The first eight (8) subjects enrolled in the 100-206 trial will be assigned (not randomized
      between treatments) at Baseline to undergo radiation plus temozolomide plus TSC treatment
      (0.25 mg/kg) for 6 weekly cycles followed by 4 weeks of rest in standard fashion. At the Week
      10 clinic visit the same eight (8) subjects will be assigned to treatment with 2 subjects
      each assigned to TSC at doses of 0.25, 0.50, 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg.

      The first eight (8) subjects will be studied in parallel and all for two full 28-day cycles
      with inclusion of appropriate blood sampling collection for TSC and temozolomide
      pharmacokinetics.

      The Data Safety Monitoring Board will examine the resultant safety data after 2 full cycles
      (Weeks 11 through 18 of post-radiation temozolomide treatment period; Days 1 to 56).

      The eight (8) subjects that are a part of the dose-escalation run-in will continue at their
      assigned TSC dose (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mg/kg) for the Week 19 TSC dosing period.

      The Data Safety Monitoring Board will recommend an acceptable TSC dose, if different than 1.5
      mg/kg, for the post-radiation temozolomide treatment period prior to the Week 23 TSC dosing
      period for the eight (8) subjects that are a part of the dose-escalation run-in.

      Thereafter, subjects will enter the 100-206 trial and be randomized at Baseline between TSC
      plus standard of care or the standard of care.
