      assessment have not been rigorously tested for their usefulness in clinical, military, and
      sports medicine communities.

      This study evaluated the components of biological variation and accuracy of potential markers
      in plasma, urine, saliva, and body mass, for static and dynamic dehydration assessment.
      Design: Eighteen healthy volunteers (13M, 5F) were studied while carefully controlling
      hydration and numerous pre-analytical factors. Biological variation was determined over three
      consecutive days using published methods. Atypical values based on statistical deviations
      from a homeostatic set-point were examined. Measured deviations in body fluid were produced
      using a separate, prospective dehydration experiment and evaluated by ROC analysis to
      quantify diagnostic accuracy.

      All dehydration markers displayed substantial individuality and half displayed marked
      heterogeneity of intra-individual variation. Decision levels for all dehydration markers were
      within one standard deviation of the ROC criterion values and most were nearly identical to
      the prospective group means after dehydrating volunteers by 1.8 - 7.0% of body mass. However,
      only plasma osmolality (Posm) showed statistical promise for use in static dehydration
      assessment. A 301 Â± 5 mmol/kg diagnostic decision level is proposed. Reference change values
      (RCV) of 9 mmol/kg (Posm), 0.010 (urine specific gravity, Usg), and 2.5% change in body mass
      (Bm) were also statistically valid for dynamic dehydration assessment at the 95% probability
      level.

      Posm is the only useful marker for static dehydration assessment. Posm, Usg, and Bm are valid
      markers in the setting of dynamic dehydration assessment.
