    
      A total of 100 patients with persistent，in whom successful RF ablation of slow pathway or
      accessory pathway was performed. Patients with atrial fibrillation, structural heart disease,
      ventricular arrhythmias, impaired left ventricular systolic function or on antiarrhythmics
      were excluded. All the patients had echocardiographic study before ablation 、1 day and 1
      months after ablation. Left atrial systolic function was assessed using atrial ejection force
      (AEF) according to Manning's formula (AEF = 0.5 x ρ x MA x A(2), r: blood density = 1.06
      g/cm(3), MA: mitral orifice area [cm(2)], A: A wave velocity). The following left atrial
      dimensions were assessed: antero-posterior (LA-AP), infero-superior (LA-IS, long axis),
      medio-lateral (LA-ML, short axis). The correlations between AEF and electrophysiological
      parameters were analysed (VA - ventriculo-atrial conduction, VA/CL - tachycardia cycle
      length).
