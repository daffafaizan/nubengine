    
      PAP is a rare lung disease characterized by accumulation of surfactant phospholipids and
      proteins within the lungs. There is no specific pharmacologic therapy for PAP and the current
      practice of lung lavage under general anesthesia is invasive and has limitations. Although it
      is unknown if the anti GM-CSF antibody is related to the disease pathogenesis, observations
      suggest a role for GM-CSF in lung homeostasis as well as in the pathogenesis of PAP.

      Patients will receive subcutaneous GM-CSF or placebo once a day and will be followed on an
      outpatient basis at 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months after initiation of therapy.
      Clinical response will determine dosing schedule and will be evaluated by symptom scores, gas
      exchange data, and chest radiographs.
