      with three investigative arms. The study recruits at least 375 first stroke patients with
      certain motoric disabilities that are randomly assigned to either one experimental condition
      or one of two control conditions. Every individual patient participates for 31 (+/- 1) weeks
      in the trial (see fig. 1), the whole study is planned to last at least for 3 years. The
      recruitment and treatment of patients will last for 17 months during the trial. Patients
      undergo a baseline assessment for screening purposes and during the course of participation
      three further assessments of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. These endpoints will
      refer to the degree of recovered objective and subjective physical abilities due to the
      experimental treatment in comparison to the control comparators. Studies' hypotheses claim
      that the experimental treatment will lead to effects on the motoric abilities superior the
      effects elicited by the control treatments.
