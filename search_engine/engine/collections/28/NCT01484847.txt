    
      This is a single arm pharmacokinetic assessment study conducted at Princess Margaret Hospital
      in which eligible patients will be enrolled successively to receive a single dose of
      PF-00299804 in an open-labelled, unblinded manner. All patients will receive 45 mg of
      PF-00299804 via Gastrostomy (GT) once only on an empty stomach (i.e. 2 hours before or after
      oral food intake or GT feeds (food intake of less than 500 calories permitted)) as an
      inpatient. All patients will be admitted for an overnight inpatient stay (approximately 24
      hours) to facilitate pharmacokinetic assessment. There will be no dose reductions or
      modifications. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetics will occur on day 1 immediately prior to
      the dose of PF-00299804 (t=0), then at t=30 minutes, t=1 hour, t=2 hours, t=3 hours, t=4
      hours, t=6 hours, t=12 hours, t=24 hours, t=48 hours, t=72 hours, t=96 hours, t=144 hours,
      t=168 hours, t=192 hours, and t=216 hours.
