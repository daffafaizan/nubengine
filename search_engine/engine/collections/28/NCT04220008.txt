    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the day 100 non-relapse mortality (NRM) of allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      (allo SCT) using vorinostat/gemcitabine/clofarabine/busulfan (SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu) with
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-CY).

      II. Estimate the graft versus host disease (GVHD)-free/relapse free survival (GRFS) in
      patients with refractory lymphoma receiving an allo SCT with SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      III. Estimate the overall survival (OS) in patients with refractory lymphoma receiving an
      allo SCT with SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      IV. Assess the 1-year NRM in patients with refractory lymphoma receiving an allo SCT with
      SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      V. Assess the relapse rate in patients with refractory lymphoma receiving an allo SCT with
      SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      VI. Assess the graft failure rate in patients with refractory lymphoma receiving an allo SCT
      with SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      VII. Assess the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in patients with refractory
      lymphoma receiving an allo SCT with SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      VIII. Assess the incidence of grade 2-4 and grade 3-4 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD)
      in patients with refractory lymphoma receiving an allo SCT with SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      IX. Assess the overall and severe chronic GVHD in patients with refractory lymphoma receiving
      an allo SCT with SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      X. Determine the incidence of grade 3 and 4 nonhematological adverse events in patients with
      refractory lymphoma receiving an allo SCT with SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Describe changes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response and repair, poly
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and downstream cellular effects in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMNC), and, when available, malignant lymphocytes obtained by fine needle
      aspiration (FNA) of peripheral lymph nodes of patients with refractory lymphoma receiving an
      allo SCT with SAHA/Gem/Clo/Bu with PT-CY.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a low-level "test" dose of busulfan intravenously (IV) over up to 1 hour on
      days -15 to -9, vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -8 to -4, gemcitabine IV over
      about 90 minutes on days -7 and -5, clofarabine IV over about 1 hour and high-dose busulfan
      IV over 3 hours on days -7 to -4. Patients with CD20 positive (+) lymphoma also receive
      rituximab IV over 3 to 6 hours on days -15, -8, 1, and 8. Patients undergo allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) on day 0. Patients then receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 3 and 4. Beginning day 5, patients receive standard
      of care tacrolimus IV over 24 hours and mycophenolate mofetil IV over 2 hours three times
      daily (TID) until they can be tolerated PO. Once tolerated PO, patients receive tacrolimus PO
      twice daily (BID) for 6 months and mycophenolate mofetil PO TID for up to 30 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 30 days, patients who develop
      GVHD continue treatment with mycophenolate mofetil at physician's discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months after
      stem cell transplant, then every 6 months for 4 years.
