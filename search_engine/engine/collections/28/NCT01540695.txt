      permanent sections from previously cryofixed tissue is a common practice used to confirm
      diagnosis of frozen section histology. In dermatology, this practice can be used to examine
      Mohs layers and its debulk as well as routine nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) biopsies after
      initial histologic diagnosis with frozen sections. Even though freezing tissue can introduce
      histologic artifacts, there have been no studies documenting whether this occurs specifically
      in cryofixed tissues that are subsequently thawed for permanent FFPE H&E histology. The
      purpose of our study is to determine whether the freeze-thaw process used to generate
      permanent sections after cryofixation introduces significantly detectable histologic
      differences compared to permanent sections that were not previously cryofixed. Thirty debulk
      specimens of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas will be prospectively collected. Each
      specimen will be split so that half is processed as cryofixed permanents and the other half
      as noncryofixed permanents. The investigator will show each slide in random order to a group
      of four blinded participants (two dermatopathologists and two Mohs surgeons). Each
      participant must first rate the overall quality of histology. Then, each participant will
      rate each slide on the quality of cellular morphology, nuclear morphology, color and contrast
      of stains, intactness of specimen, and other miscellaneous artifacts. These data will then be
      analyzed for statistical significance.
