      before surgery. Currently this procedure is done with or without a local anesthetic. Patients
      report anxiety regarding cancer and cancer-related procedures. Different types of needle
      localization may have different pain and anxiety based on their duration, complexity, and
      invasiveness. This research is designed to determine if VR simulated environment can reduce
      pain and anxiety.

      Our aim is to study the efficacy of a virtual environment in reducing pain and procedural
      anxiety. It is intended for patients undergoing an ultrasound guided breast localization
      procedure that have had an abnormal breast biopsy. The overall aim is to discover an
      efficacious nonpharmacologic method to lower pain and anxiety during a standard of care
      procedure.
