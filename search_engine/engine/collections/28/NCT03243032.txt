      post-operative pain.1 There is evidence that alternative approaches, such as the use of long
      acting local anesthetics along with the combination of non-opioid analgesics such as
      acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may prevent the need for
      opioid medications. With the current national opioid overdose epidemic, government officials
      have introduced new prescribing recommendations for the management of acute pain. Dentists
      can play a role to address this epidemic by wider recognition and adoption of the new
      prescribing recommendations for fast acting pre-emptive non-opioid analgesics to prevent
      acute dental pain.2 Dentists are the fifth leading prescribers of opioids among health care
      professionals accounting for 12% of the total immediate-release opioids prescribed in the
      United States (U.S).3 With the increasing trends of opioid prescribing for dental surgeries
      in the past few decades, dental implant procedures hold the highest increasing rate for
      opioid prescribing.4 In the U.S alone, there has been as many as 183,000 prescription opioid
      overdose related deaths from 1999 to 2015. Since 1999, the mortality rate from opioid
      overdose has more than quadrupled.5 With more than 650,000 opioid prescriptions being
      dispensed daily in the U.S,6 there has been a national call to alter the current prescribing
      patterns of opioids to ensure appropriate indications and patient selection.7 There are
      multiple adverse effects that may develop from opioid pain medications: nausea, vomiting,
      constipation, dizziness, headache.8 However, two major concerns associated with the excessive
      prescribing of opioids are overdosing leading to life threatening respiratory depression
      problems and the creation of an environment that fosters the development of opioid
      dependency, abuse and addiction.8 The U.S. Senate passed the 'Comprehensive Addiction and
      Recovery Act' of 2016 to combat the opioid epidemic.9 This legislation is designed to prevent
      opioid-related morbidity and misuse via physician and patient education, risk awareness,
      proper prescribing practices, and efforts to improve safer handling of prescription opioids.9
      NSAIDs are widely used for their anti-inflammatory, pain and fever reducing properties. In
      the periphery, these drugs interfere with the formation of pro-inflammatory modulating
      prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 via reversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes
      (Cox-1 and Cox-2). NSAIDs exact their effects through a variety of peripheral and central
      mechanisms. Their efficacy in the reduction of post-operative pain has been widely
      documented.10 It has been demonstrated that a single dose of an NSAID (i.e. etoricoxib,
      ketoprofen, diclofenac potassium, diflunisan, ibuprofen) may provide better acute
      post-operative analgesia than some commonly prescribed single dose opioids, even when they
      are prescribed in combination with other NSAIDs.10 There is also sound evidence that some
      individuals receive synergistic analgesic effects when NSAIDs are combined with
      acetaminophen.11 However, these effects can vary, as not everyone will achieve adequate pain
      relief even from the most potent drugs. Simple drug combinations of fast acting
      anti-inflammatories with acetaminophen can reliably provide successful analgesia for many
      acute pain patients in reasonably low doses.10 While modern dental literature contains
      numerous articles that support the tolerability, safety and efficacy of NSAIDs, many dental
      practices continue to prescribe opioids in cases which would likely respond better to other
      analgesics. Many dentists still underrate the risks and abuse of opioids. That is why it is
      important to design and test more lucid protocols for prescribing analgesics in dental care
      settings.

      Severity of post-operative pain in periodontal and dental implant surgery can vary between
      mild to severe 12,13 and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) can be adverse at times.14
      There is evidence that straightforward implant placement procedure is a surgical procedure
      associated with relatively low postoperative pain and pain management following dental
      implants is usually achieved by the use of drugs such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or
      opioids.11,15 Pre-emptive analgesia refers to the reduction of pain severity that occurs
      post-operatively by suppressing pain pre-emptively prior to the performance of the surgical
      procedure.16,17 Previous studies have shown the rationale and efficacy of using pre-emptive
      analgesia in periodontal and oral surgical models.18-25 Long acting local anesthetics such as
      bupivacaine have been shown to prolong the onset of and suppress postoperative pain better
      than lidocaine, an intermediate duration anesthetic.26,27 With successful pre-emptive
      analgesia including NSAIDs and long acting local anesthetics, the need for stronger
      post-operative analgesics, like opioids, may be significantly decreased.
