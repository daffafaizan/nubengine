    
      In the first phase the Study Objectives are to:

        -  Define the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) for administration
           of cordycepin as a 1-hour IV infusion, administered 1 hour following administration of
           an IV bolus of pentostatin, in subjects with refractory TdT-positive leukemia;

        -  Determine plasma ADA levels prior to pentostatin infusion and at 60 and 120 minutes
           after administration of pentostatin;

        -  Determine the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of cordycepin given 1 hour
           after a fixed dose of pentostatin;

        -  Assess cordycepin pharmacodynamics by measurement of blast cell apoptosis from
           peripheral blood smears;

        -  Measure and quantitate any clinical responses in refractory TdT-positive leukemia
           patients following cordycepin/pentostatin administration.

      In the second phase, the Study Objectives are to assess the safety, PK, and clinical outcomes
      of cordycepin in combination with pentostatin, at the RD, in a 20 subject cohort
