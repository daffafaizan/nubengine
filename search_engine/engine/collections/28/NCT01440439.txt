    
      A1: At the first appointment, potential participants will be screened regarding the inclusion
      criteria, and if eligible to take part the study information sheet will be discussed with
      them in detail. Written, informed consent will be obtained if participants are willing to
      take part in the study. Participants will be given advice and support from this point in
      order to optimise basal insulin therapy using their usual basal insulin.

      A2: Following a period of at least 3 weeks from recruitment into the study, participants will
      have their maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 MAX - a measure of capacity for physical exercise)
      assessed.

      A3: After at least 4 weeks following recruitment , to allow time for optimisation of basal
      insulin therapy, and at least one week following A2, the participant's metabolism will then
      be assessed during and after 60 minutes of exercise at 50% VO2 MAX. Participants will be
      fitted with a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) to monitor glucose levels for the
      24 hours after exercise finishes.

      A4: At least 24 hours and no more than 7 days after A3 the participant will switched to using
      the other trial insulin for basal insulin therapy. Again, participants will be provided with
      advice and support in order to optimise treatment.

      A5: At least 4 weeks following A4, the participant's metabolism will once again be assessed
      during and after 60 minutes of exercise at 50% VO2 MAX. Participants will again be fitted
      with CGMS to monitor glucose levels for the 24 hours after exercise finishes.

      A6: Once the 24 hours after exercise are complete, the study finishes and participants
      re-start their usual basal insulin.
