      found hypometabolism in the areas concerned (Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia,
      dementia Lewy body etc). The diagnosis is given by the clinician with a visual analysis of
      the data. Technical aids are now recommended (European recommendations) to complete the
      diagnosis with a quantitative analysis of different brain regions to a healthy brain base, to
      guide the diagnosis, in addition to visual analysis.

      The emergence of a new technology has allowed the transition from analog PET / CT to digital
      PET / CT improving spatial resolution and image contrast. Unlike analog PET / CT that uses
      photomultipliers to detect light, digital PET / CT uses the digital photon counting technique
      to directly convert light into a digital signal and each crystal is connected to a single
      detector.

      Different software, used in clinical routine, gives access to a quantified analysis of
      different areas of the brain. However, these programs have been made with healthy subjects of
      reduced strength (for example, the Neuro Q Â® software database is based on 29 healthy
      patients), with no specific age and thanks to analog PET / CT ( old generation). There is
      therefore a low specificity in terms of detection of degenerative pathologies, this being
      explained by a decrease in cerebral metabolism with age 9, mainly at the level of the
      anterior areas 10 (frontal lobe, temporopolar areas, insular areas, cortex anterior
      cingulate).
