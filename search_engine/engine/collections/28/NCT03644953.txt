      combination treatment termed hydroxyurea and transfusion (HAT). The primary objective of the
      study is to determine the feasibility of HAT for patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA)
      currently being treated only with simple transfusions for stroke prevention. Secondary
      objectives include: to evaluate the safety of HAT and to determine if HAT decreases
      transfusion requirements in this patient population. Exploratory objectives include: to
      evaluate with HAT changes in pre-transfusion laboratories and biomarkers of cerebrovascular
      disease progression, and to describe changes on brain imaging.
