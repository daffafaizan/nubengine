      Primary

      * Assess the response rate in patients with newly diagnosed active multiple myeloma treated
      with lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. OUTLINE:
           Patients receive oral lenalidomide on days 1-21, oral cyclophosphamide on days 1, 8, and
           15, and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
           4-12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.
