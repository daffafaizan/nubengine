      (seroprevalence 38% (GÃ©rardin et al., 2013)) in a developed but previously non-immunized
      country, providing an unique opportunity for studying Chikungunya-related joint symptoms and
      their long-term evolution. In a previous study, the investigators demonstrated that at least
      17/73 patients initially classified as Chikungunya-related inflammatory joint diseases after
      40 months still suffered from inflammatory joint symptoms fullfilling validated
      classification criteria after 13 years (Guillot et al., 2020). However, in this monocentric
      study, the investigators did not consider the full spectrum of Chikungunya-related rheumatic
      diseases, the population was not fully representative and the sample size was not sufficient
      to perform statistical analyses nor identify poor prognosis markers. In the RHUMATOCHIK
      cohort study, 307 patients were evaluated by 4 rheumatologists 2 months after the infection,
      83% and 43% reported persistent joint pain and joint swelling respectively after 32 months in
      potentially biased telephone interviews (Bouquillard et al., 2018).

      In this context, the present study aims at performing a systematic clinical rheumatologic
      re-evaluation of the RHUMATOCHIK patients after 15 years, in order to precisely describe and
      classify the full spectrum of persistent Chikungunya-related joint diseases in a larger
      population.

      After a telephone interview and screening questionnaire, these patients will be clinically
      re-evaluated by a second rheumatologist in a multicenter transversal follow-up study.
