      This study is primarily a pilot and feasibility trial, aiming to evaluate if sentinel node
      biopsy has a satisfactory detection rate and negative predictive value in certain groups of
      vulvar cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      The study is planned as a prospective, multi-center cohort study in Sweden. Since 2017, the
      treatment of vulvar cancer patients has been accredited to four tertiary referral university
      hospitals in Sweden; the Sahlgrenska University hospital in Gothenburg, the Linköping
      University hospital, the Skåne University hospital in Lund and the Karolinska University
      hospital in Stockholm.

      Eligible patients will undergo a sentinel node biopsy additionally to their radical
      inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy and detection rate and negative predictive value for the
      sentinel procedure will be calculated. The study will consist of four patient groups:
      Patients with squamous cell vulvar cancer and:

        1. primary tumors ≥4cm

        2. primary multifocal tumors

        3. local recurrence, earlier no treatment of the groins or only sentinel node biopsy

        4. local recurrence, earlier treatment of the groins with radiotherapy / inguinofemoral
           lymphadenectomy

      It is estimated to include 20-30 patients in each study group during a time frame of about 24
      months.

      RESULTS:

      Results are to be expected in the end of 2021.
