      administered intravenous piggyback (IVPB) in 50ml 0.9% normal saline over 15 minutes on days
      1-5 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 administered intravenously in 500 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride over
      2 hours on days 1-5.

      On day 6, patients will receive a single dose of GO 3mg/m2 (maximum dose 4.5mg). Patients
      will be pre-medicated 1 hour prior to the GO infusion with diphenhydramine 50mg administered
      orally or intravenously, acetaminophen 650 mg administered orally or intravenously and 1mg/kg
      methylprednisolone or an equivalent dose of alternative corticosteroid administered IV within
      30 minutes prior to infusion of GO. GO will be administered intravenously in 50 ml (or other
      suitable volume resulting in a final GO concentration between 0.075 mg/mL to 0.234 mg/mL) of
      0.9% sodium chloride over 2 hours. Doses of GO will be based on BSA calculated using actual
      body weight with a cap of 4.5mg. Vital signs will be recorded within one hour prior to the
      infusion and then every 30 minutes during the infusion and 30 minutes and one hour after
      completion of infusion. An additional dose of methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV may be given for
      any sign of infusion reaction, such as fever, chills, hypotension, or dyspnea occurring
      during the GO infusion or within 4 hours after the GO infusion.

      For dose modifications based on kidney and liver function please see the treatment schema at
      the end of the study.

      Supportive care including blood product transfusions, antiemetic medications, antiviral and
      antifungal medications, growth factor support, tumor lysis syndrome prophylaxis, or empiric
      antibiotics may be used at the clinical discretion of the provider.
