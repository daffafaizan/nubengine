      which is naturally involved in the homeostasis of blood and immune cells. In cancer, CXCL12
      acts as a communication bridge between tumor cells and their environment. In particular, it
      confers resistance to checkpoint inhibitors through T-cell exclusion in preclinical models.
      The hypothesis is that inactivation of CXCL12 by olaptesed pegol induces changes in the tumor
      microenvironment of patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer which render the tumors
      more susceptible to immuno-oncological approaches such as checkpoint inhibition.
