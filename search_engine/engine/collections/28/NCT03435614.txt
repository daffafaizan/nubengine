        1. To identify specific signs and symptoms of OIWS in mechanically ventilated adult
           intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving at least 72 hours of regular opioids at the
           Montreal General Hospital (MGH) and the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) from February to
           October 2018.

        2. To determine if a change in serum cortisol is associated with the presence of OIWS.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Considering our first objective is purely descriptive, no hypothesis can be stated.

        2. OIWS is associated with an increase in serum cortisol.

      Methods:

      A prospective multicentre observational study will be carried out in two
      university-affiliated hospital ICUs (Montreal General Hospital and Royal Victoria Hospital).
      All mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients receiving regular (continuous or intermittent)
      opioids for more than 72 hours will be prospectively screened daily for withdrawal symptoms
      once the opioid dose is reduced by 10% or more. From that moment, daily evaluation by a
      physician using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) criteria
      for opioid withdrawal will be conducted. Concomitantly, signs and symptoms of withdrawal will
      be collected by an investigator blinded to the DSM-5 assessment. These assessments will
      continue daily until the patient is transferred out of ICU or a maximum of 14 days and will
      be repeated once more between day 1 and day 4 post-transfer out of ICU.

      A serum cortisol will be drawn on the first day of dose reduction by 10% or more (baseline)
      and will be repeated either after 72 hours or upon patient discharge from the ICU, whichever
      one occurs first.
