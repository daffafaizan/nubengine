      immediately after birth. This significant fluid loss is related to proportionally large
      extracellular pool of fluids, the immaturity of the skin barrier, and the relatively large
      surface area exposed to evaporation. Water depletion in this population is associated with
      development of significant electrolyte imbalance in the form of hypernatremia, hyperkalemia,
      hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. In order to compensate for these losses, clinicians have
      to progressively increase fluid intake. Excessive fluid intake in the first days of life is
      associated with worsening patent ductus artriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality. Also skin integrity is important to protect
      against skin infection and secondary sepsis. Based on recent studies and relevant data, the
      risk of sepsis in ELBW is up to 40% nationwide, but only about 25% at GWUH Water application
      is a benign treatment that is routinely applied to the skin of premature babies and was shown
      to decrease skin colonization. The current practice at GWUH is to clean the bodies of
      premature infants using a piece of damp cloth with warm water. This is performed at birth and
      consequently every other days. The study group will receive more frequent and standardized
      applications. The investigators hypothesize that application of sterile water in ELBW infants
      is associated with decreased fluid requirements in the first week of life. As a secondary
      outcome, the investigators hypothesize that sterile water application is associated with
      improved skin integrity, decreased incidence of BPD with no increased incidence of skin or
      systemic infections.
