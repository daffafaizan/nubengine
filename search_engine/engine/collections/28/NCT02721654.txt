    
      Fluid resuscitation is a fundamental component of the management of acutely and critically
      ill patients and the choice of fluid is a longstanding issue of debate.

      Worldwide, 0.9% saline has traditionally been the most widely used resuscitation fluid,
      however its use is increasingly challenged by emerging evidence that suggests its high
      chloride content may have clinically important adverse effects and that resuscitation with
      so-called "balanced" or "buffered" crystalloids (such as Plasma-Lyte 148®) offer patients
      better outcomes.

      Given the limitations of current evidence, there is now a scientific, ethical and health
      economic imperative to provide an accurate and reliable estimate of the comparative risks
      versus benefit of Plasma-Lyte 148® versus 0.9% saline.

      The PLUS study is a prospective, multi-centre, parallel group, concealed, blinded,
      randomised, controlled trial.

      The study will test the hypothesis that in a heterogeneous population of critically ill
      adults, random assignment to Plasma-Lyte 148® for intravascular volume resuscitation and
      crystalloid fluid therapy in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) results in different 90-day
      all-cause mortality when compared with random assignment to 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) for
      the same treatment.

      Each patient who meets all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomised to
      receive either Plasma-Lyte 148® or 0.9% saline for all resuscitation episodes and for all
      compatible crystalloid therapy while in ICU for up to 90 days after randomisation. Other
      crystalloid fluids may be used as carrier fluids for the infusion of any drug for which
      either Plasma-Lyte 148® or 0.9% saline is considered incompatible.The study treatments will
      be supplied in identical 1000 ml bags and treatment assignment will be concealed.

      The volume of study fluid being administered will be titrated against clinical endpoints
      determined by the treating clinicians and reviewed as clinically appropriate during the
      period of resuscitation and ICU treatment.
