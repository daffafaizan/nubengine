      completed the study. Twenty-six healthy subjects matched for age and body mass index (BMI)
      served as nondiabetic controls. All subjects were postmenopausal women with last menses at
      least 2 years. After the baseline measurements, all subjects were instructed to follow a
      weight-maintaining diet, based on ADA recommendations, and were also encouraged to walk or to
      jog at least 30 min daily. Subsequently, 28 of the diabetic subjects were randomly assigned
      to receive rosiglitazone (4 mg/day). Twenty-eight of diabetic subjects were on diet alone.
      The randomization procedure was based on a random sequence.

      All subjects had a complete clinical examination, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory
      tests at baseline and at the end of the 12th week of the study. Laboratory investigations
      included assessment of: (i) glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and insulin
      levels, and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index (22); (ii) serum bsALP and active human
      osteocalcin concentration (OCL) as markers of bone formation; (iii) urine deoxypyridinoline
      (DPD) as marker of bone resorption. Other non-specific bone markers including serum total ALP
      activity, urinary calcium (Ca) and phosphate (PO4) concentrations were also measured. Urine
      concentrations of DPD (nmol/L), Ca and PO4 (both in mmol/L) were corrected for their
      respective urine creatinine (Cr) concentrations in mmol/L (Urine DPD/Cr, Urine Ca/Cr and
      Urine PO4/Cr respectively). In addition, fasting blood samples were analyzed for plasma
      cytokine levels including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, and for haptoglobin levels.
