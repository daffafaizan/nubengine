           predicting anastomotic leakage in the early postoperative period in patients who have
           undergone anastomosis following resection for non-metastatic colorectal cancer, and
           their superiority to each other.

        -  Investigate the effectiveness of these laboratory parameters in developing anastomotic
           leaks according to tumor location and different age subgroups (<45 years, 45-65 years,>
           65 years).
