      daily, tablets over a 2 year period in HIV infected adults.

      The study is a randomised, multi-centre, 2 year study of two dual NRTI, once daily tablets in
      subjects with HIV, currently taking two individual NRTIs as part of their therapy. 350
      subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either:

        1. tenofovir (TDF) 300mg + emtricitabine (FTC) 200mg OR

        2. abacavir (ABC) 600mg + lamivudine (3TC) 300mg. Subjects will cease their current
           individual NRTI treatment, commence their randomised dual NRTI tablet, and continue on
           their current NNRTI or PI therapy.

      Subjects will be stratified by the type of NRTI they are currently taking (ABC, TDF or
      other); whether they are currently taking a protease inhibitor (yes or no); and by the site
      where they are randomised. A study plan is enclosed

      Subjects will be closely monitored (at 1 month and then every 3 months until week 96) for
      safety by evaluating the incidence and severity of adverse effects/abnormal laboratory
      parameters. Study investigations enclosed. It is optional whether subjects also provide
      plasma, serum and cells (PBMCs) for storage. These samples will be available for analysis for
      sub-studies agreed to through the IVRN expression of interest network.
