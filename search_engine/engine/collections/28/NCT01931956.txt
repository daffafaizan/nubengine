      continued data collection on the use of Abbott Vascular's MitraClip System (MitraClip®
      Device) under more "real world" conditions. After the completion of enrollment in the pivotal
      EVEREST II Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) NCT00209274 and EVEREST II High Risk Registry
      Study NCT01940120, continued access to the technology was warranted to collect additional
      safety and effectiveness data on the MitraClip® Device. This continued access study was
      approved by FDA on November 21, 2008 (G030064). There are two arms (High Risk and Non-High
      Risk) in the REALISM study. Patients that did not meet REALISM High Risk or Non-High Risk
      eligibility criteria were evaluated for consideration for either Emergency Use (EU) or
      Compassionate Use (CU). Enrollment in the Non-High Risk arm of the study concluded on April
      14, 2011 and enrollment in the High Risk arm concluded on December 19, 2013.

      REALISM is a prospective, multi-center, study of the safety and effectiveness of an
      endovascular approach to the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation using the Evalve
      Cardiovascular Valve Repair System (MitraClip® implant). Patients with moderate-to-severe
      (3+) or severe (4+) mitral regurgitation (MR), as determined by the site from a transthoracic
      echocardiogram (TTE), were considered for enrollment in this study. The TTE and a
      transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) are used to assess eligibility criteria for MR severity,
      valve anatomy and left ventricular parameters.
