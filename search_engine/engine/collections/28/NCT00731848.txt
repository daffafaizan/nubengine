    
      This study is an open-label extension to the double-blind GUP-0205-1 and double-blind
      extension GUP-0205-1XX studies. Eligible male subjects, i.e.,men who had rising PSA levels
      following primary therapy for localized prostate cancer, were previously assigned to the
      placebo group in the double-blind study or the double-blind extension and were diagnosed with
      disease progression while on placebo treatment. Upon satisfying all entry criteria, the
      subjects will receive open-label pomegranate extract for up to 48 months in the absence of
      further disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
