      childhood behavioral and emotional wellbeing. Recent studies found that adults using
      computer-assisted feedback-learning paradigms, referred to as Cognitive Bias Modification for
      Interpretation (CBM-I), experienced significant reductions in levels of social anxiety, trait
      anxiety, and depression. Our goal is to identify patients with prenatal anxiety and evaluate
      the effects of CBM-I on symptoms of prenatal anxiety and patient satisfaction with the labor
      and delivery experience.
