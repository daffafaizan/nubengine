    
      Hypothesis:

      The investigators hypothesize that examination of genome-wide association study (GWAS)
      findings will enable the investigators to provide pharmacogenomic insights into clinically
      observed - and, with this study, quantified - differences in propofol requirements for loss
      of consciousness (LOC) and apnea in children. It is further hypothesized that the
      distribution of allelic variants in these pharmacogenes may differ between children of
      different genomic ancestry.

      Objectives:

      Primary: (i) To describe and quantify doses of propofol required to produce loss of
      consciousness and apnea in children of differing ages, sex and self-identified countries of
      origin. (ii) To identify genomic associations that may explain variability, and generate
      hypotheses for further study. (iii) To identify genomic ancestry and examine how pharmacogene
      allele variants that may explain the findings of (i) above are distributed across genomic
      ancestries.

      Secondary: To examine the correlation between self-identified countries of family origin and
      genomic ancestry.

      Methods:

      Prospective, non-randomized, single cohort study of two pharmacodynamic endpoints (loss of
      consciousness and apnea), in children requiring propofol anesthesia, with subsequent
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) and principal component analysis (PCA) to examine,
      respectively, pharmacogenomic explanations for pharmacodynamic variability and genomic
      ancestry.
