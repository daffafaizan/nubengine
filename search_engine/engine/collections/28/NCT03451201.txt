      without known complications were randomized into 3 groups: HIIT n=12; MCT n=12 and a
      sedentary control group (CON) n=12. Total sample size was calculated to a power of 80% alha
      0.05 and a difference in mean FMD of 2%. Before randomisation, flow mediated dilation (FMD)
      and maximal exercise capacity (VO2 peak)is determined. Block Randomisation based on FMD rank
      values are done to equalize baseline FMD. Exercise sessions are performed in cycle ergometers
      during 40 minutes, 3 times a week, along 8 weeks. HIIT protocol, intensity vary from 50 to
      85% of the maximum heart rate (HRmax), while in MCT, HR remained stable at 50% HRmax.
      Endothelial function was measured by flow mediated dilation (FMD) for endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation (EDVD) and smooth-muscle function was measured by nitroglycerine mediated
      dilation (endothelium independent vascular dilation) - (EIVD). Peak oxygen consumption
      (VO2peak) and oxidative stress markers were determined before and after the training period.
      ED was defined as an increase of less than 8% in vascular diameter after cuff release.
