      structure and function of the brain. Further, the investigators will determine which is the
      key driver of recovery of arm function after stroke: changes in the structure of the brain or
      changes in how brain regions interact with one another. Together, these data will advance the
      investigators understanding of how neural systems support recovery from stroke. The
      investigators will use a MRI technique that allows us to assess the health of a brain
      structure called myelin. This structure is important as it allows information to travel down
      nerves faster; the more myelin the quicker the signal can be conducted. The investigators aim
      is to test whether or not movement training can restore myelin in the brain. If movement
      training does restore myelin in the brain, the investigators will have identified an
      important new target for rehabilitation interventions.
