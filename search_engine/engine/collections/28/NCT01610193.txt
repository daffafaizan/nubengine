      performed and the sample size re-calculated based on the actual and precise data collected.
      At interim analysis, the external data monitoring committee will decide upon the continuation
      or discontinuation of the trial, as well the potential need to modify the sample size. If any
      changes are suggested by the external data monitoring committee, the principal investigators
      will decide on the feasibility of the potential changes and submit a formal addendum to the
      ethics committee. No changes will be made to the protocol or study design unless first
      approved by the ethics committee. Any changes to the protocol approved by the ethics
      committee will be updated at clinicaltrials.gov
