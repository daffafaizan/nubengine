      groups of equal size being followed. This is a multi-center, controlled study, with the
      reference drug being the intravitreal implant of 700μg of dexamethasone (Ozurdex®) compared
      to subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone (Kénacort retard®). This is an open,
      prospective, randomized study. It is not possible, for technical reasons, to inject blind two
      products with different injection routes and that are visible to the investigator during
      control examinations (sub-conjunctival crystals and intravitreal implant). However, the
      assessment of visual acuity and central macular thickness will be performed by an uninformed
      ophthalmologist.
