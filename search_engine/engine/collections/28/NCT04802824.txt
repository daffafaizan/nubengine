    
      24 evaluable patients with radiological and/or histological evidence of mRCC and due to
      receive systemic therapy will be enrolled. The patients invited to participate in the study
      will provide written informed consent. Patients will only undergo [18F]FPIA positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging once they have satisfied the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Once these have been satisfied, eligible patients will proceed to
      [18F]FPIA PET/CT. Patients will have three imaging visits at baseline, 4-6 weeks and 12 weeks
      post the commencement of treatment. Patients will have been treated as per standard of care,
      which may have included TKI's, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or combinations of these. Data
      will be considered complete when patients have all three analysable scans. In the event of
      dropout, additional subjects will be recruited to reach a total number of 24 evaluable
      subjects.

      On each day of imaging the patients will have a blood test and a urine sample collected to
      measure concentrations of carnitine. For each scan, a single dose of [18F]FPIA (maximum 370
      MBq) IV will be administered to the participant. The participant will then rest in a quiet
      place for an uptake period and undergo whole body PET/CT scanning from 60 minutes.

      Archival tumour biopsies (primary or metastatic lesion), taken within 3 months of the 1st
      [18F]FPIA PET/CT scan will be retrieved for analysis where possible.
