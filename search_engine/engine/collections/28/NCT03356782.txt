      multimodal therapy. Therefore, novel curative approaches are needed.This study will combine
      two different ways to fight sarcoma: antibodies and CAR-T cells. Several immune checkpoint
      antibodies have been examined on various tumors with good outcomes. Sarcoma is known to
      express increased levels of surface antigens that can be targeted by CAR-T cells. Thus, in
      this study, the 4SCAR-IgT cells targeting sarcoma surface antigens will be infused in dose
      escalation cohorts.This study will assess the feasibility, safety, efficacy and side effects
      of CAR T cells immunotherapy in patients who have sarcoma that is relapsed or late staged.
