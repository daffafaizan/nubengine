      criteria. Patients are included if they have stable sinus rhythm (heart rate <75 bpm for dual
      source CT and <65 bpm for 64-slice CT). Informed signed consent is obtained from these
      patients and the CT scan is prepared. After topogram scan and the native scan for Ca-Scoring,
      patients are randomized in two groups with the use of sealed envelopes. After that
      contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography is performed with the standard spiral protocol or
      with the sequential protocol.

      The CT examination is evaluated by two experienced investigators on a per-vessel basis and
      all results and study-related data are collected in a dedicated database. For assessment of
      image quality, a previously established 4-point score system is used and quantitative image
      quality parameters are measured.

      A 30 day follow-up after the CT examination aims to evaluate if patients underwent invasive
      coronary angiography or were scheduled for a myocardial stress / perfusion test (such as
      stress-echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy or stress perfusion imaging by MRI).
