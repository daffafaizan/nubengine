    
      The purpose of this qualitative study is to understand the patient perception of QOL after
      surviving critical illness and how survivors can help illuminate gaps in current health
      policies to provide better recovery resources for this growing population.

      The central research questions are:

      RQ1: What are the issues important to preserve quality of life from the perspective of
      critical illness survivors? RQ2: How do survivors of critical illness describe rehabilitative
      services after discharge?
