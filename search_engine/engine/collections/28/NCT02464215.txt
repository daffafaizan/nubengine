      and D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of
      splenic artery (4d, 4sb), hepatoduodenal ligament, superior mesenteric vein) wiil be
      performed basically. As a general rule, Billroth I or BillrothII methods will be used for
      gastric reconstruction for all cases. For anastomosis, absorbable suture is used. Anastomotic
      diameter is 5~6 cm length. Drainage tube is inserted through the right flank area and
      additional drainage tubes can be inserted as needed.
