           disease undergoing hemodialysis.

        -  Traditional risk factors do not adequately predict cardiovascular morbidity and
           mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease.

        -  Increased oxidative stress, inflammation and impaired fibrinolysis contribute to
           cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing hemodialysis.

        -  Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system(RAAS) may contribute to oxidative
           stress and inflammation in individuals with chronic kidney disease

        -  Activation of the kallikrein-kinin system during hemodialysis may increase fibrinolysis
           but may also contribute to inflammation in chronic kidney disease

        -  Despite data from clinical trials demonstrating that ARBs and ACE inhibitors decrease
           cardiovascular mortality, delay progression to cardiovascular disease and decrease the
           incidence of diabetes in the general population little is known about the impact of
           these agents on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with end- stage renal
           disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis

        -  Angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)S
           differ in their mechanisms of action and their effects on inflammatory biomarkers
