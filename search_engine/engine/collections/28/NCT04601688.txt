    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome after intraocular injections of
      Bevacizumab or combination of Bevacizumab and Dexamethasone under pro re nata treatment
      regimen for the patients with Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) patients. Mean change of
      logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (VA), central foveal
      thickness (CFT), contrast sensitivity (CS) as well as predictive factors including
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), vision related questionnaires and various other ocular
      parameters will be assessed.
