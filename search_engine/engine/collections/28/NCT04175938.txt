      cornea that controls its clarity. Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive
      disease that affects both eyes in which the endothelium is dysfunctional, causing the cornea
      to swell and lose its clarity. Because of the vision loss associated with this swelling,
      corneal transplantation is needed for patients with advanced FECD.

      Currently, there is no method to directly measure how well endothelium cells are functioning
      in patients with FECD. Such a measurement, if it were possible, would allow physicians to
      identify patients who are at a higher risk of corneal swelling. The goal of this study is to
      establish a tool to measure and compare the amounts of corneal swelling between normal and
      FECD patients after a stress test is performed (the wearing of an FDA-approved contact lens.)
      Data will also be collected regarding how quickly and how well a cornea recovers from
      swelling in patients with healthy eyes compared to those with FECD.
