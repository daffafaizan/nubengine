      epidemiology plays a voluble role in managing infections empirically within the hospital
      setting. Antibiograms can serve as a critical tool in optimizing empiric antimicrobial
      decisions. Refining antibiogram data to specific populations such as SOT patients may allow
      for timelier and appropriate empiric use of antimicrobials, and improve clinical outcomes.

      Time to appropriate therapy (antimicrobial testing susceptible in vitro to the pathogen
      identified) is of vital importance in management of serious infections. SOT may have
      different resistance rates at Methodist Dallas Medical Center making the applicability of the
      yearly hospital-wide antibiogram unknown for use in this specialized patient population. A
      SOT-Specific antibiogram may highlight common resistance patterns identified in pathogens
      seen in this patient population. Additionally, this investigation may further emphasize the
      importance of antimicrobial stewardship activities such as: appropriate empiric antibacterial
      decisions, de-escalation, and effective durations of therapy.
