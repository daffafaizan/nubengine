    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the general safety of efalizumab in patients with cutaneous graft-vs-host disease
           (GVHD).

        -  Study the feasibility of digital imaging to objectively quantify cutaneous GVHD.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of serial skin biopsies to monitor disease response to
           efalizumab in patients with cutaneous GVHD.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the overall complete response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Assess the overall cutaneous response rate (complete cutaneous response rate and partial
           cutaneous response rate) in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Assess the overall hepatic response rate (complete hepatic response rate and partial
           hepatic response rate) in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Assess the duration of any responses observed.

        -  Assess the effect of this drug on overall patient survival.

        -  Use the preliminary efficacy and toxicity data collected in this small exploratory study
           to decide on the appropriateness of a larger, subsequent phase II trial to more formally
           assess toxicity and efficacy of this drug in this patient population.

        -  Collect pharmacokinetic data on this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive efalizumab subcutaneously once weekly for 8 weeks (total of 8
      doses).

      Digital photographs of body regions are taken for determination of disease involved body
      surface area. Skin biopsies are obtained before and after treatment and analyzed for
      lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1),
      cluster of differentiation 4, 8, and possibly 20 (CD4, CD8, CD20) by immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 and 9 weeks.
