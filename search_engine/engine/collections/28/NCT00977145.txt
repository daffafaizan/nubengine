      patients with advanced measurable disease. This provides proof-of-principle of the potential
      for clinical benefit with melanoma vaccines however, the current response rate is low. Thus,
      there is a critical need for additional new therapies for melanoma, both for adjuvant therapy
      of high-risk resected melanoma and for therapy of patients who are not candidates for, or
      fail, other therapies in the setting of advanced disease.

      It is generally agreed that one mechanism to improve the immunologic outcomes of vaccine
      therapy is to optimize T cell trafficking to the tumor site. CXCR3 is the chemokine receptor
      on T cells which directs them to sites of inflammation by following the chemokine gradient.
      The ligands for CXCR3 (CXCL9 (MIG), CXCL10 (IP-10) and CXCL11 (I-TAC)) are known to be
      induced by interferon gamma. This protocol proposes administering a peptide vaccine to
      activate tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells expressing CXCR3, followed by intratumoral
      interferon gamma to increase CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9-11) at the tumor site and recruit the
      CXCR3+ T cells.

      The primary goals of the proposed work are to assess the safety of the combination of peptide
      vaccine and intratumoral interferon gamma and to assess the immunologic outcomes at the tumor
      site.
