      radiation alone and has become standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Response
      assessment in GBM is difficult as a result of the frequent occurrence of early imaging
      changes indistinguishable from tumor progression, termed pseudoprogression. The majority of
      patients remain clinically stable. It is often unclear whether current therapy should be
      maintained or second-line therapy initiated. The incidence of pseudoprogression after
      concurrent chemoradiation is15%to 30%. A potential mechanism of pseudoprogression is that
      radiation-induced vascular changes may lead to focal transient increase in gadolinium
      enhancement. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging provides a noninvasive means for
      quantifying tumor vascular properties.
