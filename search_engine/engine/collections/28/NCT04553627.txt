      non-invasive fat reduction of the medial infragluteal folds on a small group of subjects.
      This is a feasibility study to determine if cryolipolysis in this area produces a desirable
      lifted appearance to the buttocks. Typically, a lifted more youthful appearance is obtained
      through surgical means. Study participants will be recruited from the population of patients
      who have suitable, treatable subcutaneous fat on the medial infragluteal folds and desire a
      lifted appearance. Subjects will receive treatments with a cooled cup cryolipolysis
      applicator from the CoolAdvantage family of applicators (cooled cup vacuum applicator).
      Treatments will be performed with a treatment temperature of - 11Â°C for up to 35 minutes.
      Subjects will complete all study-required follow-up visits, including an 8-week follow-up
      which may include a second treatment session, as well as a 12-week post final treatment
      follow-up visit.
