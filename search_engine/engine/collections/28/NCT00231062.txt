      people around the world. Patients suffer from headache, facial discomfort, nasal congestion,
      nasal drainage, loss of the sense of smell and malaise. Sinusitis is responsible for major
      healthcare expenditure and loss of workplace productivity.

      The rationale of this study is to collect data on the effectiveness and safety of balloon
      dilation of the Frontal, Maxillary and Sphenoid sinuses by treating patients and observing
      them for a six month period of time following the procedure. Six month follow-up data is
      important to demonstrate the effectiveness of balloon catheter dilation.
