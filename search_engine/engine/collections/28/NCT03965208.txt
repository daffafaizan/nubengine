      bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin in a 1:1 fashion. There will be 17 patients in each
      group for a total of 34 patients.

      Unfractionated heparin binds to antithrombin thereby causing an anticoagulant effect while
      bivalirudin binds directly to thrombin. Use of unfractionated heparin in this population is
      problematic due to reliance on adequate levels of circulating antithrombin, complex
      pharmacokinetics, and variable clearance. Bivalirudin avoids many of these difficulties.
