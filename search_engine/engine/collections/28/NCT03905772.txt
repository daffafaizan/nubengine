    
      A controlled randomized controlled trial will be carried out by university students, divided
      equally into four groups: control group (GC), long responding pulse group (PLR),
      non-responder long pulse group (PLNR) and pulsed current group (CP) after the acute fase of
      the protocol. Muscular architecture (muscle thickness, pennation angle and fascicle length)
      of the muscles composing the sural triceps, H-reflex and M-wave tests (central and peripheral
      contribution), electromyographic signals of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles and
      sole, voluntary and evoked joint torque of the muscles composing the sural triceps and level
      of sensorial discomfort. The independent intervention with the neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation and the isometric exercises performed by the control group will be considered as
      an independent variable. All groups will have the dependent variables evaluated 6 times,
      before, during and after the intervention, which will consist of 24 sessions (8 weeks). The
      training with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) will be performed 3 times a week
      and will never be applied for two consecutive days, as well as the voluntary exercises
      performed by the control group.
