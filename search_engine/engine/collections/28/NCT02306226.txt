    
      The SAVI TF is s single arm, multicenter, non-randomized and open registry. The purpose of
      this registry is to collect and monitor ongoing safety and performance data from commercial
      use of the ACURATE neo™ Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Delivery System.

      The ACURATE neo™ and its Transfemoral Delivery System are intended for use in minimally
      invasive, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using transfemoral access in patients
      presenting with severe aortic valve stenosis.

      The primary objective is to further evaluate the safety and performance of the ACURATE neo™
      Aortic Bioprosthesis and ACURATE TF™ Transfemoral Delivery System in the first 1000
      consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis treated with the newly marketed device.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate adverse events and device performance of the newly
      marketed device.
