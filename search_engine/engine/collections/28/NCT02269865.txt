      we anticipate full recruitment of 8-17 year old subjects with DM1. The genetic counselor will
      help recruit 20 DM1 subjects, and 20 comparably aged controls, all of whom will complete MRI
      and neuropsychological tests. We anticipate full participation in evoked potential and blood
      tests, but estimate 30% will permit a lumbar puncture for CSF evaluation - done at the LPCH
      Ambulatory Procedure Unit with sedation as necessary. In total 40 MRIs will be done over 2
      years, or 20 annually. Testing of Subjects

      All neuropsychological evaluations will be performed in the morning in attempt to standardize
      wakefulness and stamina. Dr. Day's assessment of clinical status (~45 min) utilizes the
      Stanford myotonic dystrophy questionnaire, the University of Rochester MDHI, and the muscular
      impairment rating scale (MIRS)57, and records vital signs, current medications, spirometer,
      and disease history and progression. Given the frequency of sleep disorders in DM, subjects
      will complete the Affiliated Sleep Questionnaire, an online collection of extensive
      information in standardized format (see letter Dr. Mignot). After the clinical and
      neuropsychological assessments the subject and family members will have lunch prior to the
      MRI(75 min). In the mid-afternoon subjects will have evoked potentials in the
      Electrodiagnostics Lab(~90 min) followed by a lumbar puncture (if consenting) and blood draw
      in the LPCH APU(90 min). Subjects return home the same day, and Ms. Paulose contacts them
      several days later for feedback.
