      in the treatment of social phobia and, in so doing suggest a common mechanism of action for
      all brief psychosocial interventions. Perceived self-efficacy of social behavior, negative
      cognitive appraisal (estimated social costs), and perceived emotional control will be
      considered as potential mediators; avoidant personality disorder and the generalized subtype
      of social phobia will be considered as potential predictors for poor treatment outcome.

      Social phobia is a very prevalent and debilitating disorder, with public speaking anxiety
      being the most common fear among socially phobic individuals. Although there are a number of
      effective psychosocial treatments for social phobia (e.g., cognitive-behavioral treatments
      and exposure therapy) very little is known about the underlying mechanism of therapeutic
      change (i.e., the mediators of change), and the variables that are predictive of treatment
      outcome (i.e., the moderators of change). Furthermore, it is unclear why treating individuals
      for their public speaking anxiety can generalize to other untreated social fears.

      Patients are randomly assigned to either a comprehensive cognitive-behavioral treatment for
      social phobia (n=43), a performance-based exposure treatment for public speaking anxiety
      without cognitive intervention (n=43), or a waitlist control group (n=43). Clinician ratings,
      behavioral tests, cognitive assessments, subjective ratings, and physiological measures are
      employed to determine the degree of therapeutic gains in various social phobia domains. The
      main hypothesis is that perceived emotional control will mediate treatment outcome and
      generality of effectiveness independent of the specific treatment condition.
