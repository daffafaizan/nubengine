      sequence animation videos (RSAV) are of use as an additional learning resource for the
      elective pre-operative patient. The investigators aimed to do this by comparing the change in
      knowledge and anxiety from baseline to immediately preoperatively. Patients were block
      randomised to either the normal patient pathway or to receive the educational video as an
      additional preoperative learning resource.

      Patients over 18 years of age electively listed for lower segment caesarean section (LSCS)
      and transobturator / transvaginal tape (TVT/TOT) were included.

      Two RSAV were created explaining LSCS and TVT/TOT. Participants were block-randomised in
      groups of 10 to either control (no video) or intervention (video). Two questionnaires
      assessing anxiety were completed at baseline and immediately preoperatively using a Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) and a State- Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Patient knowledge was
      assessed using a custom questionnaire. Primary outcome measures were the change in knowledge
      and anxiety scores.
