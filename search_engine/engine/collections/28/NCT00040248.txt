      treatment to methotrexate in maintaining remission that has been induced by cyclophosphamide
      and glucocorticoids in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. In this study, all patients
      will initially receive daily cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids and then at disease
      remission, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued and patients will receive methotrexate for
      remission maintenance. Following the switch to methotrexate and when the prednisone dose has
      been tapered to 20mg QOD (plus or minus 10mg QOD), patients in remission will be randomized
      to receive daclizumab or not receive daclizumab. Those randomized to receive daclizumab will
      be treated with 1 mg/kg intravenously on day 0, week 2, week 4 and every month thereafter for
      a total of 18 months (20 doses). Regardless to which arm the patient is randomized, they will
      continue to receive methotrexate. Two years after the methotrexate was started, if the
      patient remains in remission, this will be tapered and discontinued. Patients will be
      prospectively monitored for evidence of disease relapse and drug toxicity. Specific
      parameters that will be obtained include the time to disease remission, the rate and time of
      disease relapse, and the incidence of drug-related adverse events.
