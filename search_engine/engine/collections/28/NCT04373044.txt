      I. To determine the efficacy of baricitinib combined with antiviral therapy in participants
      with COVID-19-related moderate and severe disease in terms of reduction of the proportion of
      participants requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or dying or requiring anti-IL6
      monoclonal antibodies compared to that seen with antiviral alone within 60 days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the clinical findings in a cohort of symptomatic COVID-19-infected
      participants.

      II. To test whether cytokine signatures predict progression to invasive ventilatory support
      or death.

      III. To describe adverse events (AEs) associated with baricitinib when administered at 4mg in
      combination with antivirals.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the decay in quantitative viral burden from saliva samples collected sequentially
      under treatment with baricitinib in combination with antivirals.

      II. To obtain preliminary data on efficacy and tolerability of baricitinib in combination
      with antivirals in participants with cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive baricitinib orally (PO) daily, and standard of care
      hydroxychloroquine PO three times daily (TID). Treatment continues for 14 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO daily, and standard of care hydroxychloroquine PO TID.
      Treatment continues for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 60 days after enrollment to treatment.
