    
      Multicentre study with 5 treatment groups. Three groups will receive three different
      manufactured lots of GSK134612, one group will receive one lot of GSK134612 given in an
      experimental co-administration with Fluarix™, the control group will receive Mencevax™. The
      study will be conducted in a double-blind manner with respect to the 3 lots of GSK134612
      vaccine. The study will be 'open' between the groups receiving GSK134612 and the group
      receiving GSK134612 + Fluarix™ and the Mencevax™ group.

      Each subject will have 2 blood samples taken for immunogenicity analyses, one prior to
      vaccination and one taken 30 days later.
