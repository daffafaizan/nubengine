      spectrum of FPL, and to better recognize FPL in patients with Metabolic Syndrome. Similarly,
      genetic studies in these patients will not only help better characterize the
      genotype-phenotype relationship, but is also likely to help identify other genes involved in
      regulation of lipid homeostasis, as some patients may not have any of the known mutations.

      The Investigators will systematically study mitochondrial protein quality and function under
      fasting and fed state in relation to intramyocellular and circulating plasma lipid levels,
      and compare with age, sex and BMI-matched individuals. The Investigators will also study the
      rate of de-novo protein synthesis to determine if hyperinsulinemia affects both muscle
      protein anabolism and catabolism.
