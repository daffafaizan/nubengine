      and echocardiographic monitoring. In the case of treatment for breast cancer, surgery
      requiring general anesthesia may follow chemotherapy. Although a possible interaction between
      general anesthetics and anthracyclines on systolic function is only rarely mentioned, some
      cases of heart failure and / or conduction disturbances peranesth√©sique were observed in
      patients treated or previously treated with anthracyclines. The determination of
      concentration of BNP is a diagnostic tool used in the detection of heart failure and acute
      coronary syndromes. In fact, it is one of the most sensitive markers of impaired myocardial
      function, and an increase in interest rates may precede any other biological changes. In a
      patient who received anthracycline, although it remains asymptomatic elevation of NT-proBNP
      concentration may persist for some months after exposure, and that, whatever the doses
      received. The question of a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines and
      anesthetic agents arises. Given its minimally invasive nature and its diagnostic value, the
      BNP assay might thus allow to highlight a possible subclinical deficiency. To our knowledge,
      there is very little data regarding a possible synergism between cardiotoxic anthracyclines
      and anesthetic agents.
