      fibrillation regarding oesophageal complications after ablation.

      200 patients will be prospectively randomised into 2 groups. The conventional group will
      undergo RF-Ablation of atrial fibrillation using an oesophageal probe to measure the
      temperature during ablation.

      In the other group will receive ablation using fixed energy levels (25 Watt) at the posterior
      left atrial (LA) Wall without an oesophageal probe , All patients will get a gastroscopy for
      evaluation of oesophageal complications the day after the procedure.

      All patients will have a 6 months follow up (FU) in our clinic to be reevaluated for
      complications (primary endpoint) and rhythm stability. (secondary endpoint)
