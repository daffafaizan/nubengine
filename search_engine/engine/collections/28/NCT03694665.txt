      surgery. Lung mechanics and volumetric capnography will be non-invasively assessed during
      laparoscopy. Esophageal pressure will be measured by an esophageal balloon to measure
      transpulmonary pressure. A lung recruitment maneuver will be done. The optimum level of
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is defined as the PEEP level when transpulmonary
      pressure remains positive during the PEEP titration trial of the recruitment maneuver. Lung
      collapse is detected when transpulmonary pressure becomes negative. The behavior of the
      studied volumetric capnography and lung mechanics parameters will be compared with the
      reference transpulmonary pressure signal.
