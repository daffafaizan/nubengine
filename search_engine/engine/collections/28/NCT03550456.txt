      patients consulting the outpatient clinic for pediatric pulmonology suffering from dyspnoea
      while exercising.

      Besides standard diagnostics (bodyplethysmograph, spirometry, exhaled NO, skin prick test)
      subjects will take part in an exercise-challenge in a cold chamber at 2-4Â°C. Subjects showing
      symptoms of exercise-induced asthma will get a treatment with ICS/LABA for six weeks. All
      Patients should fill out a symptom diary. On suspicion of an EILO, subjects not showing
      symptoms in the first exercise-challenge in the cold chamber and all subjects without
      improvement after EIA treatment will take part in a second exercise-challenge in the cold
      chamber with continuous laryngoscopy.

      If EILO is proved by laryngoscopy, speech therapy is recommended. To investigate the symptoms
      and the quality of life of these patients, all patients and there parents should answer
      symptom and quality of life questionnaires (Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4-18), Youth
      Self-Report (YSR 11-18), Asthma Control Test, (ACT) Dyspnea Index (DI)) at every visit.

      There are yearly follow ups of these patients for five years in order to collect long-range
      prognosis.
