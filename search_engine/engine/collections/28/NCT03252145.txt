      secondary to lymphatic system damage from cancer treatments. 1 in 5 women will develop LE
      following breast cancer treatment. These women have greater restrictions in activity and
      poorer quality of life (QOL) and are more prone to cellulitis than women without LE. LE is
      incurable and progressive. Persistent lymph stasis creates a condition of chronic
      inflammation that contributes to fibrosis and fatty deposition in the subcutis of the
      affected limb. The fibro-adipose changes associated with chronic LE make it less responsive
      to treatments that primarily target limb volume. Treatments are needed that can improve these
      skin and subcutaneous tissues changes, as well as reduce limb volume.

      This 4 to 6 week randomized controlled pilot feasibility study will enroll 80 women with
      chronic arm LE, and will evaluate a novel negative pressure massage device that mobilizes
      skin and subcutaneous tissue. This negative pressure treatment provides vertical (lifting)
      and horizontal stretching of the skin and underlying fascial structures, which increases the
      subcutaneous space for lymphatic circulation, improves lymph flow, and has the potential to
      decrease fibrosis. This treatment will be compared to the standard of care massage: manual
      lymphatic drainage. Women will be randomly assigned to either the negative pressure massage
      device (intervention group), to the standard manual lymph drainage massage (control group)

      Objectives: To evaluate recruitment and retention rates; to determine rates of adverse
      events; and to determine effect sizes for limb volume, tissue induration; and patient
      reported outcomes of arm function, QOL, and body image in response to treatment
