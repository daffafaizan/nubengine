      mainly due to early progression of EGFR mutation-negative tumors after gefitinib alone. Taken
      together with the FASTACT trial results, this PFS curve crossing-over may well be averted if
      effective chemotherapy is given together with gefitinib in a most optimum timing and
      sequence. Apparently, timing of EGFR-TKI administration within chemotherapy cycles is very
      critical, as shown in OSI 9774 trial.

      In this placebo-controlled randomized phase II, Investigators propose to give gefitinib on
      days 5-18 of a 3-weekly chemotherapy cycle of pemetrexed/cisplatin to avoid any potential
      overlap of EGFR-TKI effects on chemotherapy or vice versa. Investigators would like to
      generate promising pilot data, which warrants a large phase III trial. Investigators hope to
      show that intercalated administration of IressaÂ® (gefitinib) and Pemetrexed/platinum regimen
      improves the outcome of never-smokers with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) lung adenocarcinoma.
