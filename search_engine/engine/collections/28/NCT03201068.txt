      with the last three years implicating our modern, deteriorated gut microbiota in numerous
      chronic diseases. It is likely dietary changes in the last half-century consistent with
      adoption of the Western diet have had an adverse impact on the gut microbiota. A critically
      important next step in this field of research is to identify how different probiotic
      supplements can potentially restore the microbiota in alignment with the optimization of
      human health, particularly in regard to the reversal or prevention of chronic diseases
      including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. This study is designed
      to elicit and contrast the amount of increase in microbiota diversity and related metabolic
      output achievable following consumption of a probiotic supplement commonly available to the
      general population. The results could contribute to dietary recommendations for reversing the
      chronic disease epidemics of westernization.
