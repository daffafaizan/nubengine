    
      KP-1461 is a prodrug of KP-1212 triphosphate, a unique nucleoside that is incorporated into
      the HIV viral genome resulting in an accumulation of nucleic substitutions that interfere
      with viral replication. The study is designed to investigate the safety and antiviral
      activity for 124 days in antiretroviral-experienced HIV-1-infected subjects. By inducing
      additional mutagenic events in the viral genome, viral decay accelerators such as KP-1212 may
      force the virus to exceed the threshold of nonviability.
