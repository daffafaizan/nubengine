      complicated by organ failures, especially lung injury. It is well accepted that inflammatory
      reaction is the major cause of lung injury. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is a novel Î±2-adrenoceptor
      agonist that is primarily used in surgical anesthesia and conscious-sedation. Recently,
      animal studies have shown that Dex plays an anti-inflammatory role, while it is not known
      whether Dex possesses any lung protective functions in patients with sepsis. Therefore, the
      aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Dex on lung protection in patient with
      sepsis undergoing cleaning focus of infection.
