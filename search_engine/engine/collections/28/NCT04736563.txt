      Gel with 14 essential oils for 12 weeks on knee joint pain in 45 patients suffering from
      chronic pain related to arthritis of the knee. The patients included in the study will be
      consultants from the Department of Physical Medicine, Rehabilitation and Sports Trauma at
      Foch Hospital in Suresnes and will have to present chronic pain related to arthritis of the
      knee either with or without antalgic and anti-inflammatory treatment. The evaluation of the
      puressentiel antalgic effect Joints and Muscles - Gel with 14 essential oils will be
      evaluated by an algo-functional score of WOMAC based on items of pain, joint stiffness and
      locomotor function (main criterion), a visual analog scale EVA (graduated from 1 to 10) of
      the pain by self-assessment of the patient during each visit and the number of daily antalgic
      and anti-inflammatory drugs (secondary criteria).
