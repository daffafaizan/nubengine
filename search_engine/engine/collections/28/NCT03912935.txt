    
      All patients from age 18 years old to 75 years old undergoing elective surgery under general
      anaesthesia in operating theater of University Malaya Medical Centre over a period of 15
      months, from April 2018 to June 2019 will be included and recruited based on inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.

      Those patient that fulfilled the criteria and consented for the study will be randomized to 2
      group.

      i) BUHE group: Bed up at 20-30 degree aiming alignment between the external auditory meatus
      with sternal notch.

      ii) Sniffing group: Maintaining supine position with head elevation with head rest (foam
      donut).

      Induction of anaesthesia starts with:

        -  preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3-5 min performed until end tidal oxygen of 85%
           achieved.

        -  A pre-calculated dose of induction agent is administered, followed immediately by a
           neuromuscular blocking agent.

      (IV Fentanyl 2mcg/kg,IV Propofol 2-3mg/kg,IV Rocuronium 1mg/kg).

        -  Cricoid pressure at 10 Newton is applied increasing to 30 Newton once consciousness is
           lost.

        -  After adequate neuromuscular blockade,both group patients will be intubated by one
           investigator via direct laryngoscopy using Macintosh blade size 3 or 4.

        -  Time taken from insertion of Macintosh blade into oral cavity till confirmation of
           endotracheal tube placement via detection of CO2 on the end tidal CO2 monitor will be
           recorded.
