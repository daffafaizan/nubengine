    
      This pilot study will be an observational no randomize study in which the NiNAVAped protocol
      will be applied solely to the NIV NAVA arm.

      Every PICU will have to include 3 patients in the Pilot study before starting the clinical
      trial, which means that the pilot study will involve a maximum of 60 patients.

      Should the Pilot study reveal deficiencies in the NiNAVAped design, the protocol would be
      improved accordingly.

      There will be a specific consent document during the Pilot study. The Pilot study will be
      published in a scientific journal.
