      aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Standard chemotherapy cures less than 40% of
      patients. When patients relapse, they may be eligible to receive high-dose chemotherapy with
      autologous stem cell support. Multiple studies have shown the value of high-dose
      chemotherapy, with increased disease-free survival and overall survival, when compared with
      second-line conventional chemotherapy. Unfortunately high-dose chemotherapy is curative in
      less than half the patients who receive it, and other treatment strategies are needed to
      improve the cure rate.

      Another treatment option called immunotherapy is being tested in lymphoma patients.
      Immunotherapy involves attempts to use the immune system or products of the immune system to
      fight lymphoma. For example, NHL cells have a protein called CD20 on their surface. Rituximab
      is an antibody directed against the CD20 protein, which may result in the death of the
      lymphoma cell. Patients in this study will receive Rituximab to see if it is a safe treatment
      option for NHL patients.
