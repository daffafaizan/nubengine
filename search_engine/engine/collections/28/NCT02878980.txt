      I. To assess the feasibility of recruiting and enrolling newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian
      cancer patients who have undergone debulking surgery and will be starting platinum-based
      chemotherapy, to an exercise trial.

      II. To evaluate adherence to the data collection and exercise trial protocol. It is necessary
      to determine the feasibility of collecting tablet-based questionnaire data and blood samples
      at multiple time points in one visit. It is also critical to determine whether the exercise
      intervention is feasible in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine changes in DNA repair function before and after a single exercise session.

      II. To examine changes in DNA repair function, body composition, quality of life, symptoms
      and patient satisfaction with care over the treatment time course.

      III. To examine the effect of the exercise intervention on these measurements.

      IV. To follow the patients an additional 12-months for clinical outcomes defined as death,
      cancer recurrence, or new primary cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo supervised 1-on-1 exercise sessions for 60 minutes on day
      1.Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 18 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive a home-based exercise prescription including
      instructions for keeping patients' heart rate within 50-80% maximum.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 12 months.
