      both are needed, treated separately on back to back days); incubation: 2.5 hours and blue
      light photodynamic therapy utilizing the DUSA BLU-U device; illumination: 1000 seconds (16
      min, 40 secs); administered quarterly for 3 years. Patients who change systemic
      immunosuppression regimens or add or increase systemic chemoprevention while in the study
      will be excluded from the overall analysis. The patients will be evaluated by the principal
      investigator every 3 months, prior to photodynamic therapy (PDT) administration.

      Primary endpoints include:

        1. development of non melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) lesions and

        2. assessment of actinic damage score.

      The primary endpoint will be development of new skin cancers at 3 years, based on comparison
      to rate at baseline from previous (x) year(s) using absolute slope value for number prior to
      treatment vs. number after treatment. The patients will serve as their own controls and the
      investigators will analyze the delta in development of non melanoma skin cancers and actinic
      damage score pre- and post- treatment.

      Additionally, an actinic damage score will be assigned based on the number of actinic
      keratosis on initial evaluation. At each 3 month follow up visit, the actinic damage score
      will be reassessed. The investigators will be able to secondarily analyze the delta in the
      actinic damage score on treatment.
