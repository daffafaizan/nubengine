      doxorubicin plus ifosfamide vs doxorubicin plus ifosfamide and etoposide) in patients with
      newly diagnosed, previously untreated, nonmetastatic osteosarcoma. II. Determine the effect
      of postoperative dose intensification on outcome in patients with standard response to
      preoperative chemotherapy. III. Determine the effect of dexrazoxane cardioprotection during
      standard induction therapy on histologic response in these patients. IV. Evaluate biological
      factors that may predict outcome in these patients. V. Determine the safety of dexrazoxane
      administered with doxorubicin in combination with cisplatin or cisplatin and ifosfamide in
      these patients. VI. Determine the effect of dexrazoxane on cytotoxicity as measured by tumor
      necrosis at definitive surgery in these patients. VII. Assess the feasibility of
      administering doxorubicin with dexrazoxane cardioprotection or high dose ifosfamide with
      etoposide to standard risk patients who are also receiving methotrexate and cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are enrolled sequentially on 1 of 3 pilot
      intensification regimens. After surgery to completely remove the primary tumor, patients are
      assigned to 1 of 2 adjuvant chemotherapy groups based on percent necrosis at limb salvage.
      Pilot 1: (Closed to accrual as of 6/2/2000) Patients receive dexrazoxane IV followed
      immediately by doxorubicin IV over 20 minutes plus cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2
      of weeks 1 and 6. Methotrexate IV over 4 hours is administered on day 1 of weeks 4, 5, 9, and
      10. Patients undergo surgery on week 11. Adjuvant chemotherapy begins on day 1 of week 13.
      Group 1 (good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy): Patients receive methotrexate IV over 4
      hours every 3 weeks for 6 courses, beginning on week 13. Patients also receive dexrazoxane
      and doxorubicin every 3 weeks for 4 courses, beginning on week 14. Cisplatin is administered
      with the first 2 courses of dexrazoxane and doxorubicin. Group 2 (standard response to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy): Patients receive methotrexate and cisplatin as in group 1 plus
      dexrazoxane and doxorubicin for 6 courses. Pilot 2: Patients receive preoperative therapy
      comprised of dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, and methotrexate as in pilot 1. Ifosfamide IV over 4
      hours is also administered on days 1-5 of week 1. Patients undergo surgery on week 11, then
      begin adjuvant chemotherapy on week 13. Group 1: Patients receive methotrexate, dexrazoxane,
      and doxorubicin as in pilot 1, group 1. Ifosfamide is also administered on weeks 14 and 20.
      Cisplatin is administered on weeks 17, 23, and 26. Group 2: Patients receive methotrexate,
      dexrazoxane, and doxorubicin as in pilot 1, group 2. Ifosfamide is administered on weeks 14,
      20, 26, and 31. Cisplatin is administered on weeks 17, 23, and 29. Pilot 3: (Open to accrual
      as of 6/2/2000) Patients receive preoperative therapy comprised of methotrexate, dexrazoxane,
      doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and cisplatin as in pilot 2. Patients undergo surgery on week 11,
      then begin adjuvant chemotherapy on week 13. Group 1: Patients receive methotrexate,
      dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and cisplatin as in pilot 2, group 1. Group 2: Patients
      receive methotrexate on weeks 13, 19, 29, 32, 35, and 36, high dose ifosfamide and etoposide
      IV over 4 hours on days 1-5 of weeks 14, 23, and 26, and cisplatin on weeks 20, 30, and 33.
      Dexrazoxane and doxorubicin are administered on weeks 17, 20, 30, and 33. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 180 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
