    
      This is an observational study to characterize how COVID-19 modulates systemic inflammation,
      autoimmune features and vasculopathy in adult and pediatric patients with a prior diagnosis
      of systemic autoimmunity, and their overall outcomes including response to potential
      antiviral treatments or vaccines.

      Primary Objective:Characterize how COVID-19 modulates systemic inflammation, autoimmunity
      features, organ damage and vasculopathy in adult and pediatric patients with a previous
      diagnosis of systemic autoimmunity. Assess how subjects with systemic autoimmunity respond to
      COVID-19 regarding antiviral and/or proinflammatory responses and overall outcomes

      Secondary Objectives:Understand prevalence and severity of COVID-19 in individuals with
      autoimmune diseases, and the variables that associate/predict these responses.

      Primary Endpoint: Immune dysregulation and vasculopathy modulation following COVID-19.

      Secondary Endpoints: Immunologic and clinical response to potential antiviral/immune
      modulator treatments and/or vaccines that are used during COVID19 for clinical purposes.
      Overall outcome following exposure to COVID19 (response to virus, status of rheumatologic
      disease)

      200 subjects ages 15 years old and above with systemic autoimmune diseases and 60 healthy
      volunteers ages 15 years old and above.
