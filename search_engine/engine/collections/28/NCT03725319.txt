    
      Post sphinterotomy-bleeding (PSB) occurs in 1-2 % of Endosocpic Retrograde
      Cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) and usually needs no blood transfusion after endoscopic
      therapy but can be life-threatening in some rare cases.

      The increasing use of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapies enhances the risk of PSB.

      There are no prospective comparative studies concerning the endoscopic treatment of PSB due
      to the rarity of the incident.

      Insertion of an endoprosthesis in the common bile duct may be more effective than
      Epinephrin-injection into the papilla which is the therapy of first choice.

      A retrospective single centre analysis on both used methods over a study period of 16 years
      shall be performed.

      In detail, clinical success and safety of the procedure, re-bleeding rate, number of
      re-interventions and days of hospital stay will be analysed.
