      protocol of vestibular rehabilitation versus conventional protocol of Cawthorne & Cooksey
      exercises for the treatment of patients with vestibular disorders. Methods: There will be a
      Clinical Trial Random, blind, Hidden Allocation. The sample will consist of 54 subjects
      submitted to two different protocols of vestibular rehabilitation exercises (Intervention
      Group (IG) and Control Group (CG)), to be held with individual treatment once a week,
      totaling 12 attendences. All will be assessed before and after treatment and the main
      variables analyzed are general characteristics of the clinical signs and symptoms caused by
      vestibular diseases, perception of quality of life and functional capacity paras activities
      of daily life, body flexibility, range of motion in the region cervical, parameters of static
      and dynamic postural balance and the perception of the results promoted by the treatment of
      vestibular rehabilitation and will compare the results of the groups. Expected results: It is
      expected, clinically, that subjects who receive treatment through multisensory exercises
      Protocol for VR present reduction of clinical signs and symptoms of dizziness, complaints of
      pains and cervical joint limitations, parameters of improvement related to postural balance,
      aspects of functional capacity and quality of life.
