      mastectomy to other techniques such as nipple and skin sparing procedures. Nipple-sparing
      mastectomy (NSM) with reconstruction technology offers the opportunity to preserve the shape
      of both the breast and the nipple-areola complex.

      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the da Vinci Xi Surgical System in
      NSM procedures.
