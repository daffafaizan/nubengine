      increased mortality rates. Between 2012 and 2013, 3% of patients who died from asthma in the
      UK were found to be on LABA monotherapy, despite guidelines recommending that LABAs must
      always be administered with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Monotherapy with the LABA
      salmeterol has been linked to a significant increase in asthma-related mortality rates when
      used without ICS. When salmeterol is used with ICS, it is not associated with an increased
      risk of serious asthma-related events and is associated with fewer exacerbations than when
      using ICS alone. The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanisms underlying why
      LABA use on its own causes worse outcomes in asthma patients. If the mechanisms can be
      successfully understood, this could provide further compelling evidence to optimise safe of
      these medicines in airway disease.

      The primary objective of this study will be: to determine whether LABA monotherapy with
      salmeterol for 2 weeks in asthmatic patients induces disease-relevant mediators (as
      identified through ex vivo studies) in the airways in vivo; and to determine whether LABA/ICS
      combination therapy with salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate for 2 weeks in the same
      asthmatic patients will abolish the induction of disease-relevant mediators in the airways in
      vivo. If it can be shown that the levels of these inflammatory mediators increase in the
      airways of asthmatic patients when they are on salmeterol xinafoate monotherapy, and that
      this effect is decreased when asthmatic patients are on salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone
      propionate combination therapy, this will provide evidence for a mechanism underlying the
      adverse effects of salmeterol in asthmatic patients.

      Secondary objectives will be to determine the impact of LABA monotherapy with salmeterol
      xinafoate for 2 weeks and LABA/ICS therapy with salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate
      for 2 weeks on the following parameters in asthmatic patients: lung function (assessed by
      spirometry); airway inflammation (assessed by measuring fractional exhaled nitric oxide);
      airway hyperresponsiveness (assessed by histamine challenge testing); asthma symptom control
      (assessed by the Asthma Control Questionnaire-6); and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) concentration and platelet BDNF concentration.
