      generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength.The randomized, multicenter study was
      conducted at the physical medicine and rehabilitation departments of five different centers.
      One hundred patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly allocated to
      either a home-based exercise group (n=50) or a control group (n=50). The patients were
      evaluated before and 3 months after inclusion using the timed up and go test, the Berg
      balance scale, the 6-minute walk test , a numeric rating scale to determine QoL, and the
      number of falls.
