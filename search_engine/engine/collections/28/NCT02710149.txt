      exhibited good clinical outcomes. The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown exellent therapeutic
      efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, patients
      treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 mutation. Other targets aimed CAR-T
      is in need. Therefore we constructed CD20-targeted CAR-T cells and hope to start a
      clinicaltrial to explore the therapeutic effect of CD20-targeted CAR-T cells in the treatment
      of B cell malignancies.
