      diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The physician in this procedure inserts the bronchoscopy
      tube that has a camera at its tip to visualize the airways and detect possible pathologies.
      When needed, he/she can take samples (biopsies), perform brochoalveolar lavage, remove
      foreign bodies, or relieve airway obstructions.

      The usual method of Bronchoscopic Anesthesia (BA) is conscious sedation combined with local
      anesthesia as it's more comfortable for the patients, with less chances of lidocaine
      toxicity. Local anesthesia is classically done using lidocaine injected through the
      bronchoscope's working channel. As the operator starts from the upper airway, they
      anesthetize each part as they go down to examine the lungs. The lidocaine will be delivered
      to the airway as it drips out of the working channel into the airway part closest to it. Side
      effects of this method is cough with varying frequencies/severity that may sometimes hinder
      the procedure.

      Recently, a spray catheter was designed and used, but mainly for EBUS (Endobronchial
      Ultrasound) and not for bronchoscopy.
