      over the infectious diseases problem, mostly due to the changes in lifestyle and increase in
      life expectancy.

      However, the unprecedented rising numbers of COVID-19 patients in Indonesia has impacted the
      Indonesian healthcare system heavily. It has been reported that older age and the presence of
      cardiometabolic risk factors pose a poor prognostic factor of COVID-19. It is also important
      to note that in Indonesia, the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors is often observed at
      a younger age. Thus, this might also contribute to the higher mortality of COVID19 infected
      patients despite their relatively younger age in comparison to other countries. Nevertheless,
      specific data on the impact of aging and cardiometabolic risk factors on COVID-19 are
      fragmentary, justifying the achievement of a dedicated prospective observational study.

      The CARAMEL study aims to specifically describe the phenotypic aging and cardiometabolic
      characteristics of patients with COVID-19 infection, in relation with the changes in the
      mucosal and systemic immune system. Particular attention will be devoted to obesity, central
      obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, as well as anti-diabetic,
      antihypertensive, and anti-dyslipidemia therapies.

      This study will provide answers to researchers, medical professionals, and especially
      patients, regarding the impact of aging and cardiometabolic risk factors for COVID-19
      prognosis. This pilot study will be used for the development of new studies and for the
      establishment of recommendations for the care of patients with cardiometabolic risk factors
      and COVID-19.
