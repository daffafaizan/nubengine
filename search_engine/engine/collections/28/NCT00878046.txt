      artificial hip joint, is effective in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease
      requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be evaluated at regular
      intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray assessments. A subset of
      patients will undergo scans to allow the bone mineral density of the bone surrounding the
      implant to be monitored
