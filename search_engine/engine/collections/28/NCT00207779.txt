      with catheters. Interventions designed to decrease fibrin deposition and thrombus formation
      have the potential to reduce catheter-related infections. Seven randomised studies have been
      performed to assess the safety and efficacy of heparin (either as an infusion or bonded to
      central venous catheter) on central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections. Although
      a meta-analysis of 4 studies looking at heparin either as an infusion or bonded to central
      venous catheter showed a strong trend for a reduction in catheter-related bloodstream
      infection with the use of heparin, these studies used variable definitions of
      catheter-related infections.

      We have shown in a randomised study (in press), that low dose of unfractionated heparin (100
      IU/kg/daily) was safe and effective to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection in
      patients with haemato-oncological disease. The aim of this prospective randomised controlled
      trial is to compare the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infection in 2 groups of
      patients with haemato-oncological disease:

        -  Group A: heparin impregnated catheters

        -  Group B: low-dose unfractionated heparin (100 IU/kg/daily)
