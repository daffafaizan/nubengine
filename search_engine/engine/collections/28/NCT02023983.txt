        -  that early discharge (within 72 hours) in selected group of patients with low risk of
           follow-up complications after myocardial infarction with elevations of ST-segment,
           treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, is feasible and safe

        -  that early discharge is comparable with the group of patients, discharged in a standard
           way accordingly with present practice and physicianÂ´s decision (usually 4th-7th day),
           thus it is not associated with higher incidence of complications in 90th day after
           myocardial infarction
