      180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people
      are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading
      indication for liver transplantation. A combination of ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated
      interferon (PegIFN) is the currently recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection and this
      may achieve viral clearance in 19% to 52% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (GT-1) and
      in 76% -80% of patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 and 3. The standard of care is changing
      and will soon become an HCV protease inhibitor [Boceprevir/ Telaprevir in combination with
      PegIFN and RBV]. The registration studies for the new protease inhibitors demonstrated
      increased sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 60 70%. However, this is still
      associated with a high incidence of adverse events (AEs) and lower cure rates in several
      populations. Novel therapies that do not rely on an Interferon backbone will be required to
      enhance cure rates in various populations.

      This is a randomized controlled open-label study to assess safety, tolerability and efficacy
      of GS-7977 (a potent and selective HCV NS5B inhibitor) given at a dose of 400 mg daily in
      combination with RBV to a total of 60 treatment-na(SqrRoot) ve HCV genotype 1 mono-infected
      individuals with less than or equal to stage 2 fibrosis.

      The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses to
      an interferon (IFN) free regimen as well as determine the role of RBV in IFN-free therapies.
