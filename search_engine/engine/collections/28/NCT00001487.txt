      that decrease with age. In humans low DHEA levels have been associated with a variety of
      adverse biological consequences, including increased cardiovascular disease, decreased immune
      function, decreased bone density, negative lipid profile and an increased fat to muscle
      ratio.

      In this study, we investigate the effects on mood and behavior of DHEA in men and women with
      midlife-related mood disorders in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. We
      specifically ask whether increasing DHEA levels will mitigate any or all of the
      neurasthenia-like symptoms characteristic of these disorders.
