    
      A multicenter, randomized rater-blinded controlled trial was carried out in a sample of 119
      adolescents (15-21 years) and was conducted between April 2012- May 2014. Patients were
      randomly assigned to 12 group manualized cognitive-behavioural group therapy sessions (n=45)
      or a waiting list control group (N=44). Primary outcomes were assessed by a blind evaluator
      (ADHD Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity, Global Assessment
      Functioning) before and after treatment as well as by self-report and parent informant
      ratings.
