    
      This trial aims at evaluating the performance diagnosis of pCLE for the detection of bile
      duct cancer, in patients with indeterminate biliary stricture when associated with other
      diagnostic information.

      The hypothesis is that ERCP with Cellvizio probe-based endomicroscopy improves
      differentiation of biliary and pancreatic duct lesions versus ERCP alone or ERCP with tissue
      sampling, by improving the sensitivity of detection and by providing a real-time diagnosis.

      Direct measures of accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, etc.) in the differentiation of
      malignant versus benign biliary duct lesions will be compared for the combination of ERCP
      alone, endomicroscopy plus ERCP imaging, and ERCP plus endomicroscopy plus tissue sampling.
      These information will be reviewed retrospectively by a second physician.

      These presumptive diagnoses will be compared against a 12-month follow-up confirmed
      histopathologic endpoint (an initially-benign pathologic diagnosis will be confirmed by a
      12-month follow-up). Secondary objectives include collecting patient management
      recommendation. Yet, effective management recommendation is left as the discretion of the
      physician.
