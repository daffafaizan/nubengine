      Stroke Foundation of Canada, as well as the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec. The
      multidisciplinary study team comprises over 20 researchers with a wide variety of relevant
      expertise as well as research fellows, students and staff (www.etudequalitystudy.ca).

      The specific objectives of QUALITY are: 1) To increase understanding of the natural history
      of excess weight and its associated cardiometabolic consequences (dyslipidemia,
      hyperinsulinemia, dysglycemia, inflammation, elevated blood pressure, sympathetic
      overactivity) in youth at risk for the development of obesity; 2) To investigate the relative
      importance of the genetic, biological, environmental and psychosocial determinants of excess
      weight and its associated cardiometabolic consequences. Determinants of particular interest
      include social factors (socio-economic status, family composition, built environment),
      behavioural factors (eating behaviour, physical activity, smoking, sleep, stress), biological
      factors (adverse fetal environment, body fat distribution, growth trajectory, aerobic
      fitness), metabolic factors (insulin sensitivity, adipocytokines), and genetic/familial
      factors (family history, parental characteristics, gene variations); 3) To examine the
      relation between obesity, cardiometabolic complications, and subclinical markers of
      atherosclerosis; and 4) To examine whether obesity and its associated risk factor are related
      to children's oral health.

      The QUALITY Cohort used a school-based sampling strategy to identify potential participants.
      About 400 000 recruitment flyers were distributed over three consecutive years to parents of
      children in Grades 2 to 5, in 1040 primary schools (89% of schools approached) including 44
      private schools situated within 75 km of Montreal, Quebec City and Sherbrooke in the province
      of Quebec, Canada. Families interested in participating were invited to contact the research
      coordinator for additional information, to confirm eligibility, and to set an appointment
      with the research team; 1320 of 3350 families who contacted the coordinator met the inclusion
      criteria. Six hundred and thirty families agreed to participate and completed the baseline
      evaluation.
