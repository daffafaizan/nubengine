    
      Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA) and Patient Self-Assessment (PSA) scores, assessing
      severity of erythema, will be obtained prior to study treatment to confirm subject
      eligibility. Enrolled subjects will receive up to three dual-depth treatments to affected
      areas of the midface (cheeks, chin, forehead, glabella and nose) each treatment provided
      approximately 2 weeks apart. Groups A and B will receive low-density treatment, and Groups C
      and D receive high-density treatment. Groups A and C will receive 2 treatments. Groups B and
      D will receive 3 treatments. Protocol amended Sept 2014: Groups A and C will receive 1
      treatment; Groups B and D will receive 2 treatments.
