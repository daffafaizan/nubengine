      responses (brain activation) and behavior related to stress, including emotions, desires, and
      reactions to adverse events such as social conflict. The full research project will be
      conducted over approximately 4-6 weeks, and will consist of two data collection sessions on
      the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) campus, one before and one after a 14-day stress
      reduction training course conducted via mobile phone (SmartPhone). The two courses entail
      instructor-facilitated stress reduction exercises previously shown to reduce stress and
      improve well-being. Participants will be randomly assigned to a mindfulness course or an
      active coping course. Both of these courses - mindfulness training (MT) and coping training
      (CT) - involve expert-facilitated mental wellness techniques. MT emphasizes mindfulness-based
      techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being, whereas CT emphasizes established emotion
      regulation techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being.
