      will consist of two experimental groups of equal size (n=28): DCS treatment group and a
      placebo group. Participants will be randomized into either group; with a double blind study
      design. Participants will be instructed to self-administer their treatment pills once per day
      for 28 days. There will be a total of 6 study visits that will include medical and
      neuropsychological assessment. The first visit will be for establishing eligibility and
      baseline functioning. Three visits (visits 2-4) will occur during the medication trial (day
      1, day 2 and two weeks into medication/placebo). Visit 5 will occur around the time
      medication/placebo is finished. Visit 6 (follow up) will occur one month after
      medication/placebo is complete.
