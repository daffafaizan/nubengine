      Thoracoscopic Ventral Spondylodesis. The other group will be operated on using Monopolar
      Electrosurgery.

      The study is designed as a randomized trial. That means that all patients who have given
      their consent to participate in the study will be allocated to either ultrasound scissors or
      Monopolar Electrosurgery by chance.

      A total of 40 patients will be included in this study. The study ends with finishing of the
      first day after the operation, there is no longer follow up.
