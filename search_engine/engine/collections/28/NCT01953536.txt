      tomography (CT) scan with etarfolatide (EC20) to identify target lesions and determine
      eligibility for treatment. After successful screening, during the treatment stage,
      participants will receive study drug (vintafolide, vintafolide + paclitaxel, or paclitaxel)
      for approximately four 28-day cycles.
