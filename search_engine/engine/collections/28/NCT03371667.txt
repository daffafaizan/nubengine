      develop clinically meaningful acute GVHD and who meet all other entry criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either corticosteroids and placebo ("standard of care", control
      arm) or the combination of low-dose MTX with corticosteroids as first-line therapy for acute
      GVHD (MTX; "experimental arm").

      The primary analysis of this hypothesis generation study is to estimate the composite
      endpoint of GVHD-free and corticosteroids-free survival at 12 months after randomization in
      both treatment arms. In fact, it is more and more established that such composite endpoint is
      a clinically very relevant one because it represents ideal recovery from allo-SCT (Stem Cell
      transplantation) (at 1 year after acute GVHD diagnosis) and a measure of cure without ongoing
      morbidity.
