    
      This is an open label study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),
      safety and tolerability of a single dose of ASP3652 in healthy male and female subjects from
      Caucasian, Japanese, Black/African and Chinese origin.

      A total of 64 healthy male and female subjects are included in this study (16 subjects per
      race group). Each race group comprises 8 female subjects and 8 male subjects.

      Screening assessments are performed from Day -22 to Day -2, and subjects are admitted to the
      clinic on Day -1, where they remain until Day 4. On Day 1, the subjects receive a single oral
      dose of ASP3652, and are discharged on Day 4 when all assessments have been performed and if
      there are no medical reasons to stay longer. An end of study visit (ESV) is performed 7-14
      days after discharge.

      For each race group, plasma samples for PK and PD analysis are collected. Vital signs, safety
      electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, safety laboratory assessments, physical examination,
      adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications are monitored throughout study.

      In order to identify potential relationships between dietary intake and the PK of a single
      dose of ASP3652, all subjects record their diet for 3 days during the screening period in
      order to assess daily dietary intake (including total daily caloric intake; daily cholesterol
      intake; and total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate and protein as a percentage of total
      calories).
