      the FMC63 mouse hybridoma, a portion of the human CD137（4-1BB） molecule, and the
      intracellular component of the human CD3ζ molecule. Prior to CAR-T cell infusion, the
      patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After CAR-T cell infusion, the
      patients will be evaluated for adverse reactions and efficacy.

      The Main research objectives:

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1904B in patients with recurrent or refractory B-ALL

      The Secondary research objectives:

      To investigate the cytokinetic characteristics of 1904B in patients with recurrent or
      refractory B-ALL
