      neonatal hemoglobin level, higher iron stores in the newborn around three to six months, and
      better neurological development. In 2017, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      (ACOG) recommended a minimum 30-60 seconds delayed clamping of the cord after a minimum of
      30-60 seconds, regardless of the delivery method, in both term and preterm newborns. In
      addition, optimal placental transfusion can be achieved due to strong uterine tonus in
      vaginal delivery. However, this is not possible due to decreased uterine tonus and time
      constraint in cesarean delivery. The main concern in delayed clamping and milking of the
      umbilical cord is the possibility of maternal anemia due to excessive maternal blood loss in
      the short term, the need for maternal blood transfusion or maternal intensive care support,
      and the possibility of conditions such as hyperbilirubinemia, symptomatic polycythemia, and
      long hospital stay that may cause the need for phototherapy in the newborn. Although there
      are many studies in the literature regarding the neonatal results of the clamping timing of
      the umbilical cord, there are a limited number of articles regarding the results in patients
      who underwent term elective cesarean section. The aim of this study is to show that delayed
      umbilical cord clamping or milking of the umbilical cord in pregnant women undergoing
      elective cesarean delivery might have better effects than early clamping, on neonatal results
      without causing maternal hemorrhage or negatively affecting the neonatal outcome , and to
      compare the superiority of these three methods to each other.
