      as one of the etiologies of iatrogenic retinal break related to vitrectomy.The iatrogenic
      retinal breaks related to IPVD usually develop near or anterior to the equatorial region.

      Thus, the investigators hypothesized that this complication could be prevented by restricting
      the extent of IPVD, and planned a modified procedure of vitrectomy in which the extent of
      IPVD and removal of vitreous cortex was restricted to about slightly beyond the margin of
      temporal major vascular arcade.

      The investigators have termed this procedure, partial posterior hyaloidectomy. Unlike RRD or
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy, lesions are localized within the major vascular arcade in
      macular disorders so that macular disorders could be an eligible indication for this
      procedure.
