      the affected foot exposed. The diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) will be cleaned using saline
      solution and gauze, then the ulcer temperature will be checked using the digital infrared
      thermometer. Diabetic wounds will be measured and photographed at baseline and every 10
      visits until the study is completed, the images will be analyzed using the ImageJ program for
      follow-up throughout the intervention. The DFU will be ranked according to the Wagner Scale.
      Afterwards the volunteers will receive LLLT application and conventional treatment in the
      form of Helianthus Annuus oil dressing. Both therapist and participant will be instructed on
      precautions to be observed when using LLLT. Goggles will be provided prior to administration.
      The lower cylinder of the LASER probe will be placed perpendicular to the DFU, the floor and
      edges of the ulcer will be irradiated using punctual and scanning techniques, respectively.
      Once a week blood glucose levels will be obtained for patient screening. All data will be
      recorded until the end of the visits in a control form prepared.
