      preparative regimen for HSCT using a novel reduced toxicity regimen for stem cell transplant
      with unrelated donors. Analysis will be geared to confirm if the study regimen, followed by
      an appropriately HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD)or unrelated cord blood HSCT, can lead to
      durable donor engraftment with reasonable toxicity, inhibiting sickle erythropoiesis and
      limiting disease related organ toxicity in patients who are at high risk for morbidity and
      mortality associated with sickle cell disease (SCD).
