      blood will be processed per standards at the investigators regional blood center (New York
      Blood Center) and then split into two equal units and shipped to Columbia University Medical
      Center for storage and transfusion. One unit will be transfused back into the same individual
      fresh (i.e. between 3-7 days after donation). The other unit will be transfused 42 days after
      donation. Blood samples will be drawn before, during, and after transfusion to measure levels
      of various analytes.
