      blood cell (PRBC) transfusion and the development of NEC in neonates. Although, to date,
      there is no conclusive evidence indicating a causal role of PRBC transfusion on the
      development of NEC. Given the growing body of data that support the association of PRBC
      transfusions and NEC, a common clinical dilemma arises with regard to feeding infants during
      a blood transfusion. Additionally, it is thought that increased immunomodulation may be
      exacerbated by any other pro-inflammatory process or insult; thereby leading to a rapidly
      increasing cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may ultimately lead to gut
      inflammation and NEC.

      Prior to a non-urgent PRBC transfusion, subjects will be randomized to either the NPO group
      or fed group of patients. The intervention will be the placement of a subject in the NPO
      group. Subjects will be made NPO for a total of 24 hours around the time of the PRBC
      transfusion. During the transfusion, both groups of subjects will have serum cytokine levels
      obtained at 3 time intervals- 1) 4 hours pre-transfusion, 2) 2-4 hours post-transfusion, and
      3) 20-24 hours post-transfusion.
