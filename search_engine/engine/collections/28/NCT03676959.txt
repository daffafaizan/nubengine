      Treatment (up to 24 cycles or 1 year, whichever occurs first), and Follow-up (up to 1 year).
      There will be a lead-in period on Day -28 for each dose escalation cohort in which the
      single-dose pharmacokinetics of ZKAB001 will be characterized prior to initiation of
      continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment. The lead-in period duration, PK
      time-points, doses and/or regimens used in subsequent cohorts may be modified based on the
      exposure (AUC) observed during the lead-in period (although the number of PK samples will not
      be increased). Treatment of continuous dosing is up to 24 cycles or 1 year, until as per
      investigator's opinion, subjects experience disease progression (evaluated by RECIST 1.1 and
      immune-related response criteria irRECIST), no clinical benefit, or intolerable toxicity. If
      investigators suspect subjects experience pseudoprogression or has evidence to prove "mixed
      response", subjects can continue to accept treatment as investigator decided.
