      target values of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to be reached with interventions on food and / or
      pharmacological habits to perform an effective cardiovascular prevention.

      Although the atherogenic action of hypercholesterolemia is largely attributable to a direct
      damage action on the vascular endothelium, recent studies suggest that the activation of a
      low-grade systemic pro-inflammatory state, typical of the patient with cardiovascular risk
      factors, in turn would play a role in the determinism of endothelial damage and atheroma
      degeneration of the arteries. It is believed that the systemic inflammation, documented by
      the determination of some humoral signs of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein,
      interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), may contribute to increase of cardiovascular
      risk; it also seems that elevated plasma levels of the aforementioned markers can exert a
      synergistic pro-atherogenic action with the various cardiovascular risk factors.

      The inflammatory state can modulate the atherosclerotic process at various levels,
      determining endothelial activation, promoting leukocyte chemotaxis in the sub-intimal space
      of the arterial wall and therefore the formation of an atheromatous plaque rich in
      inflammatory cells; the latter represents the lesion responsible for the vast majority of the
      coronary and cerebrovascular events observed in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been identified as an indicator of systemic inflammation and a
      predictor of cardiovascular risk. In the AFCAPS / TexCAPS study, subjects with normal LDL-C
      levels and low levels of HDL-C were shown to encounter a greater number of coronary ischemic
      events as baseline hsCRP levels increased. On the contrary, in the Justification for the Use
      of statins in Prevention-an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), the
      treatment with rosuvastatin in subjects with high hsCRP was associated with a significant
      reduction of CV events even in patients with low LDL-C level.
