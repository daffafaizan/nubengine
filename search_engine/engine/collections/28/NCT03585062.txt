        1. The incidence of pancreatic cancer in China has been increasing rapidly in recent
           years，but most of the pancreatic cancer patients are unresectable, whose median survival
           time were only 6~9 months.

        2. Studies have shown that neoadjuvant therapy improves the quality of surgery in patients
           with pancreatic cancer，and prolong their life.

        3. S-1 is a new generation of oral fluorouracil derivatives ,S-1 single drug as an adjuvant
           therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer is better than gemcitabine, and has less side
           effects than gemcitabine. Protein bound paclitaxel is a novel paclitaxel combined of
           paclitaxel and albumin by nanotechnology , which can extend free survival in patients
           with advanced pancreatic cancer with less side effects than gemcitabine. So S-1 combined
           with Paclitaxel-albumin is expected to play an important role in neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy in Pancreatic cancer, and may improve the rate of R0 resection in patients
           with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      S-1 combined with Paclitaxel-albumin

        1. S-1:40~60mg bid, day 1~14 (S-1: BSA (Body surface area)<1.25m2, 40mg bid , 1.25m2 ≤ BSA
           ≤1.5m2, 50mg bid, BSA>1.5m2, 60mg bid),2 weeks and rest for 1 weeks.

        2. Paclitaxel-albumin: 125 mg/m2, intravenous infusion for 30 minutes, Day1 and Day 8.

      Repeat every three weeks. for 6 cycles.
