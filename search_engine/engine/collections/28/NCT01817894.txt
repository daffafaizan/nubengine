      affects their quality of life. In Denmark patients are offered six laser treatments covered
      by the public health insurance. There is a lack of good follow-up treatments to this regime
      that can extent the efficacy of the laser treatment. Eflornithin cream is an approved
      treatment for reduction of facial hair growth which has proved to give an additional
      efficiency when used in combination with laser treatments.The efficacy when used after laser
      hair removal is not known.

      Aim: To investigate whether an extended efficacy of laser hair removal can be achieved with
      application of Eflornithin cream twice daily for six months after completion of laser
      treatments.

      Method: in a split-face trial to apply Eflornithin cream twice daily for six months. Outcome
      measures are investigator evaluation, blinded on-site evaluation, patient's assessment score
      and clinical photos.
