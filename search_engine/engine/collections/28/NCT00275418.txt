    
      Patients with documented Crohn's disease who are at least 2 months in remission (CDAI<150)
      will be randomized to receive 60 mg beta carotene/day vs. placebo for 1 year.

      The study medication will be taken in addition to regular treatment for Crohn's disease.

      The protocol includes 5 visits (months 0, 3, 6, 9, 12). Each visit lasts 30-60 minutes and
      includes a brief interview, standard questionnaires, physical examination, and blood tests.

      Exacerbation of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI>150. The study hypothesis is that less
      patients treated with beta carotene will suffer an exacerbation than patients treated with
      placebo.
