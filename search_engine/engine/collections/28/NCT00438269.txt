      the ICU for at least 24 hours, and who manifested either a temperature >38.5 degrees, or a
      temperature>38.0 degrees and a white cell count >12,000, and in whom clinicians entertained
      the possibility of infection as a diagnosis, to either site-specific broad spectrum empiric
      antibiotics or the corresponding placebo. All patients underwent a comprehensive series of
      investigations to identify an infectious focus, and all patients had full source control,
      including changes of central lines and urinary catheters, and change of nasogastric to
      orogastric tubes.

      Patients were maintained in assigned study arm for seven days, or until culture data were
      available, at which time they were switched to culture-guided narrow spectrum therapy
