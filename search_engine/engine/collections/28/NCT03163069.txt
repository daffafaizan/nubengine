    
      Sixty-three eligible participants (29 males and 34 females, mean age 26.1 years) with at
      least one maxillary tooth demonstrating shade A3 or darker will be recruited and randomly
      allocated into 3 groups (n = 21), according to the different dentifrices used in this
      clinical trial: Crest Total (regular dentifrice) for group C, Crest 3D Whitening
      (conventional whitening dentifrice) for group CW, and Close Up White Now (whitening
      dentifrice containing blue covarine) for group CU. All participants will receive in-office
      tooth bleaching with 40% hydrogen peroxide (Opalescence Boost PF 40%) for the maxillary
      anterior teeth (2 sessions, with a 1-week interval). The participants will be instructed to
      use only the provided dentifrices and toothbrushes to brush their teeth twice daily over a
      4-week period. Colour parameters (CIE L*, a*, b*) will be measured with a spectrophotometer
      (Vita Easyshade Advance 4.0) at baseline (T1), after the first bleaching session (T2), after
      the second bleaching session (T3), 1 week after the completion of in-office bleaching (T4),
      and 3 weeks after the completion of in-office bleaching (T5). The colour differences (ΔE) and
      whiteness index (W) will also be calculated. The data will be statistically analysed through
      repeated ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05).
