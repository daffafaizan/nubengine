      fractures treated with the Femoral Neck System (FNS)™ at one year post-operation. The Femoral
      Neck System (FNS)™ represents a new generation of implants designed to improve outcomes in
      the treatment of femoral neck fractures. These implants offer a fixed angle construct and all
      of its mechanical advantages with regards to neutralizing shear and providing stability while
      not exerting a rotational malreduction force on the fracture. The FNS system has been shown
      to compare favorably to traditional fixed angle constructs in a cadaveric model
