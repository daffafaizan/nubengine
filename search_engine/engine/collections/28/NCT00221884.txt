      the interscalene, supraclavicular and axillary regions. This is a widely available
      technology, it is non-invasive, portable, less expensive than other imaging modalities and
      allows for real time imaging simultaneously with the block procedure.

      There are some recent case reports and small case series describing the use of ultrasound to
      image the brachial plexus and to guide brachial plexus blockade 16,17,18. We have used
      ultrasound imaging to succesfully identify the brachial plexus and guide needle localization
      and nerve stimulation in 15 volunteers 19. In these healthy volunteers, we were able to
      identify the brachial plexus in every subject, at four different anatomical levels :
      interscalene, supraclavicular, axillary and mid-humeral (see figures). Needle localization
      and nerve stimulation were also successful in every case. Moreover, preliminary data from an
      ongoing series at our institution, shows that when ultrasound guidance is used,
      supraclavicular brachial plexus block can be performed with a high success rate (97%)20.

      However, whether ultrasound guidance truly improves success rates when compared to more
      traditional techniques is still unknown. There has been no randomized controlled trial
      published to date addressing this question.
