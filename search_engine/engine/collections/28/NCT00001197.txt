      ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme that converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides.
      Hydroxyurea has been shown to induce the production of HbF, initially in non-human primates,
      and now in more than fifty patients with sickle cell anemia. The majority of patients with
      sickle cell disease respond to the drug with a more than two-fold increase in HbF levels; in
      some patients the percent of HbF exceeds 10 or 15 percent. It is estimated that levels of 20
      percent are required to substantially reduce the sickling propensity of red cells and to
      modulate disease severity. We propose now to treat several patients chronically with
      hydroxyurea to monitor the durability of the response, to examine for unanticipated long term
      sided effects and to determine hematological changes occurring longitudinally. Such patients
      will be candidates for protocols determining the ability of other agents to enhance HbF
      synthesis, especially in hydroxyurea non-responders. Finally, a series of in vitro studies
      are planned to attempt to develop predictors of response.
