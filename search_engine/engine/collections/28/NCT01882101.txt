      biofeedback and posterior tibial nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence. Primary endpoint
      is weekly episodes of fecal incontinence at 1 week after each treatment. Sample size was
      calculated as 50 patients. Outcomes include weekly episodes and severity of fecal
      incontinence, quality of life and anal function. Outcomes will be assessed using bowel diary,
      FISI questionnaire, FIQL questionnaire and anorectal manometry at 1,8,16 and 24 weeks after
      each treatment for 6 weeks.
