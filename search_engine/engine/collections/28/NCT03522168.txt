    
      Prospective, multi-site, Phase 4, longitudinal observational study designed to systematically
      collect robust longitudinal post-marketing safety and quality of life data about multi-year
      pediatric treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole. Screening may occur for up to 37 days
      prior to enrollment. Assessments will occur at in-person visits planned at months 0, 6, 12,
      18 and 24, and at unscheduled, in-person visits that study staff request when the participant
      switches or stops antipsychotic monotherapy with risperidone or aripiprazole, adds or stops
      treatment with a weight modifying agent, becomes pregnant, chooses to withdraw from the study
      prematurely or, has an ongoing Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that requires further assessment.
      Monthly remote interim contacts occurring between in-person visits will monitor for changes
      (other than dose related) in antipsychotic therapy or weight modifying treatments, potential
      SAEs, and potential pregnancy. The participant, his/her parent/guardian, and the
      participant's personal psychotropic- prescribing medical provider (PPPMP) will make any and
      all decisions related to antipsychotic medications; any other medications; and the
      participant's current mental state, developmental/psychiatric condition, and level of risk
      for potential harm to self or others independent of the study procedures and assessments.
      Study staff (SS) will share all lab results and changes in the participant's AEs or clinical
      presentation, which the study medical clinician (SMC) considers medically concerning based on
      the participant's assessment during in-person visits, with the participant's PPPMP. If an
      emergency safety concern is evident during an in-person visit, the SMC will immediately
      assess the participant, following medical standard-of- care procedures, to determine whether
      the participant is safe to leave the clinic or requires additional emergency care. If new or
      worsening symptoms are reported by the participant or parent/guardian during remote interim
      contacts, the participant and/or parent/guardian will be instructed to contact the PPPMP
      directly.
