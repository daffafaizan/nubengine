      yoga program coupled to health education (HED) compared to HED alone. In a randomized
      clinical trial of 90 patients (45 patients per arm), investigators will measure the effects
      of the two interventions on IR, HTN, dysplidemia, and body composition (See Figure 1. Study
      Diagram). Subjects will be scheduled for outcome assessment at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24
      weeks. In addition, investigators will collect data at baseline and 12 weeks on
      self-efficacy, stress, mindfulness, and mood. As a sub-study to the randomized controlled
      trial, investigators will measure the aerobic intensity of the yoga to estimate the dose of
      physical exercise provided by the yoga (n=10).

      Subjects willing and eligible to participate in the RCT will receive written consent.
      Consented subjects will be randomized to either 12 weeks of yoga with HED versus HED alone.
      Subjects randomized to yoga will receive 30 to 45 minutes of weekly yoga instruction,
      followed by 30 to 45 minutes of HED. Subjects will receive written instructions for home yoga
      practice and lifestyle changes based on HED. Subjects randomized to HED alone will receive a
      weekly standardized HED curriculum which will be attention and time matched to the yoga with
      HED arm.
