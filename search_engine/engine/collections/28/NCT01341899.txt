    
      Patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within the previous 12 months will be recruited into
      this study.Hematopoietic stem cells were mobilized with cyclophosphamide (CY, 2.0g/m2) and
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (10 Î¼g/kg per day) and then collected from peripheral
      blood by leukapheresis and cryopreserved. The cells were infused after conditioning with CY
      (200 mg/kg) and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (4.5 mg/kg). All the included patients
      undergoing AHST complied with blood glucose self-monitoring and scheduled medical
      appointments.Their blood samples were obtained for measuring the frequency of lymphocytes and
      the levels of plasma hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum C-peptide, islet antibodies, and cytokines
      longitudinally.
