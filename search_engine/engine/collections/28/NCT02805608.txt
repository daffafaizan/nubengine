      regional lymph node metastases will be tested by observer-blinded readings and compared to
      diagnostic performance of conventional preoperative procedure. The reference test will be
      histopathology of lymph nodes obtained by operative lymph node dissection based on 6 regions.
      The suspected lymph nodes will be assigned to 6 regions based on the images. During the
      following operation the lymph nodes will be removed and analysed in each of these regions.
