      silicone oil bubble. This bubble acts like a balloon inside the eye and helps to keep the
      retina pushed back against the eye wall so it can heal in its proper place. Gas bubbles
      spontaneously dissolve over a few weeks whereas silicone oil remains in the eye until removed
      with another surgery. When retinal detachments are associated with significant scar tissue on
      the retinal surface, silicone oil is often used since it can remain filling the eyeball for
      as long as necessary to help the retina to heal properly in place. Currently, two different
      types of silicone oil (1000 centistoke and 5000 centistoke) are commercially available and
      have been approved for use in the eye by the Food and Drug Administration. The goal of the
      study is to compare the outcomes using these two different types of silicone oil.

      The retinal detachment will be repaired in a standard fashion. There will be no difference
      between the way retinal detachments are repaired in this study compared to those not in this
      study. Patients will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to receive one of the types
      of silicone oil. Both types of oil have very similar characteristics. The primary difference
      is that one type is thicker (more viscous) than the other, analogous to honey in comparison
      with maple syrup.
