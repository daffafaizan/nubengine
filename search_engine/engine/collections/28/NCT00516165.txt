    
      -  Participants will be given a supply of the study drug RAD001 to be taken at home. They
           will be asked to take the study drug every morning on an empty stomach and will be given
           a study drug diary to record the time/date each time they take RAD001. Each 6 week
           period of time is called a cycle of study treatment.

        -  We are looking for the highest dose of RAD001 that can be given safely. Therefore not
           every participant will receive the same dose of RAD001.

        -  Participants will come to the clinic every other week. At each of these visits, a
           physical examination and blood tests will be performed.

        -  A CT and MRI will be repeated every 6 weeks during the first 3 cycles of treatment then
           every 12 weeks thereafter.
