      reduced emergency department visits, increased self-efficacy and quality of life. The type of
      self-management interventions, specifically individualized and interactive educational
      interventions, have been suggested to have the strongest effect on asthma morbidity. Few
      studies have tested asthma self-management educational interventions in increasing knowledge,
      self-efficacy and quality of life in rural pediatric populations. The goal of this study was
      to test the effectiveness of an asthma educational intervention in improving asthma knowledge
      in rural children and their parent/caregivers. We hypothesized that an interactive asthma
      educational intervention would increase parent/caregiver and child asthma knowledge resulting
      in decreased emergency room visits in rural families of children with asthma.
