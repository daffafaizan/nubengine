      the safety and tolerability of three different doses of IMM-101 administered intradermally to
      melanoma patients. Additionally, the study aims to characterize local responses to this
      vaccine in order to delineate unexpected / unacceptable local reactions from those indicative
      of appropriate immunological response in this patient group.
