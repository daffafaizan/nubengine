    
      Purpose 1 : To collect upper limb muscle activity parameters of healthy adults and stroke
      patients to establish a database of doing hand circular motion activity.

      Purpose 2 : To test the reliability of this refined muscle testing by collecting the muscle
      activity during hand circular motion activity.

      Purpose 3 : To compare the results of the EMG signal strength with other evaluation methods
      such as the modified Ashworth scale and dynamometer to understand the relationship between
      the EMG signal and each evaluation results.

      Purpose 4 : To compare the differences in electromyographic signals, muscle strength, and
      joint angle between healthy adults and stroke patients.
