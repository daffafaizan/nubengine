      Alexandroupolis (UHA) in a consecutive-if-eligible basis. By means of a custom computer
      randomization program all participants will randomly populate either study group (who will
      receive Systane Ultra as additional postoperative treatment) and control group (who will
      receive standard postoperative treatment).
