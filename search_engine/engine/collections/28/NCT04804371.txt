      the selection of an optimal treatment strategy challenging.

      A subject with 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake on all lesions without FDG uptake is likely to have
      low-grade, metabolically inactive disease, leading to an indolent disease course and may also
      be a predictive biomarker in subjects being considered for PRRT.

      Conversely, avidity on 18F-FDG PET/CT and non-avidity on 68Ga-DOTATATE may indicate a
      high-grade NET, and would predict resistance to PRRT, suggesting that a more "aggressive"
      approach with systemic chemotherapy might be beneficial.

      Therefore, the prospective assessment of PETNET score in patients with G2 or G3 GEP NETs,
      which may be biologically diverse is the most clinically relevant group for dual-tracer PET
      imaging.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To determine the distribution of PETNET scores derived from 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE
           PET/CT in patients with G2 and G3 well differentiated GEP-NETs.

        2. To determine the proportion of patients in whom the addition of 18F-FDG PET/CT data
           results in a change in planned clinical management.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. mTo determine whether there is intra-individual variability in somatostatin receptor
           expression and glucose metabolism (as seen on DOTATATE PET and FDG PET, respectively)
           across different tumor sites within the same patient.

        2. To determine whether a correlation exists between tumor texture features on
           68Ga-DOTATATE PET and FDG PET to tumor grade and Ki67 index.

        3. To assess if an association exists between tumor texture features on 68Ga-DOTATATE PET
           and glucose metabolism; and/or an association between tumor texture features on FDG PET
           and somatostatin receptor expression.
