      this is believed to be reduced iron absorption as a result of increased circulating hepcidin
      concentrations. However, the direct interactions between body fat mass, iron absorption,
      inflammation and hepcidin have not been studied to date. Whether the low iron absorption in
      obese subjects could be overcome by conventional methods to increasing iron absorption, e.g.
      the addition of ascorbic acid and whether a reduction of inflammation could improve
      absorption is further unclear. For the calculation of fractional iron absorption from oral
      doses of stable iron isotopes an estimation of blood volume is required. Several equations to
      estimate blood volume from weight and height or calculated body surface area or volume are
      available, but have rarely been validated or used in obese subjects. The aim of the described
      study is therefore: 1) to determine blood volume using the carbon monoxide-rebreathing method
      over a large BMI range and to use those values to validate existing blood volume equations;
      2) to measure iron absorption, hepcidin and inflammation in relation to BMI and body fat and
      3) to assess the effect of ascorbic acid on iron absorption.
