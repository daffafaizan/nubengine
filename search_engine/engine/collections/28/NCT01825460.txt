    
      Design: Randomized clinical trial. Objectives: to determine the short-term effects of a a
      manual therapy protocol on pain, disability and cervical range of motion in individuals with
      acute whiplash injury.

      Methods and measures: sixty patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the
      experimental group received a manual therapy protocol and the placebo group received two
      manual therapy techniques. Neck pain, disability and cervical range of motion data will be
      collected at baseline and 24-hr after the last manual therapy application. Mixed-model
      analyses of variance will be used to examine the effects of the treatment on each outcome
      variable.
