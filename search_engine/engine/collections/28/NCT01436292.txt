      hospitalized and 6,500 die. It is a well known fact that the two most important factors for
      mortality in burn patients are age and percent total body surface area burn (TBSA), which are
      unmodifiable findings.

      A predictable inflammatory response takes place after a burn injury leading to profound
      changes in patient homeostasis. As a result, hypoalbuminemia is one of the common finding in
      severe burn patients. 21% of hospitalized adult patients are hypoalbuminemic on admission.
      After admission, worsening of existing hypoalbuminemia and development of de novo one are
      frequently seen.

      Moreover, hypoalbuminemia, a potentially modifiable variable, has been strongly associated
      with poor clinical outcomes in critically ill patients and in burn patients.

      Dynamic organ dysfunction scores have been introduced in critically ill patients few years
      ago in order to describe the evolution of patients on a daily basis. The Sequential Organ
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is now one of the most accepted score in critically ill
      patients and has been validated in general medico-surgical unit, as well as in trauma and
      cardiac surgery patients. It encompasses components assessing six organ functions. This score
      has also been shown to predict mortality in critically ill patients and in burn patients when
      used in a dynamic way.
