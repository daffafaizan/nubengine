      correlated to post-cesarean pain scores. Anxiety, anticipated post-operative pain score and
      anticipated medication need are also found to be promising risk factors to post-cesarean pain
      management.

      The investigators would investigate the risk factors of causing post-cesarean emesis, and to
      reaffirm that there is a positive correlation between pain on local anesthetic injection,
      presence of mechanical temporal summation (MTS) and post-Cesarean pain scores. 470
      parturients undergoing cesarean delivery and requiring regional anaesthesia will be
      recruited. Pain and anxiety assessment will be conducted via visual analogue scoring (VAS),
      MTS assessment and a series of questionnaires. After delivery, patients will be given
      appropriate analgesia, and pain score at movement will be recorded. Secondary outcomes
      include pain scores at rest, analgesia consumption, time-to-first-rescue analgesia,
      opioid-related side effects, patient satisfaction and postpartum depression. A separate 125
      patients will be recruited to evaluate the feasibility and patient acceptability of the use
      of Headspace, a mindfulness mobile application during the pre- and postnatal period to
      improve the maternal outcomes (emesis, pain, anxiety, depression).
