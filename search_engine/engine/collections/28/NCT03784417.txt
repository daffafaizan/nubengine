      Western societies within a decade. Management include chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy,
      while resectable disease is possible only in 15% of cases.

      Despite these therapeutic approaches, the survival rate of unresectable pancreatic cancer
      remains disappointing. Recently, there is a growing interest in the development of
      alternative therapeutic approaches, which can work in parallel with standard chemoradiation
      therapy. These methods include intra-lesion injection/instillation of antitumoral agents
      performed through a laparoscopic approach, or percutaneously or under endoscopic ultrasound
      (EUS) guidance and tumor volume reduction procedures using ablative techniques.

      In this context laser ablation has been reported to be effective in inducing coagulative
      necrosis of the tumour in absence of major adverse events. However, the available studies on
      the matter are limited by small sample size, lack of extended follow up and informations
      about the possibility to ablate the entire tumour mass.
