    
      Recruitment will be performed by the 3 Clinical Investigators (Jean-Pierre Danjoux -
      Sunderland Eye Infirmary, Karen Goodall - Croft Shifa Health Center, Mark Benson - Midland
      Eye Institute) and any appropriate, pre-trained staff within the hospital using the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria set out in the protocol. Patient selection will involve anyone over
      the age of 21 with an age-related cataract regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender.

      An Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be explained with patients in full which will be signed
      by both the Principal Investigator (PI) and the patient with full understanding.
      Understanding fully means that the patient understands the nature of the operation, the
      benefits to the operation and also any risks or burdens.

      The consent form also states alternatives to participation in the trial other than the option
      being put forward. The patients will be of sound enough mind to retain the information from
      the ICF and will be given time to digest this in order to make a free and effective decision
      to join the study.

      All risks and benefits are explained in the ICF and are no more or less than that of a
      standard cataract surgery provided on a daily basis by NHS consultants. All surgeries will be
      performed by the PI.

      Confidentiality shall be kept at all times with the PI and clinical staff using a unique
      patient reference number that in no instance indicates the identity of the patient to the
      study sponsor (Lenstec Inc.) or anyone else outside of the hospital. Any other
      confidentiality issues will run in conjunction with the hospital policy of which the staff
      involved in the study are aware.

      There are no tissue samples to be used in this study.
