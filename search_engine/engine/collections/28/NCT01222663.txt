      high (between 40 and 60% as per the studies). The recent complementary therapies for severe
      sepsis have been reassessed (strict glycaemic control, substitutive corticotherapy, activated
      protein C). Early neutralisation of the endotoxaemia related to gram-negative bacilli sepsis
      in contact with hemoperfusion membrane covered with polymyxin B (Toraymyxin™) may enable
      reduction of the inflammatory reaction caused by sepsis and improve its prognosis. 30
      studies, including 10 randomized studies, have compared hemoperfusion with Toraymyxin™ to the
      standard treatment, showing an improvement in the patients' haemodynamic state, oxygenation
      conditions and reduction in mortality. This treatment is commonly used in Japan. However, the
      studies conducted either include only a limited number of patients or are not randomized
      prospective studies. The post-hoc analysis of a recent randomized study conducted on a
      limited number of patients with abdominal septic shock shows a significant reduction in
      mortality after factor adjustment. Though the side effects of such a treatment are limited,
      its cost is high. Hence, extensive prospective studies are necessary to confirm its
      effectiveness.
