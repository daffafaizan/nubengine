    
      This is a randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the dose-response in the
      sedation success rate for 4 different initial bolus doses of AQUAVAN following pretreatment
      with an analgesic, fentanyl, in patients undergoing a colonoscopy. A group of patients will
      receive midazolam as a reference therapy.

      Following completion of pre-procedure assessments, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      5 IV treatment groups at an equal allocation ratio (25 patients per arm) on the day of the
      scheduled procedure. Randomization will be stratified by age and ASA status:

      AQUAVAN initial bolus dose 1: 8 mg/kg AQUAVAN initial bolus dose 2: 6.5 mg/kg AQUAVAN initial
      bolus dose 3: 5 mg/kg AQUAVAN initial bolus dose 4: 2 mg/kg Midazolam initial bolus dose:
      0.02 mg/kg

      A person skilled in airway management and authorized by the facility in which the colonoscopy
      is performed (such as a respiratory therapist, a study nurse, or a clinician) must be
      immediately available during the conduct of the study. All patients will be placed on
      supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (4 L/min), and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse
      oximeter, and blood pressure monitor prior to administration of study medication. All
      patients will receive an injection of analgesic pretreatment followed by the administration
      of sedative medication, as described below. This protocol recognizes 2 distinct phases of
      sedation: Sedation Initiation and Sedation Maintenance. Assessments will be made to evaluate
      the patients for levels of sedation, clinical benefit, and adverse events as detailed in the
      protocol. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, also detailed in
      the protocol.
