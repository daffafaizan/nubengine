      follow-up among patients with chronic kidney disease. Usual outpatient follow-up visits will
      be replaced with diagnosis-specific electronic questionnaires filled in by the patient at
      home. Participants in the PRO-based follow up will complete a disease specific questionnaire
      every 3 months. Patients with an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) < 40mL/min are
      randomized into three groups of follow-up

        1. PRO-based follow-up (The clinicians use the PRO data to decide whether a patient needs a
           visit or not)

        2. PRO-based telephone consultations (The clinician use the PRO-data to support the
           communication with the patient)

        3. Usual outpatient follow-up visits (Patients are seen in the outpatient clinic)

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect on the clinical outcomes, the utilisation of
      resources, and patient-reported outcome in three types of follow-up in a non-inferiority
      randomised controlled trial.
