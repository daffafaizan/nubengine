      fermented) and a refined wheat control product were tested in the study. The rye crisp bread
      products contained similar ingredients. All products provide similar amounts of available
      carbohydrates (about 30g). The total amount of test product is about 50-60g.

      The specific primary aim of the study: To conduct a short-term breakfast intervention study
      in humans (n = 24) to compare the effect of 2 high-fiber rye crisp bread products processed
      in different ways (sourdough fermented or unfermented) and a refined wheat control crisp
      bread as part of a normal breakfast on self-rated appetite, postprandial glucose and insulin
      concentrations. Difference in post-prandial insulin response between products is the primary
      endpoint.

      Secondary aim (conducted if significant effects in the primary endpoint have been
      demonstrated): To assess changes in hormones and their relation to self-perceived satiety,
      hunger and desire to eat and to differences in chemical and microstructural composition of
      the tested foods.
