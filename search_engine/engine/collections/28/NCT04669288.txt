      randomized, multi-center evaluation of AZ for the treatment of acute wheezing episodes. The
      study will recruit eligible patients from an estimated six EDs and enroll up to 2,000
      patients. We will test two primary hypotheses: 1) AZ (12 mg/Kg/day) given for 5 days to
      preschool children with severe acute wheezing and harboring any of three specific pathogenic
      bacteria (H influenzae, M catarrhalis, or S pneumonia) in their nasopharynx will decrease the
      severity of the acute episode; and 2) AZ given on an identical schedule and dose will
      decrease the severity of wheezing episodes in children who do not harbor any of these three
      pathogenic bacteria in their nasopharynx. We will also explore whether variants in the genes
      encoding for Cadherin Related Family Member 3 (CDHR3), Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and in the 17q
      asthma-related gene cluster predict response to AZ.

      This short-term study has three planned visits. All enrolled patients will participate on the
      Day 0 visit for screening, the informed consent process, enrollment, randomization, treatment
      initiation and dispensing drug. A sub-group of 370 randomly selected patients will
      participate in two follow-up visits on Day 5 - 8 and Day 14 - 21 where they will be tested
      for antibiotic resistance. The primary outcome will be the sum of the Asthma Flare-up Diary
      for Young Children (ADYC) score, a validated instrument completed by the parent or guardian
      of the enrolled children during the 5-day treatment period. Secondary outcomes will include
      (1) ED length of stay (2) hospital length of stay, and (3) return ED visits or
      hospitalizations within 72 hours after randomization.
