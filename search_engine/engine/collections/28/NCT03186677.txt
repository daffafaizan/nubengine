    
      This study is a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study to investigate the
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ISU304/CB2679d/Dalcinonacog alfa in
      previously treated Hemophilia B patients.

      This study is comprised of 5 cohorts. Each cohort may receive an intravenous administration
      of 75 IU/kg, with subcutaneous administrations from 75 IU/kg to 150 IU/kg.

      During the study period, a subject may be hospitalized to facilitate the collection of blood
      samples for pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis. The Data Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB) and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be operated after the end of Cohorts 1
      to 4. These committees will monitor the PK/PD and safety data from each cohort to determine
      the continuation of next cohort (Cohorts 2 to 5), target dose, and blood sampling period for
      PK/PD (including timing of collection). Additional subjects may be enrolled in all cohorts or
      cohorts may be canceled depending on the results of PK/PD analysis. A cohort of subcutaneous
      dosing at 300 IU/kg was cancelled as single-dose PK is uninformative.
