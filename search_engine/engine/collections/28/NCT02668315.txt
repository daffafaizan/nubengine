    
      Investigators are proposing a phase I-II, Canadian multi-center, open-label study of UM171 ex
      vivo expanded CB transplant in 25 patients who need an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT) but lack a Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) matched donor.

      Investigators key primary and secondary objectives include:

        1. To establish the feasibility of expanding cord blood units for allogeneic cord blood
           transplantation.

        2. To establish the safety and identify unexpected toxicities associated with the
           transplantation of cord blood cells expanded with UM171/fed-batch culture system.

        3. To measure kinetics of neutrophil and platelet recovery.

        4. To determine minimal cord blood unit cell dose (Total Nucleated Cell (TNC)/CD34+ cells)
           that when expanded achieves prompt engraftment as a single cord transplant.

      Methodology:

      Patients with a hematologic malignancy and an indication for allogeneic HSCT who lack a
      matched unrelated donor will receive a myeloablative or submyeloablative conditioning regimen
      followed by infusion of UM171 expanded CB graft. Accrual is expected to last 18 months and
      patients will be followed for 3 years.

      Expected benefits:

      Investigators expect that expansion with UM171/fed-batch will be safe and lead to both rapid
      and sustained engraftment. This will likely decrease the high early morbidity/mortality of CB
      HSCT and improve access to transplant, especially ethnic minorities. In addition, if low cell
      dose is solved, patients will benefit from CB's lower risk of chronic (graft versus host
      disease) GVHD, a major cause of morbidity.
