    
      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of two consecutive repeated IV 177Lu-ST2210
           administration following a previous tumor intra-lesion/s injection of AvidinOX.

        2. To assess safety and tolerability of intra-lesionally injected AvidinOX + IV injected
           177Lu-ST2210

        3. To evaluate intra-lesional distribution and retention of {AvidinOX +
           177Lu-ST2210}-complex in tumor lesion/s

        4. To evaluate systemic biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 177Lu-ST2210 and {AvidinOX
           + 177Lu-ST2210}- complex

      Main secondary objectives are:

        1. To evaluate whole body dosimetry of IV 177Lu-ST2210 after prior AvidinOX injection
           (radiation safety dosimetry)

        2. To record individual tumor dosimetry

        3. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of {AvidinOX + 177Lu-ST2210}-complex in reducing tumor
           size and metabolic activity.

        4. To evaluate damage of tumor cells by radioactivity and immunogenic cell death

        5. To evaluate whole body safety dosimetry and dose linearity

        6. To evaluate pharmacokinetics of ST2210 in plasma and urine
