      causing meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) in 5-10% of neonates born. Due to lack of evidence
      of benefits of endotracheal suctioning at birth in non-vigorous infants, recent neonatal
      resuscitation guidelines do not recommend it as a routine and they suggest to start
      ventilation within the first minute of life, which may be critical to reverse asphyxia and
      stabilize the neonate. There are concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of this change in
      practice because it is not based on large randomized controlled trials. Besides that, the
      delay in the beginning of the PPV in these babies has not been previously explored.

      Objective: to compare the time of PPV initiation between performing immediate laryngoscopy
      with intubation and suctioning and performing immediate PPV without intubation in a manikin.

      Methods: Level III NICU consultants, residents, and fellows trained in advanced airway
      management will be randomly assigned to AB arm (endotracheal suction, followed by the
      procedure without endotracheal suction) and to BA arm (reverse sequence), with a washout
      period of 6 hour. During each simulation, an external observer will record the time of PPV
      initiation. The primary outcome measure will be the time of PPV initiation in the
      endotracheal suction arm compared to the control arm.
