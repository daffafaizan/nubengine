        1. identify the covariates of baseline substance abuse and sexual risks (including
           demographics, social risk measures, peer norms, abuse history, and mental health status)
           among a sample of 750 heterosexually active, not-in-treatment, club and prescription
           drug users ages 18 to 39 in Miami, Florida.

        2. evaluate, through random assignment, the relative effectiveness of two intervention
           conditions and a waitlist control in reducing sex risks and drug use, as measured at 3-,
           6- and 12-month follow-ups:

             -  Arm 1, an interviewer-administered comprehensive health and social risk assessment
                intervention (CAPI Intervention) similar to the baseline instrument used in the
                parent grant;

             -  Arm 2, an identical self-administered comprehensive assessment intervention (ACASI
                Intervention); and

             -  Arm 3, a waitlist control condition (Control). Outcome measures, including past
                90-day counts of unprotected sex acts and days' drug use, will be obtained from
                brief risk behavior inventories at baseline and follow-ups.

        3. conduct qualitative process evaluation research with 40 participants in each study arm
           to contextualize the study findings and intervention outcomes.
