    
      Double blind, randomized, controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial in hookworm
      exposed adults living in the area of Americaninhas, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Subjects will
      receive three doses of the assigned vaccine delivered intramuscularly on approximately Days
      0, 56, and 112.

      Safety will be measured from the time of each study vaccination (Day 0) through 14 days after
      each study vaccination by the occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic
      reactogenicity events.

      Unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the time of the first
      study vaccination through approximately 1 month after each study vaccination. New-onset
      chronic medical conditions and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be collected from the time
      of the first study vaccination through approximately 9 months after the third study
      vaccination (final visit). Clinical laboratory evaluations for safety will be performed on
      venous blood collected approximately 14 days after each vaccination.

      Immunogenicity testing will include IgG antibody responses to each vaccine antigen, by an
      indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by ImmunoCAP, on serum obtained
      prior to each study vaccination and at time points after each vaccination; antibody affinity
      by Surface Plasmon Resonance; functional activity of vaccine-induced antibodies via in vitro
      enzyme neutralization assays; and, antigen-specific memory B cell responses.

      Recruitment and enrollment into the study will occur on an ongoing basis, with each group
      being recruited and vaccinated in sequence.

      60 subjects will be enrolled into 6 groups of 10.
