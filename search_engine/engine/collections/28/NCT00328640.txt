      use of statins, treatment of hypertension, and anticoagulation in patients with atrial
      fibrillation. Preliminary analyses suggest that only 9-15% of Kaiser Permanente Northern
      California's ischemic stroke patients receive optimal care for secondary prevention of
      stroke. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not a quality improvement (QI)
      intervention can improve the care received by stroke patients. This project consists of a
      randomized trial of standardized stroke discharge order forms to improve adherence with best
      practices in secondary stroke prevention. The primary research question is: Is a secondary
      prevention intervention, focused on implementation of standardized pre-printed discharge
      orders for hospitalists, effective at increasing utilization of the following evidence-based
      treatments 6 months after discharge for ischemic stroke: (1) treatment with statins, (2)
      control of hypertension, and (3) anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation.

      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients receiving optimal treatment, as
      defined by these three goals. The impact of the intervention will be measures as a change
      after-to-before at intervention hospitals compared to non-intervention (control) hospitals,
      with the institution as the unit of analysis. Secondary analyses will evaluate the impact of
      the intervention on each of these components and on 6-month and 1-year rates of mortality,
      readmission for stroke, and costs of care after discharge.
