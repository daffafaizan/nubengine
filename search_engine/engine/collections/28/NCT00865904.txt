      orally-administered VX-809 in participants with CF who are homozygous for the specific CFTR
      mutation known as âˆ†F508 or F508del. Enrollment was planned for 90 participants at
      approximately 20 centers. Participants were planned to be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to
      receive 1 of 4 doses of VX-809 or placebo once a day for 28 days in a parallel design.
      Participants were outpatients during the study, except for overnight stays on Day 1 and 28.
