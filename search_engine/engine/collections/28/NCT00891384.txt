      autologous stem cell transplantation the patients will be included and randomised. Three
      month after high-dose therapy all patients will receive consolidation therapy with 6 cycles
      of lenalidomide 25 mg daily for 21 days every 28 days. Afterwards patients will receive
      maintenance therapy according to their assigned treatment arm. Randomisation will be
      performed in a 1:1 ratio to continuous maintenance therapy with either 25mg or 5mg
      lenalidomide daily for 21 days every 28 days.Randomisation will be stratified by ISS-stage
      (1+2 vs 3, age (younger than 66 years versus 66 years or older), response after high-dose
      therapy (CR+vgPR vs PR vs MR/SD. Patients will be treated until disease progression.
