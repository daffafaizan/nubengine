      combination with docetaxel and compare the efficacy of RAD001 plus docetaxel versus published
      Phase II and III reports of docetaxel alone in patients with recurrent NSCLC.

      New agents and regimens are urgently needed for lung cancer treatment. With the development
      of novel agents and small molecules designed to curtail the aggressive aspects of this
      disease, some progress has been realized. However, much more effort and insight will be
      required for further real gains to be made. We propose that studying the mTOR axis, known to
      be abnormal in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and translating that knowledge into
      therapeutic adjustments can lead to meaningful advances in lung cancer treatment.

      Approximately 58 patients will participate at Emory Winship Cancer Institute and Emory
      Crawford W. Long Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.
