      augmentation of behavior therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. All subjects will undergo
      a pre-treatment assessment, and then be randomly assigned to receive Seromycin (100 mg) or
      placebo one-hour before each of 10 therapy sessions. Subjects will then come in for a
      treatment planning session and the behavior therapy sessions delivered twice weekly for 5
      weeks. Comprehensive assessments of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, mood state, and cognitions
      will be given at baseline, after 5 treatment sessions, after 10 sessions and 1 month and 6
      months post-treatment.
