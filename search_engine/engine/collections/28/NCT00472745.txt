      conjunction with studies of the effect of weight loss on bone health in women for comparison
      purposes. See NCT00473031, NCT00472680, and NCT00472654. This information is important for
      determining optimal nutrient requirements during weight loss.

      Participants will be recruited for both weight loss and weight maintenance. All participants
      will be asked to take a daily vitamin/mineral supplement and, depending on their usual food
      intake, they may be asked to take a calcium tablet to meet the recommended intake throughout
      the study period. Weight loss participants will attend regular counseling sessions (about 45
      minutes each) with a dietitian for approximately 6 months; they will be asked to attend 6
      sessions but will be given the opportunity to attend 13 sessions. Body composition will be
      measured by a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine, ultrasound, and peripheral
      quantitative computer tomography (pQCT) before and after 6 months of weight loss. Bone,
      mineral, protein and lipid markers, and hormones that influence bones will also be measured.
