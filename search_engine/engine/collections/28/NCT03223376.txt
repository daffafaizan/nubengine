    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III clinical trial
      to compare the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib combined with Paclitaxel versus Paclitaxel
      alone in patients with advanced gastric cancer who have progressed after first-line standard
      chemotherapy. After checking eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized into
      Fruquintinib combined with Paclitaxel group (treatment group) or placebo combined with
      Paclitaxel group (control group) in a ration of 1:1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Overall
      Survival (OS). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: Progression free survival (PFS) (According to
      RECIST Version 1.1), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), . Safety and
      tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by
      severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.03.
