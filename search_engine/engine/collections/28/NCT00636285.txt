      studies in the target population of low birth weight infants. This will be an open label,
      dose-ranging study of BSYX-A110 in 12 adults. The dose levels to be evaluated are 3, 10 and
      20 mg/kg. Each dose level will enroll 4 adult volunteers who will receive one dose of
      BSYX-A110 intravenously. The primary endpoint of this study is safety and tolerability. The
      secondary endpoints include the pharmacokinetics of the rise in anti-LTA antibody and opsonic
      activity against S. epidermidis.
