      in sickle cell disease . Fetal hemoglobin is protective against sickling and its decrease is
      associated with vaso-occlusive crisis . Gum Arabic is soluble fibers with prebiotic
      properties. It increased the level of serum butyrate which is short chain fatty acid. The
      latter proved to serve as fetal hemoglobin inducing agent both in vivo and in vitro study.
      And also has strong anti-inflammatory properties. So our aim to test whether oral digestion
      of Gum Arabic will induce fetal hemoglobin among sickle cell pediatric patients
