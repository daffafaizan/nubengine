        -  Determine the local recurrence rate in women with phyllodes tumors of the breast
           previously treated with local excision with negative margins and are now treated with
           adjuvant radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      METHODS: Within 12 weeks after prior local excision or breast reexcision, patients underwent
      adjuvant radiotherapy 5 days a week for a total of 28 treatments. Patients were then followed
      every 6 months for 10 years.
