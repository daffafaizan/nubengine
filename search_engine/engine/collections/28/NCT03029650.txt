      attractive, and easy to use systems. Scopolamine patches are very popular TDDS available on
      the United States market today. Accurate determination of the rate and extent of drug release
      and absorption is crucial to ensure the safety of individuals using these and other types of
      patches. Delivery rate can be determined early in the development process by using in vitro
      skin flux permeation studies, and later in humans by accurately quantifying residual drug
      from patches post-wear and in pharmacokinetic studies. In this proposal, the investigators
      will employ two types of evaluation to determine the rate and extent of drug release and
      absorption from RLD (reference listed drug) Transderm ScopÂ® TDDS (transdermal drug delivery
      system), namely residual drug analysis post-wear and pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy
      adult volunteers. In addition, the investigators will compare the plasma drug concentrations
      following patch and intravenous administration of Scopolamine, in order to determine the
      absolute bioavailability of these patches. The investigators will conduct residual drug
      analysis of TDDS following in vivo wear using highly sensitive validated quantification
      methods. Positive outcomes of this project will identify appropriate methods to determine the
      rate and extent of drug release and absorption from TDDS, and will help regulatory agencies
      in the development of Guidances for Industry regarding the characterization of drug release
      and absorption kinetics to ensure the safety of individuals utilizing these types of products
