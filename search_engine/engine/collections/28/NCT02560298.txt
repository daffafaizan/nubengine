      I. To evaluate best overall response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Progression free survival (PFS). III. Disease control rate
      (DCR) (stable disease [SD] or better) at 12 and 24 weeks.

      IV. Best ORR of non-irradiated lesions. V. Anti-tumor activity and magnitude of response as
      captured by waterfall plot analyses.

      VI. Toxicity. VII. Quality of life (QOL). VIII. Feasibility of conducting a multicenter
      international study on squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) and recruit within a
      reasonable time frame.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explorative biomarker analysis.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil
      IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complications
      associated with the central venous access which prevent further infusion of fluorouracil and
      only after discussion with the Chief Investigator may receive capecitabine twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-4.

      ARM B: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
