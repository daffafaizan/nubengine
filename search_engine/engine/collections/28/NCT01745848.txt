      prior to drug administration, blood samples will be collected for analysis of markers of bone
      metabolism (C-terminal telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTx), Amino-terminal Propeptide of
      Type-1 Procollagen (P1NP) and participants will undergo measurement of endothelial function
      with measurement of brachial flow mediated dilation. After completion of one month of
      Roflumilast therapy, participants will have a repeat blood collection for measurement of CTx
      and P1NP and repeat measurement of brachial flow mediated dilation testing.
