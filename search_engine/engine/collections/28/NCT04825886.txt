      From this observational prospective study, the efficacy and safety of Zotarolimus-Eluting
      Stent in patients with coronary artery disease longer than 25mm is planned to be
      investigated.

      Background:

      Long coronary artery lesions are observed in 20% of all coronary interventions, and are
      associated with poor clinical outcomes. Zotarolimus-Eluting Stents are a new type of stent
      that combines the advantages of an Endeavour Resolute stent (drug eluting stent) and
      Integrity stent (bare metal stent). In other words, BioLinx polymer is used which is an
      advantage of Endeavour Resolute stent to secure clinical efficiency through stable drug
      release while ensuring flexibility and excellent deliverability, which is the advantage of
      Integrity stent. To date, there are only few studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Therefore, the
      investigators planned to carry out a multicenter, prospective observational study to
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent in patients with long coronary
      artery disease of 25 mm or longer.
