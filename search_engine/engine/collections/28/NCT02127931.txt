      create the predictive algorithms to analyze the data and predict the likelihood of ADHD
      diagnosis based on patterns of game play behavior. Participants in this study will complete
      the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS), the DSM IV Adult ADHD
      Checklist, Hamilton Rating Scal for Depression (HRSD), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety
      (HAM-A), and complete the Conner's Continuous Performance test (CPT 3).
