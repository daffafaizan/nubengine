      Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have show that flavonoids, antioxidants which are rich
      in green tea, are potentially as beneficial as vitamin E, beta-carotene and vitamin C in
      reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, the possible preventive effects of green
      tea on CHD have begun to raise research interests in green tea sufficiently to inquire about
      its beneficial effects formally in humans. However, few epidemiologic studies have been
      carried out to directly examine the effects of green tea on CHD. The Honolulu Heart Program
      (HHP) is a 30 year longitudinal study of CHD and stroke among 8,006 Japanese American men
      living on Oahu Hawaii. Until the end of 1992, 1,888 men from this cohort were defined as
      having incident CHD; this includes 396 deaths due to CHD. The baseline examination for the
      HHP was conducted during 1965-68. A comprehensive physical examination and 24 hour dietary
      recall interview were administered. Within the original cohort more than 75 percent men
      reported to have drunk green tea daily. The amount consumed per day varied considerably from
      low to high doses. The high prevalence of green tea consumption coupled with dose information
      (i.e low, moderate and high consumption) provides good opportunities to examine the
      relationships of green tea consumption and CHD.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study uses the Honolulu Heart Program data to examine the prospective association of
      green tea consumption to the incidence and mortality of CHD using multivariate analysis while
      controlling for the potential confounding effects of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and
      dietary nutrients.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
