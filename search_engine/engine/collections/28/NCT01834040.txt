      down through families. They may occur in childhood or adulthood. There are many different
      types of muscular dystrophy. They include:

      Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a form of muscular dystrophy that worsens quickly. Other
      muscular dystrophy (including Becker's muscular dystrophy) get worse much more slowly.

      Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a protein in the
      muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition.

      Symptoms usually appear before age 6 and may appear as early as infancy. They may include:

      Fatigue

      Learning difficulties (the IQ (intelligence quotient )can be below 75)

      Intellectual disability (possible, but does not get worse over time)

      Muscle weakness

      Begins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other
      areas of the body

      Difficulty with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping)

      Frequent falls

      Trouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs

      Weakness quickly gets worse

      Progressive difficulty walking

      Ability to walk may be lost by age 12, and the child will have to use a wheelchair

      Breathing difficulties and heart disease usually start by age 20
