      therapies are needed to prevent the high rates of relapse. Selegiline is a selective
      inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) and has been used clinically in combination with
      levodopa to treat Parkinson's disease. Selegiline permits the stabilization of dopamine (DA)
      levels in the brain by preventing the rapid degradation of DA by means of MAO B and is used
      as an adjunct to levodopa therapy causing a dose-sparing effect and enhancing dopaminergic
      transmission. Selegiline's effect on MAO B and the resulting effect on brain DA has
      interesting implications for the treatment of nicotine dependence because brain DA systems
      may play a key role in the mediation of reward learning behavior. Previous research suggests
      that the brains of living smokers show a 40% decrease in the level of MAO B relative to
      nonsmokers or former smokers. The purpose of this study is examine whether selegiline,
      administered in the form of a skin patch, is effective for smoking cessation.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatments: 1) transdermal selegiline
      patch (STS) or 2) placebo. Treatment with STS or placebo will be given for a period of 8
      weeks. Participants will be stratified by gender to evaluate the role that gender plays in
      moderating smoking cessation treatment. Study visits will take place once each week for 30 to
      45 minutes, and will include adverse events monitoring, biochemical verification of smoking
      status, and a physical exam. Follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 24 and 52 to determine
      response to treatment.
