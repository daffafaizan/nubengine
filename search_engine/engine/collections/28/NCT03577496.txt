      nausea and vomiting (PONV). Peppermint aromatherapy will be used preemptively to test for
      effectiveness, decreased PONV, and the ability to avoid anti-emetics. This study will seek to
      demonstrate that peppermint aromatherapy is a simple, cost effective way to prevent PONV
      after anesthesia. By decreasing the need for anti-emetics and incidence of PONV, patients may
      have a quicker recovery time and experience less side effects from anti-emetics, such as
      increased sedation. This problem is significant to patients and society as it may demonstrate
      that the inhalation of peppermint can ease PONV and decrease costs due to anti-emetics, wound
      dehiscence, and prolonged hospital stay. This study may lead to higher levels of patient
      satisfaction; if the patients are not nauseated they may be more satisfied with their care.
