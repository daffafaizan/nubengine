      age with AF accompanied by symptoms and morbidity, 2) the failure of anti-arrhythmic drug
      therapy to maintain sinus rhythm and reduce mortality, 3) the rapidly increasing application
      of radio-frequency catheter ablation without appropriate evidence-based validation, and 4)
      the expanding impact of AF on health care costs.
