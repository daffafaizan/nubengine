    
      Twelve patients with unilateral alveolar cleft will be enrolled in this randomized
      comparative study.

      The patients will be divided into two groups, the control (group A) who received illiac
      cancellous bone graft and study group who received a combination of bone marrow concentrate
      and illiac cancellous bone graft (group B).

      Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images will be done prior to surgery to asses preoperative alveolar
      defect volume. Six months postoperative CBCT images will be done and postoperative newly bone
      formed volume and density will be evaluated and bone formation ratio (BF%) will be calculated
      as follows: BF% = (formed volume/alveolar defect) Ã— 100%.
