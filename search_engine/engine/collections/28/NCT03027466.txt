      smoke as threatening if they think it suggests that they are unable to meet the challenges of
      cessation. When individuals experience such a threat to their sense of self-identity (e.g.,
      to their sense that they have integrity and/ or competence), they often respond defensively.
      Individuals have a tendency to react defensively to information that informs them that their
      behavior increases risk for a particular disease or negative health consequences.
      Self-affirmation a process through which individuals focus on their strengths and values can
      offset threats to the self and promote healthier behaviors, including smoking cessation. To
      the extent that relapse or difficulty quitting is perceived as a threat to self-identity,
      when individuals are presented with the opportunity to self-affirm they may perceive failure
      as less threatening, mitigating the motivation to downplay the importance of quitting.
      Preliminary evidence suggests that self-affirmation can be feasibly incorporated into an
      existing smoking cessation text message-based intervention, and may bolster cessation rates
      among users motivated to quit smoking. Here, we propose to extend that research by examining
      whether the addition of self-affirmation text messages to a smoking cessation app (Smoke Free
      UK) promotes smoking cessation, compared to standard of care (i.e., existing app content
      only). Importantly, self-affirmation material will be incorporated into the current app and
      will not change the goals or nature of the original texting program. We predict that the
      individuals in the self-affirmation condition will be more likely to report being smoke-free
      at the 1-month and 3-month follow-ups.
