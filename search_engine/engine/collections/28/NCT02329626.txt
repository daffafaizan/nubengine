      A. To assess whether metabolic abnormalities objectified by PET CT 18 FDH performed at rest
      at the onset of symptoms may be predictive of persistent disability at 6 months as measured
      by the EDSS, the NIHSS and WHO status.

      B. To assess whether metabolic abnormalities objectified by PET CT 18 FDH performed at rest
      at 3 months after diagnosis may be predictive of persistent motor disability at 6 months
      (EDSS, NIHSS, mRS, WHO) C. To search for and characterize any abnormalities of metabolism
      objectified in the initial PET CT 18 FDH predictive of persistent motor disability at 3
      months.

      D. To determine if there are persistent metabolic abnormalities 3 months post-diagnosis
      independently of the clinical course (marker trait).

      E. Define the brain areas whose metabolism is often altered in patients with motor conversion
      disorders.

      F. Establish a collection of biological samples from patients for future research studies of
      prognostic biomarkers of a motor conversion disorder.
