      reduced mortality as well as the risk of developing chronic heart failure. There are though
      still a large number of patients that develop symptoms of heart failure in the form of
      fatigue and breathlessness with physical exertion in spite of medical treatment. With the
      advance in stem cell technology there is now hope for the possibility of
      regenerating/repairing dead myocardial tissue, hence improving cardiac function.

      The current study is a pilot study that is going to precede a later double blinded randomized
      study. The aim of the study is to evaluate patient safety, optimize procedures, and to be
      used in power calculation in the design of the following study.
