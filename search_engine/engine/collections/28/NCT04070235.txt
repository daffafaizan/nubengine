      highly variable HCV genotype geographic distribution. A simple, universal,
      non-genotype-specific treatment regimen is preferred for anti-HCV treatment in clinical
      practice and public health. The combination regimen of SH229 and DCV is expected to
      completely suppress HCV replication in subjects chronically infected with HCV and achieve a
      sustained virologic response.
