      promote, there are problems regarding adherence, which can be related to several factors,
      among them, motivation. Alternative therapies can reflect on motivation and promote increased
      adherence to CR. In this context, virtual reality-based therapy (VRBT) appears as an option.
      Additionally, chronic hemodynamic and autonomic repercussions of VRBT in relation to CV still
      need to be investigated. Objective: To evaluate the chronic hemodynamic and autonomic
      repercussions of the insertion of VRBT in CR. To qualitatively analyze the perception of
      patients and physiotherapists regarding the use of TRV, as well as their association with CR,
      and through a new questionnaire that takes into account patients 'adherence, identifying
      which are the main barriers that influence patients' absences. Methods: cardiac patients or
      individuals with factors that regularly participate in CR will participate in this study.
      Patients will be randomly allocated to CR + VRBT intervention or keeping the normal routine.
      Interventions will be carried out three times a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome will
      be to assess chronic hemodynamic repercussions (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,
      oxygen saturation and perceived exertion using the Borg scale) and autonomic (linear and
      non-linear data). The secondary outcome consists of a qualitative assessment through a focus
      group with patients and a focus group with therapists, in addition, the new questionnaire
      developed to identify the influence of barriers on patients' adherence to CR will be applied.
