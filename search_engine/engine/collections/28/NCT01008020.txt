      physiological activities such as antiviral effects. Recent experimental studies have revealed
      that tea catechin extracts prevent influenza infection, but few studies have been conducted
      on the clinical effects of tea catechin consumption on the prophylaxis of influenza
      infection. Based on these backgrounds, we designed a prospective randomized controlled study
      to evaluate the effects of 5 months tea catechin consumption on the prophylaxis of influenza
      infection.
