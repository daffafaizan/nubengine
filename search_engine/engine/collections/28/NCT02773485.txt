      chemotherapy which has a median survival of 11.7 months (ABC-02 study). While this study
      included almost 60% of patients with cholangiocarcinomas (intrahepatic, extra hepatic and
      hilar), almost 73-76% of patients in each arm had metastases to begin with. And while the
      overall survival of the entire cohort was significantly improved by gemcitabine plus
      cisplatin compared to cisplatin alone, the hazard ratios for intrahepatic {0.57 (0.34-0.94)},
      extra hepatic {0.73 (0.43-1.23)} and hilar cholangiocarcinomas {0.59 (0.32-1.09)} were all
      insignificant. Even though concurrent chemoradiation+/= brachytherapy has been used for
      management of cholangiocarcinomas for more than 3 decades the lack of level I evidence
      prevents from it being recommended as the first line management across multidisciplinary
      clinics.

      While either modality alone rarely yields survival of more than 12 months, recent reports of
      improved median survival with combination of high dose radiation and systemic chemotherapy
      necessitates investigation into role of combination of high dose (chemo) radiation and
      systemic chemotherapy.

      All patients with diagnosis of nonmetastatic unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who fulfill the
      study eligibility criteria will be evaluated for study participation. Patients will undergo
      upfront randomization into one of the study arms (systemic chemotherapy alone vs Systemic
      chemotherapy+ High dose radiation) The study stratification criteria will be done according
      the primary site i.e. Intrahepatic vs Extrahepatic.
