      perfused or ballon catheters. This allows the recording of anorectal pressure on 2-3 sites.
      Recently, high resolution manometryu devices using > 36 pressure channels have been
      developped. The investigators therefore aim to evaluate the usefullness of the high
      resolution manometry in patient with fecal incontinence in terms of feasability and diagnosis
      accuracy
