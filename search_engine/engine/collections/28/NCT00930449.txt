    
      We have established a collaborative partnership between OISE, HSC, OPDS, and JVS to evaluate
      the effectiveness of a WM training program when conducted in a school setting. To determine
      whether the WM training program does improve WM, attention, behaviour, and/or academic
      achievement, we will compare its effects to those expected to result from two other
      intervention programs that focus on academic skills only: 1) a computerized software program
      known to improve math skills (Academy of MathÂ®); and 2) extra, individualized tutoring in an
      area of academic weakness supervised by a trained and experienced staff person. We will
      assess WM, related cognitive abilities, ADHD symptoms, academic achievement, before and after
      intervention, and also at 3- and 6-month follow-up to determine whether any improvements are
      sustained and increased after the training has finished.
