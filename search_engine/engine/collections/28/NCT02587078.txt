    
      Comparative, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized study.

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria (at Screening, see below for definition) will be
      randomized immediately in a ratio of 1:1 to either receive intravenous Volulyte® or
      Jonosteril® for fluid resuscitation (on RAND). Fluid resuscitation with study drug will be
      started immediately in order to reach initial hemodynamic stabilization. Assessment of the
      effects of fluid resuscitation to achieve the primary and secondary endpoints will be
      performed up to 24 hours following the randomization.

      Initial hemodynamic stabilization is defined as normalization of mean arterial pressure
      (MAP), central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) and PPV (pulse pressure variation) or
      response to PLR (passive leg rising) as defined below and maintaining this normalization over
      a period of 1 hour, with no increase in the infusion of vasopressors, or inotropic therapy
      and with ≤ 250ml of additional study drug administration within this 1 hour. The
      normalization of the parameters MAP and PPV (pulse pressure variation) or PLR (passive leg
      rising) and ScvO2 is defined as follows:

        -  MAP: ≥ 65 mmHg

        -  ScvO2: ≥ 70%

        -  PPV: ≤ 12% (premise: sinus rhythm, no spontaneous breathing efforts and mechanical
           ventilation with VT: 5 - < 6 ml/kg).

      If PPV is not applicable, response to PLR-manoeuvre is used (see below).

      ● PLR: < 10% change in cardiac output (CO)
