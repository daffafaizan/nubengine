      to their dramatic increase in popularity. However, very little is known about ECIGs,
      including what factors may make them more likely to be used and abused. Examining factors
      that influence nicotine yield, delivery, and subjective effects from ECIGs is essential to
      understanding their abuse liability. Limited pre-clinical research has revealed that nicotine
      yield may be influenced by the ratio of the two liquid vehicles, propylene glycol (PG) and
      vegetable glycerin (VG), most commonly found in ECIG solutions. Specifically, higher
      proportions of PG result in greater nicotine yields. However, the influence of PG:VG ratio on
      nicotine delivery and subjective effects associated with ECIG use has not been examined
      previously. The primary hypotheses are that higher proportions of PG will result in greater
      nicotine delivery and subjective effect profiles suggestive of higher abuse liability in ECIG
      users. Results from this project will result in further understanding of the factors that
      influence the abuse liability of ECIGs and could inform regulation of these products.
