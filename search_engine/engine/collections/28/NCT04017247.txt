      randomly to either routine oxytocin (intermittent) treatment or continuous oxytocin
      treatment.

      Both groups will follow the institutional oxytocin protocol. The primary dose of oxytocin is
      2.0 mU/min, with an incremental increase by 5.0 mU/min every 30 minutes, until 40.0 mU/min,
      tittered to a target of 3-5 contractions in a 10-minute period, or active labor (dilatation >
      6 cm). Women will be continuously monitored to fetal heart rate while oxytocin is
      administered.

      In the intermittent group, oxytocin will be discontinued after 6-8 hours if the patient does
      not go into active labor in that period of time. The second course of oxytocin will be
      renewed after 8-12 hours. In the continuous group, women will receive a continuous oxytocin
      infusion until delivery, unless there is an indication to stop the infusion, including;
      category II fetal tracing, uterine tachysystole (an average of more than 5 contractions in 10
      minutes for more than 30 minutes).

      During oxytocin infusion, sodium levels will be monitored every four hours. In cases where
      the maternal sodium is below 125 mmol/L oxytocin should be stopped. The decision regarding
      further oxytocin administration should be made following assessment of the woman's clinical
      condition and circumstances after discussion with a consultant obstetrician.
