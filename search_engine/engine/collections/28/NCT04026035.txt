      antimicrobial therapy in patients under hemodialysis with catheter. Specific emphasis is put
      on early availability of antimicrobial susceptibility results by Diagnostic laboratories to
      optimize the management of those difficult infections.

      Direct whole blood PCR could allow a rapid determination of bacterial susceptibility to
      antibiotics. The study is designed to assess the concordance of a direct whole blood PCR
      targeting staphylococcus and its susceptibility to oracillin with the classical
      microbiological approach of samples from hemodialysis patients with catheter suspected of
      septicemia. This innovative approach should allow a faster diagnostic allowing the clinicians
      to better tailor the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy which has been proven crucial
      for a good clinical management of the patients.

      Moreover, the use of an adequate antimicrobial therapy early in the management of the
      patients, should not only lead to a better clinical outcome but also avoid unnecessary
      prescriptions of drugs which are the main drivers of the emergence and spread of
      antimicrobial resistance.
