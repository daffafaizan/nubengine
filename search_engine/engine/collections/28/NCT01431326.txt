    
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the PK ( Pharmacokinetics) of understudied drugs
      administered to children per standard of care as prescribed by their treating caregiver. This
      will be accomplished by the collection of biological samples during the time of drug
      administration per standard of care as prescribed by the caregiver. The prescribing of drugs
      to children will not be part of this protocol.

      Aim #1: Evaluate the PK of understudied drugs currently being administered to children.

      Hypothesis #1: The PK of understudied drugs in children will differ from adults and within
      children according to pediatric age groups or special population.

      Aim #2: Explore the pharmacodynamics (PD) of understudied drugs currently being administered
      to children.

      Hypothesis #2: The PD of targeted drugs in children will differ from adults.

      Aim #3: Evaluate the influence of genetic factors, metabolic and protein profiles on
      therapeutic exposure.

      Hypothesis #3: Genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and metabolic and proteomic
      profiles will impact drug exposure in children.
