      investigators randomly assigned the two treatment arms and one placebo arm at 1:1:1 ratio. At
      baseline, anthropometric and biochemical evaluations were conducted including body weight,
      body composition (DXA and Fat CT), lipid profiles, and liver function test. The tablets were
      supplied to each participants under double-blind conditions. The investigators obtained blood
      and stool samples both baseline and final visit at 12 weeks. For improving compliance for
