      immune responses capable to control HIV infection. The administration of a conventional
      vaccine results in the expansion of peripheral clones. Concomitant administration of rhGH may
      boost this expansion and reconstitute specific T cell responses not achievable by vaccination
      alone. In this study we want to investigate whether the administration of rhGH expand T cell
      repertoire and whether there is an increase in the specific cellular responses to HIV-1 and
      recall antigens and, lately, whether this responses can be further amplified after
      immunization with tetanus toxoid and hepatitis A vaccines. This Hypothesis will be evaluated
      by the measurement of thymic volume, the expansion of na√Øve, memory and effector cell
      subsets, analysis of thymic emigrants (TRECs) before, during and after rhGH administration
      and vaccination. Moreover, T cell receptor rearrangement, specific antibodies and cellular
      responses to antigenic peptides will be determined.
