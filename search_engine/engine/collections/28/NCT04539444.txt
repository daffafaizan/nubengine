      T cells (CART) therapy in refractory/relapsed B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R/R B-NHL), the
      response can't usually last long and relapse occurs in a large proportion of patients who
      receive CART cells infusion. The main reasons of relapse might be tumor antigen loss and a
      lack of CART cell persistence. Currently, preclinical studies have shown that there is a
      synergistic effect between CAR-T cell therapy and anti-PD1 pathway, and it did have efficacy
      in clinic. In parallel, the combined use of CART-19 and CART-22 cells has a better potential
      to reduce antigen escape and increase anti-tumor activity. Therefore, the combination of
      CD19/22 CART and PD-1 inhibitor is one of the ways to improve the therapeutic effect of CART
      cells. This study was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of CD19/22 CART cells in
      R/R B-NHL.
