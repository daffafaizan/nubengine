      of protein sources with lower phosphorus bioavailability such as pulses and nuts, focus on
      phosphorus to protein ratios and the avoidance of all phosphate additives.

      Method: Controlled crossover feeding study in 8 HD patients. On one day, participants were
      directly observed eating a standard low phosphorous diet and on the other day, a modified low
      phosphorus diet. The modified diet included beef and less dairy, with a lower phosphorus to
      protein ratio, as well as plant-based protein, whole grains, pulses and nuts containing
      phytates which reduces phosphorus bioavailability. Both diets were tailored for each
      participant to provide 1.1g protein/kg ideal body weight. Participants provided fasting
      bloods before breakfast, a pre-prandial sample before lunch and samples at one hour intervals
      for the four hours after the meal, for analysis of phosphate, potassium and intact
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH).
