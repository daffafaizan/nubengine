      caesarean section especially in obese patients.

      The aim of this study is to find out the correlation between baseline PI and post spinal
      hypotension in obese parturient.

      Methods After approval of ethical committee and written informed consent, fifty Parturients
      aged between 18- 40 years, ASA I and II with term singleton pregnancies with BMI between 25
      &40 admitted for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were recruited in this prospective,
      observational study. The primary outcome is the correlation between baseline perfusion index
      and post spinal hypotension. The secondary outcome is the correlation between BMI and the
      incidence of hypotension after spinal anesthesia. Heart rate, blood pressure, perfusion index
      before and after spinal induction using Masimo device, level of sensory block, dose of
      ephedrine required to correct hypotension, dose of atropine required to correct bradycardia,
      incidence of nausea, vomiting and shivering were recorded.
