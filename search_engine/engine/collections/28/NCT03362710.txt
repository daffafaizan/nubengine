    
      Patients referred for an arterial vascular investigations of the lower limbs will be
      included.

      After signing the consent, all included patients will be assessed by the examination series,
      among which ABI measurement and an arterial Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs +/-
      transcutaneous oxygen pressure recording in case of suspected critical limb ischemia.
      Following the visit patients will be classified as have or not PAD and in case of PAD
      classified for the severity of PAD on the basis of the investigation results.

      Blinded to the results of the vascular laboratory test, a technician will:

      Measure ABI with an automatic sphygmomanometer.

      Examination series:

        1. Skin temperature on the back of the foot with infra-red thermometry

        2. Toe saturometry

        3. ABI with an automatic sphygmomanometry

        4. Skin Recoloration time at the foot
