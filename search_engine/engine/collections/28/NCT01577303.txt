      focusing on aversive stimuli or avoiding aversive stimuli. Computerized training programs
      have been developed to implicitly direct the users attention towards a neutral,
      non-threatening stimuli. In this study, such a program will be provided to 128 participants
      that meet the diagnostic criteria for social phobia. It will be compared with a program that
      implicitly directs the users' attention towards threatening cues. Pre/post-measurements will
      be compared. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups, receiving one of the two
      variants of the cognitive bias modification program or a control training.
