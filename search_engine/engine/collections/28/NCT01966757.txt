    
      Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in
      children characterized by seizures, blindness, ataxia, myoclonia and loss of cognition. There
      are 12 clinical types identified with a concurrent genetic abnormality. The diagnosis is
      determined by gene testing and skin biopsy findings although genetic testing has supplanted
      skin biopsy in most cases. Numberous studies have confirmed the presence of sleep disorder in
      patients with NCL but these cases were documented over a decade ago. The investigators would
      like to study the prevalence of sleep disorders in this group of patients. The investigators
      will distribute a Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) to the family of the patient
      to complete and provide a information regarding the patient's sleep. In addition to the
      validated sleep questionnaire a separate demographic questionnaire will be given to the
      family to identify the type of NCL, presence or absence of blindness, presence or absence of
      seizures, interventions tried to treat sleep disturbance. The last questions of the study are
      asking for the presence or absence of Restless Leg Syndrome symptoms.
