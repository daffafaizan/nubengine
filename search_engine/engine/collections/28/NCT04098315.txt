    
      The PRESTIGIO Register consists of a systematic and continuous collection of data on
      clinical, laboratory and treatment characteristics of patients with documented resistance to
      the 4 classes of antiretroviral drugs that meet the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      All the clinical centres of Infectious Diseases of the different Italian regions can
      participate in the implementation of the Registry. Based on an analysis conducted on data
      collected in an AIFA register, established for the purpose of monitoring the use of
      dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg Bis in Die (BID) and containing about 200 patients with the criteria
      specified in this protocol, the size currently conceivable for this register in Italy is
      about 300 patients.

      The collection of clinical information and biological samples will begin once the Ethics
      Committee of the participating centers has approved the participation in the registry and
      will continue for at least three years.
