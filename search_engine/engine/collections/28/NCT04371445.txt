      inflammation following vitreoretinal surgery. However, topical treatments are limited by the
      potential for patient non-adherence and variation in drug concentrations due to the
      intermittent nature of application. A corticosteroid insert, placed following surgery,
      provides the advantages of reliable and continuous drug delivery without the need for
      patients to adhere to a treatment regimen. Recently, DEXTENZA®, a dexamethasone
      intracanalicular insert was FDA-approved for the treatment of inflammation and pain following
      ophthalmic surgery. DEXTENZA® is placed into the canaliculus via the lower punctum and is
      designed to release steroid medication for 30 days.

      The data is limited regarding the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA® for postoperative
      management of vitreoretinal surgery. Herein, the aim of this study is to assess the
      management of pain and inflammation following retinal surgery when using a dexamethasone
      implant compared with topical steroids.
