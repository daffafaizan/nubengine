      have post stroke cognitive impairment. This study looked at the improvement of cognitive
      symptoms in people who take actovegin compared to placebo.

      The study enrolled 503 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient
      and study doctor during the study:

        -  Actovegin-2000 mg intravenous solution; 2- 200 mg tablets 3 times a day

        -  Placebo intravenous solution; tablets (dummy inactive) - this is a solution or tablet
           that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants received daily intravenous infusions in the hospital (up to a maximum of 20
      infusions) followed by 2-200 mg tablets three times a day for the remainder of the 6-month
      treatment period.

      This multi-centre trial was conducted in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia. The overall time to
      participate in this study was 12 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic plus
      a final visit after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
