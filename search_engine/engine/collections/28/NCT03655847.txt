      anesthesia induction and maintenance, and DEX was injected intravenously 30 minutes before
      the end of operation. Single bolus is for more than 1 minute. In the first case, the dosage
      of DEX was 0.1 ug/kg. If the cardiovascular reaction was positive (MAP or heart rate was more
      than 20% before intravenous injection), the dosage of DEX in the next patient decreased by a
      gradient (0.05ug/kg). If the cardiovascular response was negative, the next patient increased
      the dose of DEX by a gradient (0.1ug/kg); if a patient withdrew from the study, the next
      patient received the same dose as the patient who withdrew. There were 8 turning points of
      cardiovascular reaction and the test was completed. The changes of blood pressure and heart
      rate per minute in 10min were recorded after single bolus. The dosimetric map of patients
      with DEX was drawn, and the ED50 and ED95 were calculated by probit probabilistic unit
      regression (Bills method).
