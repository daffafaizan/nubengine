      Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. 850 70-84 year-old cognitively normal older adults with
      hearing loss will be randomized 1:1 to the hearing intervention (hearing needs assessment,
      fitting of hearing devices, education/counseling) or successful aging intervention
      (individual sessions with a health educator covering healthy aging topics). Post baseline,
      participants will be followed semi-annually for 3 years.

      Outcomes will include assessments of cognition, social functioning, physical functioning, and
      quality of life.
