      and/or Streptococcus pyogenes, more recently with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA), due to impaired barrier function. As cutaneous infections such as MRSA and others may
      complicate the treatment of atopic dermatitis, the use of topical antibiotics have become
      very important to avoid oral antibiotics and their side effects, especially in the pediatric
      population.

      The current study will investigate the safety and efficacy of Altabax ointment use for
      treatment of secondarily infected lesions caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus
      pyogenes in both the pediatric and adult populations.
