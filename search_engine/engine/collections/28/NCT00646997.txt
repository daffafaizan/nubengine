      major complication with a prevalence of 10-50%. Although the men mechanism is not known, in
      recent studies, age and left atrial function have been demonstrated as the most responsible
      factors. Velocity vector imaging (VVI) is a new modality which may give accurate and detailed
      information on both left atrial segmental and global function. In this study, our aim was to
      assess preoperative left atrial function by using three different echocardiographic
      modalities, VVI, tissue Doppler imaging and conventional echocardiography and evaluate the
      relation between the left atrial functions and the development of post-operative atrial
      fibrillation after CABG.
