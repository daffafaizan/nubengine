      clinical presentation is considered "abdominal pain out of proportion to examination") that
      may be under-recognized in the Emergency Department. Early identification and treatment is
      essential to improve outcome as mortality rate is attested around 80% if untreated within few
      hours from onset. The investigators aim to review the emergency department's clinical notes
      of patients discharged from hospital in 2014 and 2015 diagnosed with acute mesenteric
      ischemia. Furthermore the investigators will consider patients admitted for "abdominal pain"
      in the same time frame without acute mesenteric ischemia and we will compare presentation
      symptoms, medical history, medications, vitals, laboratory markers and imaging finding of the
      two groups. From this comparison, the investigators will be able to clarify the incidence
      among general population and among patients presenting acute abdominal pain. Finally, using
      multivariate analysis, the investigators may identify those variables predictive of acute
      mesenteric ischemia. This study will be held in three university hospitals and all data
      analyzed together.
