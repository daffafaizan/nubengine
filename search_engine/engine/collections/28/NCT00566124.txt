    
      In this randomized, double-blind, euglycemic glucose clamp study, 10 healthy male volunteers
      received a subcutaneous injection of 0.4 U/kg insulin detemir, insulin glargine or NPH
      insulin on three separate study days in a cross-over design. After insulin administration,
      plasma glucose was maintained at 0.3 mmol/l below fasting level for 24 hours by manually
      adjusted glucose infusion. C-peptide, insulin, NEFA and counter regulatory hormones were
      measured throughout the clamp period. Endogenous glucose release (EGR) was assessed by the
      isotope dilution technique (3-3H-glucose).
