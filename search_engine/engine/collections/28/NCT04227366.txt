    
      BCD-089-3/SOLAR is the international, multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled phase III
      clinical study.

      The main period of the study (Weeks 0-24) is blinded; study subjects will receive
      BCD-089/placebo.

      At Week 24 the study will become open-label and all patients will receive BCD-089 once a week
      for 4 weeks. At week 28 patients who achieved the RA remission at week 24 will be switched to
      BCD-089 Q2W dosing regimen and will receive it through Week 51. Patients who failed to
      achieve remission at week 24 will receive BCD-089 once a week through Week 51.
