      cardiovascular disease. While bypass surgery is effective in restoring blood flow in the
      short-term, 30 to 50 percent of venous bypass grafts eventually become blocked or fail.
      Within the first year after a CABG procedure, it is estimated that between 15 and 30% of
      saphenous vein grafts fail (i.e., ≥ 75% reduction in flow within the graft), due to intimal
      hyperplasia at the anastomosis sites. There is currently no approved treatment to prevent
      venous graft failure. These patients may frequently undergo a second bypass surgery if the
      extent of graft failure(s) is sufficiently severe to lead to uncontrolled angina pectoris. It
      is clear that a second CABG procedure in a patient represents a higher operative mortality
      rate than the first procedure. Venous graft failure in CABG is a major unmet medical-surgical
      problem.

      AVI has previously focused some of its Neugene® products in the area of preventing
      cardiovascular stenosis. This application of antisense targeted to to inhibit the c-myc gene
      has previously been demonstrated to prevent sequelae of intimal hyperplasia following
      endovascular injury. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether immersion of the
      excised saphenous vein in a novel anti-c-myc antisense drug (AVI-5126) solution will prevent
      subsequent graft failure at 1 year, compared to physiological saline (placebo) prior to graft
      anastomosis.
