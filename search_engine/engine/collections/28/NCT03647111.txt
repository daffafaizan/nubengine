      non squamous non small cell lung cancer with positive ALK rearrangement.This study aims to
      explore the efficacy and safety of clozotinib as a first-line therapy for advanced
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with ALK-positive mutations in the real world. Among
      them, ALK positive was based on NGS test results, exploring the new drug resistance mechanism
      of ALK under clozotinib treatment mode and consistency between plasma and tissue detection
      driving genes, and finally assessing the role of plasma dynamic detection driving gene
      mutation spectrum in predicting disease progression risk. A retrospective study of 120
      patients with advanced NSCLC using clozotinib ALK positive mutation was conducted to observe
      the efficacy and safety of clozotinib regimen in the real world.
