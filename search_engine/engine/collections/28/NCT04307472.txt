    
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Statins
      have been demonstrated to be an effective tool for reducing the risk of CVD-related events
      and mortality, but statins are often not prescribed for patients that meet evidence-based
      guidelines. In this study, the investigators will evaluate nudges to clinicians, patients, or
      both to initiate statin prescriptions for patients that meet the United States Preventive
      Task Force guidelines, patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
      condition, and patients with a history of familial hyperlipidemia. In partnership with the
      health system, this will be conducted as a 4-arm factorial, cluster randomized trial to
      evaluate the effect of the interventions.
