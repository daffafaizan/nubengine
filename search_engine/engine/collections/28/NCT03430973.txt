      Only six driving simulation experiments have been conducted, and one of these experiment was
      conducted by the investigators (Bushman, Kerwin, Whitlock, & Weisenberger, 2017).

      The proposed research will test the effects of seven situational risk factors: (1) racing
      video games (Experiment 2), (2) racial bumper stickers (i.e., "Black Lives Matter" bumper
      stickers for white motorists vs. "All Lives Matter" bumper stickers for black motorists;
      Experiment 3), (3) political bumper stickers (i.e., "Donald Trump for President 2016" for
      Democrat motorists vs. "Hillary Clinton for President 2016" for Republican motorists;
      Experiment 4), (4) alcohol-related cues (i.e., a case of beer vs. water on the passenger
      seat; Experiment 5), (5) music with violent lyrics (Experiment 6), (6) music with an upbeat
      tempo (Experiment 6), and (7) roadside trash (Experiment 7). The proposed research will also
      test the effects of five situational protective factors: (1) racial bumper stickers (i.e.,
      "Black Lives Matter" for black motorists vs. "All Lives Matter" for white motorists;
      Experiment 3), (2) political bumper stickers (i.e., "Donald Trump for President 2016" for
      Republican motorists vs. "Hillary Clinton for President 2016" for Democrat motorists;
      Experiment 4), (3) music with prosocial lyrics (Experiment 6), (4) music with a calm tempo
      (Experiment 6), and (5) roadside vegetation (Experiment 7).
