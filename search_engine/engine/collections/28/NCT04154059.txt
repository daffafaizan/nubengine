    
      A randomized controlled trial will be performed with 76 patients with knee osteoarthritis.
      The participants will be randomly assigned into either a control group (no exercises; they
      will keep their recommended clinical treatment) or an intervention group which will receive
      8-week physical therapy exercises, three times per week, under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist. Every exercise has its own progression depending on the subjects' execution,
      increasing in intensity and difficulty.

      The subjects will be evaluated in 3 different moments (Baseline, immediately after treatment
      and 8 weeks follow-up).

      The hypothesis of this study is that the intervention group will decrease pain and medication
      intake, and improve functional performance, increase isometric strength of the feet and
      production of beneficial biomechanical changes during walking compared to the control group.
