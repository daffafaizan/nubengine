      sufficiently effective to control overweight and obesity to be approved and subsidized by
      French national health insurance. However, good quality scientific evidence is still required
      to support the benefit of spa therapy. An unpublished pilot study conducted in 2004, in
      several French spa resorts, showed that an additional 25% decrease in BMI was obtained for
      overweight and obese individuals enrolled in spa therapy as compared to individuals receiving
      classic weight management (-1.4 kg/mÂ² and -1.05 kg/m2 respectively). However, no scientific
      conclusions can be drawn in the absence of relevant methodological and clinical information.
      This multicenter, controlled trial was designed to obtain sufficient statistical power to
      assess the benefits of spa therapy based on an evidence- based medicine approach.

      The primary objective of this study was to assess whether a 3- week course of spa therapy is
      effective to achieve sustained weight loss over a period of 14 months among overweight and
      obese individuals
