      devastating causes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), prone to acute rebleeding with poor
      clinical outcomes despite current surgical or endovascular treatment. Flow diversion (PED FD)
      with the Pipeline Endovascular Device (PED) is a promising treatment alternative to
      conventional management options.

      The DIVERT trial is designed to provide a prudent, controlled clinical framework for offering
      the PED FD , a promising yet unproven option in the care of patients with acute blood
      blister-like or dissecting vertebral aneurysms. DIVERT is a care trial, designed as a simple,
      pragmatic, multicenter, randomized trial integrated into daily practice with inclusive
      selection criteria.

      The investigators hypothesize that PED FD can decrease poor outcomes from 30 to 15%, compared
      to 'best standard treatment' (BST). BST is chosen prior to randomization amongst 4 options:
      observation, coiling with or without stenting, parent vessel occlusion or surgical clipping
      or wrapping. Patients are enrolled within 48 hours of SAH using standard 1:1 randomization
      between PED FD and BST after informed consent has been obtained from the patient or surrogate
      decision maker(s). Patients for whom no other option than PED FD appears feasible and safe
      will be included in a registry conducted alongside the trial.

      Blister-like aneurysms and intradural dissections presenting with SAH have a high propensity
      for rebleeding and outcomes are poor in approximately one third of the cases, despite
      treatment using surgical or endovascular techniques.
