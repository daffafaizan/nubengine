      olfactory bulb. So, the involvement of common GABA pathway implies a possible interaction of
      general anesthetics with olfactory function.

      olfactory identification is an associative memory which is found to be facilitated by action
      of melatonin. involvement of GABA receptor in the transfer of light information from
      suprachiasmatic nuclei to pineal gland suggests possible interaction of melatonin and
      anesthetic agents.

      the aim of the study is to evaluate the possible neurotoxicity of sevoflurane,isoflurane,and
      propofol based anesthesia guided by olfactory changes
