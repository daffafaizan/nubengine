      healthy adults 18 to < 65 years of age. The study was designed to evaluate the kinetics of
      the immune responses generated by each of the study products in order to determine the best
      sampling time for future studies. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a
      single dose of either CAIV-T, inactivated influenza virus vaccine (TIV), or placebo.
