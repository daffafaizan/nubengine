      who must achieve an early recovery with minimal adverse effects. Within a multimodal
      strategy, the work hypothesis is based on comparing the analgesic efficacy of two regional
      techniques in patients undergoing nephrectomy, in terms of quality of postoperative recovery,
      pain control, absence of adverse effects and ease of performance.
