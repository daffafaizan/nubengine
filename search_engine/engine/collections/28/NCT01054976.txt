      prospective study investigating the effect of galantamine on the attention of Alzheimer's
      dementia patients. The objectives of this study include the evaluation of the relationship
      between change in attention after 4 weeks of galantamine administration and to investigate
      the effect of study drug after 12 weeks administration (the difference in the improvement of
      attention after the administration of galantamine). The secondary objective of this study is
      to clarify the causal relationship between improvement of attention and activities of daily
      living (ADL). The design of this study is prospective, open-label, multi-center study. Study
      populations are probable Alzheimer's dementia patients diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA (National
      Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's disease
      and Related Disorders Association), DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders) criteria. The efficacy of study drug will be assessed by evaluating cognitive
      function, attention and behavioral symptoms before and after the treatment using the
      following assessment tools: ADAS-K-cog11 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive
      subscale), computerized attention test and activities of daily living. Safety evaluations
      include adverse event monitoring and clinical lab tests. The patient is administered oral
      galantamine 8 mg/day for the first 4 weeks and then 16 mg/day. The dose of galantamine is
      increased up to 24 mg if tolerated.
