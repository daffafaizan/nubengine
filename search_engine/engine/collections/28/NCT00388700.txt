      anti-tumor activity of 5-FU in mice. 5-FU is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat
      tumors. A Phase I study of 40 patients showed that DAVANAT in different doses plus 5-FU was
      well tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors who failed standard, approved
      treatments.
