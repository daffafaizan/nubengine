      types of surgery. Among all perioperative risk factors, the association between perioperative
      hypotension and adverse clinical outcomes in noncardiac and cardiac surgery patients is well
      defined.

      Numerous factors are responsible for development of perioperative hypotension. They include
      but not limited to perioperative use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and calcium
      channel blockers, hypovolemia, hemodilution, bleeding and inflammatory response syndrome.

      To date, several evidence has been accumulated indicating that intraoperational hypertension
      can be hazardous.

      It was shown that even short durations (1 to 5 min) of an intraoperative mean arterial
      pressure < 55 mmHg were associated with myocardial injuries and acute kidney injury (AKI).

      Results of recent large retrospective cohort study conducted in adult patients who underwent
      cardiac surgery requiring CPB showed that postoperative stroke was strongly associated with
      sustained mean arterial pressure of less than 64 mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass.

      In patients undergoing CABG the overall incidence of combined cardiac and neurologic
      complications was significantly lower in the group where MAP during CPB was relatively high
      (80-110 mmHg) than in the low pressure group (MAP 50-60 mmHg) (p = 0.026). For each of the
      individual outcomes the trend favored the high pressure group.

      Therefore, MAP may be an important intraoperative therapeutic hemodynamic target to reduce
      the incidence of complications in patients undergoing CPB.
