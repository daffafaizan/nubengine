      death and elevated intracranial pressure. Since dexamethasone has been found to reduce
      intracranial pressure resulting from other forms of meningitis, it may be of benefit in AIDS
      patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

      Patients are randomized to receive dexamethasone or placebo every 6 hours for 72 hours (days
      1 through 3). Additionally, standard antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine
      is given for 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole for 8 weeks. Lumbar punctures will be performed
      daily on days 1 through 3, on days 7 and 14, and at week 10.
