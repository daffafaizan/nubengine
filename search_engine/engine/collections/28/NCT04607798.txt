      and peri-menopausal women are also affected by symptoms associated with GSM, the etiology
      being similar in that there is an interruption in normal estrogen production resulting in a
      hypoestrogenic state. Symptoms related to GSM include vaginal dryness, decreased lubrication,
      decreased vaginal elasticity, irritation and discomfort of the vaginal and vulvar tissues in
      general that can affect sexual health. Traditional treatments, such as hormone replacement
      therapy (HRT), are often the treatment of choice however come with potential risks and many
      women are not suitable candidates, or have contraindications to its use. Development of new
      technologies to address these concerns is warranted.

      RF energy-based treatment for symptoms of GSM has been used with success to promote
      elasticity restoration and improve moisture of the vaginal mucosa, and is well established in
      literature for the treatment of facial and neck laxity, stress urinary incontinence and skin
      tightening of tissue. Several studies show favorable results with improvement of vaginal
      laxity and sexual function with RF treatment. The addition of pulsed electromagnetic field
      (PEMF) energy to multi-polar RF therapy has also been shown to enhance the results of the RF
      therapy.

      RF therapy has already been reported to be successful in treatment of symptoms related to
      elasticity restoration and improve moisture of the vaginal mucosa. This study will
      investigate whether adding PEMF to RF therapy is safe and efficacious for the treatment of
      symptoms related to GSM and sexual health.
