      for liver transplantation in the United States. Patients who have HCV will always carry the
      virus in their body. If patients respond to treatment, the virus is no longer active. This
      means that although the virus is still present, it is not currently causing damage to their
      liver.

      Because recurrence of HCV is virtually universal in HCV positive transplant recipients and is
      associated with long term, possibly lethal complications, the search for the most appropriate
      therapies must also include methods to prevent or minimize recurrence or disease progression,
      if the goal of improving long term outcomes for these patients is to be achieved.

      Corticosteroids and high doses of immunosuppressive agents have been associated with
      increased rates of HCV recurrence. Finding a regimen that provides adequate immunosuppression
      to prevent early and late rejection episodes, and minimizes steroid usage as well as high
      doses of other immunosuppressive agents is highly desirable.

      This study is being conducted to determine the most effective immunosuppressive regimen that
      will prevent allograft rejection, minimize adverse events and at the same time, prevent or
      reduce the incidence of HCV recurrence following liver transplant.
