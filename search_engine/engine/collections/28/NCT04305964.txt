    
      Patients with an established diagnosis of OSA with apnea/hypopnea-index (AHI)< 20/ hour sleep
      from the ENT department are recruited and informed about the study. After obtaining informed
      consent and patient inclusion, a baseline portable sleep monitoring at home using
      WatchPAT™300 for one night is performed. During the next visit the objective size and
      position of the stent is determined under direct visualization using fiberoptic
      nasolaryngoscopy. Subsequently, the patients will receive a Nastent® Starter kit (containing
      6 different stent sizes of Nastent®, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150 and 155mm) to gradually get
      accustomed to the stent and to find the right size for them. During the following
      consultation, a Nastent® classic kit (containing 7 stents of the same size, each can be used
      for two consecutive nights) is given to the patients to be used for 14 consecutive nights.
      During the last night of this 14-night period, a follow-up home portable sleep monitoring
      evaluation using WatchPAT™300 is performed with Nastent® in situ. Afterwards, during the
      final visit at the outpatient clinic, acceptance of the therapy with Nastent® by the patients
      is evaluated, and the decision of whether to continue the therapy and to proceed to the
      purchase of this product as a long-term treatment for the patient or not, is made.
