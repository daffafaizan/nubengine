      administered as a "challenge" to healthy, CMV-seronegative, adult subjects who previously
      received the CMV immunotherapeutic trivalent pDNA-based vaccine, VCL-CT02, given by
      intradermal or intramuscular routes as described in the following table; these subjects have
      been followed for 32 weeks.

      Table 6.1 Subject Distribution Group Formulation Dosing Regimen (day) Dose per
      Injection(Administered to the deltoid region) Route of Administration Number of Subjects

        1. VCL-CT02 0, 28, 56 1.0 mg Intramuscular (IM) 6

        2. VCL-CT02 0, 28, 56 100 μg/injection × 2 injections Intradermal (ID) 11 Total 17

      Up to 10 subjects from Groups 1 and 2 will be approached for enrollment in the current
      protocol. If a subject consents and meets all eligibility criteria, the subject will receive
      Towne (3000 pfu subcutaneously) between 9 and 15 months after the subject's first dose of
      VCL-CT02. Safety will be monitored and Both antibody to CMV gB and T-cell responses to CMV
      antigens will be measured at specified intervals for 252 days post Towne challenge.
