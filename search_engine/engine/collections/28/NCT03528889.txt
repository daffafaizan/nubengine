      treatment includes soft tissue and bony correction. Especially the bony procedures e.g.
      femoral extension and derotation osteotomies have proven to be effective both in short term
      and long term evaluation. Nonetheless there is still a relevant number of patients that
      suffer from over- or under-correction and recurrence over time. The reasons are diverse and
      include false measurement of the amount of extension and/or derotation in OR.

      The study now evaluates electromagnetic tracking for femoral extension and derotation to
      improve these results.

      The patients are recruited from the outpatients department and included if they meet the
      criteria.

      A baseline rotational CT or MRI scan and a 3D gait analysis are performed preoperatively. The
      patients are randomized into a electromagnetic tracking group or a classical goniometer
      group. The extension and derotation are measured with the EMT system or with a classic
      Moeltgen goniometer in the OR. Goal is to achieve the planned amounts of extension and
      derotation more accurately.

      The surgical procedure follows standard rules and does not need alterations because of the
      study.

      After the operation a second CT or MRI scan is performed and the extension and derotation are
      precisely evaluated by two raters and later compared to the results of the intraoperative
      electromagnetic tracking system. One year postoperative a second 3D gait analysis is
      performed to measure and compare the functional and dynamic outcome.
