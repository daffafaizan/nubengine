      clinicians should use the results of a knowledge synthesis, such as systematic reviews and
      meta-analyses, to inform decision-making. Pairwise meta-analyses are limited, however, by the
      availability of RCTs that directly compare interventions. This is troublesome for knowledge
      users who require results from comparisons of multiple interventions to inform
      decision-making. To address this concern, the use of network meta-analyses (NMAs) is
      increasing in healthcare the literature. NMAs are a useful tool because they can summarize
      results from numerous studies and interventions. It is unclear how NMA results should be
      presented to increase the likelihood of clinicians understanding and using the results to
      improve health outcomes. Thus, a randomized controlled trial of NMA plots will be conducted.
      Participants will be randomized to either the rank-heat plot (intervention) or SUCRA plots
      (control) that present the same NMA results of a study that explored the effectiveness of
      quality improvement interventions for falls prevention. Outcomes will be ascertained via an
      online survey. The RCT will take place in an online environment and will require each
      participant to partake in a single session. This study will help guide best practices for the
      presentation of reviews to improve the uptake and use of NMA.
