      and fluorouracil has a detectable preventive effect on relapse in patients with esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma compared with surgery alone.(J Clin Oncol 2003;21:4592-4596)
      Therefore the standard treatment for stage II and III esophageal cancer is adjuvant
      chemotherapy after surgery.
