      common benign laryngeal neoplasm in children. Although RRP is rarely fatal, the disease
      requires prolonged, extensive medical and surgical treatment, and causes physical and
      emotional suffering in affected children and their families. Although recurrent respiratory
      papillomatosis is a relatively unusual problem, it accounts for significant health are
      expenditures.The goal of management of RRP is control of the disease, preservation of the
      voice and prevention of major complication .The purpose of study will identify risk factors
      for more severe juvenile RRP through prospective evaluation of a pediatric population in
      Thailand by the employing a protocol that includes staging of disease severity , as well as
      HPV genotyping.

      Objective:

        -  To identify the genotypes of HPV isolated from Thai RRP patients

        -  To compare staging and severity with HPV genotypes

        -  To correlate the following characteristics of the Thai RRP patients with the HPV
           genotypes
