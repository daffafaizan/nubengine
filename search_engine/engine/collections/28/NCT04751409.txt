      I. To evaluate whether a risk-based limited follow-up surveillance is associated with reduced
      patient anxiety compared to risk-based intense surveillance.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the impact of reduced surveillance in low-risk patients on overall survival,
      time to local or distant recurrence, anxiety at early and late time-points, out of pocket
      costs, and number of missed or extra clinic visits, compared to the risk-based intense
      follow-up in both low-risk and high-risk patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on risk status.

      GROUP 1 (LOW RISK): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo intense follow-up every 3 months for 2 years consisting of restaging
      with computed tomography (CT)-chest and imaging of the primary site.

      ARM II: Patients undergo limited follow-up every 6 months for 2 years consisting of restaging
      with either CT-chest or chest x-ray (CXR) and imaging of the primary site.

      GROUP 2 (HIGH RISK): Patients undergo intense follow-up every 3 months for 2 years as in
      Group 1, Arm I.
