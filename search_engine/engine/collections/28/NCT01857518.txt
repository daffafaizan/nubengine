      and cognitive functions in adulthood. The pathophysiology of mood disorders has recently been
      associated with maturation changes in brain networks, but little is known on the early brain
      structure changes associated with depression appearing during this major brain maturation
      period.

      The hypothesis of altered structural integrity of limbic prefrontal pathways emerges from the
      literature on depression, but it is unknown whether it is also detectable in adolescents with
      depression. Thus, we aim to investigate WM and GM structure and anatomy, and functional
      correlates of behavioral responses in depressed adolescents.

      40 adolescents with a Major Depressive Episode will be investigated using structural T1
      magnetic-resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), at inclusion and after
      one-year follow-up. Additionally, they will be investigated with fMRI.

      Covariation patterns between neuroimaging and behavioural/clinical variables will be
      assessed.
