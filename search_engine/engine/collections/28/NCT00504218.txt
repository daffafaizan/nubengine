      quality of life issues, physical and psychosocial development and overall prognosis in
      pediatric patients diagnosed with neoplasms as well as in patients s/p bone marrow transplant
      throughout their lifespan. In addition, several of the new, molecularly designed therapies
      for neoplasms may interact with endocrine signaling; these include receptors and/or their
      ligands for growth and/or proliferation factors, and disruptors of steroid hormone
      interactions. The present study serves as a natural history protocol.

      As a natural history, this protocol allows our Institute to care for pediatric and adult
      patients with endocrine related complications associated with prior cancer therapy and/or
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for the purposes of:

      Training our fellows, residents and students in the identification and management of
      endocrine abnormalities developing in patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for
      neoplasms and/or who have received HSCT at the NIH-Clinical center.

      Developing new clinical studies for the recognition and therapy of endocrine side effects
      related to cancer therapy and/or HSCT: this protocol will eventually lead to new, separate
      protocols that will address specific aspects of endocrinopathies in childhood cancer
      survivors and HSCT survivors.

      The protocol will serve as the basis for outpatient clinics that will function within the
      context of the pediatric and adult endocrine outpatient clinics: every eligible patient
      referred to the endocrine service from the NCI, NHLBI, and other NIH institutions and centers
      will be enrolled in this study, which for the first time will create an endocrine database
      for these patients. As stated in our aims above, it is our hope that the present
      investigation will serve as an incubator of further research-focused studies with the
      ultimate goal of improving the life of children and adults who have been cured of their
      underlying neoplasms as well as those individuals who are recipients of an HSCT.
