      and social life of patients and society. Every year 200 000 to 250 000 patients suffer a
      stroke in Germany. Only a small number of the stroke survivors recover to a degree that
      allows them to return into their professional and private life. Despite significant efforts
      to develop novel and efficient treatment strategies the level of functional regeneration is
      still not satisfying. Thus, the development of innovative and effective treatment strategies
      will have a major impact for the patients' life, the society and the public health system.

      Within the proposed project an innovative, non-invasive and cost effective interventional
      strategy, based on the combination of a specific rehabilitative training and brain
      stimulation by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), will be used to enhance
      functional regeneration in stroke patients. The intervention will be applied in an early
      stage in which plasticity, cortical reorganization and functional improvement is most
      pronounced. We hypothesize that the combination of anodal tDCS delivered to the motor cortex
      of the affected hemisphere combined with training over a period of two weeks in the subacute
      stage after stroke will significantly enhance cortical plasticity, functional regeneration
      and long-term outcome determined by clinical and functional outcome measures compared with
      Placebo stimulation.
