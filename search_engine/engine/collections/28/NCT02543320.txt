      I. Determine the effects of an individualized LORETA (low resolution electromagnetic
      tomography) Z score neurofeedback program on changes in brain function using EEG
      (electroencephalography), qEEG (quantitative electroencephalography), and LORETA from
      immediately before to after each session in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing
      radiotherapy and experiencing pain.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the effects of an individualized LORETA Z score neurofeedback program on
      perceptions of radiation-induced pain in head and neck cancer patients from immediately
      before neurofeedback training to immediately after neurofeedback training.

      II. Identify brain regions from qEEG and LORETA that are associated with a non-pain state and
      then an acute pain state.

      III. Examine the relationship between the patient and their spouse or primary caregiver.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning at weeks 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 of radiotherapy, patients undergo neurofeedback
      training once per day (QID) three times per week (TIW) for up to 6 treatments. Patients also
      complete questionnaires over 10 minutes at baseline and after neurofeedback training.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 week.
