      width for implant installation. Treatment of bone surfaces with citric acid, promote a slight
      demineralization on surface that mimic natural processes of bone demineralization by
      osteoclasts. Thus, this treatment could accelerate the process of autogenous bone block
      consolidation to its recipient site.
