      second-generation ('atypical') antipsychotics (SGA). These side effects frequently interfere
      with medication compliance and necessitate discontinuation of treatment. Although the causal
      mechanisms for weight and glucose dysregulation are not well understood, one promising area
      of investigation targets SGA-induced disturbances in appetite and in appetite-regulating
      hormones. Findings from our group (and others) demonstrate SGA treatment-related increases in
      fasting levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone, ghrelin, as well as increases in
      self-report hunger. This novel study will examine prospective changes in ghrelin and in the
      'satiety-signaling' peptide YY (PYY) as measured before and after participants consume a
      standard mixed-macronutrient meal. Data are obtained at baseline (within 4 weeks of beginning
      medication), and again 2 months and 4 months later.
