      the lifespan - risks that extend to the next generation, likely transmitted through both
      biological and behavioral pathways. Biobehavioral self-regulation and parenting are key
      candidates for transmission and potential points of intervention. However, nearly all
      intervention research takes a one-generation approach, measuring outcomes in the individual
      adult or child in treatment. Additionally, very little research has examined biomarkers of
      self-regulation in parents or children following treatment, and no known research has
      examined these processes in parents and young children simultaneously across treatment to
      explore bidirectional effects. There is a critical need to specify targets of two-generation
      interventions among high-adversity families to decrease intergenerational transmission of
      mental illness. The objective of this RCT is to determine whether Mom Power, an
      evidence-based two generation intervention for mothers with histories of trauma, enhances
      physiological and behavioral self-regulation in mothers and young children, testing
      mechanisms and examining bidirectional effects. The central hypothesis is that the
      intervention will shift behavioral and physiological (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia)
      self-regulation in mothers, children, and dyads to mitigate psychopathology risk. Three
      specific aims are proposed: 1) Examine intervention effects on children's biobehavioral
      self-regulation and psychopathology; 2) Examine intervention effects on mothers'
      biobehavioral self-regulation, psychopathology, and parenting behavior; and 3) Examine
      intergenerational change processes, including shifts in dyadic physiological and behavioral
      synchrony as well as bidirectional influences between mother and child self-regulation.
