      I. To determine associations between the composition of the gut bacterial communities and
      baseline levels of the mammalian lignans and steroid hormones.

      II. To determine how variation in gut microbial community composition and in steroid hormone
      and xenobiotic metabolizing genes affects the metabolism of mammalian lignans and steroid
      hormones after exposure to a lignan-rich food (flaxseed).

      III. To determine how these associations differ by race (i.e., African American and European
      American women).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive flaxseed orally (PO) daily for 6 weeks. After a usual diet
      "washout" period of 8 weeks, patients crossover to Group II.

      GROUP II: Participants maintain a usual diet for 6 weeks. After a usual diet "washout" period
      of 8 weeks, patients crossover to Group I.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days.
