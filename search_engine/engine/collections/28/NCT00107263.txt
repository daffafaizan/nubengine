        -  Compare the effectiveness of zoledronate vs standard care in reducing bone loss during
           the first 12 months of study treatment in postmenopausal women with stage I-IIIA breast
           cancer initiating letrozole after prior treatment with tamoxifen.

        -  Compare the effect of immediate vs delayed zoledronate, annually at 2-5 years
           post-baseline, in reducing bone loss in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to duration of prior tamoxifen therapy (≤ 2 years vs > 2 years); time since
      tamoxifen therapy was discontinued (< 1 vs ≥ 1 year); prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs
      no); and baseline total lumbar spine or femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) T-score (> -1
      standard deviation [SD] vs between -1 to -2 SD). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I (immediate therapy): Patients receive oral letrozole once daily. Patients also
           receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes once every 6 months.

        -  Arm II (delayed therapy): Patients receive oral letrozole as in arm I. Patients with
           radiologic evidence of bone loss after 1 year of letrozole therapy receive zoledronate
           as in arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 550 patients (275 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 28 months.
