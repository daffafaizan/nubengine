      procedure with a one abutment one-time technique using a conventional versus full digital
      workflow. Surgical accuracy, provisional fit and patient reported outcome measures (PROMs)
      of.

      Material and method: Sites with single edentulous spaces and neighboring natural teeth were
      randomized into static computer-aided implant surgery (s-CAIS) or freehand placement implant
      surgery groups. In both groups, digital implant planning was performed using data from cone
      beam computed tomography (CBCT) and surfaces scans. In the s-CAIS group, a surgical guide was
      produced and used for fully guided implant surgery, while in the freehand group, the implants
      were placed in a freehand manner. the deviations in angles, shoulders and apexes between
      planned and actual implant positions were measured based on postoperative optic impressions.
      In the test group, a custom-made zirconia abutment and a provisional restoration were
      immediately placed using a full digital workflow whereas in the control group, a physical
      impression was taken, and the abutment and crown were placed 10 days post-surgery. Loading
      outcomes (interproximal contact, occlusal contact, white esthetic score (WES)) were assessed
      as the PROMs.
