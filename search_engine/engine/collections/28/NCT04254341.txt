      external resistors, to evaluate how are the peri-pharyngeal muscles recruited and activated
      to prevent pharyngeal collapse in the presence of negative intra-pharyngeal pressures.
      Thereafter, the same parameters will be evaluated during sleep, to assess muscle recruitment
      during intra-pharyngeal obstruction. The investigaors will record the electromyogram (EMG) of
      several dilator muscles, as well as the pressures above and below the area of pharyngeal
      collapse, and airflow.
