      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation delivered via 90Y-DOTA-BC8
      (90Y-BC8) when combined with FLU and 2 Gy TBI as a preparative regimen for patients aged >=
      18 with advanced AML, ALL, and high-risk MDS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine disease response and duration of remission.

      II. To determine the rates of engraftment and donor chimerism resulting from this combined
      preparative regimen, and to correlate level of donor chimerism with estimated radiation doses
      delivered to hematopoietic tissues via antibody.

      OUTLINE:

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive 90Y-BC8 via central line on approximately day -12 and
      FLU intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo TBI followed by allogeneic PBSC or bone marrow transplant
      on day 0.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil orally (PO)
      or IV every 12 hours on days 0-27 (for patients with related donors) or every 8 hours on days
      0-40 with taper to day 96 (for patients with unrelated donors). Patients also receive
      cyclosporine PO or IV every 12 hours on days -3 to 56 (for patients with related donors) or
      100 (for patients with unrelated donors) with taper to day 180.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months,
      and then annually thereafter.
