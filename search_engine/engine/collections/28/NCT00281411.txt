      single-center, follow-up study. 100 Patients will be enrolled in this study. These patients
      will undergo additional MRA-examinations the day before EVAR, the day after EVAR, 6 months
      and 1 year after EVAR. These patients also participate in the conventional CTA follow-up
      scheme which comprises a pre- and post-operative CTA and a CTA yearly thereafter. Coagulation
      parameters in the blood will be measured before and 1 year after EVAR.
