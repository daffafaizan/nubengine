      immunization services are among the most widely utilized health services. Most women in the
      extended postpartum period want to delay or avoid future pregnancies but many are not using a
      modern contraceptive method. Establishing systematic screening, counseling, and referral
      systems from different contact points particularly from Expanded Program for Immunization
      (EPI) units may improve family planning access and uptake in the extended perinatal period.

      Therefore, this study is proposed to assess the effect of counseling for family planning at
      immunization units on postpartum contraceptive uptake during the extended postpartum period.

      To do this, a before-and-after type of quasi-experimental study will be conducted in
      purposively selected health centers in Sidama, South Ethiopia. All mothers coming to the
      selected health centers for infant immunization services will be screened for, counseled, and
      referred for family planning. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire will be
      used to collect quantitative data from a total of 1474 randomly selected women coming to
      purposively selected health centers before and after the intervention. Bivariate and
      multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for possible confounding variables will
      be computed.
