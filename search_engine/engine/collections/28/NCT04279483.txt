    
      Individual participation in this study will take place over a period of up to 5 months.
      During (approximately) the first 6 weeks, the participant will be asked to share their
      geolocation information, attend 3 in-person visits (2 of which involve getting fMRI brain
      scans), and complete short surveys and repeated tasks (e.g., responding to EMA, using
      study-provided funds to make small purchases from a specified retail environment) in the
      weeks between visits. Approximately 3-months after the in-person participation in the study
      is complete, participants will receive a follow-up phone call during which a researcher will
      ask the participant to verbally answer brief survey questions.
