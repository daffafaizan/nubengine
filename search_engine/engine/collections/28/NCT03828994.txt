    
      Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is a common, serious reproductive disorder that is
      associated with significant adverse reproductive health outcomes such as ectopic pregnancy,
      tubal infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and significant reductions in health-related quality
      of life for affected patients. The Technology Enhanced Community Health (TECH) Nursing Study
      has further demonstrated that the biological milieu associated with PID is more complicated
      than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment guidance indicates,
      leaving women without adequate treatment for Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) and Trichomonas
      vaginalis (TV). The broad-spectrum antibiotics recommended by the CDC for syndromic PID
      management are suboptimal because: 1) MG is often resistant to doxycycline (standard therapy)
      and macrolides such as Azithromycin (alternative therapy) and 2) metronidazole (effective for
      TV) is an optional add-on to standard PID treatment that is inconsistently prescribed at
      diagnosis. Further MG was not officially considered in CDC STI treatment guidelines until
      release until 2015, testing is only available in large research laboratories, and the paucity
      of data from randomized trials limits the scope of the CDC's recommendations. Finally, while
      there are no public health control programs in the United States for MG and TV, recurrent and
      persistent infection with MG and TV is associated with ongoing inflammation in the female
      genital tract and increased risk for secondary STI and HIV infection due to unhealthy shifts
      in vagina microbiota. The goals of this study are to leverage novel STI diagnostics (new MG
      macrolide resistance testing and TV testing) with the investigators' demonstrated ability to
      reach vulnerable youth to treat adolescents and young adult women with mild-moderate PID with
      precision based on the actual diagnoses rather than suboptimal syndromic management. The
      investigators will add genomic analysis of vaginal specimens to assess compositional changes
      in the five vaginal Lactobacilli community state types associated with optimal vaginal health
      to determine if TECH-precision-nursing (TECH-PN) protocols for field treatment tailored to
      STI results reduces the inflammatory response observed with active vaginal infections. The
      investigators hypothesize that by further repackaging the investigators' previous successful
      TECH-N intervention protocol and translating bench science into precision healthcare, the
      investigators will further reduce the risk of recurrent infection, potentially restore
      vaginal health for PID- affected patients, and add new knowledge that advances public health
      control of STIs and has the potential to reduce the observed STI disparities after PID in
      urban youth.
