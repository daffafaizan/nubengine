      eligible for enrollment if they are admitted due to acute ischemic stroke within 2 days, with
      65 years of age or older, do not have known atrial fibrillation on history or baseline ECG at
      admission. Investigators will randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to undergo daily
