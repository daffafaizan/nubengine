      been used to treat the infection. Although the response to this treatment is generally good,
      up to 90 percent of AIDS patients who have taken amphotericin B to treat their histoplasmosis
      infection will have a relapse (that is, they will get the disease again) within 12 months
      following treatment. Ketoconazole has been used to prevent relapse, but available information
      suggests that up to 50 percent of AIDS patients relapse even with ketoconazole treatment. A
      more effective therapy to prevent recurrence is needed. Itraconazole has been used
      successfully to treat disseminated histoplasmosis in non-AIDS patients and it is hoped that
      it may be more effective in preventing histoplasmosis relapse.

      AIDS patients who have been successfully treated with amphotericin B for an acute first
      episode of disseminated histoplasmosis are selected for treatment. They receive daily oral
      doses of itraconazole for a total of 52 weeks. Patients who do not experience significant
      toxicity related to the drug may continue to receive itraconazole until the last patient
      completes 52 weeks of itraconazole therapy or has the study drug discontinued prior to
      completing 52 weeks of therapy. AMENDED: Patients will be treated for a minimum of 52 weeks.
      Patients who complete the 52 weeks and remain on the study drug will continue to be followed.
      If itraconazole becomes licensed for histoplasmosis, study drug must be discontinued at the
      end of 52 weeks of therapy or at the time of licensure for patients who have received more
      than 52 weeks of therapy.
