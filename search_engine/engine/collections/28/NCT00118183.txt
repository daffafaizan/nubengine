      I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time between study entry
      and disease progression or death, for each of the two combination regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate of each regimen. II. To evaluate the overall
      survival distributions associated with each regimen.

      III. To evaluate the toxicities of each regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cetuximab IV
      over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or stable
      disease after 4 courses receive cetuximab alone as above in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1,
      8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or stable disease after 4
      courses receive bortezomib alone as above in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months
      for 2 years, and then every 4 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients (31 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 6-11 months.
