      removed following. These patient will need to undergo a second operation to ensure all the
      cancer cells are removed, which has psychological, cosmetic and cost implications. Several
      technologies have been designed to allow the edges of tissue to be tested during surgery,
      with the most accurate being those that involve assessing the tissue edge at a cellular
      level. However, these techniques are time consuming which makes their use in routine work
      impractical.

      The Histolog system uses pinhole (confocal) microscopy to capture cellular level images of
      the edge of tissue intra-operatively. The first generation of the device has been shown to be
      accurate for assessing breast tissue biopsies and skin cancer. The second generation of the
      device has an 8cm plate for scanning tissue and is CE marked for the assessment of tissue
      margins. This project is to show that the device is accurate for the assessment of margins,
      with further assessment in relation to the time for images to be captured and ease of
      interpretation to assess overall feasibility. The study would recruit at a single high volume
      breast cancer centre. The study will recruit patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer who
      are due to undergo breast conservation surgery (lumpectomy) with inclusion criteria of female
      patients over the age of 18 who are able to give informed consent. The study would involve
      the edges of removed tissue being imaged following surgery. These images would be reported by
      a consultant histopathologist and compared to the routine gold standard histology. There is
      no change to patient care and the device will not be used to change the surgery performed.
      There are no questionnaires or additional demands placed on the participants.
