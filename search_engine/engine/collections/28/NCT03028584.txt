    
      Part 1: The research team will use a sociotechnical work systems model, developed by
      researchers at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Systems Engineering Initiative for Patience
      Safety (SEIPS), to guide analysis of the work system barriers and facilitators to
      implementing an EHR-based care planning model in community oncology practice, collected from
      direct observations.

      Part 2: The research team will measure reach/maintenance (percentage of survivors with
      EHR-based survivorship care plans (SCPs) over a 9-month time period) and impact (pre/post
      survey of patient satisfaction and perceived care coordination).
