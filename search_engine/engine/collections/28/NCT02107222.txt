      • To evaluate the clinical effect of PALP™ in reducing the time on invasive ventilation in
      patients with an exacerbation of COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

      Secondary Study Objectives

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PALP™ in patients with an exacerbation of
           COPD requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

        -  To determine if rates of adverse events (AEs) are reduced in patients who receive PALP™
           and invasive mechanical ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone.

        -  To determine mortality rates in patients who receive PALP™ and invasive mechanical
           ventilation vs invasive mechanical ventilation alone.

        -  To determine if PALP™ will effectively reduce the number of subsequent acute
           decompensations requiring hospital admission for ventilatory support (invasive or
           noninvasive).
