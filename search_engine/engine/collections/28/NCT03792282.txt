      Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF) is a new form of intermittent fasting and involves shortening
      the eating window to 4-10 h/day. TRF is a safe lifestyle intervention for weight loss in
      adults with obesity. Accumulating evidence suggests that TRF is an effective means of
      decreasing body weight and improving insulin resistance but did not have any negative impact
      on eating disorder symptoms, body image perception, or eating behaviors. Polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition in productive-aged women. About 60-70
      % of women with PCOS are obese or overweight, and obesity is associated with insulin
      resistance. Since many women with PCOS seem to have insulin resistance, compensatory
      hyperinsulinemia is thought to contribute to hyperandrogenism by direct stimulation of
      ovarian production of androgens and by inhibition of liver synthesis of SHGB. It is important
      to ameliorate insulin resistance in PCOS patients.The aims of the present study is to examine
      whether TRF is a safe and effective regimen to improve insulin resistance and decrease body
      weight in overweight/obese PCOS patients.
