      whole breast irradiation (WBI) and a complementary dose to the lumpectomy cavity (boost). A
      delay of 3-4 weeks after surgery is advisable for allowing wound healing before the start of
      radiotherapy. Historically, WBI plus boost are delivered in 6-7 weeks. This treatment is
      associated with fatigue and a decreased quality of life. Randomized trials have shown that
      shorter hypofractionated schedules, delivering radiotherapy in 3 weeks, are equal to the long
      schedules. The investigators have shown that a hypofractionated tomotherapy with a
      simultaneous integrated boost is oncologically safe, well tolerated and has less impact on
      quality of life than the conventional schemes.

      In the postoperative setting, it is often debatable which volume should be included in the
      boost. Surgical clips can help to decrease inter-observer variability, but often
      boost-volumes remain large because of uncertainties in delineation. Preoperative radiotherapy
      has the advantage that the gross tumor volume (GTV) is visible on imaging. This can result in
      smaller boost volumes.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a short preoperative tomotherapy.
      The potential benefits are

        -  a decrease in overall treatment time

        -  a positive effect on quality of life

        -  a more precise target delineation

        -  profitable health economics.
