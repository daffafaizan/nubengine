        -  Compare relapse-free and overall survival of patients with high-risk stage III melanoma
           receiving adjuvant sorafenib tosylate, tamoxifen citrate, and cisplatin vs historical
           data from patients treated with tamoxifen citrate and cisplatin.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to number of positive lymph
      nodes identified during surgery.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28, oral tamoxifen citrate
      twice daily on days 1-7, and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 2 and 3. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for at least 5 years.
