      other structures in the knee joint (such as the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci),
      fewer studies are available to assist the surgeon and patient with appropriate
      decision-making regarding conservative versus surgical treatment. The majority of patients
      who sustain injury to these structures are treated conservatively. Unfortunately, several
      investigations describe noteworthy symptoms and functional limitations following conservative
      management, and a high percentage of patients develop knee osteoarthritis that can be
      disabling for both recreational and daily activities. The investigators of this study have
      nearly three decades of experience and have extensively studied the effects of this injury in
      both the laboratory and clinic settings. It is our opinion that surgical reconstruction
      provides significant benefit when appropriately indicated, as has been demonstrated in our
      previous studies. Especially in athletic individuals, PCL and posterolateral reconstructive
      procedures have advanced to the point where more predictable results can be expected to
      restore sufficient knee function. Studies have demonstrated, at least in the short-term, that
      the majority of patients with acute ligament ruptures treated with reconstruction are able to
      return to various levels of sports activities.12 Whether these procedures will decrease the
      risk of the patient developing future osteoarthritis is unknown and requires further study.
