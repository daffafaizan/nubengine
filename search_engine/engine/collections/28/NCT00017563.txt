        -  Determine the 5-year freedom from prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Define the maximum tolerated dose of neoadjuvant docetaxel and mitoxantrone followed by
           prostatectomy in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer. (Phase I completed
           as of 2/15/02)

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the PSA response rate and pathologic response rate in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the surgical margin status at time of prostatectomy in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of mitoxantrone. (Phase I completed as of 2/15/02)

      Patients receive neoadjuvant docetaxel and mitoxantrone weekly on weeks 1-3. Treatment
      repeats once a week for a total of 4 courses.

      Patients receive escalating doses of mitoxantrone until the maximum tolerated dose is
      determined. (Phase I completed as of 2/15/02)

      Patients undergo prostatectomy 2-4 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
