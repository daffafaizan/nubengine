      are reentry, triggered activity, and enhanced automaticity. Enhanced automaticity process is
      the underlying mechanism for arrhythmias due to excess catecholamines. Catecholamines may
      increase in patients with PVC. Half-lives of catecholamines are very short and rather
      changeable. Therefore, 24 hours urine levels of catecholamines are the more sensitive than
      plasma levels. Metabolites of catecholamines are metanephrine and normetanephrine. Our aim is
      to measure 24 hours urine levels of metanephrine and normetanephrine.
