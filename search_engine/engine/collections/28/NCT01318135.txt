      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2
      peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      This was a phase 2/3, multicenter, open-label study, in participants who had completed the
      core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea add-on study (SYR-322/CCT-005; NCT01318083) or the core phase 2/3
      metformin add-on study (SYR-322/CCT-006; NCT01318109) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      alogliptin administered as an add-on to a sulfonylurea (glimepiride) or metformin
      continuously for 40 weeks (52 weeks from the start of study treatment with alogliptin in the
      core phase 2/3 sulfonylurea add-on study or the core phase 2/3 metformin add-on study).
