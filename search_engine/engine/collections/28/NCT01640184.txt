    
      Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD),
      including those who are undergoing long-term dialysis treatments. sHPT is damaged for bone
      system, blood system, cardiovascular system, and so on. The treatment of the sHPT of CKD's
      patient includes dietary phosphate restriction, the use of medicines, and parathyroidectomy.
      In the mainland of China, there are not certain useful medicines to treat sHPT, including the
      derivatives of vitamin D, calcimimetic agent, non calcium aluminum phosphate binders.
      Furthermore, medical therapy is not always successful in achieving adequate control of sHPT.
      Oral medications have efficacy limitations as well as side-effects. Otherwise, surgery
      treatment can only be used for the patients with enlarged parathyroid gland(s). The patients
      may suffer from the injury of operation, hypoparathyroidism, or recurrence of
      hyperparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy.

      Then ultrasonic ablation may become a valuable alternative treatment that help control sHPT
      in selected patients presenting with enlarged parathyroid gland(s) visible at
      ultrasonography,.
