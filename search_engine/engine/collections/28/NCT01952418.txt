    
      Gastrointestinal endoscopists perfoming routine endoscopic procedures and their patients will
      be randomized to one of two endoscopy rooms at the MGH Ambulatory Endoscopy Center at Charles
      River Plaza. The two rooms will have identical equipment with the exception that one room
      will have the current standard size video monitor (NDS 26") used at this facility while the
      other room will have a larger video monitor (NDS 32"). The ADR achieved by each physician in
      each room will be compared.
