      psychopathology, prevent relapses and stabilize the effects of inpatient cognitive behavioral
      therapy is well proven. In order to attain a high reachability rate among the patients,
      simple, quick and low cost methods should be used. Modern communication technologies, such as
      mobile phones provide this opportunity. Therefore, the current study explores how modern
      communication technologies can be used as a support system in psychotherapy to realize a
      reduced psychopathology.

      Methods: A total of 150 patients participated in a transdiagnostical 6-weeks text messaging
      maintenance intervention. The text messages were based on emotion regulation skills. The
      effectiveness of different variants of the text messages was studied in a randomized
      controlled trial, comparing the impact on the patient's psychopathological outcome to
      receiving personalized text messages versus standardized text messages.
