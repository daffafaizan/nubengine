      called "Observe and Plan", against today's standard protocol "Treat and Extend". Studies
      suggest that the individual treatment interval can be achieved earlier with
      "Observe-and-Plan" and that a proportion of patients do not need more than 3 injections, ie
      the loading dose. The other advantages seem to be that patients achieve good visual acuity
      with fewer controls and are more satisfied with the new protocol, which will be beneficial to
      both patients and health care. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has tested
      this before.
