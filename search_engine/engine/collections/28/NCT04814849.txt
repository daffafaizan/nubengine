      three months period per center. The selected nine pediatric diabetes centers covered all
      regions of Germany. The study participants were mothers, fathers, or other primary caregivers
      of children and adolescents diagnosed with type 1 diabetes before 14 years of age. During a
      regularly scheduled medical visit, in Germany usually 4 per year, families were informed
      about the study procedure, its aims and anonymous data collection and analyses. The answered
      questionnaires were either collected in a closed box in each diabetes center or could be sent
      anonymously via a prepaid envelope to the study administration center.
