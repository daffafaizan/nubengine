      EMB-001 (metyrapone/oxazepam combination) in otherwise healthy adults who have tobacco use
      disorder. There will be 3 cohorts, each with 8 subjects (6 active: 2 placebo), for a total of
      24 subjects. During the treatment period, subjects will receive a single dose of EMB 001 on
      Day 1, followed 24 hours later by the start of multiple doses twice daily for 7 days, and
      then a final morning dose on the last dosing day (Day 9). This design allows for
      characterization of EMB-001 single dose PK for 24 hours, followed by assessment of repeat
      dose PK in the multiple-dose phase. Safety will be assessed after the single dose and
      repeated dosing. Effects of study drug on smoking and craving cigarettes will be assessed at
      the end of repeated dosing. Later studies may also assess the efficacy of this drug
      combination in treating cocaine use disorder, tobacco use disorder, and/or other disorders.
