    
      Patients with a fibrosing interstitial lung disease will be recruited. In total 20 patients
      will be recruited, 10 for the intervention group and 10 for the control group.

      The Intervention group will participate in a 12 week yoga class with classes twice a week for
      about 1 hour. The control group will not participate in a yoga class.

      At baseline all patients will conduct a 6 minutes walking test, a lung function test, several
      surveys to measure health related quaility of life (King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease
      Questionnaire (K-BILD), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Interstitial Lung
      Disease Anxiety questionnaire), and some blood will be drawn for biomarker analysis.

      Furthermore, participants in the Intervention group will participate in two focus group
      interviews, one at baseline and the second one at 12 week follow-up.
