        -  Compare progression-free and overall survival of patients with stage III or IV Hodgkin's
           disease treated with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine with or
           without autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and high-dose
           chemotherapy.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these treatment regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to number
      of poor prognostic factors (3 vs 4 vs 5) and stage of disease (III vs IV).

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes,
      bleomycin IV over 10 minutes, vinblastine IV over 5 minutes, and dacarbazine IV over 15-30
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 5 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who show at least partial response
      after the fifth course of induction chemotherapy and whose blood counts have recovered are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive 3 additional courses of induction chemotherapy for a total of 8
           courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 1 additional course of induction chemotherapy followed by stem
           cell collection. Patients then receive high-dose chemotherapy with carmustine IV over 2
           hours on days -6 to -4, etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on
           day -2. Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      Patients are followed at 60 days, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 460 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
