      modulator in patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery
      involving a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

      Perioperative bleeding is a serious complication that adversely affects the morbidity and
      mortality of cardiac surgery. To alleviate this complication, prophylactic antifibrinolytic
      therapies are now widely accepted as a strategy to inhibit excessive fibrinolysis.

      MDCO-2010, a synthetic small molecule, is a direct inhibitor of plasmin and plasma
      kallikrein. Both of these have been implicated with impaired haemostasis. In addition, potent
      inhibition of coagulation factors Xa, XIa and activated Protein C has been demonstrated.
      Thus, MDCO-2010 has the potential to mitigate excessive fibrinolysis and thrombin generation
      during cardiac surgery involving a cardiopulmonary bypass. In particular the latter is
      supposed to provide additional benefits beyond reducing transfusion requirements.
