      subarachnoid haemorrhage consists of interventional neuroradiology with coil embolization of
      the aneurysm. Although ensuring a better neurological prognosis than neurosurgical clipping,
      interventional neuroradiology exposes the patient to various risks: thromboembolic
      complications during or after embolization and re-rupture of the aneurysm during
      embolization. To prevent thromboembolic complications, the embolization procedure is
      performed under prophylactic unfractionated heparin, the efficacy of which is monitored by
      point-of- care testing according to international guidelines. However, these guidelines are
      based on limited scientific evidence and the ideal level of anticoagulation required has not
      been precisely defined. Furthermore, the correlation between the point-of- care tests used at
      Amiens University Hospital and the reference methods used in the laboratory varies
      considerably according to the available literature.
