      osteoporosis associated with these deficiencies. In some tissues, such as muscle, the effects
      of testosterone and growth hormone are additive, but it is not known if the effects are
      additive in bone as well. This study will compare the effects of testosterone alone with
      testosterone plus growth hormone in improving bone structure in men with total pituitary
      hormone deficiency.

      Participants in this study will be men who have pituitary or hypothalamic disease and have
      deficiencies of all pituitary hormones, but who have not been treated with either
      testosterone or growth hormone. The men will be randomly assigned to receive either
      testosterone alone or testosterone plus growth hormone for two years. Testosterone in a gel
      form will be applied daily to the skin. Growth hormone will be self-administered by daily
      subcutaneous injection. Blood concentrations of both hormones will be monitored with blood
      tests every 3 months during the 2-year study. Doses of the hormones will be adjusted to keep
      blood concentrations of the hormones within the normal range. Changes in bone structure will
      be assessed noninvasively before treatment and after one year and two years of treatment by
      magnetic resonance microimaging (ÂµMRI) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
