      treating seasonal allergic rhinitis. We hypothesize that ear acupressure will be effective in
      treating seasonal allergic rhinitis by changing the immune parameters and the psychological
      impact factors such as expectation, stress, depression, and anxiety can moderate the ear
      acupressure treatment effectiveness in allergic rhinitis by influencing the immune
      parameters.
