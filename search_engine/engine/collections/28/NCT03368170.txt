    
      METHODOLOGY:

      This is a multicentre study where 74 patients with Parkinson's disease exhibiting levodopa
      induced dyskinesia will be randomised to receive study drug or placebo. Thirty seven patients
      will be randomised to mesdopetam and 37 patients to placebo (1:1 randomisation).

      Patients will be screened for eligibility according to inclusion/exclusion criteria within
      four weeks of initiation of study treatment (Screening visit).

      An outpatient study with the patients taking the study drug for four weeks at home.
      Mesdopetam will be taken twice daily (b.i.d.) as adjunctive treatment to the patients'
      regular and stable antiparkinsonian medication.

      The first two weeks of treatment will allow for per patient titration of study medication to
      the highest tolerated predefined dose, after which patients will continue on this highest
      tolerated dose for an additional two weeks.

      Changes in disease state and dyskinesia will be measured using the Unified Parkinson's
      Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS); furthermore,
      patients will administer two 24-hour diaries on run-in and on the fourth week of dosing to
      assess daily movements.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be collected for the determination of concentrations of
      mesdopetam and its metabolites IRL902 and IRL872 in plasma. They will be collected before and
      after IMP administration at two visits.

      A Follow-up Visit will be performed for all patients five to eight days after last
      administration of IMP.
