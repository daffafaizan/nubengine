      acute stroke, specifically related to the use of intravenous thrombolysis. Effective urgent
      stroke evaluation and secondary stroke prevention is also essential to decrease the risk of
      recurrent stroke, however, there have been no studies to date examining the use of telestroke
      to improve delivery of non-emergent inpatient stroke care per American Heart Association
      (AHA) guidelines.

      Currently, access to stroke specialist expertise is limited resulting in significant
      disparities in stroke care. Previous publications have identified that patients in rural
      areas may receive sub-optimal stroke care that does not follow accepted guideline
      recommendations. Telestroke is a cost-effective mechanism to deliver specialist stroke care
      to hospitals that do not have in-person stroke consultation available. The aim of TELECAST is
      to determine whether specialist telestroke inpatient rounding improves guideline-based acute
      stroke care when compared to non-specialist stroke care.

      The primary outcome of TELECAST is a composite score comprising 4 categories: diagnostic
      stroke evaluation, secondary stroke prevention, health screening and evaluation, and stroke
      education. Individual components of the primary outcome were primarily derived from AHA
      stroke guidelines. Additional outcome measures include individual analyses of the components
      of the primary outcome as well as the complication rate, stroke recurrence rate, transfer
      rate, patient and provider satisfaction levels, and a cost-analysis. All outcomes will be
      assessed at 1 year post-implementation, with data accruement beginning after a 3-month lead
      in phase.
