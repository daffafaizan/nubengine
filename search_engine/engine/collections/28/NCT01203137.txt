      Comprehensive preoperative echocardiography was performed in all patients, with the
      performance of early postoperative echocardiography in all patients. During follow-up,
      clinical events, defined as operative mortality (death within 30 days after surgery or before
      discharge), cardiovascular death, repeated open heart surgery, and readmission due to
      cardiovascular problems were investigated.
