      different formats of an informed consent document in ways that improve participant
      understanding and confidence. Participants will review one of several different versions of
      the same informed consent document, and will be asked to complete a survey after reading the
      documents. The survey will ask participants their willingness to enroll in the clinical trial
      discussed in the document and their confidence in their decision. The survey will also test
      participants recollection of information from the informed consent document. Researchers will
      look at this data to see if there are ways to improve knowledge about the clinical trial and
      confidence in decisions without necessarily changing enrollment preferences.
