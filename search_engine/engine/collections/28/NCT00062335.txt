        -  Determine the optimal dose of high-dose 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in patients
           with inoperable stage I, II, or IIIA non-small cell lung cancer who are treated
           according to the total lung volume irradiated.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen, in terms of local control rates and incidence
           of distant metastases, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients
      are assigned to 1 of 3 strata according to the total lung volume irradiated (less than 25% vs
      25-37% vs over 37%).

        -  Stratum I: Patients undergo high-dose 3-dimensional (3-D) conformal radiotherapy 5 days
           a week for 6 weeks.

        -  Stratum II: Patients undergo high-dose 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for
           5.5-7 weeks.

        -  Stratum III: Patients undergo high-dose 3-D conformal radiotherapy 5 days a week for
           5.5-6.5 weeks.

      Cohorts of 6-15 patients in each stratum receive escalating dose intensities of high-dose 3-D
      conformal radiotherapy (either by increasing the total dose or by shortening treatment time)
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which
      2 of 6, 2 of 15, or 3 of 30 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, at least every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1
      year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54-135 patients (18-45 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
