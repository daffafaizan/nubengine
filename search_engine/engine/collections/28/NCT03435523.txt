      impair respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. The investigators tested a strategy based on
      an open lung approach (OLA) consisting in lung recruitment immediately followed by a
      decremental positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration to the best respiratory system
      compliance (CRS) and separately quantified the elastic properties of the lung and the chest
      wall. The investigators hypothesis was that this approach would improve gas exchange and
      increase lung compliance (CL).

      Methods: In thirteen patients undergoing upper left lobectomy the investigators studied lung
      and chest wall mechanics, transpulmonary pressure (PL), respiratory system and transpulmonary
      driving pressure (ΔPRS and ΔPL), gas exchange and hemodynamics at two time-points (a) during
      OLV at zero end-expiratory pressure (OLVpre-OLA) and (b) after the application of the
      open-lung strategy (OLVpost-OLA).
