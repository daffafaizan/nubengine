      limited by patient needle phobia and the need for trained medical personnel. Alternative
      routes of vaccination that avoid hypodermic needles have previously been poorly immunogenic,
      require live vaccines, utilize bulky devices and/or are unsuitable for self-administration.
      Novel vaccine delivery methods such as microneedles can render vaccination easier and more
      acceptable to the public by simplifying vaccine access. Microneedles are micron-scale needles
      that administer vaccine directly into the skin using a simple minimally invasive approach
      without generating sharps waste. This study is designed to investigate the safety,
      reactogenicity, and acceptability of a placebo microneedle patch in children.
