    
      Phase 4 (post-marketing) De novo African American living or deceased donor renal transplant
      recipients 18 to 65 years of age Number of subjects to be enrolled: 60

      All patients will receive standard induction immunosuppression according to institution
      protocol. Within one week of transplantation, all patients will be converted from
      immediate-release tacrolimus (TAC) to extended-release tacrolimus (ENV) at 20% reduction in
      total daily dosage. Patients will be randomized to low-, moderate-, or high-intensity ENV
      groups, stratified by peak panel reactive antibody (pPRA) greater than or equal to 75%.
      Target tacrolimus trough concentrations for the first month post-transplant will be 8-10
      ng/mL in low-intensity group, 10-12 ng/mL in moderate-intensity group, and 12-14 ng/mL in
      high-intensity group; likewise from month 1-3 post-transplant, target trough concentrations
      will be 6-8 ng/mL, 8-10 ng/mL, and 10-12 ng/mL, respectively. Subjects experiencing
      dose-limiting adverse events (AEs) will be de-escalated as warranted. Following month 3, all
      patients will be maintained on ENV at target tacrolimus trough concentrations according to
      institution protocol. Additional maintenance immunosuppression will consist of mycophenolate
      mofetil (MMF) at a goal dose of 2000 mg daily along with an oral prednisone taper to 5-10 mg
      daily by the end of month 1. All patients will be followed for 6 months post-transplant.
