      important and parental participation is essential. Parents must recognize overweight in their
      child so health providers may engage them in a dialogue to change their child's diet and
      physical activity patterns, yet a large proportion of parents do not recognize that their
      child is overweight. Parents' misperception of their overweight child's weight status
      presents a barrier to treating obesity.

      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial with an embedded cross sectional study
      exploring parental perceptions of their weight status and how it affects their perceptions of
      their child's weight status. This study uses an educational intervention in which parents are
      informed of their actual weight status and how it affects their child's health. We will study
      the effect of this intervention on the parent's perceptions of and level of concern for their
      own and their child's weight status.

      Our goal is to develop a primary care intervention that will enhance parental perceptions of
      overweight and motivation to make changes for their family. Pilot data collected here will
      support an R21 Exploratory/Developmental Clinical Research Grant in Obesity or a Centers for
      Disease Control (CDC) or Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ) grant submission.
