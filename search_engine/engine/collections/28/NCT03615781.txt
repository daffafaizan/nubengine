      is unknown. The investigators perform a randomized study allocating patients into a
      two-week's and a four week's randomization arm.

      The adult patients are hospitalized for septic arthritis. A computer program randomizes 1:1
      between a two week's and a four week's arm of targeted antibiotic treatment of which at least
      the first week is intravenously. The randomization may occur until Day 5 of admission. Up to
      three surgical interventions are allowed. The investigators allow the inclusion of all
      bacterial arthritis and all joints.
