      spontaneous remission, in KDIGO, it is recommend that initial therapy should be started only
      in patients with nephrotic syndrome and when at least the following condition is met:urinary
      protein excretion persistently exceeds 4g/d and remains at over 50% of the baseline value,and
      does not show progressive and antiproteinuric therapy during an observation period of at
      least 6 months. But many retrospective researches reported that using steroids and
      immunosuppressive agents were better than waiting for spontaneous remission. There were few
      prospective, randomized, controlled research on whether it is better that begin to use
      steroids and immunosuppressive agent early without waiting for 6 months. In our study,we
      evaluate the validity and security of steroids plus cyclosporin therapy in idiopathic
      membranous nephropathy. This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter
      study. Patients in treatment group will receive oral methylprednisolone 0.4mg/kg/d and
      3.5~5mg/kg/d cyclosporin for 6 months. Patients in control group will waiting for spontaneous
      remission for 6 months,if there were no spontaneous remissions, patients in control group
      will receive oral methylprednisolone 0.4mg/kg/d and 3.5~5mg/kg/d cyclosporin for 6 months.
      After followed-up for 6 months the curative and side effect of steroid plus cyclosporin
      therapy in the early stage of idiopathic membranous nephropathy will be evaluated.
