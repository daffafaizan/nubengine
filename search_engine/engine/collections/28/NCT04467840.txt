      study with an adaptive design that will utilize a futility assessment. The study is planned
      be performed worldwide in up to approximately 80 clinical sites.

      After informed consent is obtained, patients will enter a screening phase for no more than 3
      days, to determine eligibility. Approximately 464 eligible patients will be randomized and
      receive either opaganib added to standard of care, or matching placebo added to standard of
      care, in a randomization ratio of 1:1. Treatment assignments will remain blinded to the
      patient, investigator and hospital staff, as well as the sponsor. As the approval and/or
      guidance for treating COVID-19 are evolving, for this protocol, standard of care will be
      defined by the recommended schemes of treatment according to the severity of the disease
      based on local diagnostic and guideline documents such as the Temporary Methodic
      Recommendations: Prophylactic, Diagnostics and Treatment of New Corona Virus Infection
      (COVID-19) (Appendix 10); the EU Commission, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Heads
      of Medicines Agency (HMA) and FDA, and as updated to the most current version of the
      recommendations.

      Study participants will receive either opaganib 2 x 250 mg capsules (500 mg) every 12 hours,
      or matching placebo, in addition to standard of care (pharmacological as defined above and/or
      supportive) at any given institution. Study drug will be administered every day for 14 days
      (Day 1 to Day 14). All participants will be followed up for 28 days after their last dose of
      study drug, which may occur at Day 14 or after premature study drug discontinuation, based
      upon patient or physician determination.
