      antenatal breastfeeding education on the breastfeeding rates (Su et al. 2007; Mattar et al.
      2007; Wong et al. 2014). Two of these studies did not find differences in the total
      breastfeeding rates between the groups that received and did not receive antenatal
      breastfeeding education at the infants' age of 6 months old (Su et al. 2007; Wong et al.
      2014). However, Su et al. found higher exclusive breastfeeding rates for 6-months-old infants
      in the group that received antenatal counseling. In contrast, Mattar et al. 2007 found
      significantly difference in breastfeeding rates with individual counseling compared to
      non-counseling or only breastfeeding educational material with no counseling.

      Few studies have investigated breastfeeding in twins specifically, and even fewer have
      focused on the duration of breastfeeding of twin infants. Furthermore, in our literature
      search, we did not find studies of breastfeeding of twins investigating the effect of
      antenatal education on breastfeeding twins. Our hypothesis is that mothers of twins receiving
      specific antenatal counseling on breastfeeding should have a higher rate of breastfeeding
      than mothers who do not receive antenatal breastfeeding counseling. Therefore, the purpose of
      this study was to investigate the effect of specific antenatal breastfeeding counseling on
      the breastfeeding rates in twin pregnancies.
