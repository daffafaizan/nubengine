      I. Determine if treatment with 17-AAG results in measurable anti-tumor effects and calculate
      the proportion of clinical responses.

      II. Test the hypothesis that treatment with 17-AAG can disrupt the MAPK pathway by depleting
      intra-tumor stores of RAF kinases and/or downstream proteins such as phospho-ERK, CDK4 and
      cyclin D1.

      III. Determine if either of these effects correlates with the presence of mutated BRAF within
      the melanoma tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of BRAF
      mutation in tumor (yes vs no).

      Patients receive tanespimycin IV over 1-6 hours once weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every
      56 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
