      postpartum depression (PPD). This condition poses a risk for disturbances in the
      mother-infant relationship as well as for developmental delays and subsequent psychopathology
      in their children. Thus, and investigation of the efficacy of a relational approach that
      focuses on improving the mother's sense of competence in the parenting role, and reducing
      depressive symptoms and social isolation through group therapy is warranted.

      Patients are randomly assigned to either relational group treatment or to standard individual
      treatment. Assessments of maternal and infant functioning, mother-infant and father-infant
      relations, parenting stress, and marital conflict and conducted pre- and post-treatment, at
      12 months post-treatment, and when infants are 12 and 24 months of age.
