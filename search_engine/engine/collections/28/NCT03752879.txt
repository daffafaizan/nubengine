      Kristeller maneuver will be recruit as cases. For each case, a control (no fundal pressure)
      will be recruit matched by BMI, second stage duration and birthweight. All women will be
      invited to undergo a postpartum 3D transperineal ultrasound (TPUS). The main outcome measure
      will be the presence of LAM avulsion at 3D TPUS. TPUS results will be compared between cases
      and controls.
