    
      Based on previous studies showing temporary improvement in immune function in HIV-infected
      patients using peripheral lymphocyte transfers and bone marrow transplantation, and based on
      studies documenting the antiretroviral effects of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alfa
      (IFN-A) as well as the preliminary test tube and patient studies suggesting anti-HIV effects
      of recombinant CD4-IgG, we propose to treat HIV-infected patients using combination
      antiretroviral therapy with transplantation of bone marrow and peripheral lymphocytes from
      previously immunized donors in an attempt to restore immunologic function and a virus-free
      state.

      Three patients are treated with stable doses of AZT, IFN-A, and CD4-IgG for 12 weeks,
      followed by six peripheral lymphocyte infusions and transplantation of bone marrow from their
      respective identical twins. Following bone marrow transplantation, patients continue to
      receive the three drugs. Additional periods of lymphocyte apheresis and transfer may be
      offered to each donor/recipient pair.
