    
      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of transition from adolescence into
      adulthood especially on adherence to health care, among young people with severe haemophilia
      in France.

      The operational objectives of this study are: i) to compare the level of adherence in
      adolescents and in young adults (YA) ii) to identify determinants (medical, organisational,
      socio-demographic and social, and psychosocial and behavioural factors) of the level of
      adherence in YPWH (young people with haemophilia), iii) to assess specific factors involved
      in suboptimal level of adherence in the sub-groups of adolescents on one hand and of YA on
      the other hand, iv) to identify groups of patients (clusters) regarding both their level of
      adherence and their psychosocial characteristics, v) to examine trough a qualitative approach
      YPWH needs and expectations towards the health care system during the transition process, and
      to identify some ways to improve their global care.

      This study is an exploratory, observational, multicentric, transversal study aimed at
      describing the perceptions of adolescents (14-17 years old) with severe haemophilia to those
      of young adults (20-29 years old) regarding their expectations and their feelings about
      growing into adulthood. Every patient enrolled in the FranceCoag national cohort (cohort of
      French patients suffering from inherited deficiencies of coagulation proteins), suffering
      from severe haemophilia, aged from 14 to 17 years old or from 20 to 29 years old, will be
      offered to get enrolled in the TRANSHEMO study (expected number eligible of participants: 154
      adolescents and 389 young adults). , among whom 70% are expected to take part in the study).
      The patients' participation in this study will not modify their medical or paramedical care.
      A multifocal approach which combines both quantitative and qualitative data collection will
      be proposed.
