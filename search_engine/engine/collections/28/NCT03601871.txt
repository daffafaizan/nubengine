    
      This is a pragmatic randomized, multi-center, open-label randomized clinical trial, aimed to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of thalidomide in improving prevention of chemotherapy-induced
      delayed nausea and vomiting (CINV) in chemotherapy-naive patients after multi-cycle
      cisplatin-containing highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) . A total of 880 patients are
      planned to be enrolled into the study. Chemotherapy-na√Øve patients treated with multi-cycle
      cisplatin-containing chemotherapy will be randomized into two groups(thalidomide group and
      control group), and be treated with Thalidomide+5-hydroxytryptamine receptor(5-HT3)
      antagonist +Dexamethasone (Thalidomide group) or 5-HT3 antagonist + Dexamethasone(control
      group), respectively. The primary end point is no nausea rate in delayed phase of the first
      cycle chemotherapy, and the secondary end points include the complete response rate of
      vomiting in acute,delayed and overall period; no nausea rate in acute and overall phase;
      anorexia score, fatigue score and sedation score assessed by VAS ; safety and quality of life
      (QOL) during multi-cycle chemotherapy.
