      epidemiology, natural history, response to treatment and outcome. In addition, a biobank
      allows addressing specific scientific issues on a variety of open questions. The cohort will
      provide a platform for carrying out scientific research projects on AIH. In addition, the
      cohort will allow collaborations with reference networks on AIH abroad.

      Measurements and procedures: Enrolment visit and one follow-up visit at least once a year are
      planned. An additional follow-up visit at 6 months postdiagnosis is planned for newly
      diagnosed patients.

      Whole blood is collected for biobanking once a year Optionally, if available and collected
      during normal clinical procedures, liver fragments are obtained.

      Number of subjects projected for the entire study (all sites combined): 500 (corresponding to
      1/3 of the estimated global AIH population residing in Switzerland, assuming a disease
      prevalence of 20:100,000)
