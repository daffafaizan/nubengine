      emergency general surgeons, and the preferred treatment remains controversial. A variety of
      therapies have been recommended including early operative intervention, delayed operative
      intervention, and non-operative management. Recently, a prospective randomized controlled
      trial from a single center was conducted in Finland comparing operative and non-operative
      management of appendiceal abscess. Patients managed in the operative arm were found to have a
      shorter length of stay, fewer re-admissions, and fewer additional interventions than those
      managed in the non-operative group, but there is no high-quality randomized control trial
      conducted in the United States to support this. The investigators, therefore plan to carry
      out a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing operative and
      non-operative management of complicated appendicitis with abscess or phlegmon in the United
      States.
