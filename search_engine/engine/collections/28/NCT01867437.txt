      hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Life expectancy is shorter in obese individuals who
      often suffer from costly related co-morbidities such as certain cancers, liver disease,
      osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and depression. Weight loss improves the co-morbidities. Diet and
      exercise are effective in the short term, but are rarely effective over a span of years. New
      therapies are needed especially for patients with obesity. The melanocortin system, and
      specifically, melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is involved in the regulation of energy
      homeostasis and body weight. This role is validated in human genetic mutations, and in animal
      models of obesity, stimulation of MC4R reduces food intake and increases metabolic rate,
      causing a reduction in body weight.

      RM-493 is a potent, selective peptide agonist for the MC4R that suppressed food intake and
      reduced body weight in preclinical studies. RM-493 has been studied in single dose and
      multiple ascending dose clinical studies in obese volunteers. This study is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 2-period, crossover study to assess the
      effects of RM-493 on resting energy expenditure measured in a room calorimeter. Twelve obese
      but otherwise healthy adult subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 inclusive, will be
      enrolled and randomized to one of 2 treatment sequences (RM-493 then placebo; or placebo then
      RM-493) over an 8-day study interval. Components of 24-hour energy expenditure, exercise
      induced energy expenditure, spontaneous physical activity, respiratory quotient, safety and
      pharmacokinetic data will be collected.
