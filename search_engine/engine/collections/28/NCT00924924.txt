      by trained volunteers from the UM T.E. Atkins Wellness Program is able to help people who
      take the classes improve their confidence in their ability to choose good health behaviors
      and carry out new behaviors. The project will use the Stanford University Self-management
      education model and train volunteers to be teachers. People who work on the MU campus will be
      recruited to take a 50-minute class once a week for six weeks. Class members will complete
      questionnaires before and after the class and again three months later that ask about their
      health behaviors and confidence to perform health behaviors. This information will be
      analyzed to determine if the classes were effective in helping people act in healthier ways.
