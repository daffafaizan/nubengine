      Primary

        -  Correlate predictive genetic, proteomic, and/or neurotrophic markers with neurological
           manifestations related to the administration of oxaliplatin in patients with colorectal
           carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  Differentiate between risk factors predictive of acute and chronic neurotoxicity.

        -  Establish a possible relationship between acute and chronic neurotoxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin every 2 weeks as part of a FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen.

      Blood samples are collected 15 days prior to beginning chemotherapy, prior to each course of
      chemotherapy, and at 1 month after completion of chemotherapy for pharmacogenetic and
      laboratory biological studies. Patients with chronic neurotoxicity undergo additional blood
      sample collection at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after completion of chemotherapy. Samples are
      analyzed for the detection of gene variants involved in the oxalate and fluorouracil
      metabolic pathway; neurotrophic factors; proteomic analysis of plasma proteins and peptides;
      and for biological testing of neurotoxicity.
