      reliable and medically acceptable way of better managing your heart failure prior to your
      noticing symptoms or being hospitalized. This may enable you and your doctor to take
      preventative measures, by fine tuning your care including more frequently adjusting your
      medications with a goal of avoiding hospitalization.
