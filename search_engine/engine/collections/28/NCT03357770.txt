      osteoarthrits patients as participants, who will be randomly assigned into high dose group,
      moderate dose group or low dose group. The participants in the high dose group will receive
      the treatment of high dose MSCs (1×10^8cells/3mL) anticular injection.The dose of the MSCs in
      medium dose group is 5×10^7cells/3mL, and the dose in the low dose group is 1×10^7cells/3mL.
      Unexplained local and systemic symptoms will be assessed to determine the the maximum
      tolerated dose of mesenchymal stem cells in anticular injection.
