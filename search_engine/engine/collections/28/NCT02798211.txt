    
      Treatment Period 1 was defined as the period from Randomization through Week 16 (prior to the
      Week 16 dose). At the start of placebo-controlled Treatment Period 1, patients were
      randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) in a 2:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups.

      Group 1- Secukinumab 300 mg: secukinumab 300 mg (2 s.c. injections of the 150-mg dose) once
      weekly for 5 weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4), followed by dosing every 4 weeks.

      Group 2- Secukinumab 150 mg: secukinumab 150 mg (1 s.c. injection of the 150-mg dose and 1
      s.c. injection of placebo) once weekly for 5 weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4),
      followed by dosing every 4 weeks.

      Group 3- Placebo: placebo (2 s.c. injections of 150 mg secukinumab placebo per dose) once per
      week for 5 weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4), followed by dosing every 4 weeks.

      At each study treatment visit 2 s.c. injections in the form of prefilled syringes (PFS) were
      administered. This was necessary to maintain the blind, as secukinumab in PFS is available in
      either 1.0 mL (150 mg) or 2 x 1.0 mL (300 mg). Placebo to secukinumab was also available in
      1.0 mL to match the active drug.

      Rescue medication was not allowed before completion of Week 16 assessments.

      Treatment Period 2 patients receiving secukinumab 300 mg (Group 1) continued to receive the
      same dose up to Week 48.

      At Weeks 16, 28, and 40 patients on secukinumab 150 mg (Group 2) were classified as
      responders (â‰¥20% improvement from BL in both tender and swollen joint counts) or
      nonresponders.

        -  At Weeks 16, 28, and 40 patients on secukinumab 150 mg (Group 2) who were responders
           continued to receive secukinumab 150 mg (1.0 mL) plus placebo (1.0 mL) every 4 weeks
           until next evaluation of responder status at Weeks 28 or 40.

        -  Patients who did not meet the responder criteria at Week 16, 28, or 40 started receiving
           secukinumab 300 mg s.c. every 4 weeks and continued this dose up to Week 48.

        -  Patients on placebo (Group 3) regardless of their responder status started receiving
           secukinumab 300 mg s.c. every 4 weeks from Week 16 up to Week 48.
