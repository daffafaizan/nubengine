    
      A prospective randomized clinical trial of all the patients undergoing Roux - en-Y gastric
      bypass will be performed. Patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups: those patients
      receiving a preoperative balanced energy high-protein formula (group 1) and those receiving
      preoperative Immunonutrition (group 2). Changes between groups in acute inflamatory markers
      (CRP, fibrinogen, leucocites), pain (VAS scale), postoperative septic complications
      .(anastomotic leak and organ/space SSI)and lenght of stay, among others will be investigated.
