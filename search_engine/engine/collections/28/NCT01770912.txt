      pathogenesis. These disorders are multifactorial in origin including physical and
      psychosocial aspects; however, there is little understanding as to how much each of these
      components are associated with a particular diagnosis and subsequent treatment outcome of
      temporomandibular joint disorders. There is also a paucity of information regarding the
      relative effectiveness of different therapies for the treatment of patients with
      temporomandibular joint disorders. The identification of the least invasive and most
      efficacious therapy is vital to proper management of these patients with temporomandibular
      joint pain.

      Patients enrolled into the study will be examined and treated at the Department of Oral and
      Maxillofacial Surgery. At the first appointment, they will be examined following standard
      procedures to determine if they would potentially benefit from the TMJ arthrocentesis
      procedure. If the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the study and with their informed
      consent, they will be required to complete a questionnaire about their physical and pain
      symptoms and undergo a standardized clinical exam. At the next appointment, the patients will
      undergo the standard clinical protocol for TMJ arthrocentesis with either only normal saline
      or normal saline with adjunctive steroids (triamcinolone hexacetonide). Follow-up
      appointments will be at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks where the pain VAS and clinical exams
      will be completed.
