      (SYNOSTE Nitinail), Locking screws, accessory instruments for surgery and the home care unit
      (also External control unit (ECU) or Halo). It includes also, a software tool, Syndex, that
      supports setting up the number of lengthening activations needed per day.

      The SNS is intended for lengthening of the femur by distraction osteogenesis.

      The study will consist of a recruitment period of 3 months and an observation period of
      roughly 24 months (6 months after explantation). The observation period is split in two
      parts: The first part contains the most critical treatment phases from implantation surgery
      of the device through the actual lengthening phase up to the end of the bone healing. The
      second part contains only two visits: the explantation surgery of the device and a control at
      6 months of further follow-up.

      After the fist part of the trial, a primary analysis of the data including the hypothesis
      testing will be carried out. After the second part of the trial a follow-up analysis will be
      done.

      16 (max 20) patients will be recruited in Finland and Turkey.
