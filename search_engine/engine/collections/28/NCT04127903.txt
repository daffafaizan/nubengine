      surgery. The variable anatomy of the length of the right main stem bronchus seems to be the
      main reason clinicians are unwilling to use the right-sided DLT (R-DLT). The factors that
      could compromise the adequate ventilation of the right lung are mostly the variable length of
      the Right Main Stem Bronchus and the misalignment of the lateral orifice of the right-sided
      DLT in regard to the right upper lobe bronchus (RULB). The objectives of this study were to
      validate an alternative method to estimate the length of the Right Main Stem Bronchus by
      Computerised Tomography as a Guide to Right-sided Double-lumen Tube Use
