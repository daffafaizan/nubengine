      care and no experimental interventions will be performed.

      All patients scheduled to undergo ESD at the University of Florida and participating centers
      as medically indicated will be considered for the study. Patients in whom ESD is considered
      as part of their standard medical care will be offered to participate in this study. The
      physician performing the procedure will also discuss the study with the subjects. If the
      patient agrees to participate, he or she will be given the informed consent form and allowed
      enough time to read it. Opportunity to ask questions will be provided. If the patient agrees
      to participate, he or she will sign the consent form and a copy will be provided. Data will
      be prospectively recorded according to the data collection form. ESD will be performed as
      medically indicated. The investigators from each respective center on this project will also
      be in charge of the medical care of the patients enrolled in the study. Follow-up will be
      carried out as medically indicated and no additional studies or clinic visits will be needed
      specifically for the purpose of this study.
