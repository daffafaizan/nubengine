      nonrandomized clinical study. Mean patient age was 22 years (range, 18-26 years). Inclusion
      criteria were low stage bilateral progressive keratoconus, transparent cornea and thinnest
      corneal thickness ≥ 440 µm. Using the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer central corneal sensitivity
      was measured preoperatively, after 7 days, and once a month after surgery until recovery of
      the baseline preoperative level. Normal levels of central corneal sensitivity were considered
      above 40mm.
