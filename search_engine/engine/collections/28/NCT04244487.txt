      have prior esophageal/gastroesophageal variceal bleeding will be enrolled. The baseline
      parameter will be recorded and the patient will be randomized into either interventional
      (synchronous vagus nerve-preserving laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection
      with intraoperative endoscopic variceal ligation (SVEL)) or control (single vagus
      nerve-preserving laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection without
      intraoperative endoscopic variceal ligation (SVEL)) group. From postoperative day 3, all
      patients will receive 100 mg oral aspirin enteric-coated tablets (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany)
      once daily for 1 year, low-molecular-weight heparin (CS Bio, Hebei, China) subcutaneously
      (4.100 IU/day) for 5 days, and 25 mg of oral dipyridamole (Henan Furen, Henan, China) thrice
      daily for 3 months. At months 3, 6, and 12 after operation, endoscopic intervention will be
      done for all patients. Endoscopic variceal ligation was made if the diameter of the
      esophageal varices was >5 mm. Postoperative complications of esophageal variceal re-bleeding
      and death due to re-bleeding will be recorded during the postoperative first year monitoring
      in the both groups as per the primary or secondary outcome.
