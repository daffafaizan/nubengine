      activity of tyrosinase and melanogenesis. This 3-arm clinical trial will asess the efficacy
      and safety of oral and topical tranexamic acid as monotherapy compared with topical
      hydroquinone for 12 weeks in adults with melasma. One hundred and twenty patients will be
      recruited in 3 groups of intervention: group I with tranexamic acid at a dose of 250 mg bid
      orally, group II with 5% topical tranexamic acid bid, group III with 4% topical hydroquinone
      once daily. The primary outcome will be the percentage of reduction at 12-week period of
      mMASI and melanin index. The incidence of adverse effects will be reported at weeks 4, 8 and
      12.
