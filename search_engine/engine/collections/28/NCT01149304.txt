      heparin on pathological processes in healthy tissue after irradiation is described in
      clinical studies on percutaneous liver irradiation and on bone marrow transplantation.
      However, data remains inconclusive.

      This exploratory study aims at assessing whether a protective effect of the combination of
      pentoxifylline, ursodeoxycholic acid and enoxaparin can be demonstrated in a limited number
      of patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer after HDR brachytherapy.

      All patients receive a single fraction CT/MRI-guided HDR-brachytherapy of colorectal liver
      metastases using Iridium-192 as a standard therapy. The follow-up consists of 4 MRI controls
      of the abdomen using the hepatocyte-specific contrast agent Gd-EOB-DTPA (Primovist) after 3
      days, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months as well as blood samples and a questionnaire taken the
      same time.Within the study, 22 patients are given low dose low molecular weight heparin,
      pentoxifylline and ursodeoxycholic acid for 8 weeks starting with the preinterventional day.
      Another 22 patient will receive the standard therapy without the medication. After completion
      of the follow-up, MRI volume data of the lesion will be acquired and compared to the
      dosimetric treatment plan. Blood samples are tested for liver-specific and inflammatory
      laboratory parameters.
