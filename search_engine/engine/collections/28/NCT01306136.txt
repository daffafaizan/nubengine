      advancement of treatments for PTSD among Spanish-speaking Latinos, particularly Puerto
      Ricans. This area of research is important in light of the limited treatment options
      currently available for Spanish-speakers with PTSD and the long-term negative consequences of
      this condition. Participants in this study are recruited by referral from mental health
      providers in a general health setting. Patients meeting criteria for enrollment will be
      randomly assigned to receive either Prolonged Exposure therapy or treatment as usual.
      Assessments for all participants will be collected at baseline, week 8, and week 16 after
      randomization.
