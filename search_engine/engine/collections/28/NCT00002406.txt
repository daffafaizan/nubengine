      to baseline plasma viral RNA (less than 400 copies/mL vs negative plasma viral RNA result)
      then randomized into one of two arms:

      Arm 1: Indinavir (800 mg, q8h) plus two pre-existing NRTIs. Arm 2: Indinavir (1,200 mg, q12h)
      plus two pre-existing NRTIs. Plasma viral RNA will be measured every 4 weeks for the duration
      of the 24-week study.
