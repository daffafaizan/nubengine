      measurements from the reference device, a blood glucose meter, to the CGM System values
      collected during the study. Specifically, performance will be primarily evaluated in terms of
      the proportion of G4 System values that are within ±20% of glucose meter reference value for
      glucose levels >80 mg/dL and ±20 mg/dL of glucose meter reference values <80 mg/dL. These
      G4-meter matched pairs will be analyzed across the 7 days of wear.

      Safety data of the CGM System will also be collected and safety will be characterized by the
      incidence of anticipated device-related adverse events (ADEs) of subjects who participate in
      the study.
