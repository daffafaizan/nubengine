      its delivery by the vascular system. Hypoxia is associated with adverse patient outcome in
      many human cancers and this association is hypothesized to be due to a combination of
      treatment resistance and aggressive tumor biology.

      The study of hypoxia is also important as new cancer drugs are being developed that are
      specifically active on cancer cells in area of tumors with lower oxygen levels.

      his study involves administering the hypoxia probe pimonidazole hydrochloride to patients
      prior to resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to evaluate the extent, molecular context and
      clinical relevance of hypoxia in clinical pancreatic cancer samples and the subsequently
      derived primary xenograft tumors.

      We propose accrual of patients over a 5-year period to evaluate hypoxia within 100 clinical
      tumor specimens and corresponding primary xenograft tumours where available. The
      complementary techniques of wide-field multicolor fluorescence image analysis microscopy and
      high level flow cytometry will be used to identify potential relationships between
      intratumoral hypoxia and cell proliferation, differentiation, and the expression of putative
      cancer stem cell markers.
