      (SHSC) into SHSC's "MyChart" patient portal system. Next, using alternating expert input and
      input from focus groups of patients, we will develop a library of educational content and
      rules to select and drive delivery of content that will, for the first time, allow patients
      with mood disorders to receive customized, just-in-time educational content using their own
      self-report data to drive selection and timing of the delivery of the content. While we
      expect that this innovation should be beneficial to its users, we cannot assess this without
      adequate numbers of users. So, in this project, we will make this system available to MyChart
      users for six months and collect ongoing feedback on user satisfaction, continuously refining
      the system over the six months with the goal of steadily increasing the number of users
      frequently using this system.
