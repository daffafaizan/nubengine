      alafenamide (TAF) now are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with chronic HBV
      infection because of their significant suppression of viral replication and a high barrier to
      resistance. HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a clinical syndrome defined
      as acute hepatic insult with diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic liver disease. Only a limited
      number of medical treatments are available for ACLF. Although liver transplantation is a
      life-saving treatment for ACLF, the difficulty in finding a suitable donor and the high cost
      hinder its extensive clinical use.

      The precise mechanism underlying the liver injury caused by HBV-related ACLF and the factors
      contributing to the progression of liver failure remain unknown. HBV DNA replication is one
      of the key factors causing the progression from liver damage to liver failure. Current
      clinical guidelines advocate oral antiviral treatment in HBV-related ACLF. However, the
      specific antiviral treatment for patients with liver failure remains unclear. In the past
      years, efficacy of nucleoside analogues, such as lamivudine, entecavir, telbivudine and
      tenofovir, for HBV-related liver failure has been reported. However, no conclusion on which
      nucleoside analogue is the most satisfactory drug for the treatment of HBV-related liver
      failure has not been reached yet.

      In this cohort study, the investigators will compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) in
      HBV-related ACLF in China.
