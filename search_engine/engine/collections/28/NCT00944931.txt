    
      Objective:

      The principal objectives are: 1) to explore the effectiveness of anodal high-density direct
      current (HDDC) stimulation of the brain; and 2) test the focality of the technique.

      Study Population:

      Up to 81 healthy volunteers over the age of 18 will be enrolled.

      Design:

      We will perform three studies:

        1. A parallel trial of anodal and sham HDDC delivered to the lateral prefrontal area,

        2. An exploratory evaluation of the focality of HDDC in the motor cortex and

        3. A study to determine whether HDDC can be better targeted using a finite element model
           (FEM) based on the individual subject's MRI scan (obtained as part of the study).

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome measures are the effect of anodal HDDC (relative to sham) on category
      verbal fluency, and the decay in the HDDC-induced change in corticospinal output excitability
      with distance from the active electrode. Performance on the California Computerized
      Assessment Package is included as a secondary safety outcome.
