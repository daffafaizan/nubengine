        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 humanized monoclonal antibody M195
           when combined with etoposide as a preparative regimen for autologous peripheral blood
           stem cell transplantation in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or
           refractory leukemia.

        -  Determine the qualitative toxicities associated with this regimen in this patient
           population.

        -  Assess preliminary information on engraftment following this conditioning regimen in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 humanized monoclonal antibody M195
      (Y90 MOAB M195).

      Patients receive Y90 MOAB M195 IV over 40 minutes once between days -12 to -9 and etoposide
      IV over several hours on day -3. Peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow are reinfused on
      day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 1 until
      hematopoietic recovery.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB M195 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed between days 10 and 14 and then monthly for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
