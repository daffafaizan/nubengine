      appendix. The purpose of this study is to see whether antibiotic irrigation using gentamicin,
      clindamycin and suction during the surgery works better when compared to suction alone when
      cleaning the stomach cavity.

      Arm A patients will have their abdomen irrigated with the antibiotics, gentamycin and
      clindamycin, and then the wound will be suctioned out. Arm B patients will not have the
      antibiotic irrigation but will have their wound suctioned.
