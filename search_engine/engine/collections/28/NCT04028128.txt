      high in flavanols cocoa in body composition and performance of endurance athletes:

      A randomized, blinded, parallel placebo controlled intervention study was carried out in
      endurance athletes . The number of male athletes enrolled in the study was 40, with ages
      between 18 and 50 years and an aerobic power consumption of oxygen greater than or equal to
      55 mL / kg / min). The intervention was carried out for 10 weeks. Cocoa or placebo
      (maltodextrin) were supplied in sachets of a single daily dose. Cocoa provided 425 mg of
      flavanols/ day.

      Athlete's body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Exercise
      performance was evaluated with a treadmill test protocol determining the maximum aerobic
      capacity and also by determining the time necessary to run a kilometer at maximum speed.

      Adipokines (follistatin, myostatin and leptin) in plasma and serum samples were determined by
      ELISA.

      Diet was determined by three 24h-recall questionnaries and a Food Frecuency questionnaire.
