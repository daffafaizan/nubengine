      confirming the position of nasal jejunal tube after bedside placement when compared with
      endoscopic placement in patients with severe acute pancreatitis.

      Primary endpoint:

      Success rate.

      Secondary Endpoint:

      Adverse effects, Change of intra-abdominal pressure (1h before, 1h after and 3 days after
      placement), Tolerance of enteral nutrition, Time to approach the target calories.
