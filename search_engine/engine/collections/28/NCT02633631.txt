      Contraceptive CHOICE Project. Specifically, the model will provide the following components:
      1) Structured, evidence-based contraceptive counseling; 2) education of providers about
      long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods and evidence-based guidelines for
      contraceptive provision; 3) removal of patient barriers to family planning services; and 4)
      post-visit contraceptive support. The model addresses the barriers to contraceptive uptake.
