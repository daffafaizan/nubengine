      (NNRTI) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2008 and by the
      European Medicines Agency in September 2008 for clinical use in adults with incomplete
      virologic suppression and resistance to previous NNRTI and other antiretroviral classes.

      A question that has not been explored is whether subjects with sustained undetectable HIV-1
      RNA-levels experiencing antiretroviral-related toxicity can safely switch their current PI to
      etravirine. This treatment strategy could allow improvements in tolerability and lipid
      profile and would permit an easy posology (400 mg dissolved in water every 24 hours). We
      designed a proof-of-concept study to test the efficacy and safety of switching from a
      Protease Inhibitor (PI) to etravirine in subjects with viral suppression as an antiretroviral
      strategy of simplification therapy, based on the high antiviral potency, low toxicity,
      together with its easy posology (in water dissolution).

      Patients with HIV-1 infection on HAART PI-based regimen will be randomized to switch from the
      PI to etravirine (400 mg dissolved in water every 24 hours) or to continue with the same
      approach.

      The primary endpoint would be the percentage of patients who maintain virological suppression
      at week 48.
