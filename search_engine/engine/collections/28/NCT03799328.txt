    
      This is a single-arm, open label, study of the intervention of low dose multiple-nut OIT in
      nut allergic children.

      After meeting eligibility criteria, participants will have a food challenge to 2-5 nuts.

      If the oral food challenge is positive, participants will be enrolled in the study to
      multiple nut OIT. A blood draw and quality of life (QOL) survey will occur at baseline.

      Participants will have dose escalation visits of the multiple nut OIT every 2 months to a
      target dose of 30mg of each nut protein. A blood draw and QOL survey will occur at 6 months.

      Participants will then continue with daily ingestion of the 30mg of each nut protein for 1
      year with visits every 3 months.

      After 18 months from the start of the study, another oral food challenge will be given to
      participants to assess the change in the maximum tolerated dose of nuts. A blood draw will
      assess changes in the immune parameters. A QOL survey will occur at 18 months to assess
      changes in QOL.
