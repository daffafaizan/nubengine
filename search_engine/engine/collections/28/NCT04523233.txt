      This observational case-control study will be conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology, Cengiz Gokcek Public Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey, between August 2020 and March
      2021. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of Gaziantep
      University (reference no: 2020/167). The study strictly will be adhered to the principles of
      the Declaration of Helsinki. All women will be provided written informed consent before the
      acquisition of all samples. The study will be included 140 pregnant women who underwent
      amniocentesis at the investigator's perinatology department.

      The study group will be included 70 pregnant women whose fetuses were found to have
      congenital NTDs (eg, anencephaly, spina bifida, acrania, and encephalocele) on detailed
      ultrasonographic examinations between 16 and 37 weeks of pregnancy. The control group
      included pregnant women with healthy fetuses (n = 70), who were matched for gestational weeks
      and maternal age and underwent amniocentesis because of age-related risk or increased risk in
      the triple test. Then, this study will be determined maternal plasma/urine/hair, and amniotic
