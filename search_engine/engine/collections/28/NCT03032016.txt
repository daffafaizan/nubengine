    
      Defitelio® was granted a Marketing Authorisation in Europe under exceptional circumstances on
      18 October 2013. Defitelio® is indicated for the treatment of severe hepatic Veno-Occlusive
      Disease (sVOD) also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) in haematopoietic
      stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) therapy.

      It is indicated in adults and in adolescents, children and infants over 1 month of age.

      As required by the risk management plan, Gentium set up a disease registry to collect safety
      and outcome data, and to assess patterns of utilization of Defitelio® in the post-approval
      setting.

      This is a multi-centre, multinational and prospective observational (non-interventional)
      disease registry of patients with severe hepatic VOD following HSCT and treated with
      Defitelio®.

      The registry will be conducted in European transplant centres that are members of the
      European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).

      The main objective of the registry is to assess the incidence rate of specific SAEs (Serious
      Adverse Events) of interest (including fatalities) in patients with severe hepatic VOD
      post-HSCT treated with Defitelio®.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To describe the population treated with Defibrotide (age, gender, patients with
           pre-existing liver or severe renal insufficiency; patient with intrinsic lung disease)

        -  To determine the incidence rate of multiorgan failure (MOF) and Graft versus host
           disease (GvHD) in adult and paediatric patients receiving Defibrotide.

        -  To determine survival by Day+100 post-HSCT, overall mortality and mortality due to VOD
           in patients treated with Defibrotide.

        -  To determine the rate of VOD and VOD with MOF resolution any time after treatment
           initiation in patients treated with Defibrotide.
