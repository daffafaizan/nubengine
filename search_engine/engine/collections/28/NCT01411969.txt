      nostril to the nasal valve (NV), the most important site of nasal obstruction. Literature
      presents different opinions regarding the anatomical correlation of the two notches at the
      beginning of the rhinogram curve in normal adult Caucasian individuals.

      This prospective study included 32 nasal cavities under the following conditions: 1st - basal
      condition; 2nd - with external nasal dilator strip (ENDS) (Breath RightÂ®); 3rd - after
      decongestion (0.05% oxymetazoline chloride applied as an aerosol spray); 4th - after
      decongestion with ENDS.
