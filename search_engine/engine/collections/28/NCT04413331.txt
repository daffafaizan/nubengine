      leading to an alteration of the vascular wall. The classification of vasculitides has evolved
      considerably over the last few decades.

      In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology established a classification of the main
      systemic vasculitides based on clinical, biological and histological criteria. In 1994, the
      Chapel Hill nomenclature has been established as the reference classification system of
      vasculitides and vasculitides were classified according to the size of the affected vessels.
      The Chapel Hill nomenclature was revised in 2012, thus enabling to integrate new vasculitides
      and diagnostic tools.

      It is proposed here to conduct a non-interventional cohort study of the different forms of
      vasculitis, as defined in the Chapel Hill nomenclature. By collecting data from a large
      number of patients followed prospectively, our objective is to describe the clinical patterns
      of these diseases, the presentation, management, comorbidities and outcomes, and to evaluate
      their possible association with some immunological, genetic and molecular parameters.
