    
      This study is aimed at examining the interest of amyloid radiotracer Florbetapir (18F-AV-45)
      for the etiological diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment and dementia. This study
      stems from two converging objectives: (1) the need to refine characteristics of vascular
      cognitive impairment (VCI) and dementia (VD) in order to propose diagnosis criteria of VCI
      and of mixed dementia and to improve diagnosis criteria of VD and (2) the need to improve the
      etiological diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment and dementia. It will take advantage
      from the ongoing GRECOG-VASC study (which determines the cognitive status 6 months poststroke
      in consecutive patients according to a standardized international battery) coordinated by the
      Amiens University Hospital center, the opportunity to perform amyloid imaging in vivo using
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Florbetapir (a production site is located in the city
      of Amiens) and the collaboration between neurology and imaging departments of Amiens
      University hospital.
