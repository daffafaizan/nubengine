      is increasing. Poor long-term success observed with current weight-control strategies
      stresses the relevance to explore new weight management approaches. One of these approaches,
      referred to as Health-At-Every-Size (HAES), is a new weight paradigm that focuses on a
      healthy lifestyle by promoting overall health benefits of behavioral changes related to
      dietary habits and physical activity and emphasizes self-acceptance and well-being,
      independently of body weight status. Studies on the effects of a HAES approach have shown
      significant improvements in metabolic and psychological variables.

      To our knowledge, no study has yet reported the short and long-term impacts of a HAES
      approach on a cluster of variables (psychological, morphological, metabolic, and nutritional)
      in women. The aim of this study is to measure the effects of a HAES approach on global health
      status of premenopausal overweight women preoccupied about their weight and who have been
      unsuccessful in previous weight loss attempts. In this parallel controlled trial, women will
      be randomized to one of the 3 treatment conditions: HAES group, Social support group (SS), or
      Control group. Measurements will be taken in the short term as well as in the long term (up
      to 1 year post-intervention).
