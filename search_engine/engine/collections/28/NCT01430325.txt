      participant blinding include offering regular air at a lower pressure than the hyperbaric
      oxygen intervention, or compressing all participants to the same pressure but providing
      different gas mixes to the active and sham arms.

      In some trials of hyperbaric oxygen for brain injury, investigators offer a sham chamber
      session (regular air at 1.2 atmospheres absolute [atm abs]) compared to the active
      intervention, hyperbaric oxygen (100% oxygen at 1.5 atm abs). It is unknown whether
      individuals familiar with pressure changes, such as divers and hyperbaric chamber inside
      attendants, could discern the difference between these pressures and thereby become unblinded
      to study allocation.

      In this study, 80 experienced divers and chamber inside attendants will be enrolled and
      randomly assigned to one of four possible chamber pressures and one of two breathing gases.
      After a brief hyperbaric chamber excursion, they will be asked to what chamber pressure they
      were compressed and what gas they breathed. If participants can accurately report chamber
      pressure or breathing gas, pressure-familiar individuals should be excluded from blinded
      clinical trials of hyperbaric oxygen.
