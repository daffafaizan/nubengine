      with ACS post-PCI will be recruited according to the resource available of each participating
      center to represent real-world setting. Patients enrolled in the project will accept
      two-years' follow-up and will be assessed on mortality, cardiovascular events, and severity
      of depressive or anxiety symptoms using self-rating scales continuously during the trial, in
      which their treatment for anxiety or depression will also be documented.
