      blood loss after general anesthesia during cesarean section therefore it is important the
      investigators identify all pharmacological contributors to poor uterine tone. Furthermore,
      anesthesiologists are increasingly called upon to care for women undergoing a range of
      in-utero fetal surgeries which require a careful balanced anesthetic and strict control of
      uterine tone.

      This will be the first study that compares the three commonly used intravenous anesthesia
      agents on human myometrium: ketamine, etomidate and propofol. This study is required to allow
      doctors make informed decisions about which anesthesia agent is most suitable to manage their
      patient depending on clinical circumstances.

      The specific objective of this project is to investigate the pharmacological dose-response
      profiles of different anesthesia induction agents by in-vitro isometric tension measurements
      of contractions in gravid human myometrium. The investigators will study both spontaneous and
      oxytocin induced contractility.
