    
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system disease that usually exhibits a high
      variability in clinical findings both among and within families. About 50% of individuals
      with TSC develop intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The
      purpose of this research study is to learn more information about ASD/ID in individuals with
      TSC through neurobehavioral assessments, electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and magnetic
      resonance imaging so that ultimately effective treatments and interventions for ASD/ID can be
      realized.

      Individuals with TSC will be asked to participate in this study if they are 18 months or
      older at the time of enrollment and have been diagnosed with suspected or confirmed autism
      spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability, as well as healthy controls. Both males and
      females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study participation,
      individuals' primary communicative language must be English. The participant and at least one
      biological parent will be asked to provide biological specimens including DNA and RNA for
      inclusion in the TSC RDCRN Biorepository.

      The study involves 3 on site visits over the course of two years. Study visits will vary in
      length from about 4 hours to 6 hours. Study visits involve a physical exam, medical history
      questions, and neuropsychological assessments. A subset of participants between the ages of 2
      and 11 years old will take part in the EEG portion of the study. At one point during the
      study, a blood draw will be done for future research studies. Individuals who have a
      clinically indicated MRI will have an option to provide routine clinical scans for analysis.
