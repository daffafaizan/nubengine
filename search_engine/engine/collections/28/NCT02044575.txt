      septic patient settings, yet.

      Clock genes are involved in modulating the activity of several transcription factors that are
      important regulators of immune functions (e.g. HIF1-α, STAT1, STAT3, and NF-κB) (Bellet MM et
      al., 2013).

      Furthermore, polymorphisms such as rs7221412, a common polymorphism near period homolog 1
      (PER1), was associated with the timing of activity rhythms and also showed a suggestive
      time-dependent relationship with both cerebral cortex and monocytes PER1 expression and an
      association with time of death (Lim ASP et al., 2012).

      This explorative project is a pilot study. First data are generated for the assessment of the
      circadian system in patients with septic shock.
