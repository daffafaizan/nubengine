      I. To compare white wine (Arm A) to non-wine nutritional supplement (Arm B) for the treatment
      of cancer-associated anorexia.

      II. To evaluate the side effect profile of white wine (Arm A).

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to primary malignant disease (lung vs
      gastrointestinal vs other [specify]), severity of weight loss (excluding peri-operative
      weight loss) within the past 2 months (< 4.6 kg [< 10 lbs] vs >= 4.6 kg [>= 10 lbs]), age (<
      50 years vs >= 50 years), and planned concurrent chemotherapy or radiation (yes vs no).

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients consume white wine with =< 15% alcohol content twice daily for 3-4 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients receive an oral non-wine nutritional supplement (e.g., Boost or Ensure) twice
      daily for 3-4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
