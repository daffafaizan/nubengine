      their ability to increase muscle mass and/or attenuate loss of muscle mass. Leucine,
      isoleucine, and valine are branched chain amino acids that have been studied extensively and
      have been shown to stimulate muscle anabolism. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a
      metabolite of leucine, has been suggested to play a significant role in preserving muscle
      mass in situations that favor muscle mass loss. This is thought to occur through stabilizing
      sarcolemma integrity, reduced proteasome activity and expression of the proteasome 20S
      subunit, inhibition of apoptosis, and by activation of skeletal muscle satellite cells.
      Furthermore, in a catabolic-induced myotube and a murine adenocarcinoma cell line, HMB (50ÂµM)
      was more potent in reversing the increased protein degradation and decreased protein
      synthesis compared to a higher dose of leucine (1mM). Similar findings were reported in a
      rodent cancer model. These data suggests that HMB plays a significant role in preventing
      muscle wasting.

      Understanding the metabolic fate of HMB is crucial to developing strategies to increase HMB
      concentrations in populations that are subjected to muscle wasting. The objective of this
      application is to determine if a cholesterol lowering statin alters HMB metabolism in healthy
      adults. The Researchers will test the hypotheses that with statin administration, HMB
      metabolism and urinary excretion is affected and that this will have an unknown effect on the
      production of HMB and the response to intake of HMB precursors like leucine.
