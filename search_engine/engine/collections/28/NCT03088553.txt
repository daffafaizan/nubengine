      ganciclovir can reduce the time of negation of the CMV-DNA load.

      Secondary objectives are to determine the concentration-toxicity relationship of ganciclovir
      and the relationship between concentrations of ganciclovir and apparition of CMV gene
      mutations responsible of drug resistance.

      Each week, trough concentrations of ganciclovir are measured, associated with control of
      CMV-DNA load and all biological analysis currently necessary for the monitoring of the
      infection.
