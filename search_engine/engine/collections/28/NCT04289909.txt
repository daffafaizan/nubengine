      non-randomized pilot study which aims to identify in patients with MS at different stages if
      the presence of retinal perivascular inflammation can be detected and quantified using
      adaptive optics, which is a non-invasive examination.

      Investigators will recruit MS patients in 3 subgroups, depending on their phenotype
      (Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) without optic neuritis, RRMS with optic
      neuritis, progressive MS), with 15 patients in each group.

      15 healthy volunteers (HV) will also be enrolled.

      The comparison of these groups is necessary to determine if there are significant
      differences, allowing us to highlight biomarkers in MS patients in order to enable highly
      efficient and robust trials designs in the future.

      To test the hypothesis, the study has 3 visits over 6 months (M0, M3 and M6). Neurological
      evaluation, blood sample, imaging, ophthalmologic evaluation and Adaptive optics
      ophthalmoscopy assessments will be performed.
