      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Host immunogenetic factors contribute to HBV-associated liver
      damage and/or carcinogenesis. Variant cytokine alleles, including tumor necrosis
      factor-α(TNF-α)and interleukin-1β(IL-1β), might contribute to interindividual difference in
      inflammatory responses and account for heterogeneous disease outcome of infectious disease.

      By detecting polymorphisms of IL-1β and TNF-α,this study aims to find the effects of cytokine
      gene polymorphisms(and their interaction) on susceptibility and severity of HBV-related HCC.
