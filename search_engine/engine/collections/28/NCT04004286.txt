      clinical data registry and tissue biobank (pain registry/biobank) for the advancement of
      pain-related research. This Pain Registry Biobank will address the complexity of pain by
      utilizing the Pain Assessment Screening Tool & Outcomes Registry (PASTOR), a thorough
      biopsychosocial assessment that extends beyond a single-item pain rating scale. PASTOR is an
      assessment battery that includes several Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
      System (PROMIS) scales developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other
      important scales that span physical, psychological, social, and behavioral aspects of pain
      and pain-related treatments. As a uniform assessment system, PASTOR also mitigates a
      significant challenge in pain-related research, the lack of standardized, cross-study
      outcomes. Additionally, the richness of PASTOR data matched with biological samples allows
      future researchers to address significant research gaps and enhance health care for service
      members, veterans, and civilians.
