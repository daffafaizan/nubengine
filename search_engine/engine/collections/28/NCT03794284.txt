      around the world, and was associated with poorer outcomes, including respiratory failure and
      mortality. Rapid and accurate tools for diagnosis of TB is of great importance in initial
      treatment and for better treatment outcomes. Other than TB, non-tuberculous mycobacterium
      (NTM) pulmonary infections are emerging in many regions of the world. These bacterium are
      more common to be found in respiratory specimens than MTB. With similar clinical presentation
      of NTM pulmonary infections and pulmonary TB, misdiagnosis of NTM pulmonary infections to
      pulmonary TB would lead to unnecessary intake of anti-TB medications and delay of the
      initiation of corresponding treatment.

      This test aims to detect MTB as well differentiate the NTM species involved in pulmonary
      infections simultaneously using VereMTB.
