      encompasses 10 content modules with a strong focus on evidence-based cognitive-behavioral
      techniques, either from its so-called first (behavior-oriented), second (cognitive-oriented)
      or third wave (e.g. mindfulness and acceptance): (1) psychoeducation, (2) behavioral
      activation, (3) cognitive modification, (4) mindfulness and acceptance, (5) interpersonal
      skills, (6) relaxation, physical exercise and lifestyle modification, (7) problem solving and
      (8) expressive writing and forgiveness, (9) positive psychology and (10) dreamwork and
      emotion-focus interventions. The ten modules are framed by one introductory and one summary
      module. Communication is carried out online via simulated dialogues. Patients have to respond
      to narrative text messages from the virtual therapists in multiple-choice response fashion,
      enabling them to express doubt, to affirm a particular message or to request more
      information. Text messages are aided with drawings, photographs and animations. The program
      is adaptive and selects exercises and contents on the basis of the subject's response. The
      modules are sequential and each module refers and builds upon previous one. Modules can (and
      should be) repeated within the intervention period.
