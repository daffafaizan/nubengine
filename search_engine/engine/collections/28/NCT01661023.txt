      developing among women under age 50. Despite this, there is scant information on predisposing
      factors in African populations. We are proposing a multidisciplinary case-control study at
      three hospitals in Accra and Kumasi that treat the majority of breast cancers in Ghana. We
      have begun this investigation as a pilot endeavor and are seeking approval for continuation
      into a full-scale effort, which over the two years following the pilot will result in a total
      of approximately 2,000 interviewed cases and 2,000 population controls. Tumor tissue samples
      are being sought from cases in order to classify them into subtypes (including triple
      negative tumors, which predominate among young African women). A detailed questionnaire is
      being administered in hospital and anthropometry measurements are being taken. Additionally,
      subjects are being asked to donate blood, saliva, and stool samples for assessment of genetic
      and other biologic markers. Similar materials are being collected from population controls.
      In addition to providing unique data relevant for improving prevention activities, this study
      will build capacity for additional research activities in Ghana.
