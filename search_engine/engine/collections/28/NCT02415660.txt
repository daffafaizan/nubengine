      spinal pain is low. Muscles comprise the majority of the stability for the cervical spine,
      yet neck muscle function can be altered in the presence of pain. Research has consistently
      shown the benefit of including thoracic spine manipulation (SMT) in the treatment of patients
      with mechanical neck pain. Emerging evidence is now also showing promising benefit of
      including trigger point dry needling (TDN) for the treatment of mechanical neck pain.
      Treatment regimens commonly address anterior cervical stabilizing musculature, but little is
      known regarding the response to treatment of the deep posterior stabilizing musculature.

      This study will assess the short term response of thoracic SMT with or without TDN in 58
      subjects with a primary complaint of mechanical neck pain. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive 2 treatment visits approximately 2-3 days apart of either SMT+sham TDN or SMT+TDN.
      TDN will be directed to the upper trapezius and deep cervical extensor muscles of the neck.
      Outcomes of interest will be changes in function and pain. Assessments will be made at
      baseline, immediately after the first treatment, at the 2nd treatment, and approximately 5-7
      days after the 2nd treatment visit. A subgroup of 20 subjects (10 per group) will also have
      the upper trapezius and deep cervical extensor muscle activation assessed via shear wave
      elastography, and deep cervical flexor activation assessed via the craniocervical flexion
      test.
