      14,000 children in the US. Although a single study has demonstrated reduces CYP1A2 activity
      following Gh replacement therapy, the effect of GH on the most abundant phase 1
      biotransformation pathways (e.g. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) remain largely uncharacterized. This
      information gap exists largely due to the lack of sufficiently safe, specific and
      non-invasive methods appropriate for the longitudinal evaluation of enzyme activity in young
      children. We can overcome these problems by employing validated phenotyping methods using
      caffeine, a commonly ingested dietary substance and dextromethorphan, a safe, non-sedating
      over the counter anti-tussive agent. Application of these methods will permit us to identify,
      characterize and describe the isoform-specific effects of rhGH on major phase 1 hepatic drug
      biotransformation pathways, thereby addressing this information gap with minimal risk to
      children.
