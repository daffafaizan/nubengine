      obstruction during sleep. Systemic and airway inflammation has been recently shown to be
      associated with OSA and is hypothesized to contribute to the clinical manifestation and the
      complications of OSA patients.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a first-line treatment for OSA and improves
      diurnal and nocturnal symptoms. However, the effectiveness of CPAP in reversing airway
      inflammation is less compelling in comparison to systemic inflammation.

      This study will assess NO in exhaled breath, inflammatory biomarkers in induced sputum and
      blood of OSA patients and other clinical measurements before and after 3 months of CPAP
      treatment.
