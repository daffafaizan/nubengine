      organ transplantation. So called "tolerogenic immunosuppression" involves induction with
      lymphocyte depleting antibodies followed by monotherapy with calcineurin inhibitors,
      cyclosporin or tacrolimus. The proposed study aims to evaluate a protocol of
      immunosuppression induction with lymphocyte depleting antibody Campath given prior to graft
      reperfusion, followed by tacrolimus monotherapy in highly sensitized patients (PRA >14% or
      past historical =/>50% and/or multiple renal transplants) undergoing renal transplantation,
      and compare it with the current standard protocol at UTMB which employs induction with
      Thymoglobulin given over 4 days followed by 3 drugs: tacrolimus, mycophenolate and steroids.
      In both groups of patients the target tacrolimus levels will be the same i.e, between 10 to
      15ng/mL, soon after the transplant. In the Campath gro up, tacrolimus will be tapered after 3
      months in patients who do not have rejection and appear to be developing donor specific
      tolerance.
