      left atrium and pulmonary vein anatomy before the pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure.
      Most commonly, CT or MR are performed few days/weeks before the procedure. Three dimensional
      rotational angiography is least commonly used. However it has the advantage that it can be
      performed in the EP room just before the ablation procedure. There is still no consensus if
      any kind of imaging is really needed to perform safe and effective PVI.

      The investigators want to determine if 3D rotational angiography (as a mode of preprocedural
      imaging) has positive impact on procedure safety and efficacy. Also the investigators want to
      compare the immediate procedure characteristics. The investigators are conducting a
      randomized study with 1:1 randomization and planning to enroll around 100 participants with 1
      year follow up.
