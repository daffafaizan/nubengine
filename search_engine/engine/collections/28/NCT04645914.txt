      The skin blood flow of the extremities is determined as a reference value. Laser Doppler
      Imaging produces images of the blood flow using the perfusion units (PU).

      All measurements are taken under controlled vital parameters (body temperature, systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) and controlled room temperature as well as 15-minute
      acclimatization of the subjects.

      For smokers or vapers, the perfusion is measured again after consuming a cigarette or an
      e-cigarette respectively. The difference of blood flow after smoking or vaping is calculated
      using both measures.

      The total duration of the study per subject is approximately 25-30 minutes.
