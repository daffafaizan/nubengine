      during sleep, as a result of which there is a decrease or complete cessation of airflow. This
      leads to repeated episodes of hypoxia during sleep and sleep fragmentation. OSA is a highly
      prevalent though under-recognized clinical problem. The Wisconsin study estimated a
      prevalence of 24% in males and 9% in females. A population-based study in Delhi, India found
      the prevalence of OSA to be 13.7% and that of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) to be
      3.8%.

      OSA is associated with various systemic complications such as neurocognitive dysfunction,
      cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. There is an increased risk of
      motor vehicle and occupational accidents in people suffering from OSAS.

      Metabolic syndrome is the co-occurrence of several cardiovascular risk factors such as
      abdominal obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia. Presence of OSA
      together with metabolic syndrome is known as 'Syndrome Z'. Although many studies have shown
      that OSA is associated with metabolic syndrome, the exact causal relationship between these
      two entities is not proven.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment for OSA with significant
      symptoms. However, it is a costly treatment option, and poor compliance is an important
      limiting factor. CPAP treatment has been shown to improve the daytime somnolence and
      neurocognitive function in people with OSAS. However, its effect on metabolic syndrome in
      people with OSAS is unclear.

      This study aims to assess the effect of CPAP treatment on metabolic syndrome in patients with
      OSAS.
