    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of
      temsirolimus administered weekly for 2 doses in combination with intensive re-induction
      chemotherapy in children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL).

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of temsirolimus in combination with intensive
      re-induction chemotherapy in children with relapsed ALL or NHL administered on this schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare minimal-residual disease (MRD) levels present at end of induction to historical
      control in patients with relapsed ALL or NHL with bone marrow involvement of disease.

      II. To determine the complete remission (CR) rate in patients with ALL or NHL who receive
      this regimen.

      III. To evaluate responsiveness of patient ALL cells to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      inhibition using in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic assessment of the response of ALL
      blasts to temsirolimus.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-5 and 15-19;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-2; temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 8; vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; and pegaspargase IV over 1
      hour on days 3 and 17. Some patients may also receive methotrexate intrathecally (IT) up to
      72 hours prior to or on day 1 and on day 8.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.
