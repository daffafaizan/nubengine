      French prisons, which means 178 care units and 8 secures inpatient care units. The
      investigators census every patient with terminal illness, which was defined in this study as
      an evolutive pathology with a life prognosis less than a year.

      A questionnaire was completed by these physicians for every situation. The census was
      conducted for three months across France.

      For the qualitative study, the investigators selected 14 specific situations chosen into
      these which had been identified by the physicians.

      The investigators wanted to get 3 types of patients :

        1. patient who had obtained a compassionate release

        2. patient whose demand has been refused

        3. patient who did not demand any release. The four interviews (patients, physisians,
           judges, probation workers) for each situation has explained the global situation.

      Each interviewee spoke about the situation with his/her perspective and sense that they
      attributed to the actions of others.

      This research analyzes the particularity of each of these end of life situations in prison.
