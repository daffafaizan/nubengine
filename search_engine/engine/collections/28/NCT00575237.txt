      for elective gynecologic laparoscopic surgery were randomly allocated to either the current
      standard (control group) or to additional efforts to remove residual CO2 at the end of
      surgery (intervention group; power analysis yielded 45 patients necessary per group). In the
      control group, CO2 was removed by passive deflation of the abdominal cavity through the holes
      of the trocar. In the intervention group, CO2 was removed by means of Trendelenburg position
      (> 30 degrees) with 5 manual pulmonary recruitment maneuvers. Postoperative shoulder pain was
      assessed prior to discharge and 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours later using a visual analog scale
      (VAS). In addition, positional characteristics of the shoulder pain and incidence of
      postdischarge nausea and vomiting (PDNV) were recorded 48 hours after surgery.
