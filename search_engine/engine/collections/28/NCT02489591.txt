      collapse. Subsequently, they will undergo two clinical polysomnographies (PSGs) to measure
      the effect of an oral appliance (a site specific therapy) on upper airway collapsibility and
      sleep apnea severity. During the first hour of each clinical PSG, the passive pharyngeal
      collapsibility will be determined using the standard 5-breath continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) drop method. During the remainder of the night, patients will be monitored to
      determine sleep apnea severity (apnea-hypopnea index). These measurements will allow the
      investigators to determine which pharyngeal collapsing site responds best (both in terms of
      collapsibility and AHI) to mandibular advancement with an oral appliance. Patients who have
      their own oral appliance will be recruited. In addition, patients without an oral appliance
      will be provided with a temporary oral appliance for the study.
