      cartilage lesions primarily of the knee. In the initial autologous cultured chondrocyte
      transplantation (ACT or, by others implantation, thus ACI) reported by Peterson et. al., the
      results of femoral lesions were favorable, while 5 of 7 patellofemoral treatments were poor.
      In the United States, the expedited FDA approval based on these results excluded the patella.
      As a result, in the United States, it has been difficult to further evaluate use of ACI at
      the patellofemoral joint in light of the exclusion of "off label" uses by many governmental
      and private insurance programs. Nevertheless, a growing body of knowledge is accumulating
      outside the United States that the use of ACI at the patella is a viable option and soon
      similar findings will be published in the US by Minas et. al. (accepted for publication)
