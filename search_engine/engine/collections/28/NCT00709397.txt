      treatment-experienced subjects initiating raltegravir. The data derived from this study will
      further elucidate the effects of antiviral therapy on viral decay and help refine current
      viral dynamics models. In addition, results of this study will generate hypotheses for
      further testing regarding the mechanisms of action of integrase inhibitor therapy in salvage
      regimens. Lastly, this viral dynamic study on a unique cohort will provide an opportunity to
      further validate the effectiveness of the methods of measuring rate of decrease of viral RNA
      and DNA in piloting potential potent drug regimens.
