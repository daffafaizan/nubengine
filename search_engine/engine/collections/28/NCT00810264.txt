    
      This study is an FDA-required, multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, data collection
      registry. Eligible patients must have been successfully implanted with a Corox OTW BP, Corox
      OTW-S BP, or Corox OTW-L BP LV lead with a BIOTRONIK CRT device and consented and enrolled
      between 7-180 days following implant. At least 2500 patients will be enrolled in this
      post-approval registry, and each patient will be followed for five years post-implant.

      Safety will be evaluated based on the analysis of the overall incidence of lead-related
      adverse events that require additional invasive intervention. In addition, each individual
      adverse event will be separately investigated. Lead parameters for sensing, pacing
      thresholds, and impedance will also be evaluated. Reporting of all adverse events will be
      performed twice a year in order to identify and characterize any trends in adverse events,
      failure modes, or failure rates.
