      given daily for 5 days every 28 days to patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon
      or rectum. II. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of MGI-114 given on this
      schedule in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114) IV over 5 minutes daily for 5
      consecutive days. Courses are repeated every 28 days. The minimum treatment period is 2
      courses. Treatment continues indefinitely in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects or
      disease progression. Patients are followed at the end of every other course while on the
      study, and then every 3 months thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10
      months.
