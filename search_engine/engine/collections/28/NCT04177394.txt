    
      This is a post-market, multi-center, single-arm, prospective study to assess the safety and
      performance of the next generation MitraClip G4 System. The current protocol describes the
      design of this post-market study.

      Up to 1,100 post-market, consented patients will be treated with a MitraClip G4 device
      according to local guidelines and IFU from the Europe and Middle East, the United States,
      Canada and Latin America and Japan will be included in the analysis for The MitraClip EXPAND
      G4 Study. Follow-up echocardiograms will be collected at Discharge, 30 days and 1 year and 5
      year at post-procedure visits. Additional clinical follow-up visits will be at 6 months
      (phone call), 2, 3, 4 year (office visits). Cardiovascular adverse events will be reported
      through 5 years to confirm safety of the MitraClip G4 System.

      During the Phase 1 of the study 100 subjects were enrolled at 15 sites in the United States
      with the goal of evaluating the early safety and procedural outcomes associated with the
      MitraClip G4. The follow up duration was 30 days. Phase I was completed August 2020.
