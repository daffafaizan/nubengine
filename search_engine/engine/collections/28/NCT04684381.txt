    
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with a mutation in the Î²-hemoglobin gene that results
      in abnormal polymerization of hemoglobin. Polymerization of hemoglobin causes the red blood
      cell to sickle, leading to a cascade of events which cause acute complications for SCD
      patients.

      L-glutamine has been approved in the US to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell
      disease (SCD) in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.

      The purpose of this single-center, open-label, phase 4 study is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety of L-glutamine in patients with SCD.

      8 SCD patients and 4 healthy volunteers will receive weight-based dosing of L-glutamine for 3
      weeks. Doses will be changed weekly: 0.1 g/kg administered twice daily during week 1, 0.3
      g/kg administered twice daily during week 2, and 0.6 g/kg administered once daily during week
      3.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of L-glutamine in
      SCD patients compared with healthy volunteers.
