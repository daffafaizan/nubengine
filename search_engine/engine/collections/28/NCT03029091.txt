    
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effects (good and bad) of
      Losartan potassium on participants with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). If a participant has
      a connective tissue disorder (CTD) the researchers want to see what effects (good or bad)
      Losartan has on EoE.

      EoE is an inflammatory disease of the esophagus that is typically triggered by exposure to
      food. Connective tissue disorders (CTDs) are disorders that affect the connective tissues in
      the body such as tendons and ligaments.

      A protein called transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is associated with both EoE and CTD.
      Losartan may decrease the amount of TGF-beta and therefore help EoE and CTD.

      Losartan is a drug that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for use in adults and children over 6 years of age who have high blood pressure. This
      medication has not been studied in people with EoE.
