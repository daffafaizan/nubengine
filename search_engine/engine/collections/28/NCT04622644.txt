      patients will be registered at emergency room of Hospital, and according to the internal
      procedure will be clinically evaluated by the Neurologist of the stroke team. NIHSS and mRS
      will be administered and scores registered. The scanning with StrokeWave will be performed in
      5 minutes, after NCCT and before the CTA acquisition, in the CT room. StrokeWave will be
      placed on the head of the patients in the CT room passing toward the gantry of the CT
      avoiding any loose of time. After the StrokeWave scanning, the system will be removed. The
      data collected will be processed through an imaging algorithm which is integrated in the
