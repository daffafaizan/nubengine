      University of Alabama at Birmingham with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
      of the skin and at least 8 actinic keratoses on the upper extremities are potentially
      eligible for study participation.

      We propose to examine one topical medication which is already FDA approved,with a placebo
      comparator. The purpose of the study is to see if diclofenac applied daily will affect levels
      of specific biomarkers in the skin that are associated with risk of developing skin cancer.
      We hope to see these levels decrease with once daily use of this medication. Results from
      this study will help guide us in a second study where we will look at longer term use of
      these medications and how they are associated with changes in skin biomarkers that are
      related to skin cancer. The second longer study will use the dose (once or twice daily
      topical application of diclofenac and DMFO) that resulted in a decrease in biomarkers, as
      discovered in this currently proposed study.
