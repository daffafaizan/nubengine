      specific immune response against the B cell idiotype of the malignant clone that constitutes
      the tumor in patients with previously untreated stage III or IV indolent non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen using Genitope
      Corporation's molecular rescue technology in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of oral cyclophosphamide,
      vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until the maximal clinical
      response is achieved followed by 2 additional courses of consolidation therapy for up to a
      maximum of 10 courses. Patients not achieving adequate response receive up to 6 courses of
      alternate chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
      prednisone. At 3 months or up to 1 year following completion of chemotherapy, patients
      achieving adequate disease response receive vaccination consisting of recombinant tumor
      derived immunoglobulin idiotype with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ)
      at 2 sites immediately followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) SQ on day 1. Patients receive GM-CSF
      alone on days 2-4. Vaccination repeats every 4 weeks for 4 doses, followed 12 weeks later by
      the fifth and final dose. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease progression.
