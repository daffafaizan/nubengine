      after mitral valve prolapse repair surgery by the measurements obtained on pulmonary arterial
      catheter and transesophageal echocardiography. Investigators hypothesize that induced mild
      hypercarbia (PaCO2 7.5 kPa) cause elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary
      vascular resistance, and this reflect to the right ventricle, both volume and function. And
      this right ventricle effect could be noticed by echocardiography.
