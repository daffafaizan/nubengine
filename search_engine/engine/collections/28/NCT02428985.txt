      with Riociguat for PAH. A total of 600 patients (valid for safety analysis) is planned to be
      included in 4 years. This study is performed as an "all-case investigation" therefore; all
      patients who receive Riociguat treatment for PAH need to be registered, in principle. The
      treatment should be performed based on the product label in Japan. The standard observation
      period will last for 12 months from starting Riociguat treatment. Safety and effectiveness
      will be evaluated at the 3rd and 12th month of treatment. In addition, the extension
      observation period will be carried out as long as Riociguat treatment continues or at most
      for more 6 years. The purpose is to collect information on safety and effectiveness, such as
      adverse events and clinical worsening of PAH, once a year. Combining the standard observation
      and the extension observation period the patient could be followed for at most 7 years. When
      Riociguat treatment is terminated, the observation of the patient ends. The investigator
      should record data for each patient, as defined in the protocol, using the Electronic Data
      Capture (EDC) system. The duration of the study is of approximately 8 years from PAH
      indication approval.
