      effects of a musical intervention or training on children's brain development. The study will
      investigate how regular instruction in the Suzuki-like method of violin affects brain
      structure and function over the course of approximately five (5) months in preschool-aged
      children participating in an Early Childhood/Headstart preschool program when compared to a
      control group of their peers.
