    
      LCCC1410 is designed to compare the change in p16 from baseline to end of chemotherapy in 100
      older (â‰¥ 65 years) breast cancer patients participating in a home-based physical activity
      program (intervention group) to 100 patients in the concurrent control group not
      participating in a physical activity intervention (enrolled in a separate RO1 study as
      described in section 1.7). The biomarker p16 is known to dramatically increase with
      chemotherapy, and we hypothesize that the increase will be attenuated by a physical activity
      intervention. We will evaluate changes in p16 between the two study populations. Data from
      the geriatric assessment at baseline will be used to characterize the study population, and
      subscale scores from the GA will also be assessed for differences between baseline and end of
      chemotherapy to compare the LCCC1410 study population with the concurrent control.
