      ropivacaine in comparison to standard pain management after elective distal metatarsal
      osteotomy for postoperative pain control. The primary outcome parameters of this study were
      average pain and peak pain level on the verbal numeric rating scale (NRS; 1-10, higher
      numbers indicating increasing pain level) during the first 48 hours after surgery. The
      secondary outcome parameters included postoperative rescue opioid consumption, clinical
      outcome (AOFAS forefoot score, ROM of MTP joint of the greater toe), incidence of
      postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction with surgery on a numeric rating scale
      (1-10).
