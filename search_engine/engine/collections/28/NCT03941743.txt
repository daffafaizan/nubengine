      I. To obtain preliminary data to support whether fingolimod hydrochloride (fingolimod) will
      prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients receiving weekly
      adjuvant/neoadjuvant paclitaxel therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain pilot data regarding the possible relative toxicities related to fingolimod
      therapy in this study situation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fingolimod hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) starting the day before
      chemotherapy, the day of chemotherapy, and 1 day after chemotherapy for 12 weeks.
