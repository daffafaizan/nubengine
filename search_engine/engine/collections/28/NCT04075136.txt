      150 subjects will be randomized into three separate arms. This study compares the efficacy of
      standard of care Lucentis (ranibizumab) monotherapy versus OCTA-Directed PDT Triple Therapy
      with Lucentis (ranibizumab), PDT with Visudyne (verteporfin), and Triescence (triamcinolone
      acetonide) in treatment-na√Øve patients with Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
      OCTA-Directed PDT Double Therapy with Lucentis (ranibizumab) and PDT with Visudyne
      (verteporfin) will also be tested to confirm the hypothesis that steroids are necessary.
