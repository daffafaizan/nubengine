      Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) and Occupational Stress Indicator-2 were
      used in this study before and three months after intervention. A total of 112 abused
      psychiatric nurses were randomly assigned to 3 groups. The biofeedback group (n=40) received
      the biofeedback training and the self-training group received video relaxation training by
      Line (n=44). The control group (n=28) did not receive any intervention.

      Biofeedback training is an effective intervention to enhance abused PW nurses' resilience and
      lower their depressive symptoms. Video relaxation self-training is also an effective way to
      strengthen abused psychiatric nurses' resilience.
