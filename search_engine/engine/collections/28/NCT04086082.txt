    
      Markerless Tumour Tracking will be integrated with existing treatment machines to provide
      real-time monitoring of tumour motion during treatment delivery. Eligible patients will be
      implanted with fiducial markers, which act as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of
      Markerless Tumour Tracking. The patients will undergo the current standard of care
      radiotherapy, with the exception that kilovoltage x-ray images will be acquired continuously
      during treatment delivery to enable Markerless Tumour Tracking.
