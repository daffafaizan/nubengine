      of people at some point during their lives. It is associated with significant psychosocial
      morbidity, and there remains the need for efficacious and low risk therapeutic options.

      Recently, the FDA has approved various lasers for the treatment of acne. However, few
      randomized, controlled clinical trials have been performed. In addition, the use of topical
      photosensitizers preceding laser therapy for acne has also been examined in a preliminary way
      with some initial evidence of efficacy. However, these small trials have primarily focused on
      back acne and have included modest numbers of subjects. Photodynamic therapy for facial acne
      is being performed by physicians across the country but little objective data regarding this
      practice is available.

      We propose to evaluate the efficacy and confirm the safety of pulsed dye laser therapy
      (V-Beam laser, Candela Corp., Wayland, MA, 595 nm wavelength) used in conjunction with a
      topical photosensitizer in the treatment of acne vulgaris. This is a split-face comparison
      study in which one half of the face will be treated with photo-sensitizer and laser, and the
      contralateral side will be left untreated. Because one proposed mechanism of action for such
      treatments includes altered sebaceous gland activity, we also seek to examine the effects of
      this treatment on cutaneous sebum production.
