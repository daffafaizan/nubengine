      department (ED). Topical anesthetic drops are routinely used prior to slit-lamp examination
      for diagnosis of corneal abrasions and often provide immediate pain relief. Patients are then
      sent home with oral analgesics and topical antibiotics. The use of topical anesthetics for
      outpatient treatment of corneal abrasions is discouraged by most emergency medicine textbooks
      due to concerns over safety. Case reports of abuse and misuse as well as animal studies have
      suggested that long term use of topical anesthetics may lead to rare complications. Two
      clinical trials showed no delayed healing after a short course of topical anesthetics
      following PRK surgery. Whether this could be applied to nonsurgical patients in the ED was
      investigated by two small clinical trials that showed similar efficacy and safety but were
      underpowered to prove a statistical difference. In 2014, a larger randomized trial
      demonstrated the safety of tetracaine for ED patients with corneal abrasions but failed to
      show a significant difference in patient visual analogue scale (VAS) pain ratings over time.
      More recently, a retrospective cohort study of 444 ED patients given tetracaine for 24 hours
      reported no serious complications or uncommon adverse events. If topical anesthetics could be
      safely prescribed for short term use in the management of corneal abrasions, it is possible
      that this would decrease use of systemic opioids for this purpose. The aim of this
      randomized, double-blind trial was to compare the effectiveness of topical tetracaine versus
      placebo in ED patients with corneal abrasions as measured by a reduction in the VAS score.
