    
      After being taken to the operation room, the patient will be divided into two groups as group
      D (diabetic) and group K (control) by standardized anesthesia monitoring with 5-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and noninvasive blood pressure
      measurements.

      In both groups, spinal anesthesia will be applied in a lateral decubitus position using a 22
      gauge Quincke spinal needle from the interspinal space as 0.5% heavy marcaine 10-12.5 mg 1
      min. Atropine 0.5 mg and ephedrine 5 mg should be administered if bradycardia develops in
      both groups. The disease tourniquet will be applied after induction, in accordance with the
      literature, to be above 150 mmHg of the systolic blood pressure.
