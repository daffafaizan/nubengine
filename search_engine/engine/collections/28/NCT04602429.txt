    
      The Children's Acute Surgical Abdomen Programme (CASAP) is a prospective national
      observational cohort study which aims to characterise the type and quality of care being
      delivered to children having emergency abdominal surgery.

      We aim to recruit every U.K. hospital undertaking this type of surgery in children, and
      capture information on 5000 patients over the study period.

      The data collected will include information on patient risk factors, compliance with process
      quality indicators and the incidence and type of postoperative complications encountered. The
      data collected will be used to describe the current epidemiology of this patient group and to
      develop and internally validate a risk prediction tool for children undergoing emergency
      abdominal surgery. This tool be used to provide hospitals with their own risk-adjusted
      outcome measures and can subsequently be used to inform bedside decision-making. Patients
      will be followed up for 10 years through a data linkage process with NHS Digital national
      databases.
