      Study Overview. A randomized, cross-over experimental design was conducted. Each participant
      visited the laboratory on four occasions which were separated by two to five days.
      Measurement of body mass, familiarization with experimental procedures and cycling peak
      oxygen consumption test (VO2peak) were performed on the first visit. Participants took part
      in inertial-load exercise (ILE) on the remaining test days. On each separate session, a
      different inter-sprint recovery duration was employed (i.e. 15, 30 or 45-s). Cycling power
      output, pulmonary gas exchange, vastus lateralis de-oxygenation status, heart rate and blood
      lactate were measured.
