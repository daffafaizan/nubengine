        -  To acquire data for the development of one-day rest/stress cardiac PET perfusion imaging
           protocols for BMS747158 with comparable diagnostic image quality to a two-day
           rest/stress PET protocol

        -  To assess the safety of multiple doses of BMS747158

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess PET imaging parameters and image quality following administration of BMS747158
           at rest and at stress (pharmacologic or exercise) same day (at different time intervals)
           and 16-48 hours after the rest injection

        -  To assess feasibility of gated cardiac PET imaging with BMS747158 for left ventricular
           function assessment

        -  To assess agreement of one and two day rest/stress PET imaging with BMS747158 in
           patients with reversible ischemia with rest/stress single photon emission computed
           tomography (SPECT) imaging

        -  To perform a preliminary assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of one-day and two-day
           rest/stress PET perfusion imaging with BMS747158 as compared with invasive coronary
           angiography or computed tomography angiography (CTA) for detection of
