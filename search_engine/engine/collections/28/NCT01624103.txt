      area (CSA) of brachial plexus at the first rib, allowed a 35% reduction of LA volume for an
      effective US-SCB in comparison with the younger patients (2). Ultrasound-guided regional
      anesthesia becomes an increasingly popular technique and its performance must be as
      comfortable as possible. Therefore, Comfort score during block placement is extremely
      important. Comfort Score is consisted of maximum pain intensity (VAS), the satisfaction of
      the patient and the number of unpleasant events declared by the patients. It is calculated as
      the sum of each criterion, which was attributed a value of 0 or 1: VAS(<or=30/100, 1;
      >30/100, 0), number of unpleasant events (0, 1; >or=1, 0) and satisfaction (satisfied or very
      satisfied, 1; acceptable or unsatisfied, 0). Comfort score of 3 or 2 is considered as
      comfortable while score 1 or 0 as uncomfortable block placement.
