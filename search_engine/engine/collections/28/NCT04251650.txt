      there is a specific bacterial signature associated with the severity of damage on the one
      hand, and the other hand, the investigators will search for cytokinic biomarkers which can be
      correlated with the severity of the damage.

      In this study, the investigators propose to include 25 patients with periodontitis stage I
      and II versus stage III and IV according to Chicago classification (2018)
