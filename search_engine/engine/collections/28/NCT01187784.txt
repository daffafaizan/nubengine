      empirically-supported, individually-based cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety
      disorders in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Recent research suggests that 47 -
      84% of children with ASD experience clinically significant levels of anxiety due to inhibited
      temperament, physiological hyperarousal, and distinct information processing biases. Despite
      the clear need for effective treatments for children with ASD and anxiety, there have been
      few empirical studies. However, a small body of literature has demonstrated growing support
      for the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to treat anxiety in children with
      high-functioning ASD. Kendall and Hedtke's Coping Cat cognitive-behavioral therapy program
      for anxious children will be utilized as the primary intervention. To date, there are no
      studies that have used this treatment program for anxiety in children with developmental
      disorders, including ASD. However, Coping Cat has been successfully adapted for children with
      a variety of co-occurring diagnoses (e.g., physical impairments, selective mutism).
      Participants in this study will be 20 children aged 7;0 to 14;11 years diagnosed with
      high-functioning ASD and at least one anxiety disorder (separation anxiety disorder,
      generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia). A randomized controlled trial design will be
      employed. It is hypothesized that participants in the CBT condition will demonstrate a
      significantly larger reduction in overall levels of anxiety from pre-treatment to
      post-treatment compared to those in the waitlist (WL) condition and that children who
      complete the CBT treatment will maintain gains at two-month follow-up.
