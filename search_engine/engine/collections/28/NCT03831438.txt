    
      The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sequential escalating doses
      of AVID200 (study drug), in order delineate a potential effective range of tolerated doses to
      be further evaluated in Phase 2.

      Patients will be treated and followed on an outpatient basis throughout the trial, unless
      hospitalization is required for other reasons, or to assure patient safety. The choice of
      doses for further Phase 2 study will be based on clinical and laboratory data obtained during
      this trial, including safety, PK, and preliminary anti-fibrotic activity.

      Upon completion of Cycle 1, and provided re-treatment criteria are met, patients may receive
      up to 2 additional cycles of study drug unless a criterion for treatment discontinuation has
      been met.
