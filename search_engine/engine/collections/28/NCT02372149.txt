      chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), in patients with co-existent
      diabetes. In this pilot study the investigators plan to examine the overlap between diabetic
      polyneuropathy and CIDP by treating patients with diabetes and demyelinating abnormalities
      using IVIg. The investigators will enroll diabetes patients with a broad spectrum of
      demyelinating abnormalities.

      The proposed trial will be an explanatory, blinded, single-centre, superiority, randomized
      controlled cross-over trial. Each patient will receive 3 months of 10% intravenous
      immunoglobulin and 3 months of placebo (0.9% sodium chloride in water) with a 3-month washout
      period. The primary outcome measure is the mean change in ONLS (Overall Neuropathy Limitation
      Scale), a measure of disability in polyneuropathy; however secondary outcome measures will
      consider impairments and quality of life.
