      disease in colorectal surgery patients will be assessed in this quality assurance trial.
      During the pre-operative clinic visit, patients to undergo hemorrhoid surgery are educated on
      breathing exercises that can be used to reduce pain and increase relaxation. In this year
      long study patient self-reported utilization of the breathing exercises and their level of
      pain, sleep quality, gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, constipation, etc), emergency room
      visits, and hospitalizations in the month post hemorrhoid surgery will be evaluated. All
      patients will be asked to complete a brief survey at their pre-operative and one month
      post-operative visits.
