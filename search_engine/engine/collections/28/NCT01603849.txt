        1. To obtain a greater PFS and CNS PFS in patients with NSCLC treated with PCI after
           locoregional or systemic treatment.

        2. Evaluate the benefit in OS in the specific group of patients who are at increased risk
           of developing brain metastasis

        3. Evaluate quality of life and mental function before and after treatment with PCI and
           compare it with patients in the observation group.

      Methods: One hundred and twenty eight patients with locally advanced or metastatic (except
      CNS metastasis) NSCLC will be included and randomized to receive either observation or PCI 25
      Gy in 10 fractions Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) once the initial treatment has been
      completed and progression of the disease ruled out.
