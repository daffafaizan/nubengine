      and without simethicone, in terms of efficacy and patient tolerability in the preparation of
      patients undergoing routine colonoscopy. Adult ambulatory outpatients who are scheduled for
      elective routine colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening will be recruited to participate
      in the trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either simethicone or placebo in
      addition to oral sodium sulfate/potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate solution (Suprep) and
      will receive verbal and written instruction on administration of solutions. During
      colonoscopy, three areas of the colon (right colon, transverse colon, and left colon) will be
      assessed during removal of the colonoscope for overall colon cleansing, presence of bubbles,
      and degree of haziness; this will be scored by a blinded endoscopist. A separate written
      patient questionnaire will be used to assess acceptability and tolerability of the
      preparation, as well as any adverse events.
