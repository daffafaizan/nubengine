      a parallel-group design. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the 4 possible
      treatments: treatment A - 550 mg naproxen 2x daily + 300 mg rebamipide 2x daily + 20 mg
      rabeprazole 1x daily over 7 days; treatment B - 550 mg naproxen 2x daily + placebo of
      rebamipide 2x daily + 20 mg rabeprazole 1x daily over 7 days; treatment C - 550 mg naproxen
      2x daily + 300 mg rebamipide 2x daily + placebo of rabeprazole 1x daily over 7 days; and
      treatment D - 550 mg naproxen 2x daily + placebo of rebamipide 2x daily + placebo of
      rabeprazole 1x daily over 7 days.

      Upper digestive endoscopy was performed before the beginning of the therapies and 12 hours
      after the last administration (8th day of the study), with collection of the biological
      samples (biopsies) in the antrum region and 5 in the gastric body at each examination. The
      samples were preserved in formalin solution and sent for histopathological examination.

      The safety and tolerability was assessed by signs and symptoms, adverse events, laboratory
      tests, vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG).
