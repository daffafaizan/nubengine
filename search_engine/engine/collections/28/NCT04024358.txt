      within the epineural, perineural and endoneural spaces of the neuronal sheath.Clinically, PNI
      is associated with increased tumor recurrence, poor survival after pancreatectomy and pain,
      an invalidating symptom that may impair quality of life. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has
      one of the highest incidences of PNI (70-100%) among all types of cancer, which correlates
      with a poor prognosis and decreased survival. PNI is a still not uniformly characterized or
      quantified event, usually it is described only dichotomously ("present" or "absent"), despite
      some efforts to use a more detailed scoring system. However, these scores are not
      specifically developed for pancreatic surgical specimen. Vascular invasion (VI), which is
      assumed to be associated with a more aggressive tumor biology and dissemination, lacks a
      specific scoring system as well. The primary aim of this study is to validate both
      retrospectively and prospectively a novel PNI and VI scoring system aimed at a more detailed
      stratification of perineural invasion, together with an accompanying scoring system for
      vascular invasion, and correlated them with disease free survival (DFS).
