    
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to establish the safety of the Bayston
      Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter in ESRD patients initiating CAPD.

      The Bayston catheter is not expected to cause any safety related complications or reactions
      other than those described for not-impregnated peritoneal dialysis catheters. Thus the
      objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate whether the Bayston catheter causes
      any unanticipated serious adverse device effects (USADE).

      The primary hypothesis for this study is that the Bayston Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis
      Catheter is a safe catheter for peritoneal dialysis.

      No claims regarding efficacy will be verified during this clinical investigation.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center study involving patients
      suffering from end stage renal disease who are eligible for treatment with peritoneal
      dialysis. Forty-three (43) patients will be enrolled who will be followed up to 6 months
      after implantation of the Bayston Antimicrobial Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter.
