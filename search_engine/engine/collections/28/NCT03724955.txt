      results in frequent lung infections, chronic inflammation and progressive lung failure. With
      advancements in medical care, patients with CF are living longer. The median survival of
      women with CF born and diagnosed in 2010 is projected to be 37 years. Patients with CF are
      now living long enough to develop comorbidities like Cystic Fibrosis related Bone Disease
      (CFBD), hypogonadism manifesting as pubertal delay, premature ovarian insufficiency or
      hypothalamic hypogonadism. These comorbidities in women without CF can be improved by
      estrogen supplementation.

      It is well established that treating hypogonadal (low estrogen levels) women with estrogen
      can improve their bone health, slow the rate of bone loss and decrease bone turnover markers.
      Supplemental estrogen given to hypogonadal women can improve sexual and reproductive health
      including reduction of perimenopausal symptoms and improvement in sexual function which can
      improve quality of life. There is very little research investigating the effects of estrogen
      treatment for hypogonadal women with CF. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis
      that daily oral estrogen supplements given to hypogonadal women with CFBD will improve their
      bone health, sexual and reproductive health, and quality of life and modify markers of
      inflammation and lung function.
