      groups of patients are used: 1.Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; 2.Disorders of the rotator
      cuff without rupture; 3.Shoulder instability.

      The WORC, SF-36 and the Constant Score are obtained twice before therapy is started to
      measure reliability and validity. Responsiveness is tested by obtaining the same tests after
      therapy.
