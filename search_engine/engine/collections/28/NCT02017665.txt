        1. To describe the epidemiology of CNS infections in Singapore.

        2. To improve the diagnosis of aetiologies of CNS infections through a systematic clinical,
           laboratory and neuro-radiological evaluation and extensive diagnostic testing.

        3. To evaluate the prognosis, long-term outcomes and socio-economic costs of CNS
           infections.

        4. To establish an archive of biological tissues from patients with encephalitis and CNS
           infections that can be utilized for future testing for emerging novel pathogens or
           non-infectious aetiologies.

      The study will recruit 400 patients over 2 years from 5 restructured hospitals in Singapore.
      As this is not a comparative study, sample size was not determined.

      The study involves clinical and laboratory data collection. Data will also be collected on
      quality of life and for health economic analysis. The quality of data and its integrity will
      be periodically reviewed by the Principal Investigator and members of the study team. All
      samples stored will be de-identified and all data will be de-identified during analysis.
