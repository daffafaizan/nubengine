      Stargardt disease (ABCA4-related). Stargardt disease is a rare genetic disorder that leads to
      damage to the retina and results in legal blindness. Stargardt disease is caused by a
      defective ABCA4 gene, which affects the processing of vitamin A in the eye and leads to the
      formation of toxic vitamin A aggregates (called "vitamin A dimers") in the eye. Vitamin A
      dimers are thought to contribute to vision loss in Stargardt disease. ALK-001, the
      investigational drug, is a chemically-modified vitamin A designed as a replacement of vitamin
      A to prevent the formation of toxic vitamin A dimers in the eye. Trial participants will
      receive either ALK-001 or placebo, and follow-up visits will take place periodically for up
      to 24 months. There is currently no treatment for Stargardt disease.
