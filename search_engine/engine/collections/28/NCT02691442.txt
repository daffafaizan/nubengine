      solutions, used in an interscalene nerve block. This will be objectified by measuring the
      changes in small nerve functioning, using quantative sensory testing. Based on the results of
      a previous study, the investigators reduce the dose of the administered local anesthetic,
      expecting a similar length of action using these smaller doses.
