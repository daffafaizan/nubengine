      ectopic (non-pituitary) production of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) that causes cortisol
      excess. In approximately 50% of these patients, the tumoral source of ACTH cannot be found
      initially despite very detailed and extensive imaging, including studies such as computed
      tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and octreotide scan (Octreoscan) using the standard
      dose of indium-111 pentetreotide ([(111)In-DTPA-D-Phe]-pentetreotide). The sensitivity and
      specificity of structurally based imaging studies depends on anatomic alterations and the
      size of the tumor. In contrast, positron emission tomography (PET) and somatostatin ligand
      (like octreotide) imaging detect pathologic tissue based on physiologic and biochemical
      processes within the abnormal tissue. This protocol tests the ability of
      [18F]-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) PET, and the somatostatin imaging analogue,
      68Ga-DOTATATE-PET, to localize the source of ectopic ACTH production.
