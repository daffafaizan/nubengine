      well known and widely used around the world. The adjustable surgery is done in 2 steps. The
      first step, performed under general anesthesia, is practically the same as "classic"
      strabismus surgery however one or more muscles are fixed by temporary sutures. In a second
      time once the patient is awake and after a new clinical examination the sutures are adjusted
      and definitively fixed. The adjustment is sometimes made the same day but more often the day
      after the first intervention because it requires a state of consciousness close to normal.

      Anesthesia type Intravenous Intensity Concentration Anesthesia (AIVOC) allows the realization
      of a surgery under anesthesia general deep (choice of a cerebral or plasma anesthetic target
      suitable for surgery) but allows a programmed awakening, very fast in full consciousness,
      condition of an immediate reliable adjustment practically upon stopping the infusion of the
      anesthetic agent.

      The goal is to present an adjustable surgery technique simplified from a logistical point of
      view since performed in a single step thanks to the contribution of Intravenous Anesthesia
      with Concentration Objective (AIVOC) and to show that its results are equivalent to a second
      deferred time.
