      Standard Practice (defined as usual care administered to patients with similar conditions).
      Approximately 200 participants will be recruited from three sites in Sri Lanka: The National
      Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo; Teaching Hospital, Kegalle, and Teaching Hospital, Kandy.
      Subsequent to granting written informed consent, patients will undergo screening and baseline
      evaluation to confirm eligibility, followed by randomization to the Polypill or to the
      Standard Practice study arm. Patients receiving either intervention will return for a total
      of three monthly clinic visits.

      Physician acceptability will be evaluated through a five-question survey will be mailed to a
      random sample of physicians from the participating clinical sites and to the Council of
      General Practitioners in Sri Lanka.

      Patient acceptability will be measured in participants who will complete the study as well as
      those who will be screened but not eligible
