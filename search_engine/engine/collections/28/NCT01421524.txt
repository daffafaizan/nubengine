      defined as MM-2 to evaluate tolerability, safety and preliminary efficacy of CC-122
      formulated capsule alone or in combination with DEX on intermittent dosing schedule (5 of 7
      days of the week) in Pomalidomide-na√Øve subjects. Preliminary efficacy data in Multiple
      Myeloma subjects, warrants further exploration of CC-122 in MM on intermittent schedules to
      assess if dose intensity and tolerability can be improved. Initially, patients will be
      treated with oral CC-122 for one month. During this time, various tests (involving blood and
      urine collections, ECGs, etc) will be performed. Those whose tumors stabilize or regress may
      continue receiving treatment for as long as they benefit from CC-122. Different dose levels
      of CC-122 will be tested in a dose-rising study design.
