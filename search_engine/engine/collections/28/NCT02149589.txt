      to a control group (PEEP/FiO2 according to ARDSnetwork tables) or an intervention arm. In
      this arm, mechanical ventilation will be set according to lung morphology. In patients with
      focal ARDS, prone position will be start quickly for at least 16 hours. After, A low PEEP and
      8ml/kg of PBWwill be used. In non-focal ARDS, a recruitment maneuver followed by a high PEEP
      and a small tidal volume strategy will be used. In both arms, patients will be sedated and
      paralyzed during maximum 48 hours. As soon as PaO2/FiO2 > 200 mmHG, myorelaxant and sedation
      will be withdrawal. Pressure support ventilation will be used as soon as possible and weaning
      from ventilation will be checked everyday
