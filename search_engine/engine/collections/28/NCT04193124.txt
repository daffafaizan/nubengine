      bleeding) in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage is unknown.

      Objectives: To determine the prevalence and clinical relevance of prolonged vasospasm in
      patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to cerebral aneurysm.

      A prospective and observational study was conducted. Adult patients with a diagnosis of
      subarcnoid hemorrhage CT scan or presence of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid were
      incorporated. Patients with vasospasm were followed daily with transcranial doppler. Those
      with technical impossibility to perform transcranial and pregnant Doppler were excluded. Day
      0 was defined, the day of the last bleeding.

      Evaluation: 1) It was considered in patients with prolonged vasospasm: whether or not it was
      associated with clinical manifestation (deterioration of the sensory or new neurological
      deficit) and 2) the magnitude of the vasospasm (mild, moderate or severe) was measured by
      transcranial doppler.
