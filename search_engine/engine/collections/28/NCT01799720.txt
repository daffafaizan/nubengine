      criteria established by (NCEP, 2002), and performed by the research team. Women were randomly
      assigned to one of three parallel groups, in a near 1:1:1 ratio. Group 1 (n=20) took two
      capsules per day of less oxidized oil (containing 300 mg EPA-DHA per capsule) and diet. Group
      2 (n=18) consumed two capsules per day of oxidized oil (containing 300 mg EPA-DHA per
      capsule) and diet. Finally, group 3 (n=19) performed the diet but did not take any capsule.
      Therefore, the design was a single-blind (participants did not know what type of capsule they
      were receiving), parallel-group, randomized controlled trial conducted at the Miguel
      Hern√°ndez University of Elche (Spain).

      Statistical analysis was carried out using STATGRAPHICS Centurion XV software (StatPoint
      Technologies, Inc. Warrington, VA); likewise, significance was defined at p<0.05. Data are
      reported as mean standard error of the mean (SEM). Intragroup statistical comparisons were
      performed using the following hypothesis tests, both parametric and non-parametric: t-test,
      sign test and signed rank test for paired samples. Intergroup statistical comparisons were
      performed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Kruskal-Wallis hypothesis
      tests. Also, Fisher least significant difference (LSD)Multiple Range Test and Tukey HSD were
      used in order to determine which means were significantly different from the others.

      Methods for additional analyses Generalized multiple regression was used to statistically
      analyse the relationships between the variations in the lipid profile and the consumption of
      w-3 dietary supplements.
