      intervention affects the participants' degree of autonomous motivation and perceived
      competence for exercise, and as a consequence behavioral change in the form of increased and
      regular exercise. That is, the psycho-social processes which are unfolding during the
      intervention, and caused by the intervention.

      The intervention is implemented in a worksite setting and connected to a team-based health
      promotion program.

      This is a cluster-randomized two-group trial that compares a group-based intervention with a
      control group. Cluster-randomization will be carried out at the level of physical location
      consisting of two work teams each.

      Pre- and post-test assessments will be carried out during an individual health screening
      consisting of physiological tests and cross-sectional data collection in the form of
      quantitative and standardized questionnaires. The results are compiled in a health profile
      report. Participants are offered a 15-20 minutes individual consultation with the
      professional health advisor in order to explain the findings, answer quesdtions and giving
      healht recommendations.

      A small collection of the questionnaires and some qualitative interviews will be applied in
      order to collect data on relevant variables during the intervention period as well as to
      assess fidelity and participants' perceptions of the intervention.

      The intervention consists of three elements; two team-workshops, exercise support group
      meetings and a workbook for self-reflection and planning. The intervention will be carried
      out by two health advisors professionals (physiotherapist) trained in order to facilitate and
      lead the team-workshops in a need supportive manner.
