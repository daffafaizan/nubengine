      leading cause of long term disability. Almost half of the people living in the community
      following stroke have problems that challenge the activities that support their daily lives.
      This is in part due to the rehabilitation community's focus on short term stroke recovery and
      not on supporting survivors' need to actively manage their long-term disability and the
      environment around them so they can return to full participation in communities of their
      choice post-rehabilitation. The rehabilitation community is in need of evidence-based
      interventions for addressing post-stroke functional limitations. Metacognitive strategy
      training is a performance-based, problem-solving approach to task performance difficulties.
      Participants are taught to identify when to apply a cognitive strategy, how to apply it, and
      how to monitor and adapt usage of cognitive strategies within task performance. Metacognitive
      strategy training is recognized as a practice standard for addressing functional limitations
      post-stroke. Transcranial direct current stimulation is a method that has been used for over
      15 years to modulate the excitability of targeted brain regions. While it does not directly
      stimulate neurons, it results in changes to polarity of neuronal membranes and is thought to
      facilitate or inhibit neuroplasticity. Combination of these approaches may result in an
      interaction of effects and a greater effect on function in individuals post-stroke than
      either approach used alone.
