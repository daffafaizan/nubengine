    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase III study. The
      study population will consist of approximately 1300 subjects with metastatic hormone
      sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), who will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive 600 mg (2 x
      300 mg tablets) of darolutamide (ODM-201)/placebo twice daily with food, equivalent to a
      total daily dose of 1200 mg, in addition to standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and
      docetaxel. Subjects will be stratified at randomization for the extent of disease and for
      Alkaline Phosphatase levels. All subjects will be treated with ADT as standard therapy. Six
      cycles of docetaxel will be administered after randomization.

      The subjects considered for inclusion in the study will have metastatic prostate cancer and
      will be candidates for ADT and docetaxel.

      Treatment with darolutamide (ODM-201)/placebo will be administered until symptomatic
      progressive disease, change of antineoplastic therapy, unacceptable toxicity, until subject
      withdraws consent, withdrawal from the study at the discretion of the investigator or his/her
      designated associate(s), death, non-compliance, or if sponsor terminates the study.
