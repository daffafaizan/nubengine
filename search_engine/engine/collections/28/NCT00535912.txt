      therapeutic strategies in previously untreated B and C Binet stages B-CLL patients less than
      60 years old. Conventional chemotherapy (Arm A) consisted of six monthly courses of CHOP,
      i.e. vincristin IV 1 mg/m2 on day 1, doxorubicin IV 25 mg/m2 on day 1, cyclophosphamide (Cy)
      300 mg/m2 and prednisone 40 mg/m2 both given orally from day 1 to day 5, followed by 6 CHOP
      courses every other 3 months in case of response. Fludarabine (25 mg/m2 /d IV for 5
      consecutive days) was used in case of non response (stable disease or progression) after 3
      CHOP courses. This conventional therapy was compared to high dose therapy with autologous
      CD34+ purified progenitor cell support (Arm B), used as consolidation of Complete Remission
      (CR) or Very Good Partial Response (VGPR, defined by >50 % tumoral response and bone marrow
      lymphocyte infiltration <30%) obtained after 3 monthly courses of CHOP. In the absence of CR
      or VGPR, 3 to 6 monthly-courses of fludarabine were performed before mobilization with Cy 4
      g/m2 + G-CSF administration. The conditioning regimen included TBI 12 Gy and Cy 60 mg /kg /d
      for 2 days.
