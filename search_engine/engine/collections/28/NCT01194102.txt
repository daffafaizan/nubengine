    
      The program will be delivered through a partnership between Hamilton Health Sciences, the
      YMCA and McMaster University. Participants will attend the YMCA for exercise sessions several
      times a week and receive education on how to take care of themselves after a stroke. The
      staff who will deliver the program will have specialized training on how to help people with
      stroke to exercise safely and effectively. Control group participants will be provided with
      YMCA memberships but will not have access to stroke specific education and group exercise
      classes.

      Staff assisting the control group will be trained in safety and contraindications after
      stroke, but will not receive the additional specialized training in exercise/education
      programs for persons with stroke.
