      study the safety of the RejuvenAir System in a population of subjects who are scheduled to
      undergo a planned lobectomy. A secondary objective is to determine the histological effects
      of RejuvenAir System treatment in the airways. The Primary Endpoint is Safety as measured by
      occurrence of serious adverse events related to metered dose radial spray cryotherapy
      treatment performed prior to scheduled lobectomy surgery. The patient population intended to
      participate in this study are subjects scheduled to undergo lobectomy for peripheral lung
      lesions suspicious for or known to be cancer. Secondarily, this will enable an understanding
      of the histological characteristics and healing outcomes post-treatment in the airways, which
      will be resected. CSA Medical has conducted bench and animal studies that support the use of
      the RejuvenAir System as sufficiently safe and effective to warrant advancing the product
      into this primary safety study in patients presenting for consideration of lobectomy. Such
      patients provide a safe population to further the clinical evaluation of the system in that
      these subjects will receive their lobectomy or procedure 2 to 14 days following delivery of
      their metered liquid nitrogen treatment. At the time of their metered liquid nitrogen
      treatment they will be in an operating room setting with their thoracic surgeon in
      attendance. It is anticipated that subjects who agree to participate in this study will have
      the metered liquid nitrogen treatment at the time of evaluation of their lung lesion. This
      evaluation will include bronchoscopy with ultrasound for evaluation of their lymph nodes
      prior to the planned surgical resection of their lung abnormality.
