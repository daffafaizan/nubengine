      fatty acids, each given at two doses, on potential health benefits related to cardiovascular
      disease prevention. The two sources of dietary omega-3 fatty acids will be fish oil, and
      flaxseed oil. Each will be given at a lower dose that could realistically be achieved from
      food sources alone, and at a higher dose that could not realistically be achieved from food
      alone and would require supplementation. The outcomes being studied are markers of
      inflammation. The subjects being studied are those with elevated risk factors for diabetes
      and heart disease that meet the criteria for the "metabolic syndrome". These are the people
      who are currently not diabetic, and who have not been diagnosed yet with heart disease, who
      are at risk of developing these diseases and who would likely benefit the most from the
      omega-3 therapy should it prove to be effective.
