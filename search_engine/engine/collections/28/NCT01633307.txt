      medicine departments. During the first study visit, we collected data of patients with
      intravenous infusions from each participating centre in order to determine the number and
      frequency of inappropriate intravenous lines. Using a computerized randomization process (on
      a 1:1 basis), the participating centres were randomized; Half centres (interventional group)
      received an educational program consisting of educational material and two educational
      sessions; the other half did not receive the educational program (control group). The
      educational program provided medical doctors with posters and slides containing information
      on valid indications for the prescription and use of intravenous infusions (inability to
      drink or eat, malabsorption, medication only available intravenously with no oral
      equivalent). Based on a previous pilot study, we assumed that the the frequency of
      inappropriate intravenous lines with be approximately 20% at baseline and hypothesize that
      the nationwide teaching program will decrease this frequency by 50%.
