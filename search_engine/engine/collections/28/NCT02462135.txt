      will be randomized by the block randomization, into intervention group (Virtual interactive
      memory training, VIMT), or active control group (Passive information activities, PIA).
      Training sessions of the VIMT group are 45 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 12 weeks (36
      sessions each). The training of PIA group is the same as VIMT group. We constructed a
      rigorous VIMT program adhering to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
      reporting guidelines. The investigators expect to determine the improvement in memory
      function and degree of depression of older adults with mild cognitive impairment after using
      the VIMT.
