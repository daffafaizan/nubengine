    
      -  The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, controlled study is to evaluate the effect
           of pre-operative oral aceclofenac on the success of the inferior alveolar nerve block
           with 2% Mepivacaine containing 100,000 Epinephrine for patients with symptomatic
           irreversible pulpitis.

        -  Patients will be clinically and radiographically examined and their eligibility will be
           assessed and preoperative pain will be measured using Heft-Parker VAS. Eligible patients
           will be treated in one visit.

        -  Patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: experimental group (taking a 100
           mg of Aceclofenac) and the control group (taking a placebo tablet). Each tablet will be
           taken one hour before starting treatment. After 15 minutes of the initial inferior
           alveolar nerve block (IANB), the teeth will be examined using a cold pulp sensitivity
           test; in case of no or mild pain, the treatment will be initiated otherwise, additional
           IANB will be administered.

        -  During root canal treatment, no to mild pain response will be considered success. In
           case of failure, supplemental anesthesia will be administrated.
