      Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2),regulates both innate and adaptive immunity. FGL2 is a 439
      amino acid secreted protein that is similar to the β- and γ-chains of fibrinogen.

      Secreted FGL2 (sFGL2) is the key regulator in immunosuppression may play important role in
      malignant transformation of low to high by inhibiting the proliferation of T cell Study the
