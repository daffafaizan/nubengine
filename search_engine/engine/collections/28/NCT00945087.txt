      a serious clinical problem. Bacteriophages (phages) are bacterial viruses which attack,
      multiply within, and then destroy bacteria. They can efficiently destroy bacteria which have
      acquired resistance to antibiotics and which cause life-threatening infections. The method of
      treating bacterial infections using phages has been known since the beginning of the 20th
      century. This experimental treatment enables the use of phage preparations under the rules of
      a therapeutic experiment (on the basis of the respective Polish regulations) in cases where
      no effective available therapy exists or the use of the targeted drug is contraindicated. It
      is not a research study.

      The bacteriophage preparations which are used in the treatment procedures contain phages from
      the Bacteriophage Collection of the Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the
      Polish Academy of Sciences in Wroc≈Çaw. For each patient only specific formulations of single
      phage or a phage mixture that are active against the pathogenic bacterial strain or strains
      isolated from the patient are used for the treatment.The isolation of live bacterial pathogen
      from the patient is necessary to carry out a phage-typing procedure to determine if the
      preparation of an active formulation is possible which is a prerequisite for receiving the
      treatment.
