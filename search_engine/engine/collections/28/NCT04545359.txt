      mechanisms (plasticity phenomena underlying neurofeedback training or learning) are very
      poorly known. In most of the work on stress and anxiety reduction, the neural parameters on
      which neurofeedback is performed are low frequency waves like alpha waves. But the effects
      that an alpha-based neurofeedback has on these waves and more generally on the oscillatory
      behaviour of the networks involved after the neurofeedback sessions, are very little studied.

      Thus, the NEURORELAX study aims to clarify the effects on neurofeedback training at the
      (electro)physiological level (changes in brain responses in terms of frequency of
      oscillations, power and location of the cerebral sources of these activities) and/or
      behavioural level (relaxation and reduced susceptibility to anxiety). It will use the
      Melomind neurofeedback device as built by myBrain Technologies company, which will make it
      additionally possible to assess feasibility of neurofeedback training with this reduced
      mobile device comprising of 2 dry electrodes. For these purposes, the investigators will
      propose a series of auditory neurofeedback training sessions to the participants, accompanied
      by electrophysiological (EEG) and clinical measures. The level of relaxation of the subjects
      will be characterized by self-reported questionnaires and by electrophysiological signal
      measurement.
