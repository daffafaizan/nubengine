      care continuity and access to health care professionals. In order to increase the utilization
      of adjuvant therapies, patients in the intervention group are offered an additional nursing
      intervention in the period between discharge after inpatient treatment and the beginning of
      adjuvant therapy. This includes a telephone follow-up conducted according to guidelines
      serving to disclose patients' current supportive needs in order to determine potential
      intervention approaches as early as possible. Hence, the intervention aims to motivate
      patients not to discontinue the treatment. An early detection of therapy-related physical and
      psychological impairments aims at optimizing treatment management.

      Patients in the intervention group therefore are visited by nursing staff specialized in
      cancer care (Supportive Cancer Care Networkers, SCAN) during their in-patient stay and are
      informed about the intervention. An assignment for the SCAN is to support patients in getting
      access to health care services (e.g. specialists). Patients are given certain information, as
      for example contact to specialists, voluntary services and the next steps and appointments of
      the treatment plan are discussed. Within a consultation at the day before hospital discharge,
      the SCAN takes up the contact information and appoints weekly telephone consultations for the
      time up to the adjuvant therapy. The SCAN hands out information materials and explains the
      study documents, as for example patient-held records (PHR) in order to improve therapy
      compliance.
