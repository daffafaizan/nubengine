      and young adults who are tested for SARS-CoV-2. The investigators will collect data including
      demographics, clinical characteristics, clinical courses, outcomes from the medical record.

      Other information about finances, mental health, and nutrition will be ascertained by
      questionnaires. The subjects will be asked to allow the researchers to abstract information
      from their medical record, participate in an interview or telephone call (their choice) to
      answer questionnaires, and to provide a stool sample at three time points.

      The creation of an integrated database of COVID-19 pediatric and young adult patients will
      better inform the pediatric hematology, oncology, and stem cell transplant community about
      this disease specifically related to patients undergoing HOT therapy and provide valuable
      evidence to develop standardized and clinically appropriate approaches to their care.
