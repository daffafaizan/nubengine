      IPM is considering using a DOT (Directly Observed Therapy) based method for vaginal
      microbicide gel delivery in a future Phase III study. IPM has denoted this DOT based method
      as Daily Monitored Adherence (DMA). IPM014A is a Phase I/II study designed: (1) to assess and
      compare the safety of a once daily application of Dapivirine Gel 4759, 0.05% 2.5g and a
      matching vehicle placebo gel; (2) to assess the acceptability of a once daily application of
      Dapivirine gel 4759, 0.05% 2.5g and a matching vehicle placebo gel; and (3) to assess the
      feasibility of utilizing the DMA method for a large-scale phase III efficacy study.
