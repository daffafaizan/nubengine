      Aqueous humor samples (0.1ml) were obtained during intravitreous injection of ranibizumab to
      measure the levels of cytokines. Targeted cytokines are follows; IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8,
      IL-9, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IP-10, MCP-1, MMP-1, MIP-1β, PDGF, VEGF, PlGF, ICAM-1, TNF-α,
      RANTES, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, which has been reported that the expression level is increased in
      macular edema associated with RVO. Cytokines are measured by multiple ELISA (Luminex).
      Aqueous humor samples are obtained in the same manner from patients recurred after the first
      injection or continuous monthly injections. Statistical analysis is conducted to examine the
      difference of cytokine levels between early or late/incomplete responders of ranibizumab, and
      predict the number of injections to stabilize cytokine levels.

      Number of centers & patients: Single center, 100 patients

      Sample size justification: Sample size calculation was not done, since this study is a
      single-arm, observational study.

      Population: Inclusion criteria: patients with RVO and macular edema
