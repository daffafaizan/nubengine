      Some experts suggest part of the problem is that the healthcare system fosters a separate
      silos decision making model. While there is increasing recognition that quality diabetes care
      is best provided in an interdisciplinary manner, interprofessional training models are
      limited, as is understanding of the links between interprofessional training, actual
      practice, and patient outcomes. Advancing our understanding of interprofessional training
      models is critical because most of the complications associated with diabetes (e.g.,
      amputations, renal failure, strokes) can be prevented or delayed with proper management. The
      investigators' objective is to better understand the processes and mechanisms by which
      interprofessional training impacts on chronic care management (practice patterns) and the
      ways it translates into improved patient outcomes.
