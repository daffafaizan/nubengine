      Center (Beilinson Campus), Petach Tikva, Israel, a tertiary university hospital. The
      Institutional Review Board has approved this study.

      Two hundred women undergoing cesarean sections will be enrolled after filling out an informed
      consent form.

      Cerebral blood flow perfusion will be monitored preoperatively, intraoperativly and half an
      hour postoperativly, for all enrolled participants using INVOS Cerebral Oximetry.

      Preoperative data will be compared to intraoperative data and analyzed in order to evaluate
      the dynamic cerebral oxygen and blood perfusion changes in women undergoing cesarean
      sections.
