      Of the 25 million patients who undergo noncardiac surgery in the United States each year,
      approximately three million have or are at risk of having coronary artery disease. Despite
      advances in the diagnosis and therapy of coronary artery disease, approximately 50,000 of
      these patients have a perioperative myocardial infarction, and more than half of the 40,000
      deaths after surgery are caused by cardiac events. For perioperative myocardial infarction
      alone, health care costs exceeded $500 million per year in the 1980s. Determining the risk
      factors for adverse postoperative cardiac outcomes allowed the development of preventive
      strategies and the efficient allocation of health care resources.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Historical, clinical, laboratory, and physiologic data on the subjects were collected during
      hospitalization for major elective noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia and for six to
      24 months after surgery. Myocardial ischemia was assessed by continuous electrocardiographic
      monitoring, beginning two days before surgery and continuing for two days after. The study
      published many findings under the title Study of Perioperative Ischemia.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
