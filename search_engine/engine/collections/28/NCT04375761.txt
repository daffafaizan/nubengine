      and their families (household contacts).The intent is to recruit families that have
      experience with the collection of respiratory samples.

      The objective of this surveillance study is to identify the rate of infection in children and
      what, if any effect, atopy has on the SARS-CoV-2 carrier status.

      The initial surveillance interval for participants will be 6 months and, depending upon the
      findings, may be extended. During surveillance, biological samples will be collected by the
      family at established intervals and symptom and exposure surveys will be completed remotely
      via a smart phone, on-line, or phone communications at the time the biological samples are
      collected.
