    
      Objective To assess whether in the colonoscopy, the initial position of the patient in the
      right lateral decubitus (DLD) translates into advantages such as: shorter examination time or
      greater range of detection of polyps, compared to the left lateral decubitus (DLI), a
      position traditionally used.

      Methodology This is a randomized and controlled clinical trial to be carried out in the city
      of Bogot√°, in the Gastroenterology and Digestive Endoscopy Unit of the Colombia University
      Clinic, a fourth-level private clinic, a unit in which 7746 colonoscopies were performed in
      2017.

      The study will be carried out over a period of 2 months until the sample is completed.

      Patients will be randomized to start their colonoscopy in the right lateral decubitus or left
      lateral decubitus and it would be assessed, the time to reach transverse colon, cecum and
      comfort perceived by the gastroenterologist and the patient.
