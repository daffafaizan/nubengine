      D serum levels. New insights into the role of vitamin D and distribution of its receptors in
      the human body have been revealed. Presumably, this entails implications concerning disease
      and treatment that go far beyond the well-known field of bone-metabolism.

      Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      and reductions in vitamin D serum levels have formerly been perceived as a consequence rather
      than a cause of COPD.

      Yet, there is a lack of consensus concerning the role of vitamin D on the decreasing lung
      function in COPD.

      Some trials have revealed a high degree of co-variation between the grade of airway
      obstruction, intake of vitamin D and reduction of serum-vitamin D. Other claim that vitamin D
      appears to be capable of inhibiting pulmonary inflammatory responses.

      Vitamin D interacts with calcium and magnesium and this subtle balance might be highly
      relevant in the progression of inflammatory diseases like COPD. Presumably, Mg inhibits
      contraction and relaxes smooth muscles in airways due to blocking of calcium-ion-flux across
      the cell membrane.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the status of vitamin D, magnesium and calcium in
      COPD, and to study the relationship and impact of vitamin D, magnesium and calcium in
      COPD-patients.

      The hypothesis of this study is that COPD-patients with vitamin D-, magnesium- and calcium
      supplement have a better lung function and quality of life, than those who have vitamin D-,
      magnesium- and calcium deficiency.
