      brain and a variety of complex social behaviors including affiliation, sexual behavior,
      social recognition, and aggression. Oxytocin is best known for its role to facilitate the
      birth process through induction of uterine smooth muscle contractions. Oxytocin is primarily
      used to induce labor, and contract the uterus after delivery. Oxytocin is considered the
      first line uterotonic to prevent and treat uterine atony and manage postpartum hemorrhage.
      Currently, there is no instrument that is capable of point-of-care oxytocin detection. A
      practical research tool to monitor peripheral levels of both endogenous and exogenous
      oxytocin is therefore needed to better understanding the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of oxytocin in the mother, fetus and newborn. A better understanding of drug
      concentration and effect may lead to optimal dosing and better management of induction of
      labor and/or uterine atony after delivery.

      With increased research on the importance of oxytocin monitoring, a bedside oxytocin monitor
      is envisioned that would allow healthcare professionals to improve our
      pharmacokinetic/dynamic understanding of oxytocin and to monitor and adjust the dose of
      oxytocin administered during childbirth. Currently, there is no instrument that is capable of
      point-of-care oxytocin detection.
