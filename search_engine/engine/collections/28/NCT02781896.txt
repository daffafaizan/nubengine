      transient cardiac standstill while predilatation is performed and the valve is being
      positioned and deployed. This requires an additional venous vascular access and a pacing
      catheter which are both likely to generate complications.

      This study compares the standard right ventricular rapid pacing to a new and simplified
      technique : a left ventricular rapid pacing is provided via the back-up 0.035 " guidewire.
      The cathode of an external pacemaker is placed on the tip of the 0.035" wire and the anode on
      a needle inserted into the groin. Insulation is ensured by the balloon or TAVI catheter.
