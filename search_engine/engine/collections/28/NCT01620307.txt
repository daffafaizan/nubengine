      Hospital were screened by rapid antigen test and influenza subtype was confirmed by
      polymerization chain reaction (PCR). 38 H1N1 patients with severe hypoxemia
      [alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, (A-a) O2 gradient, > 200 mmHg] requiring ventilator
      support were randomized to receive Rapamune (2mg/day) or not. Patients were then randomized
      to receive either Sirolimus (Rapamune 2mg/day, Pfizer) or not for a course of 14 days. The
      outcome variables include liberation of ventilator, ICU mortality, necessity of ECMO,
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and complications after admission to ICU
      were recorded. SOFA score composed of scores from six organ systems, graded from 0 to 4
      according to the degree of dysfunction/failure.
