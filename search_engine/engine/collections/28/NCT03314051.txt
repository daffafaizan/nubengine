      clinical trials focused on the treatment of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th
      edition stage IVA/IVB treatment for high risk of recurrence or metastasis. No previous study
      reported the treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients. The investigators tried to
      investigate the long-term treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients and do risk grouping by
      plasma EBV DNA assay for future therapy improvement.
