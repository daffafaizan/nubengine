      intubation success rate when compared to direct laryngoscopy.

      Methods: We enroll 20 patients age under 1 year old undergoing neurosurgery in this
      prospective randomized study. We compared the Airtraq, Glidescope, and c-mac video
      laryngoscopes during intubation of <1 year old children undergoing neurosurgery regarding
      intubation times and intubation success rates.
