    
      This is a single-site, prospective, open label trial evaluating home telemonitoring for
      patients with COPD and a history of increased exacerbation risk. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether automated home monitoring of medication compliance and biometric
      parameters [forced expiratory capacity in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC),
      peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR), inspiratory capacity (IC), pulse oximetry, and symptoms]
      is acceptable to patients, can improve adherence, and may improve clinical outcomes and
      reduce exacerbations and avoidable 30-day readmissions. Slow spirometry will be performed
      Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Forced spirometry will be performed
      Tuesdays and Thursdays.
