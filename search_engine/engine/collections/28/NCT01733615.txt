      study are oligosaccharides that secreted in the urine from patients with MPSIVa. In this
      study, we will try to define the variability of these oligosaccharides in the same patient at
      different time points, including different month of a year and different collections during
      the day as well as variations of these oligosaccharide in different affected patients.
