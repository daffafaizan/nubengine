      choice in patients with primary or secondary peritoneal surface malignancies. However the
      survival benefit is achieved at the cost of increased morbidity and mortality due to an
      extensive surgery and intraoperative chemo-therapy. Among complications infectious
      complications are the most common. The early diagnosis of a potential fatal infection is
      therefore crucial to ensure a good outcome in patients.
