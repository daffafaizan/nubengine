      immaturity and high nutritional needs. Therefore, successful preterm infant breastfeeding
      requires increased counseling and equipment support compared to full-term infant
      breastfeeding. Inpatient preterm infant care has responded to these barriers, with
      specialized preterm infant lactation support. Unfortunately, for preterm infants, the onset
      of feeding maturity often coincides with hospital discharge and, therefore, inpatient,
      specialized lactation support ends just as the infant initiates nutritive feeding at the
      breast. Therefore, the success of preterm infant breastfeeding relies on the home environment
      and the community pediatric caregivers. A program has been created to provide this
      specialized preterm infant/mother outpatient lactation support. The program includes in-home
      availability of a hospital-grade electric pump and an infant weigh scale and pediatric
      clinic-based lactation counseling support. Fourteen pediatric practices are included in this
      study. Seven practices were randomized to intervention and seven were randomized to be
      controls.
