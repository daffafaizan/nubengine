      Patients with this fracture are at high risk of further fracture, it can be reduced by
      appropriate metabolic therapy. However, only 30% of patients after a hip fracture receive
      basic treatment appropriate calcium and vitamin D, only 10-15% receive complementary
      metabolic therapy more drugs prevent bone resorption, or bone-building drugs as recommended
      in the literature, the prevention of further fractures. studies conducted in the past have
      proven, multi-disciplinary team of dedicated financial institution may increase appropriate
      treatment and improve the quality of care in these patients.

      Previous data in our institution has shown that 84% of patients with hip fractures received
      calcium and vitamin D during hospitalization, but only 47% of the patients came to the
      metabolic clinic. Moreover, of the patients who came to the metabolic clinic, only 46% were
      put on complementary metabolic therapy, mostly due to a lack of sufficient vitamin D level.
      In the present study investigators attempt to treat patients without physical attendance at
      the metabolic clinic.
