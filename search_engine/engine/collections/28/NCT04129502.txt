    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. TAK-788 is being tested to evaluate
      the efficacy as a first line treatment compare with platinum-based chemotherapy in the
      participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose
      tumors harbor EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.

      The study will enroll approximately 318 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two treatment groups-

        -  TAK-788 group (Arm A)

        -  Platinum-based chemotherapy group (Arm B)

      The participants will be administered with TAK-788 orally in arm A and Pemetrexed/Cisplatin
      or Pemetrexed/Carboplatin intravenously (IV) in arm B until the participants experience
      progressive disease (PD) as assessed by blinded independent review committee (IRC),
      intolerable toxicity or another discontinuation criteria. Participants in the chemotherapy
      group may cross over to treatment with TAK-788 after IRC-assessed PD is documented.
      Randomized treatment with TAK-788 or platinum-based chemotherapy may be continued after PD,
      at the discretion of the investigator and with the sponsor's approval, if there is still
      evidence of clinical benefit.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States, Europe, and Asia. The overall
      time to participate in this study is until 3 years after the last participant is randomized.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and will be followed for survival,
      subsequent anticancer therapy, subsequent disease assessment outcome until disease
      progression on a subsequent anticancer therapy, and participant-reported health status
      (EQ-5D-5L) for 3 years after the last participant is randomized in the study and 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug for safety follow-up.
