      been extensively reported. While there has been much speculation about possible biologically
      based etiologies for postpartum disorders (PPD), none has ever been confirmed. Preliminary
      results from two related studies (protocols 90-M-0088, 92-M-0174) provide evidence that women
      with menstrual cycle related mood disorder, but not controls, experience mood disturbances
      during exogenous replacement of physiologic levels of gonadal steroids. The present protocol
      is designed to create a scaled-down hormonal milieu of pregnancy and the puerperium in order
      to determine whether women who have had a previous episode of postpartum major affective
      episode will experience differential mood and behavioral effects compared with controls and
      to determine whether it is the abrupt withdrawal of gonadal steroids or the prolonged
      exposure to gonadal steroids that is associated with mood symptoms. Supraphysiologic plasma
      levels of gonadal steroids will be established, maintained, and then rapidly reduced,
      simulating the hormonal events that occur during pregnancy and parturition. This will be
      accomplished by administering estradiol and progesterone to women who are pretreated with a
      gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (Lupron). After eight weeks, administration of
      gonadal steroids will be stopped in one group of patients and controls, and a sudden decline
      in the plasma hormone levels will be precipitated. Another group will be maintained on
      supraphysiologic levels of estradiol and progesterone for an additional month. Outcome
      measures will include mood, behavioral, and hormonal parameters.
