    
      This is a single-group, unblinded pilot study of the TTIP-PRO, which will be completed with
      approximately 30 participants. Potential participants will be identified by querying the
      University of Cincinnati Medical Center (UCMC) Emergency Department (ED) Electronic Health
      Record (EHR) for patients treated for an OOD (e.g., opioid poisoning). Patients who have
      experienced an OOD in the past 8 months will be eligible to receive the TTIP-PRO. A letter
      about the study will be sent to those patients. Interested patients will call the UC Health
      staff working on this study. A UC Health staff member will inform potential participants
      about the study, confirm eligibility, collect enrollment measures, and schedule a time for
      the TTIP-PRO to be completed with the Peer Interventionist. The participant will be
      instructed to contact the Peer Interventionist at the scheduled time. After the
      peer-delivered TTIP-PRO intervention has been completed, a UC Health employee will contact
      the participant to administer the follow-up measures. The UC Health employee will then send a
      mailing to the participant that will include a copy of the participant's "Personal Risks for
      Overdose" report, general information about overdose prevention, and information about
      treatment for opioid use disorder (see section 2.6 for additional information). The mailing
      will also include a gift card (which is a standard part of the TTIP-PRO) and an additional
      gift card to compensate the participant for his/her time as a study participant.
