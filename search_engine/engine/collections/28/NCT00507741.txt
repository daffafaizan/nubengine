    
      This is a Phase II clinical trial of vintafolide administered to participants with advanced
      ovarian and endometrial cancers.

      Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate
      vitamin receptor (FR). Experimental evidence shows that this target receptor is expressed on
      virtually all ovarian cancers as well as the majority of endometrial cancers. Early clinical
      evidence in a small number of Phase I patients suggests that vintafolide may have antitumor
      effect in women with advanced ovarian cancer and that it is generally well-tolerated. This
      evidence suggests that vintafolide may be useful as chemotherapy against advanced ovarian and
      endometrial cancers. The primary objective of Part A of this study is to collect data on
      clinical benefit produced by therapy with vintafolide. The primary objective of Part B of
      this study is to collect data on the safety and efficacy of vintafolide.

      All participants will undergo imaging with the FR targeting investigational imaging agent
      ertafolide (EC20, FolateScan) during the screening period to confirm eligibility for the
      treatment portion of the clinical trial. Clinical evidence suggests that ertafolide may be
      used to identify women with cancers that express the target receptor.

      Information about the safety and tolerability of both vintafolide and ertafolide will be
      assessed.
