      levels. Evolocumab is an anti-PSCK9 monoclonal antibody, and functions by binding PSCK9 (an
      inhibitor of LDL removal) and blocking its function. Evidence suggests that since evolocumab
      increases the removal rate of low-density lipoproteins from the body, it might also help
      increase the removal of bacterial components that are attached to circulating lipids during
      sepsis. Quickly removing these bacterial components could prevent a strong and rapid immune
      response that often leads to organ failure and death in sepsis patients.
