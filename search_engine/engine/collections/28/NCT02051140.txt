      placebo on measures of cognition and mobility in older adults. Participants will visit the
      HNRCA on 4 occasions. During the first visit, participants will complete a dietary assessment
      and familiarize themselves with some of the cognitive tests used in the study. After a period
      of up to 45 days participants will return for the second visit. Participants will be
      randomized to consume either freeze dried strawberry powder or a placebo powder that tastes
      like strawberry. At visits 2, 3 and 4, participants will undergo tests of cognition, memory,
      gait and balance. In addition, blood samples and 24-hour urine will be collected at these
      visits. Tests include balance and gait assessment using a treadmill instrumented with
      pressure sensors which will measure postural sway and a variety of spatial/temporal gait
      parameters. Participants will also be affixed with surface electrodes to measure the
      activation of muscles in their legs during these balance and gait measurements. Participants
      will complete a battery of cognitive tests on paper and by computer. In the time between
      participants' visit 2 and visit 4, participants will receive a weekly telephone call to check
      in with them and remind them to continue taking the study powder. At the very end of the
      study, when all participants are finished, participants will receive a telephone call to
      debrief them and notify them which group they were randomized into. An optional tissue
      banking protocol will be offered for collection of additional blood to be banked at visits
      2-4.
