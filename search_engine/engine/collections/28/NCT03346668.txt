      permanent hair loss. Most of the scarring alopecias involve a painful course, with
      individuals reporting scalp pain, burning, itching, or tingling/crawling sensations that can
      ultimately impact physical and psychological health. There has been no study of topical
      neurogenic agents, such as gabapentin, to treat scarring alopecia. However topical gabapentin
      has been safely used in other conditions associated with chronic pain, burning, irritation,
      itch, or tingling, such as vulvodynia. This study will serve as a pilot study to determine
      the efficacy and safety of topical gabapentin in the treatment of symptomatic scarring
      alopecia. In this study, 10 subjects with symptomatic lymphocytic-type scarring alopecia will
      be recruited and treated with topical gabapentin. Disease burden will be evaluated before and
      after 12 weeks of treatment through reporting of subjective symptomatology via
      surveys/questionnaire, neurometer study, clinical assessment, and biopsies measuring levels
      of CGRP before and after treatment.
