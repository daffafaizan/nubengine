      bioequivalence study to compare the rate and extent of absorption of a test
      amoxicillin-clavulanic acid versus Augmentin ES-600, a reference amoxicillin- clavulanic
      acid, under fed conditions. Prior to the study commencement, subjects were randomly assigned
      to a treatment in accordance with the randomization scheme generated by Anapharm. Subjects
      were confined to the Anapharm Clinical research Facility from at least 11 hours prior to drug
      administration until after the 12.0 hour post-dose blood draw, in each period. The treatment
      phases were separated by a washout period of 14 days.

      A total of sixty-two (62) healthy adult subjects signed the study specific informed consent
      form and were confined for period I; of these subjects forty eight (48), (21 males and 27
      females) were enrolled and dosed in the study; forty six (46) of these enrolled subjects
      completed the clinical phase of the study
