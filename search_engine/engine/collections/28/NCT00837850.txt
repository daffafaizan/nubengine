      long-term survival of the prostheses. Bone cement in total joint replacement acts as an
      anchoring medium for the prosthesis and provides a barrier to the ingress of wear debris into
      bone surfaces. However, there are significant differences in cement behaviour among differing
      types of cement. A clinical study based on the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register demonstrated
      that there is an increased rate of revision due to aseptic loosening of femoral components
      implanted with low-viscosity cement compared with that of high-viscosity.

      Studies have shown that high early migration for certain designs of femoral prosthesis can be
      a predictor for clinical loosening. RSA is a technique enabling calculation of the
      three-dimensional translational and rotational movements of the implant relative to the bone,
      and therefore provides an ideal technique to detect early micromotion of implants.
