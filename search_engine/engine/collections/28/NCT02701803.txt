    
      In this study the aim is to evaluate the outcome of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and
      continuous intraduodenal levodopa therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson' disease by
      using Parkinson's KinetiGraphâ„¢ logger (PKG) device which is a movement and acceleration
      measuring device.

      A measurement is done before and after the implantation of selected therapy. PKG will measure
      automatically in every two minutes the movement of selected limb (usually the more affected
      upper extremity) for six days. At the same time a patient will keep a written diary of
      his/her Parkinsonian symptoms. Diary and collected PKG data will be compared. PKG will also
      remind with vibration the patient of the time drug administration and the patient can confirm
      this with pressing a button on PKG. The collected data will be transmitted to a computer and
      analyzed mathematically to produce a visual graph of daily movements. The aim is to evaluate
      PKG's usability in measuring Parkinsonian symptoms and in evaluation the outcome of DBS and
      levodopa therapy. Main parameters in evaluation are bradykinesia score and dyskinesia score.
