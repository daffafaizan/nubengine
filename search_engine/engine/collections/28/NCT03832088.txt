      osteoporosis outpatient clinic. Following written informed consent, patients were evaluated
      for sarcopenia according to the sarcopenia algorithm proposed by the European Working Group
      on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). Algorithm parameters were walking speed, muscle
      strength and muscle mass measurements. We used Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) for evaluation of
      walking speed, Jamar Hand Dynamometer for muscle strength assessment, and calf circumference
      for muscle mass measurement. Balances of the patients were evaluated with Berg Balance Scale
      (BBS) and functional skills were evaluated with the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Other
      clinical parameters (age, body mass index (BMI), 25OHvitD level, menopause age, fall within
      the last year, fracture history, history of fracture in mother) were questioned. SPSS 22.0
      program will be used for statistical evaluation and correlation analysis will be done.
