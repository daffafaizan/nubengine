      achieved via a combination of parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral feeding that is advanced
      over few days to reach full enteral feed. Recent studies suggest that rapid increase of
      enteral feed volumes results in shorter duration on PN and earlier achievement of full
      enteral feed without increasing the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or death.
      Although PN has an important role in nutrition of preterm infants, it is associated with
      increased risk of metabolic and infectious complications even when it is used for a short
      period of time. Furthermore, PN mandates the need for peripheral or central intravenous
      access. Provision of full enteral feed volume that meets reference daily fluid intake from
      day of birth is used frequently and successfully in stable preterm infants born after 33
      weeks. Expanding the use of this regimen to stable preterm infants born at 30-33 weeks
      gestation may help avoid unnecessary start of intravenous access, prevent complications
      related to PN, and encourage mother-infant bonding experience.
