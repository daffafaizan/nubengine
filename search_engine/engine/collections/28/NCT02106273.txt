      However, LMA is rarely used in thoracic surgery. To enable one-lung ventilation, the LMA need
      to be used with bronchial blocker. The use of this combination has been reported as a rescue
      technique in special clinical scenarios, i.e. patient with difficult airway. When used in
      patient with difficult airway, the LMA will be inserted until proper ventilation achieved,
      then endobronchial blocker will be subsequently placed through the LMA into the selected main
      bronchus. The success rate of the the bronchial blocker placement via properly placed LMA has
      never been studied. This pilot study was designed to evaluate the success rate, the quality
      of lung collapsed, the dislodgement or other associated problems including some minor
      complications i.e. postoperative dysphagia, sore throat hoarseness of voice.
