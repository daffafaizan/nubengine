      apnea (OSA) in their lifetime. OSA is a serious condition where a person stops breathing
      periodically during sleep; it is associated with high blood pressure, behavioural issues, and
      lower quality of life. Early diagnosis and treatment is critical, but the best way to
      diagnose OSA, a 'sleep study', is in short supply. Given the limited resources, this study
      aims to see if mobile video clips (smartphone recordings) can be used to screen children with
      Down syndrome to identify those at highest risk of OSA, so they can be prioritized for an
      earlier sleep study.

      Parents of children with Down syndrome, recruited from clinic, will be asked to record short
      video clips of their child sleeping. Parents will independently rate whether they think their
      child has OSA and how severe it is, based on the videos, as will two clinicians. Parents will
      also watch an educational webinar and be asked to re-rate the presence and severity of OSA in
      their child, to see if the webinar improves their accuracy. Finally, children will undergo a
      sleep study to compare to the ratings. This study will help determine whether videos can be
      used to accurately screen for OSA in this high risk population, prioritizing children for
      earlier diagnosis and treatment.
