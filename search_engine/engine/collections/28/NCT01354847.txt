      postoperative measuring point, blood is drawn for multiple electrode aggregometry to
      investigate ex-vivo platelet aggregation as a surrogate for platelet function.

      Transfusion rate of allogenic blood products as well as postoperative blood loss is planned
      to be recorded.
