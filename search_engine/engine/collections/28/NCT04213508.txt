      of nasal irrigation has many physiological aspects such as removing of excess mucus which is
      a potential medium for bacterial growth and infection, cleaning of antigens and biofilm to
      decrease inflammatory process, increase mucocilliary function and removing curst and debris
      from post-surgery to enhance wound healing and mucosalization Hypertonic saline is defined as
      a solution with more than 0.9% weight per volume of sodium chloride while isotonic saline is
      defined as a solution that equals to 0.9% weight per volume of sodium chloride. There are
      controversial studies in the literature on which saline is superior on the other, some prefer
      hypertonic saline over isotonic saline because it can move water outside the cells, decrease
      edema of mucosa, increase hydration of sol layer and decrease muco-adhesiveness and improve
      mucociliary clearance while others found both solution had same efficacy, improved nasal
      stuffiness and nasal obstruction but patients prefer isotonic saline because it is well
      tolerated and less burning sensation. Frequency of nasal irrigation per day is poorly studied
      in the literature with no known recommended times per day. Our aim is to find which type of
      saline and number of irrigation per day are better and statistically significant .
