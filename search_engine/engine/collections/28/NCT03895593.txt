      rescue fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from the Chinese fmtBank, from September 2015
      to February 2019. Data of demographic characteristics, symptoms of intestinal infections,
      previous medicine treatment and clinical outcomes will be collected retrospectively
      abstracted from the electronic medical records. All the patients will be followed up for at
      least 12 weeks post-FMT. Information on follow-up will be designed to assess the short-term
      and long-term adverse events.
