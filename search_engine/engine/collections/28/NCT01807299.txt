      disabilities through whole life. The treatment of this disease is expensive and difficult.
      Moreover, physical exercise and omegas consumption may improve the cognitive functions and
      behavior, so it could be an interesting strategy to improve this disorder. The aim of the
      present study is to verify the effects of multiple components physical training and the
      consumption of omega 3 on behavior, cognitive functions and the serum levels of BDNF and
      IGF-1 in ADHD children. Thus, 68 ADHD children, between seven and fourteen years old will be
      selected. The volunteers will be randomly divided into four groups: Physical Training Group
      (PTG), Omega Group (OG), Omega and Physical Training Group (OPTG) and Control Group (CG). The
      protocol of the experiment will last three months in which the OPTG will make physical
      training and receive fish oil capsules, and the PTG will make only the physical training and
      receive a placebo of fish oil. The others groups will be oriented not to make any type of
      physical training, but the OG will receive fish oil capsule, and the CG will receive a
      placebo of fish oil. Behavioral and cognitive functions evaluations and blood analysis will
      be made at the beginning and at the end of the protocol.
