      100 ml salin will bi given by initial of the anesthesia of the patient, the other group will
      be taken only 100ml saline solution. Randomising will be double blind and only
      anesthesiologist will see if the paient is in working group or control group. Than
      researchers provide laparoscopic myomectomy with same prothocol to each patient. At the end
      of the operation, researchers will record all the parameters during operation like; operation
      starting and ending time, the amount of bleeding, time of suturing, the size, location and
      count of myoma uteri, complications, weight of myoma uteri and the change of haemoglobine
      levels before and after operation.
