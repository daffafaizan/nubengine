    
      Approximately 10-30% of A-T patients will develop a malignancy during their lifetime. The
      vast majority of these cancers are of lymphoid origin. There is no consensus regarding the
      optimal strategy for treating children with A-T who develop hematopoietic malignancies.
      Historically, many of these children have been treated with therapy that is much less
      intensive than the conventional approach for non-A-T patients with similar malignancies
      during the corresponding treatment era. Although these less intensive approaches may have
      stemmed from perceptions that these children would not tolerate intensive therapy, there is
      in fact no data to suggest that these children cannot tolerate intensive therapy. However, it
      is clear that children with A-T require a modification in certain components of intensive
      therapy.

      To provide children with A-T and either ALL or malignant lymphoma the best chance for a cure,
      we propose to use modern therapeutic strategies with minimal modifications which address the
      unique toxicity profile encountered in treating children with A-T.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To clinically and biologically characterize the malignancies occurring in children with
           A-T (usually malignant lymphoma or ALL). This will include in vitro drug sensitivity
           screening.

        -  To study chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in children with A-T.
