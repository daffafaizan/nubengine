      wks. GA, are studied echocardiographically on day of life 3-4. Pending parental informed
      consent, those diagnosed with a PDA of borderline significance will be randomized to receive
      either paracetamol or placebo for three days, followed by a repeat echocardiogram. If the PDA
      remains of borderline significance, the treatment will be continued for an additional 4 days
      (1 week total). Paracetamol levels and liver functions will be assessed after the third day.
      Babies will be followed until discharge for subsequent PDA pathology; respiratory distress
      and chronic lung disease [CLD]; necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC]; retinopathy of prematurity
      [ROP].

      The investigators' primary goal is to demonstrate a decrease in the composite outcome of
      death or severe morbidity chronic lung disease [CLD], as shown by decreased time on
      supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation.

      Secondary goals:

        -  To demonstrate a decrease in subsequently diagnosed hs PDA, including

             -  Decrease in the need for subsequent therapy for PDA closure

             -  Decrease in surgical PDA ligations

        -  To demonstrate a decrease in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and/or ROP with treatment.

        -  To demonstrate no adverse effect on blood flow in anterior cerebral, superior mesenteric
           and renal arteries.
