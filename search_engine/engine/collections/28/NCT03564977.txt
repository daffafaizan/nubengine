      stem cell transplantation. CD19-targeted CAR-T cells showed excellent therapeutic efficiency
      in B-cell malignancies. Investigators attempt to treat minimal residual disease
      (MRD)-positive B-cell Malignancies after autologous stem cell transplantation by
      CD19-targeted CAR-T cells and hope to explore the therapeutic effects of CD19-targeted CAR-T
      cell therapy.
