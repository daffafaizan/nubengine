      patients, presenting with moderate to severe forehead wrinkles, with sweating ability who had
      never undergone previous BoNT-A injections were enrolled. Subjects have received botulinum
      toxin type-A injections in two forehead sites, Botox 2U and Dysport 5U, both reconstituted in
      the same volume of 0.02 mL per point. Baseline, twenty-eight and 112 days later, clinical and
      photographic assessments, MinorÂ´s test, and electromyographic (EMG) evaluations were
      performed.
