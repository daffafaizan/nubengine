      re-resection (and - if possible - postoperative chemotherapy) in incidental gallbladder
      carcinoma (IGBC) or in front radical resection in biliary tract cancer (BTC) (intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)/ extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC)) prolongs overall survival
      without impaired quality of life compared to immediate radical surgery alone with or without
      adjuvant chemotherapy (investigator's choice) in patients with IGBC, or BTC (ICC/ECC). One of
      the most important secondary objectives is to raise awareness for the necessity of a radical
      second surgery as well as to improve the adherence to the treatment guidelines in IGBC.
      Further secondary objectives are safety and tolerability of the treatment as well as quality
      of life.
