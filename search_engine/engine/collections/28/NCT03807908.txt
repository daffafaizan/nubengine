    
      This study is a randomized control trial with 3 main parts associated. 1) Initial visit:
      Potential participants will be recruited from 2 antenatal clinics at the participating
      hospital. A person from the circle of care will ask if they are interested in participating
      in a study regarding pregnancy-related LBP. Participants are pre-screened by a research
      investigator, If patients meet the eligibility criteria, they will be invited to participate.
      Research personnel will explain the study in full including the rationale (per the Project
      Consent Form), visit requirement, treatment protocol and follow-up. Once consent is obtained,
      a Pre-Visit Questionnaire will be administered while they are awaiting their antenatal
      appointment. 2) Physical exam and treatment: Following their appointment, research personnel
      will walk the participant to the Obstetrical Day Unit where the chiropractor will review the
      consent and questionnaire, perform a brief physical exam to ensure proper stratification of
      pain, randomized the participant (as pre-determined by the biostatistician) and apply the
      appropriate taping protocol (intervention vs sham). 3) Follow-up: Five to 7 days later,
      research personnel will follow-up with the participant by phone and administer a
      questionnaire pertaining to their experience with the taping protocol. The total visit should
      take no more than 30 minute
