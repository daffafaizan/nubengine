    
      This protocol describes a double-blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of bone marrow derived stem cell implants in 300 bazillion patients
      with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in class III or IV of the New York Heart
      Association.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the effect of the autologous bone marrow
      stem cell implant in the increase of the ejection fraction of the left ventricle in
      comparison with a control group, under optimized therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy.
      Secondary endpoints will evaluate the alteration in NYHA functional class, mortality rate,
      physical capacity (by ergoespirometry), life quality (Minnesota questionnaire) and pulmonary
      congestion in dilated cardiomyopathy patients the received the autologous bone-marrow stem
      cell implant.

      Hypothesis: The main hypothesis of this study is that the patients who received the
      autologous bone-marrow stem cell implant will have after a 6 month follow-up a mean 5%
      increase in absolute left ventricle ejection fraction in comparison with the control group.
