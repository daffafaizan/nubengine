      one of the investigators listed on this study. Fluoroscopic radiation exposure during these
      procedures is used to guide the surgical devices that are used to treat the stones. The
      investigators will be measuring the radiation effective skin dose by two methods. First, the
      investigators will place two "Microdot" thermal leak detectors (TLD) on the patient. These
      devices which are the size and thickness of a dime will be within plastic bags taped to the
      patients body within the central focus of the fluoroscopy image. At the completion of the
      procedure the TLD's will be transferred to the Radiation Safety Office in Oakland to be read
      and the dose recorded.

      Second, a flat chamber that is integral with all fluoroscopy machines used at Children's
      Hospital will measure the dose-area product (DAP) for each case which will allow us to
      calculate the effective dose. This device is a component of the colimeter on the arm of the
      x-ray machine used for fluoroscopy. It measures the radiation that is returned to the x-ray
      machine and calculates the dose delivered to the patient by comparing the amount delivered to
      the patient to the amount returned to the machine. Its use is automatic when any x-rays are
      delivered and does not involve any manipulation of the patient or alteration of normal
      procedure.

      No additional procedures or change in duration is necessary for this study
