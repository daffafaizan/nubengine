      will be women with newly-diagnosed endometrial or ovarian cancer. Controls will be matched by
      5-year age groups and selected by random digit dialing (for those under 65), from Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) files (for those 65 and over), or from neighborhood
      sampling. Controls will not have had a hysterectomy.

      There will be 400 cases with endometrioid tumors, 60 with serous tumors or clear cell tumors,
      300 with ovarian cancer, and 400 controls. In addition, there will be a small group of black
      women included from MSKCC.

      We will interview participants about known and potential risk factors for endometrial and
      ovarian cancer and obtain information on diet. We will obtain DNA for genetic analysis from
      buccal specimens collected using a mouthwash rinse method. We will use logistic regression to
      determine odds ratios for disease with various exposures. For endometrial cancer, we will
      examine the association of risk with genotypes in strata defined by body mass index and
      dietary fat consumption.
