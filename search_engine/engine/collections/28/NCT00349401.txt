      neuropathic pain, alters the response to traditional and non-traditional analgesics (pain
      medications).

      To treat persons with chronic pain, doctors sometimes implant a permanent tube in the spinal
      space in the back to give pain medicines. This tube, also called a spinal pump, is used to
      administer pain medicine directly to the spinal space. The most commonly used medicine given
      through the spinal pump is morphine which works well for most people, but sometimes loses
      tolerance, and larger and larger doses are needed, causing many side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if another medicine, ketorolac, when given with
      morphine in the spinal space, can stop or reverse the need for larger and larger doses of
      morphine. In animals, ketorolac has been shown to slow the need for an increase in morphine
      dosage and to reduce the morphine dose, while giving good pain control.

      This study will enroll 30 individuals with chronic pain below the chest, caused by nerve
      injury, who are receiving morphine through a spinal pump. After learning to estimate pain
      accurately using thermal heat testing, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      study groups. Group one will receive the active study medication, ketorolac, while group two
      receives an inactive control (placebo). All participants will receive morphine (administered
      through the spinal pump). Afterwards, participants will rate their levels of pain, and
      provide samples of their spinal fluid (taken from the spinal tube/pump) for study. The above
      procedure will be repeated over a 4-week period.

      Duration of the study for participants is 4 weeks, and includes ten visits to the research
      center, each lasting less than one hour.
