      restenosis and stent fracture after endovascular treatment. The titanium-nitride coated
      woven-nitinol peripheral arterial stent system (GoldenFlow, Lifetech Science, Shenzhen,
      China) is designed to have superior radial strength, flexibility and durability to withstand
      the compression, torsion, bending, lengthening and shortening found in femoropopliteal
      disease. Compared to another commercially available woven-nitinol stent, the GoldenFlow stent
      has the potential advantage to be repositionable and is less likely to lengthen during
      deployment. This is a first-in-man study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GoldenFlow
      woven-nitinol stent for intraluminal treatment of peripheral vascular disease in de-novo
      femoropopliteal lesions.
