      without radiation to lower limbs. Nowadays, there are a lot of types of low back pain
      interventions, yet despite the vast amount of research findings, the evidence remains
      contradictory and inconclusive: Pharmacological treatments like NSAIDs have shown result in
      acute low back pain but not in chronic pain; conservative interventions (ultrasound,
      interferential currents, mechanical traction and massage) have been studied and found
      ineffective.

      A total of 151 low back pain patients with or without radiation to lower limbs between 18-70
      years old derived from the Physiotherapy Unit of GÃ©vora Health Center (Badajoz, Spain)
      voluntarily entered the study
