      the severity of bipolar disorder (BD). This review establishes a pattern of response of
      exercise and potential impact on the pathophysiology of BD; , as well as, produces hypotheses
      on how acute and chronic effect of exercises may act differently; and provides future
      perspectives with the focus of the exercise as an important and innovative model of treatment
      for BD and mental disorder. A critical evaluation of the literature was undertaken including
      the influence of exercise on health promotion in patients with mental disorders,
      neurochemical behavior exercise-induced, as well as reflective introduction of news
      perspectives of training control in severe exercise domain. The exercise induces significant
      changes in monoaminergic after, and with long-term training, and work with a threshold of
      exercise can modulate positive effects on mood. Fast adaptive effects from the high intensity
      interval training should be considered in BD patients. However, there must be caution in his
      administration. We speculate that exercise may be a way of maintaining euthymia in the case
      of BD, making it less vulnerable patient to stay longer at a time of neutrality. Future
      research is needed to adopt a training strategy that is both time efficient in the different
      areas and adequate for the population in question.
