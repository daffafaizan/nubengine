      trend parallels the rising rate of obesity, the most significant increasing risk factor for
      endometrial cancer. Young women with obesity and endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia
      who want to maintain their fertility and thus avoid hysterectomy are treated with progestin
      therapy, such as progestin intra-uterine device (pIUD). However, the pIUD achieves cancer
      regression in only 50-70% of women, and over 50% of initial responders will develop
      recurrence within two years. The effectiveness of the pIUD may be improved if the driver of
      endometrial cancer (obesity) was simultaneously addressed. Multiple epidemiologic studies
      have demonstrated that bariatric surgery reduces the risk of developing endometrial cancer.
      Our research aims to answer the question: "Is bariatric surgery in addition to the pIUD a
      feasible and acceptable option for young women with endometrial cancer/atypical hyperplasia
      who wish to maintain their childbearing potential compared to standard treatment of pIUD
      alone?

      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of a full-scale
      randomized controlled trial. Eligible women will be identified and consented over a 21-month
      period, and participants will be randomized to bariatric surgery plus standard pIUD
      (intervention group) or to standard pIUD alone (non-intervention group) in a 1:1 fashion.
