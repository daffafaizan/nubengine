      Imaging (MRI)-guided focal laser therapy with the Visualase Thermal Therapy System to treat
      low-risk prostate cancer tumors. Unlike surgery or radiotherapy which affects a large portion
      of the prostate or the entire organ, localized or focal therapy is intended to treat a small
      portion of tissue in which the cancer has been found by biopsy.
