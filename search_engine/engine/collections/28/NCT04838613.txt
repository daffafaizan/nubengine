    
      This is a prospective, open-label, multi center, single-arm Phase III study to evaluate the
      diagnostic performance of [18F]CTT1057 as a PET imaging agent for detection and localization
      of PSMA positive tumors in PCa patients diagnosed with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after
      radical prostatectomy or curative-intent radiotherapy, using a Composite Truth Standard (CTS)
      as reference.

      The CTS to be used as reference will be hierarchical in nature, with 3 levels of Standard of
      Truth (SoT) procedures, that will be applied as follows:

      CTS Level 1: Histopathology if available (from prospective biopsy or salvage surgery
      performed within 8 weeks after the [18F]CTT1057 PET/CT scan); OR in case that histopathology
      is not available, inconclusive or negative:

      CTS Level 2: Imaging diagnostic procedures performed on each patient as clinically indicated
      per SoC, which must include at least a high resolution CT scan with contrast and a
      [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT) performed within 8 weeks (either before or after) the [18F]CTT1057
      PET/CT scan. Three-month follow-up imaging (from baseline) will also be used as part of the
      CTS level 2 in cases where it is clinically required for the diagnosis of particular
      lesion(s); OR if neither of the two above are feasible or deemed appropriate:

      CTS Level 3: 50% or greater decline in PSA following radiation therapy (as long as no
      concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is given) as per Prostate Cancer Working Group
      3 (PCWG3) criteria.

      All participants will undergo 2 PET/CT scans: one with the investigational agent [18F]CTT1057
      and another with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (as a component of the CTS Level 2 and for a secondary
      endpoint of assessment of concordance between the 2 PET/CT scans for detection of lesions at
      patient level). The 2 PET imaging procedures will be performed at least 14 days apart, and
      the PET/CT scan sequence for each participant will be assigned at random in a 1:1 ratio.
