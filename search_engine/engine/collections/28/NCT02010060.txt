      study will investigate the effects of aerobic exercise training and increasing the amount of
      physical activity outside of training (Non-EX PA) on waist circumference, weight, and other
      cardiovascular disease risk factors in a prospective pilot trial. The investigators will
      randomize sedentary (<6,500 steps per day) obese adults with at least one additional
      cardiovascular risk factor (N= 45) to a: (1) structured aerobic exercise program with no
      intervention on Non-Ex PA (AERO group, N=15); (2) structured aerobic exercise program with
      the additional goal of increasing Non-EX PA (AERO-PA group, N=15), or (3) a non-exercise
      control group (CON, N=15) for 6 months. Exercise groups will participate in the same aerobic
      training program (50 to 75% VO2 max), designed to be consistent with public health
      recommendations of 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity. Non-Ex PA in the AERO
      group will be tracked throughout the entire 6 month intervention with pedometers capable of
      counting steps, but not displaying them to the participant (blind mode capable). The AERO-PA
      group will progressively increase Non-Ex PA throughout intervention using pedometers (a
      progressive increase of 1,000 to 3,000 steps per day above baseline levels). The AERO-PA
      group will also participate in lifestyle counseling grounded in the principles of the
      behavioral change theories to determine/reinforce strategies to increase Non-Ex PA. The
      primary outcome measure will be change in waist circumference following the intervention. The
      results of this pilot study will be used to determine the efficacy/feasibility of the
      intervention, and power a larger trial as an R01 application.
