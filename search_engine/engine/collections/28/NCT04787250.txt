    
      This is a study designed to evaluate bacteriophage therapy in patients with chronic
      prosthetic joint infections of the hip or knee caused by 1 or 2 of the following organisms:
      Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Streptococcus
      sp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      and/or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

      This study will also compare the safety and efficacy of phage therapy in conjunction with
      antibiotics versus standard of care (SOC) two-stage exchange arthroplasty plus antibiotics.
