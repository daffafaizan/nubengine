      evaluate the endocrine profile; those with basal hormonal values will receive 6 mg oral
      estradiol daily beginning from day 1 of their cycle. On day 7 of the treatment a blood test
      for the serum hormone evaluation and an ultrasound will be planned in order to evaluate the
      endometrium thickness; those who will meet the criteria (endometrium thickness â‰¥7mm) will be
      randomized. In the 7 days estradiol (E2) arm (A) the study coordinator will plan the FET
      after 6 days of progesterone supplementation (13 days of E2 intake). In the 14 days E2 arm
      (B) the team will plan on day 14 of treatment with E2 the serum hormone evaluation and an
      ultrasound in order to evaluate the endometrium thickness, consequently the FET will be
      planned after 6 days of progesterone supplementation (after 14 days of E2 intake).
      Furthermore, all the patients included in the study will undergo a blood test on the day of
      the transfer for the evaluation of the hormones level. For the assessment of the pregnancy a
      first blood test will take place 12 days after the ET and a blood test with an ultrasound
      will take place at 7 weeks for the evaluation of the clinical pregnancy.
