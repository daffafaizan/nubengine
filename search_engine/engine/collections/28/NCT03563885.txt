      important risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Weight loss improves postprandial glycemic
      control. The difficulty in achieving successful weight loss by using lifestyle therapy (diet
      and physical activity) has led to an increased interest in bariatric surgery, which is the
      most effective available weight loss therapy. Moreover, bariatric surgery procedures that
      bypass the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve
      gastrectomy (SG), have profound effects on glycemic control and cause remission in a large
      percentage of people with T2D. However, the effect of RYGB and SG surgery on postprandial
      glucose disposal among key metabolic organs has not been investigated and compared. The goal
      of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of whole-body and tissue-specific
      glucose metabolism after consuming a mixed meal in lean people and people with obesity,
      before and after 20-35% weight loss induced by RYGB or SG surgery. Glucose uptake (GU) will
      be assessed by using: i) a combination of oral and intravenous stable isotopically-labeled
      glucose tracers to assess the delivery of ingested glucose into the systemic circulation and
      whole-body glucose disposal rate; and ii) positron emission tomography (PET) with magnetic
      resonance (MR) imaging to assess muscle, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, liver,
      small intestine, and pancreas GU.
