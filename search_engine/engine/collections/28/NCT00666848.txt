      proportions in developed countries and is closely associated with hypertension. As new oral
      hypoglycemic agents become available for clinical use, practitioners wishing to treat both
      hyperglycemia and hypertension will use varieties of combinations of medications. In this
      setting, understanding interactions and additive effects of these medications becomes
      essential. Sitagliptin, a selective dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitor, improves
      glycemic control in patients with T2DM by decreasing the degradation of the incretin
      hormones. The incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent
      insulinotropic peptide (GIP) augment nutrient mediated insulin release. To date there have
      been two reports of a blood pressure lowering effect of the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin, but
      no mechanism for this effect has been proposed.

      Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin lowers blood
      pressure compared to placebo therapy in subjects with the metabolic syndrome.

      Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin potentiates the
      blood pressure response to acute ACE-inhibition.
