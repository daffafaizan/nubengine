      chemical debridement with antimicrobial irrigants, such as Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and
      chlorhexidine and use of calcium hydroxide do not always suffice to predictably render root
      canals free of bacteria Using the high-power diode laser is a new approach of disinfection
      allowing access to the previously unavailable areas, such as the tubular network. This study,
      therefore, compares two types of diode lasers (low-power and high power) in terms of
      anti-bacterial effect as well as the conventional endodontic retreatment to determine the
      ideal method of root canal disinfection.
