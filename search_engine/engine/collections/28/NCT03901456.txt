      interventions are designed to modify the more challenging aspects of care for a relative with
      Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia (ADRD) in order to improve key outcomes. However,
      current research has yet to discern which caregivers are most likely to benefit from
      different types of interventions or services. There also remains a lack of individualized
      information that can directly meet the heterogeneous needs of caregivers or their relatives
      with ADRD. This project will advance scientific knowledge, technical capability, and clinical
      practice as they pertain to ADRD management and caregiver support. The research team has
      developed and tested the feasibility and utility of an online care planning tool prototype
      (called Care to Plan, or CtP) that provides a succinct and clear overview of various types of
      ADRD caregiver interventions, administers a brief validated assessment of risk, and generates
      individualized service recommendations for ADRD caregivers as well as resources that link
      users to a selected recommendation. The goal of CtP is to offer a more efficient,
      user-directed process to link ADRD caregivers to the services that may be most appropriate
      for them given their needs, the needs of their relatives, and other contextual
      characteristics. We will deploy and more fully evaluate CtP for family caregivers of persons
      with ADRD who seek services in Riverside Health System (RHS) in the state of Virginia. The
      Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement CtP for 20 family members of persons with ADRD in four RHS
      clinical sites (Phase I) over a 1-month period; and 2) Evaluate the preliminary efficacy and
      implementation of CtP (Phase II) via an embedded randomized controlled evaluation for 100
      newly enrolled ADRD caregivers over a 6-month period. We anticipate that the CtP will serve
      as an innovative, low-cost tool that both families and long-term service and support
      providers can utilize to better meet the diverse needs of family caregivers of persons with
      ADRD in their communities.
