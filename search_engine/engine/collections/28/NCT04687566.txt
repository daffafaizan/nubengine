      investigate the treatment outcomes of add-on low dose dextromethorphan (60mg/day, DM),
      memantine (5 mg/day, MM), or dextromethorphan (60mg/day) and memantine (5mg/day) combination
      (DM+MM) in amphetamine-type stimulants use disorder patients. The investigators will recruit
      120 patients with ATSUD in three years and allocate participants to add-on DM, MM, DM+MM or
      placebo group in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (participants will also undergo usual psychosocial
      interventions).The investigators will follow up the participants for 12 weeks and measure the
      treatment responses, urine drug tests, craving scales and side effects to evaluate the
      therapeutic effects of add-on DM, MM, or DM+MM. Neuropsychological assessments, tests for
      inflammatory parameters and neurotrophic factors, and brain functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) will also be evaluated during 12-weeks follow up.
