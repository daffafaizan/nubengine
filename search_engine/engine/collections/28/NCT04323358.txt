      both, AS-OCT(s) and Pentacam. In our department three different AS-OCT devices and a HR
      Scheimpflug imaging device are currently in use for clinical routine to measure the cornea.
      Among refractive and anterior segment surgeons, there is no preferred and accepted method for
      accurate measurements of the corneal curvature. The four diagnostic tools are based on
      different technical and physical imaging principles and to date only limited information on
      their comparability exist. One advantage of ASOCT represents faster imaging speed when
      compared to Scheimpflug imaging. Thus, imaging misalignment, segmentation errors and defocus
      aberration can most likely be avoided by AS-OCT. Chen et al demonstrated that HR Scheimpflug
      imaging measurements of CCT were systematically higher than the measurements provided by FD
      AS-OCT. Further, repeatability, reproducibility and agreement of AS-OCT and Scheimpflug
      imaging device will be assessed during follow-up.
