      with recurrent or refractory superficial bladder cancer. II. Determine the dose-limiting
      toxicity and other toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess any responses
      in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive intravesical
      gemcitabine that is left in the bladder for 2 hours and then removed on day 1. Treatment
      continues every 7 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of intravesical gemcitabine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every
      3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
