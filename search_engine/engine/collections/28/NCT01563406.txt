      intensive care unit at Rush University Medical Center. The intensive care unit will be
      divided into two regions (A&B). Hub disinfectants and duration of disinfection will be
      randomly assigned to these regions. After 1/2 of the study period, the agents will crossover,
      but the duration of scrubbing will remain the same, analogous to a 2 by 2 factorial design.
      Our primary endpoint will be internal contamination of hubs and catheters.

      In February 2012 it was determined that the supplier of chlorhexidine and alcohol pads could
      not completely blind each pad. It was decided that a plain white sticker would be affixed to
      the front of each pad, but the safety information on the back of each pad would remain
      visible.

      3/27/12-Internal hub contamination (yes/no)was clarified as the primary outcome.

      On 5/10/12 a new sample size calculation adjusted the hub sample size needed to power the
      main effects based on more accurate information regarding the expected hub contamination
      rate. The expected hub contamination rate changed because of the more sensitive hub culture
      method that was adopted before the study began. This more sensitive method also allowed for a
      new secondary outcome of number of microbial colony forming units per hub.

      The first crossover time selected was 6/11/12, prior to the midpoint of the study. This was
      done to try to improve a large imbalance in the group sizes.

      On 6/11/12 a hold was placed on the catheter tip component of the study, because of an
      inability to collect tips.

      On 8/7/12 the catheter tip outcome was dropped because of an inability to collect tips.

      On 1/11/13 a second crossover was implemented in an effort to balance the sizes of the study
      groups.
