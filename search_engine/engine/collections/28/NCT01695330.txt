    
      Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To establish the safety and tolerability of treatment with a SC bortezomib containing
      combination regimen for MM patients who have demonstrated progressive disease from a prior
      and different IV bortezomib containing combination regimen:

        -  To compare the incidence of PN between IV bortezomib and treatment with SC bortezomib in
           a subsequent anti-MM combination regimen

        -  To compare the severity of PN between IV bortezomib and treatment with SC bortezomib in
           a subsequent combination anti-MM regimen

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the overall response rate [combined CR + very good partial response (VGPR) +
           PR + MR] following treatment with a SC bortezomib-containing combination regimen for MM
           patients who have demonstrated progressive disease from a prior and different IV
           bortezomib containing combination regimen

        -  To compare disease parameters following treatment with a SC bortezomib containing
           combination regimen for MM patients who have demonstrated progressive disease from a
           prior and different IV bortezomib containing combination regimen as follows:

             -  time to progression

             -  progression free survival

             -  time to first response

             -  duration of response

             -  overall survival

        -  To determine the incidence and severity of injection-site reactions with SC
           administration of bortezomib
