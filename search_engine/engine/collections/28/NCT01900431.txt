    
      The total duration per participant was up to 58 weeks, which included a 2 week screening
      period, 16 weeks principal treatment period (Part A), 34 weeks extension treatment period
      (Part B) or open label treatment period (Part C), and 6 weeks after last treatment
      administration.

      Participants with decrease in vitreous haze (VH) ≥2; or corticosteroids dose <10 mg/day at
      Week 16 were considered as responders. Participants who did not complete the principal
      treatment period (Part A) due to lack of efficacy; or no decrease in VH ≥2 and
      corticosteroids dose ≥10 mg/day at Week 16; or no decrease in VH ≥2 and corticosteroids dose
      missing at Week 16; or non-responder according to medical review, were considered as
      non-responders.

      Responder participants, observed at Week 16 (at the end of Part A), were invited to continue
      in the extension treatment period (Part B).

      Non-responder participants, observed within the first 16 weeks, were offered to be treated by
      open-label sarilumab (Part C).
