    
      This study is a pilot randomized control trial that aims to (a) to determine the differences
      in self-reported and proxy-reported pain and fear during IV insertion between the interactive
      VR intervention and control group, and (b) to assess the feasibility (safety, acceptability)
      of the VR intervention to children/families and the healthcare team in the pediatric
      emergency department. The study will consist of two study arms, where both study arms will be
      screened and recruited using the same procedure. Participants will be randomized into either
      (1) Control group: child life specialist plays an age-appropriate video on a tablet device,
      or (2) Intervention (VR Distraction): child life specialist facilitates immersive VR
      experience. Both the intervention and control groups will receive standard medical care
      (e.g., topical anesthetics). A convenience sample of 80 children and adolescents with cancer
      (40 participants per treatment arm; 20 boys and 20 girls per treatment arm) will be
      recruited. In addition to usual care, children in the experimental condition will wear the VR
      headset plus headphones. In the control condition, children will watch a video (i.e., an
      age-appropriate video selected by an emergency department affiliated child life specialist)
      on an iPad, while wearing the same headphones as in the experimental condition.
      Implementation outcomes include accrual and retention rates, acceptability and technical
      difficulties. Effectiveness outcomes include child pain, distress, and fear, as well as
      parent distress.
