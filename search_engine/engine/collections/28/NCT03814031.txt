      adjusted with donor graft weight. This index, HVF index, was assessed for correlation with
      EAD. HVF was calculated with hepatic vein area (cm2) x hepatic vein velocity (ml/s) in
      systole and diastole during the neohepatic phase. Investigators did ROC analysis to assess
      the predictive power for EAD, prolonged INR, platelet, and total bilirubin.
