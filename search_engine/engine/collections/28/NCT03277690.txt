    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal and rescue/restoration
      study in subjects with endogenous CS that will assess efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK
      of levoketoconazole. There are two populations (cohorts) of subjects: (1) subjects which were
      previous levoketoconazole study completers and (2) subjects that are levoketoconazole
      treatment naïve subjects.

      Study methodology varies by cohort prior to randomization only. Following initial screening
      (washout as needed) and Dose Titration and Maintenance Periods, as applicable, this study
      will be conducted in two double-blind phases (a Withdrawal Phase and a Restoration Phase).
      The levoketoconazole-naïve cohort will need to go through the Dose Titration and Maintenance
      Phase. The longest anticipated total study participation duration is approximately 51 weeks.
