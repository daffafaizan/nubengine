      dyspnea after therapeutic thoracentesis. Although this is a well-recognized phenomenon, the
      physiologic basis for such relief remains poorly understood. Primary physiologic basis for
      the relief in dyspnea after thoracentesis may include the improvement of the heart and lung
      function. In some cases the improvement in breathlessness cannot be attributed to the
      improvement of gas exchange, due to the atelectatic lung(not fully expansion of the lung).
      Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is a non-invasive, real-time viewing of the internal parts
      of the heart using ultrasound, which can get highly accurate and quick assessment of the
      various heart images, though which doctors can quickly assess a patient's heart valves and
      degree of heart muscle contraction.
