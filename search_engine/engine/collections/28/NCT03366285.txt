      "delivery room skin to skin study" (deisy), moderate to late preterm infants born 2010 to
      2011 who participated in the "trauma and depression in late preterm parents study" (TraDelPP)
      and full-term infants at 6 to 8 years of age is assessed using the German version of the
      attachment story completion task (ASCT). Additionally, gene expression of six key molecules
      involved in stress response and neurobehavioral development (the corticotropin releasing
      hormone receptor 1 and 2 genes (CRHR1 and CRHR2), arginine vasopressin gene (AVP), the
      glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1), the serotonin receptor 2A gene (HTR2A), and the
      serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4)) are quantified in in mucosal epithelial cells from
      buccal swabs of children of all four groups. Maternal and infant co-factors such as maternal
      depression, perceived social support, parental stress, infant health development and behavior
      are assessed by self-reporting questionnaires.
