      by gradual modification of the acrylic plate with periodic acrylic add on and grinding. After
      the alveolar cleft gap is less than 5 mm (usually at the end of second months), nasal molding
      was added to the alveolar molding plate.

      Figueroa's NAM reconstruction use labial tapes and acrylic relief to the palatal plate to
      approximate alveolar gap. The device starts with nasal and alveolar molding simultaneously.
