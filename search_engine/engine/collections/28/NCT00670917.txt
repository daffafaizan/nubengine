      Primary

        -  To compare pain rating in cancer patients undergoing bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
           (BMAB) treated with magnetic acupressure at bilateral large intestine 4 (LI 4) points vs
           sham acupressure at bilateral proximal fourth interosseus space of the hand.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the duration of BMAB, patient's rating of the procedure, and patient's
           willingness to receive acupressure during subsequent BMABs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to the number of prior bone marrow aspirations and
      biopsies (BMAB) (0-1 vs â‰¥ 2) and type of procedure (bone marrow aspiration alone vs BMAB).
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (acupressure): Patients receive acupressure at bilateral large intestine 4 (LI 4)
           points using Haci Magnetic Acupressure Suction Cups (MASC) during BMAB.

        -  Arm II (sham acupressure): Patients receive acupressure at bilateral proximal fourth
           interosseus space of the hand using the same size MASC as in arm I during BMAB.

      Patients in both arms also receive analgesic and anxiolytic medications as determined by the
      acupressure operator and physician.

      Patients complete a questionnaire before and after BMAB to assess pain experienced before and
      during BMAB and their attitude towards the procedure.
