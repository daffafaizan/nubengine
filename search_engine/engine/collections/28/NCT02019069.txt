    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Determine efficacy of CPX-351 by measuring the response rate as the sum of complete response
      (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) in older patients (age 60
      and older) with: higher risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are refractory/relapsed
      after prior hypomethylating (HMA) therapy; subjects greater than 75 years old with higher
      risk MDS who are HMA relapsed/refractory who have progressed to acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML)); AML with refractory/relapsed disease after prior HMA therapy for AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. Determine the safety of CPX-351, as the frequency of Grade 3 to 5 SAEs

        2. Determine the duration of remission (DOR) following induction therapy with CPX-351.

        3. Determine overall survival (OS) at 12 months.

        4. Determine the early induction mortality (at 30 and 60 days) following CPX-351 following
           induction therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 intravenously (IV) at a dose of 65
      units/m2/day over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 of each induction cycle.

        -  1st INDUCTION: Patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV at a dose
           of 65 units/m2/day over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Patients achieving a complete
           remission (CR) or a CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) at day 14 proceed to
           consolidation therapy

        -  2nd INDUCTION: Patients with reduced blast count not achieving a morphological leukemia
           free state (< 5% blasts) receive the 2nd course of induction therapy. Patients receive
           liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin CPX-351 IV a dose of 65 units/m2/day over 90 minutes
           on days 1 and 3. Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) or a CR with incomplete
           blood count recovery (CRi) after the 2nd course of induction therapy proceed to
           consolidation therapy.

        -  CONSOLIDATION: Beginning on day 28, patients receive liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin
           CPX-351 IV a dose of 65 units/m2/day over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 1 year.
