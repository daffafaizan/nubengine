      safe and effective treatment for patients with pollen-induced allergic rhinitis. The long
      term goal is to provide a base for a more efficient administration of ASIT, which will reduce
      both the dose necessary and the number of clinic visits associated with the conventional
      subcutaneous ASIT.

      The aim of the present substudy is to evaluate if a randomized preseasonal ILIT booster,
      after three open label ILIT injections, can increase the allergen specific IgG4 antibodies,
      and if the IgG4 increase can be correlated to clinical effect characterized with seasonal
      questionnaires.

      The first part of the study is completed and published (PMID: 23374268)
