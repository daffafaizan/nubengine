      defend their global sense of self-worth, which in the present case is threatened by
      perceptions of hearing aids/loss. However, if a person's self-image can be bolstered
      (affirmed) in a domain that is important to them, thereby preserving self-integrity, the
      individual should be less likely to process the threatening (i.e., stigmatizing in the
      present context) information defensively. Accumulated empirical evidence demonstrates that
      affirming the self: (a) reduces public stigma, (b) reduces self-stigma, and (c) causes
      meaningful changes in behaviour. Following a pilot-feasibility trial showing that
      self-affirming caused significant reductions in first-time hearing aid users' anxieties about
      ageing and increased their hearing aid use by almost 2 hours/day.
