      caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator molecule
      (CFTR) and affects approximately 40.000 patients in Europe. The majority of CF patients
      develop chronic pulmonary infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These are normally treated
      with single antibiotics, administered orally, intravenously or inhalatively. Once the
      infection becomes chronic, eradication of the pathogen is not any more possible due to
      biofilm formation of the pathogen and increasing resistance. However, inhalative antibiotic
      combination therapy might be more efficient than single antibiotic therapy in chronically
      infected CF patients. This notion is supported by previous in vitro and animal studies using
      Tobramycin/Colistin combination therapy. Importantly, a pilot study in five CF patients who
      inhaled consecutively Colistin and Tobramycin solutions for 4 week, revealed a decrease of
      log10 2.52 ± 2.5 cfu of P. aeruginosa in sputum specimens during the course of the treatment
      compared to baseline values (p=0.027). The treatment was shown to be safe and well tolerated.
      However, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) did not differ significantly.

      Taking advantage of the new development of dry powder inhalation (DPI) antibiotics,
      specifically TOBI© Podhaler, a larger randomised trial has been performed in which the
      combined TOBI© Podhaler and Colistin treatment is compared to the monotherapy with Colistin.
