      intensification on the HIV reservoir in HIV-infected patients who have viral suppression on
      combination antiretroviral therapy. Treatment regimens first will be intensified by the
      addition of raltegravir and maraviroc for 8 week followed by immunomodulation with the NIH
      HIV-rAd5 vaccine plus DNA prime-boost for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is measurement of
      change in peripheral cellular HIV DNA. A decrease of 0.5 log is considered significant. A
      secondary endpoints include change in HIV DNA in the rectal mucosa, immunologic changes in
      the peripheral blood and safety.
