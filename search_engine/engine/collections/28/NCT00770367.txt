      reduce serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in patients with adult diabetes.
      Recent research has found that elevated serum ADMA is associated with increased
      cardiovascular events and mortality, particularly in people with diabetes (Boger 2005,
      Zoccali 2006, Ueda 2007). ADMA, by mediating nitric oxide (NO) availability, may trigger
      pro-atherogenic effects. High plasma concentration of this substance has been associated with
      intima-media thickening, left ventricular hypertrophy and all-cause and cardiovascular
      mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, and associated with increased
      cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes (Kryzazanowska 2007). The result of higher
      levels of ADMA and reduced output of NO increases vasoconstriction, increases inflammation,
      and interferes with endothelial function. Preliminary studies indicate that pioglitazone may
      reduce ADMA levels, and thus lower cardiovascular risk.Thus, this protocol will test whether
      pioglitazone can reduce ADMA levels in adult patients with diabetes.
