    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, double blind, two-arm feasibility study
      evaluating the safety and performance of the sirolimus coated Cordis SMART™ nitinol
      self-expanding stent and delivery system as compared to the uncoated SMART™ stent and
      delivery system. It is anticipated that a total of 90 patients will be entered into the
      study. Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis of coated to uncoated stents.

      Ninety (90) patients with de novo or restenotic native SFA lesions will be randomized to the
      Sirolimus Coated SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent or to the uncoated (bare) SMART™ stent.

      Patients will be followed for 24 months post-procedure, with all patients having duplex
      ultrasound and clinical assessments at discharge, 1, 6, 9, 18 and 24 months, angiography at 6
      six months and plain X-ray at 18 months. This study will be conducted at nine investigational
      sites. (Protocol was amended where 56 additional patients were recruited and followed for up
      to 5 years.)
