        -  Compare the local disease control, overall survival, and relapse-free survival in
           patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma treated with adjuvant high-dose doxorubicin
           and ifosfamide plus filgrastim (G-CSF) vs no adjuvant chemotherapy and G-CSF after
           definitive surgery.

        -  Compare the toxicity and morbidity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, site of primary tumor (extremity vs trunk, including shoulder, pelvic girdle, head,
      or neck vs central, including intrathoracic, visceral, uterine, or retroperitoneal), size of
      primary tumor (less than 5 cm vs 5 cm or greater in largest diameter), postoperative
      radiotherapy (yes vs no), and isolated limb perfusion therapy (yes vs no).

      Some patients undergo isolated limb perfusion therapy with cytotoxics and/or cytokines.

      No more than 8 weeks after biopsy or inadequate surgery, patients undergo definitive surgery.
      Patients with complete resection undergo radiotherapy assessment and then randomization.
      Patients with incomplete or marginal resection (except for central lesions) undergo
      re-excision and, in the absence of macroscopic disease, assessment for postoperative
      radiotherapy followed by randomization.

        -  Randomization: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive no adjuvant chemotherapy or filgrastim (G-CSF). Beginning
                within 6 weeks after surgery, eligible patients undergo radiotherapy as outlined
                below.

             -  Arm II: Beginning within 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive high-dose
                doxorubicin IV over 20 minutes followed by ifosfamide IV over 24 hours and G-CSF
                subcutaneously daily beginning 24 hours after completion of ifosfamide infusion and
                continuing for 10 days. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 5 courses. Beginning
                within 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, eligible patients undergo
                radiotherapy as outlined below.

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients with incomplete or marginal resection undergo radiotherapy 5 days
           a week for 6-6.6 weeks. Patients with complete microscopic resection undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks followed by boost radiotherapy 5 days a week for
           1 week.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
