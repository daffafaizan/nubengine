    
      The purpose of this research study is to test a new method for determining the stage and
      prognosis of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Currently, it is not possible to
      accurately determine cancer stage prior to surgery or another treatment. This new method may
      allow doctors to better classify cancer stage and give a better estimate for prognosis prior
      to surgery or another treatment.

      In this research study, the investigators would like to use biopsied tissue to study certain
      characteristics that will help test the new method for determining cancer stage and
      estimating prognosis.

      In this research study, the investigators are...

        -  Obtaining pleural specimens at the time of routine diagnostic biopsy during the
           participant's standard treatment.

        -  Storing your biopsied tissue

        -  Studying the tissue to determine if the new method of staging and prognosis is accurate
           and valid
