           PaO2/FiO2 between 150 and 300 (with FIO2 0.31), one hour after extubation, were
           included.

        -  Then, the patients were randomized into two groups: control and intervention group.
           Intervention group used NIV with a bi-level positive airway pressure (an inspiratory
           pressure to generate a tidal volume of 6ml/kg and an expiratory pressure of 7cmH2O) with
           a FIO2 0.4. Control group used oxygen by Venturi mask(FIO2 0.4) in order to keep a good
           oxygenation.

        -  In both groups measurements were done in basal situation, one and three hours after
           beginning the treatment and one hour after stop the treatment (FiO2 0.31).

        -  Variables studied included: PaO2/FiO2, PaO2, PaCO2, heart rate (HR), mean arterial
           pressure (MAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac output (CO).
