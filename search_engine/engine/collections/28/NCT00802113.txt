      United States. While Hodgkin's Disease (HD) has been described for many years, some subtypes
      of the non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL) have only recently been described. Non-Hodgkin's
      lymphomas traditionally have been classified as low, intermediate or high grade based on
      their clinical aggressiveness. More recently they have been divided into two major subgroups
      indolent and aggressive lymphomas by the current National Cancer Institute (NCI/PDQ)
      reference. Among children, aggressive histologies are prevalent including small non-cleaved
      cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and diffuse large cell lymphoma. The most common
      histologic classifications of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma over the past 30 years has
      included the morphological schema developed by Rappaport, the morphologically and
      immunologically based schema of Lukes and Collins, the Kiel classifications, the prognostic
      sub-groupings of the National Cancer Institute's Working Formulation, and the most recently
      developed classification that utilizes morphological, immunophenotypic and genetic
      information in the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification.
