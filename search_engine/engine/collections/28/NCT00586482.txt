      might also be efficacious in helping smokers maintain preoperative "fasting" from smoking is
      not known. A goal of this study is to determine how to best decrease smokers' exposure to
      cigarette smoke immediately before surgery. The specific aim of this study is to test the
      hypothesis that NRT in the form of nicotine lozenges will decrease the exposure to cigarette
      smoke prior to surgery. This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled clinical
      trial examining the efficacy of the nicotine lozenge in increasing preoperative abstinence
      from cigarettes in patients scheduled for elective surgery. Current smokers scheduled for any
      of a wide variety of elective surgical procedures will be recruited in the Mayo Clinic
      Rochester Preoperative Evaluation Center. and will receive a brief practice-based
      intervention encouraging preoperative abstinence for at least 12 hours before admission to
      the surgical facility. They will be randomized to receive either active or placebo lozenge.
