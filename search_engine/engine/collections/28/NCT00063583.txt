      States. In the kidneys of diabetic patients, there is accumulation of protein that leads to
      the formation of scar tissue and poor kidney function. Because of this many patients
      eventually require dialysis or kidney transplantation. A new investigational drug,
      pirfenidone, has been shown to be beneficial in a number of diseases in which scar formation
      leads to disease progression. It is our goal to examine whether pirfenidone is effective at
      stabilizing or reducing progressive diabetic kidney dysfunction.
