    
      This study seeks to further the development of iEAT by including participants that
      demonstrated improvements in a previously conducted pilot study, and finalize the treatment
      manual to include the standardized decision rules to increase feeding demands, further
      integrate the multidisciplinary team (nutrition and speech pathology), and include
      supplementary sessions to better address individual treatment needs.

      Investigators propose to enroll participants with chronic food refusal and formula or feeding
      tube dependence. Treatment will involve 10 biweekly outpatient appointments and 1 follow-up
      appointment of about 1 hour in length. Assessment and treatment will involve a
      multidisciplinary team including behavioral psychology, speech pathology and nutrition.
      Target behaviors including grams consumed, percent dependence on formula/feeding tube, and
      the clinical global impression scale, which will be assessed during a meal observation, 3-day
      food record, and evaluation with the dietitian and independent evaluator. Participants will
      be assessed pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment and complete a one month
      follow-up to assess long term effects.
