      decreased muscle strength and difficulty in performing activities of daily living. The
      purpose of the proposed research is to study how to adapt and implement the 3-Step Workout
      for Life program by the physical therapists and occupational therapists in a local home
      health agency. A series of learning cycles will be conducted to adjust the treatment dose and
      delivery mode, so that the program can be implemented at low cost but remains effective in
      improving self-care ability for Medicare beneficiaries. The specific aims include to evaluate
      the implementation outcomes and clinical outcomes, and to identify facilitators and barriers
      associated with the implementation.
