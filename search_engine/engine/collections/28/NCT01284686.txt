    
      Methods: Record STN-cortex LFP coherence pattern and then stimulate STN (at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20,
      25, 30 Hz) in newly implanted patients at rest and during simple and complex motor tasks
      while recording the steady state evoked potential over the cortex using EEG. The resonance
      frequency will be calculated as previously (Eusebio et al, Brain 2009). Experiments will be
      carried out both in the OFF medication and ON medication condition.
