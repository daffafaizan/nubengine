      The following hypothesis will be tested: Accelerometer measures are clinical relevant indices
      of global left and right myocardial performance during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Model:

      The performance of the accelerometer will be tested in a intraoperative setting, during
      weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Accelerometer measures of ventricular systolic and
      diastolic function will be compared to corresponding measures and indices of ventricular
      functions by echocardiography and hemodynamic monitoring during a step wise controlled
      weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, ensuring precise control of pre- and afterload.
