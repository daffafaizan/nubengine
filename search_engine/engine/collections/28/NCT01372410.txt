      corticosteroids are the mainstays of therapy in patients diagnosed with COPD. Anticholinergic
      bronchodilators or long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists function by blocking
      endogenous airway smooth muscle cholinergic tone. Treatment with anticholinergics has been
      shown to significantly improve forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), resting and
      dynamic lung hyperinflation, symptoms, and exercise capacity in patients with COPD. Currently
      tiotropium is the only approved long acting muscarinic antagonist available for treatment of
      COPD.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, three way crossover,
      incomplete block study to evaluate 4 doses of GSK573719 inhaled once daily and 2 doses of
      GSK573719 inhaled twice daily over 7 days in patients with COPD. Tiotropium will be included
      as an open label active comparator. A placebo treatment will be included to evaluate
      treatment effect of each GSK573719 dose. Pharmacokinetic profiles of GSK573719 will also be
      determined. Each eligible subject will receive a sequence of 3 of 8 potential treatments for
      a total of 3 treatment periods per subject. There will be 7 clinic visits, during three of
      which 24 hour serial spirometry will be performed. The total duration of subject
      participation is approximately 9 weeks.
