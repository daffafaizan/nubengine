      and tolerability of SJ733 in adult patients with uncomplicated P. vivax or P. falciparum
      blood-stage malaria monoinfection. SJ733 will be administered orally once every day for three
      consecutive days, with or without a fixed dose of the pharmacoenhancer cobicistat. The Phase
      1 clinical data (completed under a US IND) and PK/PD models suggest that SJ733 is most likely
      to be curative as a 3-daily-dose pharmacoenhanced therapy, due to its moderately rapid
      clearance. There will be 1-3 cohorts with each cohort containing two treatment arms, P.
      falciparum (a) and P. vivax (b). Cohort progression will be managed independently for each
      treatment arm. Interim analysis will determine whether the data for a given treatment arm
      meets the success criteria, is inconclusive, or meets the failure criteria. Antimalarial
      efficacy will be examined over the period of 42 days. Additional aims are to characterize the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of SJ733. The results of this trial will identify active,
      well-tolerated doses for investigation in a larger Phase 2b clinical trial.
