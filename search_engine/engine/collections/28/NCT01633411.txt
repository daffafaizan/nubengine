    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility, and performance of the C2
      Focal Cryoablation Device in patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE). At 6 to 8 weeks, the
      patient will receive a follow-endoscopy to assess stricture formation along with biopsy
      samples taken.

      Post-operative pain will be noted. Additionally, biopsy samples will be evaluated for the
      presence of residual Barrett's Esophagus. Through evaluation of the histological results,
      treatment parameters for the ablation of human esophageal epithelium will be better
      understood.

      Evaluations include, but are not limited to the following:

        -  Deployment ease/scope compatibility.

        -  Device malfunctions.

        -  Time of catheter deployment.

        -  Adverse events.

        -  Stricture formation at 6 to 8 weeks.

        -  Patient Pain.

        -  Histological evaluation of treatment zone at 6 to 8 weeks for presence of residual
           Barrett's Esophagus.
