    
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, distressing, and interfering
      condition that affects between 2% and 6% of adolescents. Although medications have been
      widely used as an effective treatment for many years as the sole treatment for ADHD, for
      many, clinically significant and interfering continued symptoms remain. Even after medication
      treatment, adolescents still experience residual ADHD symptoms and continue to have problems
      with inattention, concentration, disorganization, and other symptoms. However, research
      suggests that adolescents who have received some benefit from medication treatment can then
      experience further symptom reduction from participation in skills-based cognitive behavioral
      therapy. This study, adapted from a similar research study for adults with ADHD, will examine
      whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus medication is more effective at treating ADHD
      than medication therapy alone in adolescents with ADHD.

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive twelve weekly treatment sessions
      either immediately upon enrolling in the study or after a four-month waiting period.
      Questionnaires (that participants complete and ones that are done with an interviewer) will
      be used to assess participants' ADHD symptoms at study entry, after receiving the treatment,
      and at 4 month follow-up. Parents will have some involvement in therapy.

      Note: participants must be able to come to Boston or another study location in the Greater
      Boston area for 4 assessment visits and 12 weekly therapy visits in order for participation
      to be feasible.
