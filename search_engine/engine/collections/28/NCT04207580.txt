      systematically. The cohort will be composed of patients followed by pediatric nephrologists
      affiliated with the SNP. Metropolitan France, Reunion Island and Mayotte are the geographical
      areas concerned. It is planned to integrate other French overseas departments and
      territories, in particular the West Indies.

      This is therefore a prospective, multicenter, cohort follow-up study. The data will be
      centralized via a secure website dedicated to the study.

      Data will be obtained from:

        -  Medical record data (hospitalization/consultations) as part of routine clinical
           follow-up for patients with active disease. This information will be medically validated
           and integrated into the database with the help of clinical research staff.

        -  A telephone interview for annual follow-ups for patients whose absence of active disease
           no longer requires a systematic medical visit. This structured interview will be
           administered by telephone by the study's clinical research staff.

        -  Self-administered or hetero-administered quality of life questionnaires (PEDS-QL),
           self-administered or hetero-administered treatment compliance questionnaires (Morisky's
           Score), and questionnaires on the aesthetic impact of treatments (Ferriman's Score).
           These questionnaires will be centralized and reported to the database by the study's
           clinical research staff.
