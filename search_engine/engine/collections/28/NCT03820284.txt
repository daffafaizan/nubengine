    
      PATIENT AND METHOD :

      observation Cross sectional study will be conducted at assuit university hospitals on all
      patients with inflammatory disease to detect the prevalence of helicobacter pylori among them
      .Then the examined patients will be divided in to two group receiving the same medication
      group A : inflammatory bowel disease patient with H.PYLORI group B: inflammatory bowel
      disease Patient without H.PYLORI longitudinal study will be conducted to both group to study
      the clinical outcomes in both group .

        1. Thorough medical history and full clinical examination will be taken from all patient
           including

           -Personal history focus on special habit especially smoking

           -documented previous history for H.pylori eradication

             -  Onset and duration of inflammatory bowel disease

             -  current medication

             -  presence of any extra intestinal manifestation of Inflammatory bowel disease

             -  presence of any complications from Inflammatory bowel disease

        2. Investigation :

           -All patients with inflammatory bowel disease will be tested for presence or absence of
           H.PYLORI by histological examination of endoscopically biopsied gastric mucosa

           -his to logical examination of colonic mucosal every 3 months

           -complete blood count

           -serum albumin

           -c reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).

           -fecal calprotectin if possible

             -  assess the severity of among both group (A,B) every 3 month for 2years. ulcerative
                by Mayo Score/Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index and Crohn's disease by
                Montreal classifications for Crohn's Disease .

           Mayo Score/Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Stool frequency 0 = Normal 1 = 1-2
           stools/day more than normal 2 = 3-4 stools/day more than normal 3 = 4 stools/day more
           than normal Rectal bleeding 0 = None 1 = Visible blood with stool less than half the
           time 2 = Visible blood with stool half of the time or more 3 = Passing blood alone
           Mucosal appearance at endoscopy 0 = Normal or inactive disease 1 = Mild disease
           (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability) 2 = Moderate disease (marked
           erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions) 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous
           bleeding, ulceration) Physician rating of disease activity 0 = Normal 1 = Mild 2 =
           Moderate 3 = Severe
