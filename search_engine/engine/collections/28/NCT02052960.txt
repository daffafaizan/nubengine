    
      Indication: First line systemic treatment for stage III/IV recurrent and/or metastatic
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of CetuGEX™ for the treatment of patients with stage III/IV
      recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN as compared to cetuximab (both in combination with
      platinum-based chemotherapy) in terms of progression-free survival (PFS).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate further efficacy criteria, safety and quality of life (QoL) of patients with
      stage III/IV recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN treated with CetuGEX™ as compared to cetuximab
      (both in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy).

      To assess pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and profiles of CetuGEX™. To assess efficacy and
      safety based on genetic markers for immune response (Fc-gamma receptor [FcγR] allotypes) and
      biomarkers.
