      with cardiac disease that reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, increases quality
      of life, and is cost-effective. Recent retrospective studies show that higher exercise gains
      during CR are associated with reduced long-term morbidity and mortality among patients with
      both coronary artery disease and systolic heart failure. However, it is unclear which methods
      maximize exercise gains in CR. Recent retrospective studies have suggested that performing
      stress testing early in CR may allow for better tailoring of an exercise prescription and
      thus increase exercise gains. In this study, the investigators propose to do a randomized
      controlled trial of 60 patients at Baystate Medical Center CR, in which two thirds of the
      patients will undergo exercise testing prior to starting CR. The exercise test will determine
      the initial target heart rate range (THRR) and will also influence subsequent exercise
      progression. Additionally, half of the patients undergoing a stress test will receive a
      personal heart rate monitor to help improve adherence to the exercise prescription and THRR.
      The primary outcome is to determine feasibility, protocol fidelity, and effect sizes in
      preparation for a fully powered subsequent trial that will measure the impact of stress
      testing and a target heart rage range exercise prescription on exercise gain during CR.
