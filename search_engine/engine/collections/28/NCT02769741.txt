      cashew consumption on LDL-C and other aspects of the fasting lipoprotein lipid profile in
      healthy, moderately hyper-cholesterolemic individuals consuming a typical "American diet."
      Two arms consisting of two 28-day controlled-feeding treatment periods will allow for an
      isocaloric comparison of a diet with or without cashews.
