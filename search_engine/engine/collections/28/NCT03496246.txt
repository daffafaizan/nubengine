      (UC), is a a chronic, relapsing-remitting systemic disease and it is increasing sharply with
      rapidly increasing proportion in developing countries., and the common medications are not
      effective for most patients.The key underlying pathogenic mechanisms for both diseases is a
      dysregulated host immune response to commensal intestinal flora in genetically susceptible
      individuals.Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, a secosteroid hormone whose active form,
      calcitriol or 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays important roles in immune
      regulation, particularly involving the innate immune system, cell differentiation and
      intercellular adhesion, promotes the production of anti-microbial peptides, including
      β-defensins and cathelicidins, the shift towards Th2 immune responses, and regulates
      autophagy and epithelial barrier integrity.The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and
      IBD is bidirectional that vit D with its immunomodulatory effects influence IBD pathogenesis
      and activity and IBD itself can lead to vitamin D deficiency.Vitamin D deficiency has
      associated with increased IBD activity scores, lower quality-of-life, an increased risk of
      IBD-related surgery and increased hospitalizations.[4]. Vitamin D downregulate powerful
      proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, which enhance the durability of anti-TNF therapy in
      IBD and its deficency has been found to be associated with earlier cessation of anti-TNFα
      therapy( loss of response to biologic therapy.
