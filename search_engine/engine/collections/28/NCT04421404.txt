    
      A total of 50 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      convalescent fresh frozen plasma (frozen within 8 hours of collection) of PF24 (frozen within
      24 hours) from blood donors who have recovered from COVID-19 containing antibodies to
      SARS-CoV-2 or control (standard fresh frozen plasma collected prior to 12/1/2019 or with
      documented negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody). Should additional anti-COVID agents (anti-viral
      and/or anti-inflammatory) become available for use as standard of care during implementation,
      the sample size will be recalculated and increased to account for the estimated impact that
      these agents may have on the reducing the progression to the primary endpoint of severe
      hypoxemia.
