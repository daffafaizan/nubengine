      dense breast parenchyma. We have developed Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) - a new technique
      which utilizes a Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) gamma camera for scintimammography that has a
      high sensitivity (~90%) for the detection of breast cancers independent of breast density.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the utility of MBI as an adjunct screening modality
      for the detection of occult breast cancers in women with mammographically dense breast
      tissue. Initial recruitment will be from the pool of patients awaiting a screening mammogram
      in the Department of Radiology at Mayo Clinic Rochester. All patients will have a screening
      MMO and an MBI study. Patients with positive studies (MBI or MMO) will undergo additional
      diagnostic studies. At 15 months post-recruitment, all patients will be contacted by phone or
      mail to determine whether subsequent to their study, there has been any change in their
      breast status.
