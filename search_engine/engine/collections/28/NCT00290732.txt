      Primary

        -  Evaluate the feasibility, safety, and maximum tolerated dose of intraductal pegylated
           doxorubicin HCl liposome in women with invasive breast cancer awaiting mastectomy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of intraductal pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome,
           including serial plasma concentrations of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol and tissue
           concentrations in different portions of the breast at the time of surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive an intraductal injection of pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome* on day 1.
      Patients undergo mastectomy 2-4 weeks later.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome* until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      NOTE: *The first cohort of 3 patients receive intraductal dextrose only followed by surgery
      as a feasibility study. An additional 3 patients receiving intravenous PLD will be enrolled
      in a pharmacokinetic control portion of the study.
