      depressions. The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the careful screening of patients
      and healthy volunteers for participation in research protocols that examine the role of
      gonadal steroids in depressions occurring during the perimenopause and for the collection of
      natural history data. Women in this protocol will undergo an evaluation which may include: a
      psychiatric diagnostic interview; rating scales; a medical history; a physical exam; blood
      and urine laboratory evaluation; and a request for medical records. The data collected may
      also be linked with data from other perimenopausal depression protocols (e.g., DNA,
      psychophysiology tests, treatment studies, etc.) for the purposes of better understanding the
      diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment response of women with depression during the
      perimenopause. Upon conclusion of the screening process, participants will either be offered
      entry into a research protocol and will sign the appropriate informed consent, or will be
      considered not appropriate for participation in research and will be referred back into the
      community. The second purpose of this protocol is to permit the identification of
      premenopausal women who are followed longitudinally through the menopause transition in an
      effort to confirm the association of depression onset with change in reproductive endocrine
      function. This protocol, then, serves as a screening and evaluation protocol to recruit
      subjects who are characterized with standard measures in this protocol and then offered
      participation in related studies.
