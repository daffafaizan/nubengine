    
      Primary Objective:

      To determine if dose escalated IMRT for high risk localised prostate cancer can provide PSA
      relapse free survival similar to that reported by Memorial Sloan Kettering (Alicikus et al
      2011).

      Sub-Study 1 (Proteomic Analysis):

      To use proteomic analysis of sequential blood and urine samples to detect changes in profiles
      that may predict outcome and identify prognostic biochemical markers of early disease
      progression and/ or toxicity. The unique molecular signatures may also allow the
      identification of targets for therapeutic intervention.

      To undertake, where possible, other biochemical analyses including mRNA, miRNA and metabolite
      profiling.

      Sub-Study 2 (Raman spectroscopic analysis):

      To investigate a new approach to prediction of radiation response, based on biochemical
      fingerprinting

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Overall survival and disease-free survival rates.

        -  To evaluate the significance of published prognostic/ stratification factors such as the
           UCSF-CAPRA score and assess their application to the data from this study.

        -  To achieve the maximum dose escalation (up to 81Gy). This will be assessed as the
           percentage of patients that receive each dose level for all categories (dose increments
           of 1.8 Gy from 75.6 Gy up to max 81 Gy).

        -  The incidence and severity of acute and late GU, GI and erectile dysfunction toxicities
           will be described, and correlated with DVH parameters.
