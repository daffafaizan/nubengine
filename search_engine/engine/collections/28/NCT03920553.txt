      topical application of hyaluronic acid to the surgical field after frenectomy operation
      performed with laser, through evaluation of the amount of reduction of the wound site and
      postoperative pain levels.The study included a total of 40 patients who had maxillary high
      labial frenulum attachment and were planned to undergo frenectomy and met the study inclusion
      criteria. All the patients were informed about oral hygiene control and attention was paid
      that optimal oral hygiene was maintained throughout the study. Phase I periodontal treatment
      was applied to patients where necessary. The area measurements of the wound site formed after
      frenectomy was taken immediately after the frenectomy and on days 3, 7, and 21
      postoperatively. HA gel was applied topically after the frenectomy operation to the test
      group and not to the control group. All the surgical procedures were performed by the same
      surgeon.
