      of harvest, availability and versatility [1] Traditional harvesting of GSV is open vein
      harvesting, which involves an extended leg incision. This technique is associated with a
      significant morbidity and wound complications occur in 2-24% of cases.

      Minimally invasive techniques endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH), have therefore been developed
      to reduce post-CABG leg wound complications. Last time the endoscopic vein harvesting is the
      method of choice in many centers as it allowed reduction of post-surgical complications as
      compared to the open method. Although long-term graft patency following EVH has been
      questioned cohort studies have reported that the technique is safe and effective.

      The possibility to use lymphoscintigraphy for evaluation of lower limb lymphatic system after
      vein harvesting for the coronary artery bypass surgeries was reported before. Nevertheless,
      the state of the lymphatic system after vein harvesting remains to be poorly studied.

      Currently, there is no shared vision relating to integrity and quality of the conduit after
      the impact on the vein wall during vein harvesting. In this connection, the investigators
      studied the initial state of the venous conduit, interoperation damages of the vein and
      postoperative wound complications while using two methods of GSV harvesting.
