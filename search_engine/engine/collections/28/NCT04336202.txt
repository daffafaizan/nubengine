      endorectal brachytherapy using a new applicator. Validating the feasibility of this new
      applicator, assessing the treatment time required when using it, the necessary workload
      required and ultimately avoid the need for surgery are our main priorities. Currently, this
      option is still experimental, although several patients have been treated with this method
      during the last ten years.

      In this pilot study, 45 patients will be recruited, whom have medical conditions
      (co-morbidities) that make surgery very difficult, or patients that are refusing surgery.
