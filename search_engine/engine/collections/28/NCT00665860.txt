      women. However, there is no documented scientific evidence of its long-term safety and
      efficacy in preventing osteoporosis. Our primary goal is to determine the safety, efficacy,
      and optimal dosage of isoflavone supplementation to reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women.
      The multi-state, multi-institutional design ensures that the study results are representative
      of postmenopausal women in the U.S. population. Confirming the skeletal benefits of soy
      isoflavones could translate into reduced healthcare costs related to osteoporosis.
