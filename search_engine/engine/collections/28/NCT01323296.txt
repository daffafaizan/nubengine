    
      Using ferumoxtran (Feraheme) as a USPIO contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging at 3
      Tesla, we aim to conduct the first clinical study to examine the utility of this novel
      contrast agent to image myocardial inflammation after myocardial infarction.

      We will test the following hypotheses in patients who have suffered recent acute myocardial
      infarction.

        1. Intravenous injection of ferumoxytol accumulates at the site of myocardial infarction
           and this can be visualised by magnetic resonance imaging.

        2. The spatial extent of the MRI signal change evoked by ferumoxytol in the myocardium is
           proportional to the volume of infarcted myocardium (as assessed by a gadolinium
           late-enhancement study).

        3. Myocardial MRI signal change evoked by ferumoxytol is positively correlated with blood
           markers of systemic inflammation.
