    
      Each subject will be part of 8 different experimental diets, and randomly assigned to one of
      the diets every time.

      4 reference diet would be based on egg protein composition, 3 wheat diets would have protein
      from baked wheat bread and 1 mixed meal would comprise of baked wheat bread and lentils.

      Each experimental diet will be studied over 3 days: 2 adaptation and 1 study day. The 2
      adaptation meals would be consumed at home. On the study day 3, following a 12-h overnight
      fast, subjects will come to the research unit at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON
      for a period of 7.5 h and consume the diet as 9 hourly meals. The first 3 meals would be
      consumed at home.

      For the duration of all experiments, subjects will consume a daily multivitamin supplement to
      ensure adequate vitamin intake.

      Measurements:

        1. Resting energy expenditure (REE) will be measured by open-circuit indirect calorimetry

        2. Body composition (fat and fat free mass) will be measured by BIA and Skin Fold.

        3. Breath samples will be collected after the 4th and 7th meals.
