        1. Prior to starting surgery (Sample A)

        2. The middle intra-operative sample, which will be collected when half the tumour has been
           devascularized (i.e., somewhere midway during the surgery). (Sample B)

        3. A third post excision (anoxic sample C). These tumour tissue samples will be stored as
           snap frozen, in RNA later and as paraffin sections.

      To understand the effects induced by acute hypoxia that sets in during surgery in breast
      cancer. To study this, clinical samples (Tumor biopsies) will be obtained during and stored
      for future genomic and proteonomic evaluations.
