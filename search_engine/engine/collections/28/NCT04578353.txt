    
      This is a prospective, single-center, open label single arm study, conducted in two phases:
      up to 6 healthy subjects (Phase 1) and up to 10 chronic heart failure (CHF) patients (Phase
      2).

      After being informed about the study, requirements and potential risks, consenting patients
      will be enrolled and undergo 3 procedures (each procedure up to 3 (±1) hours operation), with
      4-10 days between each procedure.

      All patients will be followed up for 7 (±2) days from final procedure.
