      analgesic use in adults with chronic pain. ReLeaf-V is a 4-arm blinded randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) of 352 adults with (a) severe or chronic neuropathic or joint pain, (b) opioid
      analgesic use, and (c) active certification for medical cannabis. We will randomize
      participants to a discounted voucher for: 1) a placebo soft-gel capsule product, 2) high
      THC:low CBD soft-gel capsule product (4.3mg THC/0.7mg CBD), 3) equal THC:CBD soft-gel capsule
      product (2.5mg THC/2.5mg CBD), or 4) low THC:high CBD soft-gel capsule product (0.2mg
      THC/4.8mg CBD). Over 14 weeks, participants will have 5 research visits in which data will be
      collected from questionnaires, and medical and Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) records.
      The primary independent variable will be randomization arm, and the primary outcome will be
      cumulative opioid analgesic dose.
