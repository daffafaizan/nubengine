      body which are consist of eukaryotes, archaea, bacteria and viruses. Microbiome in an average
      human body number are ten times more than human cells and have about 1000 more genes than are
      present in the human genome. There are symbiotic relationships between human and microbiome.
      If investigators are able to know about relationships between newborn and intestinal
      microbiome, mortality and morbidity in preterm infants may be improved. The investigators
      will collect the first and weekly stool of participants and analyze DNA of microbiome
      thorough Metagenomic anlysis. The results between 3 groups(preterm, late preterm and
      full-term infants) will be compared. The investigators expect that a mean distribution of
      intestinal microbiome in newborns(preterm, late preterm and full-term) is defined and that
      relationships between mortality, morbidity and intestinal microbiome.
