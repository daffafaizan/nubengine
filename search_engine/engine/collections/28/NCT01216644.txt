      stomach or the esophagogastreal junction without previous therapy will be included in this
      study. After randomization patients receive perioperatively 4 cycles FLOT or 3 cycles ECF,
      followed by a restaging of the tumour status and surgery. Subsequently another 4 cycles of
      FLOT or 3 cycles ECF are applicated. Then a central validation of the pathological remission
      rate is scheduled. Primary endpoint is overall survival, secondary endpoints are disease free
      survival, perioperative morbidity and mortality, histopathologic regression rate and
      R0-resection rate.
