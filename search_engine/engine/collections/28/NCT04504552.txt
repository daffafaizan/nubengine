      transformation varying from 1% to 47% in different studies. Among molecular markers, the most
      effective in predicting oral cancer risk is loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which may appear in
      tissues with different histological grade of dysplasia. Patients carrying OPL with LOH at
      3p14 and/or 9p21 plus LOH at another locus have an expected 3-year risk of developing oral
      cancer of 35%. This chromosomal profile is found in about 28% of OPL. Moreover, when a
      patient has previously suffered from oral cavity cancer, the 3-year risk of malignant
      transformation for OPL with such a chromosomal profile reaches 69%. The presence of tumour
      suppressor genes (TSGs) at these chromosomal loci explains the potential for cancer
      development in the presence of such alterations.

      The clinical management of small OPL is excision by a cold knife or laser. However, treatment
      is not effective to prevent oral cancer in patients. Lesions recur frequently and transform
      subsequently, and tumours develop in the same or adjacent anatomical region. For larger OPL
      the clinical management is limited to lifelong surveillance. To improve clinical management
      of OPLs, the arsenal of treatments should be expanded.

      Therefore, this study is aimed at treating high-risk OPL with a short course of immunotherapy
      (avelumab)
