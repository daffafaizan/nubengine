      diagnoses. Prior to the frenectomy, the same investigator recorded the following parameters:
      plaque index (PLI), gingival index (GI), pocket probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level
      (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BOP). All of the clinical parameters were measured at six
      sites per tooth (mesio, mid, and distobuccal, and mesio, mid, and distopalatal) using a
      Williams periodontal probe (Nordent Manufacturing Inc., Elk Grove Village, IL, USA)
      calibrated in millimeters.

      The patients were instructed to record the postoperative degrees of pain, redness, swelling,
      and functional complications, including chewing and speech, on a 10 cm horizontal visual
      analog scale (VAS), by placing a vertical mark between the two endpoints, from the first
      through seventh days. The scale was graded from left to right with values ranging from "0"
      (no pain, functional complications, discomfort, swelling, or redness) to "10" (worst pain,
      extreme functional complications, extreme discomfort, extreme swelling, and extreme redness).
      The keratinized gingiva width (KGW), attached gingiva width (AGW), and attached gingiva
      thickness (AGT) were also recorded before the surgery. Postoperative analyses were performed
      at four separate times: immediately, at the first week, and at the first and third months
      after surgery. The patients in each group were also asked if they required anesthesia during
      the operation and analgesics after the operation.
