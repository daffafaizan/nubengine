    
      By the end of this study, the evaluated population will be composed of 144 participants: 36
      ataxic SCA3/MJD carriers, 72 at 50% risk of carrying the SCA3/MJD mutation and 36 healthy
      controls. Ataxic subjects are invited to participate if they have an established molecular
      diagnosis of SCA3/MJD and have a SARA score greater than 2.5 points. At risk subjects are
      composed by the offspring of molecularly diagnosed SCA3/MJD subjects that have a SARA<3.
      Healthy controls belonging either to families living with the disease or to the general
      population are invited to participate according to how well they match with ataxic subjects
      included in the study. Subjects are invited to participate in the study and, after
      constentment procedures, cognitive-affective assessments and a scale on Activities of Daily
      Living (ADL) are performed on a videocall. At risk subjects collect a blood sample for double
      bilnd determination of their carrier status. Before March 2020, all procedures were performed
      in person and, instead of ADL, SARA, SCAFI and CCFS were obtained.
