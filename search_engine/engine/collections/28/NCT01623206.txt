      published in the United Sates, and the third cause of death in the same population. Ninety
      percent (90%) of patients have symptoms at the time of diagnosis, being rectal bleeding the
      most frequent one (50% of cases). Bleeding, mainly mild or moderate, has no specific
      treatment, and during the staging of the disease, can not be controlled.

      Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, is a selective agonist of the receptor V2
      of vasopressin, inducing, among others, an haemostatic effect. Interestingly, the expression
      of this receptor has been described in human gastrointestinal tract, including colon and
      rectum and in colorectal tumors. Moreover, desmopressin has shown a significant antitumor
      activity in preclinical murine models of colorectal cancer.

      This is a dose finding study, to investigate a new indication of desmopressin as an
      haemostatic agent in patients with colorectal cancer with mild to moderate rectal bleeding.
