      unit. Muscle weakness was found in 70-100% patients with severe sepsis and septic shock
      because of critical-illness induced polyneuropathy and myopathy. Previous study revealed
      electric muscle stimulation (EMS) could reduce such muscle weakness and mechanical
      ventilator-dependent days.

      Hypothesis: different electricity may be needed for minimal contraction of upper or lower
      limb because of their muscle size. Induced muscle contraction may lead to myokine secretion
      and beneficial metabolic and anti-inflammatory effect. Stimulation on Quadriceps may be
      better than on Biceps.

      Participant: adult(older than 20 years-old) patients with severe sepsis.septic shock and
      acute respiratory failure post mechanical ventilation.

      Design: Stratified ( gender and age >50 years-old) Randomized parallel 3 arms study.

      Intervention: Daily stimulation of Biceps of Quadriceps after third days in intensive care
      unit. Programmed electric stimulation device ( HELEX 573 model, strength aggressive. mode,
      45-55Hz 32 minutes per day, voltage 30-70mA)
