      group) or initial quadriceps strengthening (quad group) for 4 weeks, prior to 4 weeks of a
      similar program of functional weight-bearing exercises. Self-reported pain, function, and
      functional strength were measured. Isometric strength was assessed for hip abductors,
      external rotators, and knee extensors. A mixed-model analysis of variance will be used to
      determine group differences over time.
