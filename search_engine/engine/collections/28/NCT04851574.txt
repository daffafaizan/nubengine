      sugammadex. Group I received dose of 0.5 Mg/kg, Group II - 1.0 Mg/kg and Group III received
      dose of 2 Mg/kg of sugammadex. General anesthesia was performed among all included patients
      at the same way. During general anesthesia monitoring of TOF - Train-of-four, was used to
      assess the muscle relaxation force of rocuronium as well as the reversal of neuromuscular
      blockade by sugammadex. For this purpose, 1.5 ml of blood samples taken 8 times, were
      collected to determine the PKPD of the tested drugs, according to own protocol.
