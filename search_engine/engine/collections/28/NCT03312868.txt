      decades. The role of radiotherapy in the curative treatment of this entity was defined in a
      major publication in the 1980s and has since been proven to be the best practice in several
      other comparative trials, mostly retrospective. The radiotherapy dose of curative intent has
      also been described over the same period and remains unchanged to this day. Thus, local
      control, disease cure rate, and rate and progression time for multiple myeloma have been
      unaffected for almost 30 years.

      Radiobiology of plasmacytoma cells is also not widely studied. The alpha / beta ratio, which
      defines the pattern of response of this disease to radiotherapy fractions and its response
      time, is also not well described. However, it is believed to be smaller in comparison to
      other hematological malignancies due to reports of cases of intrinsic radioresistance and
      late recurrence and reports of success with hypofractionated dose in isolated cases where
      stereotactic techniques were used such as base of skull and spine.
