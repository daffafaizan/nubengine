      It is a long-lasting illness that can make you feel pain, tired and emotionally upset. This
      can make it hard for children and teens to see friends and do the activities that they like.
      The goal of this project is to find out if the newly developed peer mentoring program called
      iPeer2Peer helps teens with arthritis take better care of their illness and feel more
      connected to other people with arthritis. The iPeer2Peer program matches teens with arthritis
      to an older mentor who has learned to manage their arthritis well and can support them
      emotionally and socially. This study will compare two groups of teens: those who are in the
      iPeer2Peer Program and those in the control group (no mentor).
