      because of the low incidence of mild, reversible neurotoxicity and absence of blood-related
      toxicity with low dose ddC therapy, a long-term Phase II/III study comparing ddC to AZT in
      patients with AIDS or advanced ARC is now warranted.

      After screening, physical examination and laboratory tests (within 14 days of entry) patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment groups. They receive either ddC plus an AZT placebo or
      AZT plus a ddC placebo. Because it is a blinded study, patients do not know which group they
      are in. Patients are evaluated weekly for the first 10 weeks and then biweekly thereafter.
