      health and many other important functions inside the body's cells. The kidneys are
      responsible for keeping the blood levels of phosphorus normal. Healthy kidneys do this by
      spilling excess phosphorus into the urine. In patients with chronic kidney disease, the
      kidneys are unable to spill an adequate amount of phosphorus so that excess phosphorus can
      accumulate in the walls of blood vessels leading to heart disease, their leading cause of
      death. A recently discovered hormone called FGF-23 helps control the blood levels of
      phosphorus by "telling" the kidney how much phosphorus to spill in the urine. The purpose of
      this study is to learn more about how FGF-23 helps the kidneys control the blood levels of
      phosphorus. The ultimate goal is to use this information to design improved treatment
      strategies for phosphorus-related problems for the millions of patients with chronic kidney
      disease.
