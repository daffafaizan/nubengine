      she will receive a non-invasive hemodynamic assessment via the NICaS system as per usual
      protocol. The NICaS system uses impedance cardiography which provides a reliable assessment
      of cardiovascular, respiratory, and fluid parameters. In typical practice, the vasodilator
      nifedipine is initiated for increased systemic vascular resistance and elevated cardiac
      output is treated with beta blockade (via either atenolol or labetalol). The medication to be
      given to each subject will be based on their hemodynamics. Specifically, nifedipine will be
      given for a mean arterial pressure >100 and a beta blocker will be given for a cardiac output
      >8 l/min. The patients will be asked to return in one week for repeat ICG measurement.
