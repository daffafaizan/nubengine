      cancer patients whose Chemotherapy could be adjusted.

      The study hypothesis is that Immunoscore Colon Test will modify the therapeutic decision in
      MM.

      With Alpha and Beta at 5% and p0=10% modification rate, the participating investigators need
      to include 280 participants, 140 in each cohort (stage II and stage III).

      Participants will have tumor samples from their curative surgery tested with Immunoscore
      Colon. When the patients are evaluated in MM, a first therapeutic decision will be taken
      before disclosing the test result. ICT result will then be communicated and a second decision
      will be taken.
