      consist of infertile women who receive a psychosexual caring program, and the control group
      will consist of infertile women who receive standard care. Standard care includes the
      information given by the nurse about the treatment methods to be applied once. A total of 4
      interviews will be held in the intervention group. In the first interviews, pre-test data
      will be taken. The psychosexual caring program will be conducted online as a group
      intervention. The psychosexual caring program includes interventions to promote body
      awareness, the meaning of sexuality, and marital relationships by gaining communication
      skills, sexual communication, body knowledge, information about sexual health, and its
      dimensions. After online interviews with groups, data will be collected for primary and
      secondary outcomes.
