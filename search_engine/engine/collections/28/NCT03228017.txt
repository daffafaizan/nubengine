      risk factors: smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension and obesity, account for 50% of
      CVD mortality between the ages of 45 - 79.1 These traditional cardiac risk factors dictate
      who to treat with primary prevention measures but do not take into account patient-specific
      disease states such as psoriatic disease including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, which
      predispose to chronic inflammation. Patients with psoriatic disease have an increased risk of
      atherosclerotic heart disease and myocardial infarctions compared to matched controls.
