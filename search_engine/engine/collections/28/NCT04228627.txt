      non-anaemic iron deficiency (ferritin less than 30 microgm/l) or NAID is likely to be more
      prevalent than this figure. It has been hypothesised that NAID in pregnancy can be linked to
      maternal fatigue and anaemia, and infant birth weight and growth restriction. The
      investigators will compare, in NAID, active intervention (therapeutic doses of parentral
      iron, as a directly observed complete therapy, to replenish iron stores) vs usual care
      (prophylactic oral iron supplementation) to prevent of maternal anaemia and fetal growth
      restriction in a multicentre randomised trial.
