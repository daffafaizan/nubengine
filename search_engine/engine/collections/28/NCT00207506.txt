      evaluation of HoMBReS: Hombres Manteniendo Bienestar y Relaciones Saludables (Men Maintaining
      Wellness and Healthy Relationships). Applying a community-based participatory research (CBPR)
      approach, this 3-year study uses a quasi-experimental delayed-intervention comparison group
      design to assess the feasibility of implementing and the potential efficacy of an adult
      soccer league-based lay health advisor intervention. The intervention is designed to: reduce
      sexual risk behaviors among Latino seasonal farmworkers; enhance access to sexually
      transmitted disease/HIV healthcare services; and develop effective data collection methods
      among Latino men.
