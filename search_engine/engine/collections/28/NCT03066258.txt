    
      This Phase I/IIa, open-label, multiple-cohort, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of RGX-314 gene therapy in subjects with previously treated nAMD.
      Five doses will be studied in approximately 42 subjects. Subjects who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and have an anatomic response to an initial anti VEGF injection
      will receive a single dose of RGX-314 administered by subretinal delivery. RGX-314 uses an
      AAV8 vector that contains a gene that encodes for a monoclonal antibody fragment which binds
      to and neutralizes VEGF activity. Safety will be the primary focus for the initial 24 weeks
      after RGX-314 administration (primary study period). Following completion of the primary
      study period, subjects will continue to be assessed until 104 weeks following treatment with
      RGX-314.
