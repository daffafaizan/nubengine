      diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies. Angiotensin II and aldosterone are the key players in
      the development of renal failure, either directly by promoting tissue fibrosis or indirectly
      through their action on glomerular hemodynamic and proteinuria. Therefore, pharmacological
      inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may have a beneficial impact on
      proteinuria and chronic kidney diseases progression. Recently, renin inhibitors, a new class
      of drugs that selectively inhibits angiotensin II formation at the first step of the RAAS
      cascade has been introduced to clinical practice. Aliskiren is the first orally bioavailable
      direct renin inhibitor approved for the treatment of hypertension. Blood pressure
      (BP)-lowering effect of aliskiren is associated with a decreased generation of angiotensin I,
      as it blocks its generation from angiotensinogen, by inhibiting the active enzymatic site of
      renin. The investigators plan this study to evaluate the short-term effects of treatment with
      aliskiren to those of placebo and ACEI perindopril on proteinuria.
