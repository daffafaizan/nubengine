      after laparoscopic surgery have suggested that the timing of local anesthetic administration
      may be critical in the success of the technique. A meta-analysis of randomized trials of
      intraperitoneal local anesthetic instillation in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery
      found that local anesthetic instilled before surgical dissection provided superior pain
      relief compared to instillation at the end of surgery. Intraperitoneal nebulization of local
      anesthetic is a novel approach to pain management after laparoscopic surgery. Recently,
      Alkhamesi et al reported that bupivacaine nebulization performed at the end of laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain. However, clinical benefits of
      preoperative administration of analgesia, compared with postoperative administration, remains
      controversial.

      The investigators hypothesized that pain relief after preoperative and postoperative
      ropivacaine nebulization would be similar but better than placebo.
