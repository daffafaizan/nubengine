      Patients will undergo a professional oral hygiene session (causal therapy) and will be
      instructed to perform proper oral hygiene manoeuvres at home.

      Next, subjects will be divided into three groups: after the causal therapy, the treatment of
      the pockets will be performed by probing, between 3 and 7 mm, with the test product, active
      comparator or placebo, with the aid of a dedicated sterile syringe. The application will be
      repeated after approx. 5 minutes.

      One bottle of the product (test, comparative or placebo) will then be given to the patient
      who will be instructed to use it 3 times a day, after meals and after normal oral hygiene
      procedures, for at least one week.

      The subjects will then be re-evaluated after 3 days and after a week. During these check-ups,
      new samples will be collected at the level of the initial sampling sites and will be
      reassessed on the basis of the selected clinical indices (in particular plaque, bleeding and
      probing depth).

      Patients with allergic reactions or hypersensitivity due to the use of the products will be
      advised to discontinue the use of the products and seek medical advice.
