      back pain relief, subject satisfaction, quality of life, physical functioning and safety.
      Chronic discogenic pain(CDP) suffering patients will be followed for 12 months with follow-up
      visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. In line with standard practice the system will be implanted in
      two stages. The first stage is the Trial Burst spinal cord Neurostimulation (TBNS) phase
      during which epidural leads are implanted and temporarily tunnelled to an external trial
      stimulation device. Subjects will then utilize the temporary system for a period in line with
      usual practice (typically 10-14 days). If, at the end of this TBNS phase a reduction of â‰¥50%
      is achieved the device will be permanently implanted (the second stage) and subjects will be
      followed-up during 12 months. Patients who do not have at least 50% pain relief during TBNS
      will receive a Trial Tonic Neurostimulator(TTNS) targeting the dorsal root ganglion(DRG).
      Similarly, these patients will be followed-up during 12 months.
