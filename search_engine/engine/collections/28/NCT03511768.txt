    
      18F-AlF-NOTA-octreotide is a radioligand targeting the somatostatin receptor, which is widely
      expressed on the cell surface of NENs. The radioligand can be used for the diagnosis and
      stage of the NENs. A total of 5 volunteers and 60 NEN patients will be subjected to a
      18F-AlF-NOTA-octreotide PET/CT scan. The uptake of 18F-AlF-NOTA-octreotide in organs and
      tumor lesions will be quantified as Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax/SUVmean).
