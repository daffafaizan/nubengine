    
      To ensure the PK measurements reflect everolimus exposure due to Absorb BVS only, the PK
      sub-study will not allow non-target lesion treatment.

      Blood Sampling Timing:

        -  Pre-Absorb BVS implantation: Baseline

           o Baseline is defined as prior to implantation of the first Absorb BVS; the blood sample
           will be drawn on the day of the index procedure either through a heparin lock, venous
           sheath, or venipuncture.

        -  Post-Absorb BVS implantation: 10 and 30 minutes, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, 6 hrs , 12 hrs, 24
           hrs (1 day), 48 hrs (2 days), 72 hrs (3 days), 96 hrs (4 days), 120 hrs (5 days), 168
           hrs (7 days), 336 hrs (14 days), and 720 hrs (30 days).

             -  Post-implantation blood samples will be drawn at the time intervals stated above;
                timing of the post-implantation sampling will begin when the last Absorb BVS is
                deployed, i.e. last Absorb BVS delivery catheter is removed from the body.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will include time to maximum concentration (tmax); maximum
      concentration (Cmax); AUC24h: Area under the blood analyte concentration vs. time curve from
      time 0 up to 24 hours post placement of the last Absorb BVS; AUClast: Area under the blood
      analyte concentration vs. time curve from time 0 up to the last quantifiable concentration;
      AUC 0-infinity: Area under the blood analyte concentration vs. time curve from time zero and
      extrapolated to infinite time; terminal elimination rate constant (Î»z); terminal elimination
      half-life (t1/2term); drug clearance (CL).
