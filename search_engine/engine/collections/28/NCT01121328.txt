      third of such infants are preterm [1] (UNICEF, 2001). In a study that Campbell et al. (2004)
      conducted in Egypt, the neonatal mortality rate was estimated to be 25 per 1000 live births.
      prematurity was considered the main cause of neonatal deaths (39%), followed by asphyxia
      (18%), infection (7%), especially in the late neonatal period, and congenital malformations
      (6%). A substantial proportion (29%) could not be classified [2]. In developing countries,
      prematurity was the main cause of early neonatal deaths (62%)[3] Autologous cord blood
      transfusion will be safe, and cheap. The preterm neonates need transfusion of whole blood or
      any of its components at a time during NICU admission.
