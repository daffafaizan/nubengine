      prostatectomy. However, more than half of these patients will remain free of PSA recurrence
      for more than 10 years. To the contrary, patients with early PSA recurrence and a doubling
      time less than 10 months have a mortality rate approaching 50% at 10 years despite hormone
      therapy. Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the standard treatment for
      patients with early and rapidly rising PSA after prostatectomy, this treatment is not
      curative on the long term for most patients. The recent demonstration of activity of Taxotere
      (docetaxel) in a high proportion of patients with advanced metastatic disease has stimulated
      a great interest in it use at an earlier stage of the disease. Recent studies performed in
      animal models of prostate cancer suggested that the response rate of prostate cancer cells to
      docetaxel-induced cell death was significantly enhanced by androgen stimulation in
      AR-positive, androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells (i.e. before ADT). Therefore, this
      protocol proposes to assess the response rate to primary Taxotere chemotherapy in patients
      with early and rapid PSA rising after prostatectomy for high risk disease.
