      activity levels, continuously for 4 days.

      Measurements will be taken at sea level (baseline), during controlled rest and normal
      day-to-day activities without exercise for the first 3 days to establish an individual's
      physiological baseline. On Day 4 subjects will be monitored for another period of controlled
      rest followed by 2 hours in a simulated altitude (intervention) chamber with an altitude
      change of 3000 meters. At the chamber site, the subject will rest quietly for 1 hour outside
      the chamber prior to entering the chamber for 2 hours. In the chamber, subjects will be asked
      to remain seated. At the completion of the chamber run, subjects will hand back the device
      and smartphone and complete a user experience survey. A follow-up phone call to check on
      subjects will then be done on day 5 before closing the study.
