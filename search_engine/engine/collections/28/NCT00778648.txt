      usually benign, it is a leading cause of absence from work and doctor visits, causing an
      enormous economic burden including lost productivity and treatment costs.

      Common cold is caused by a variety of viruses, with rhinoviruses and corona viruses as the
      most common. There is currently no treatment for common cold, thus therapy is focussed on
      symptom relief only. Prevention strategies for common cold include lifestyle measures such as
      avoiding infected people and regular hand washing during cold season. Dietary supplements
      including herbs and vitamins have been suggested as preventive strategies for common cold.

      Juice Plus+® is a dietary supplement composed primarily of juice powder concentrate and pulp
      from fruits and vegetables. It contains several antioxidants including vitamin C, vitamin E,
      beta-carotene and folate. One randomized study reported reduction in work days lost to
      illness in the Juice Plus+® group compared to the placebo group. However, the clinical
      benefit for preventing common cold symptoms has not yet been tested in a large adult
      population.
