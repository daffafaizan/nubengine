      preoperative education, improvement of anesthesia, reducing the number of drainage tubes, and
      early diet after surgery. In recent years, because of its positive advantages, ERAS was
      widely accepted in surgical fields.

      For upper gastrointestinal surgery, high-carbohydrate drinks can be given 2 hours before
      surgery in order to guarantee the stability of blood glucose and circulation during the
      operation. It obviously reduce the preoperative thirst, hunger, irritability and even the
      incidence of postoperative complications.

      However ERAS program is rarely studied in ERCP. Theoretically we can use ERAS as a strategy
      to reduce post-ERCP uncomfortable and complications.
