      interventions. The groups are: motivational interviewing (a counseling/coaching style), a
      web-based application for participants to keep track of their physical activity, a
      combination of the motivational interviewing and the web-based application, and an
      educational program on various issues related to Parkinson's Disease. The intervention will
      last 6 months with a follow-up appointment at 9 months. Participants will be asked to come to
      Galter Pavilion at Northwestern Memorial Hospital or Shirley Ryan AbilityLab a total of five
      times over the course of the nine months.
