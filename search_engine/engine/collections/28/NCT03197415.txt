      contributes to low back pain and degenerative disc diseases. Degeneration of the IVD induces
      anulus tears and fissures, which can cause severe discogenic low back pain. Because the IVD
      has little potential to self-regenerate, treatment of degenerative disc disease is one of the
      most challenging clinical problems facing the spine surgeon. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a
      fraction of plasma that contains platelets and multiple growth factors concentrated at high
      level. Because activated platelets have the potential to release growth factors, PRP has been
      clinically used to accelerate wound healing and tissue regeneration in orthopedic and oral
      surgery. The soluble releasate isolated from PRP has recently been demonstrated to influence
      the metabolism of intervertebral discs in vitro. Furthermore, an intradiscal injection of
      autologous PRP has been shown to induce restoration of structural changes in the rabbit
      annular injection model in vivo. This clinical trial aims to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of intradiscal PRP injection in patients with discogenic low back pain. The pre- and
      post-interventional imaging and clinical outcomes will be compared.
