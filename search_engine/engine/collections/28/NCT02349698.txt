      therapy is urgently required. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have
      demonstrated great successes in treating even late stage cluster of differentiation antigen
      19 (CD19) positive B cell malignancies. To design better CAR T cells, we have developed new
      CD19 CARs. Preclinical studies have demonstrated effective killing of CD19 target cells. In
      this study, the CD19 CARs, will be evaluated in CD19 positive leukemia/lymphoma patients. The
      primary goal is to confirm its adverse effects including cytokine storm response and any
      other adverse effects. In addition, tumor targeting and disease status after treatment will
      also be evaluated.
