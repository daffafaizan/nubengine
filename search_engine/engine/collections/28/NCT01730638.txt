    
      Variation of TF2 molar dose, IMP-288 molar dose and pretargeting interval will be performed
      in 4 to 5 cohorts of 3 patients, receiving 30 to 120 nmol of TF2 and 1.5 to 6 nmol of
      peptides 1 to 3 days apart. Blood samples will be obtained after TF2 and 68Ga-IMP-288
      injections.

      A last cohort (cohorte number 5 or 6) with optimal conditions will be proposed. Whole-body
      PET images will be recorded 60 and 120 minutes after 68Ga-IMP-288 injection to assess
      semi-quantitatively tumor targeting and tumor/background ratio. Moreover, the targeting
      sensitivity of the TF2-pretargeted 68Ga-IMP-288 will be compared to standard methods of
      tumor.

      some patient will have a second immuno-TEP for their follow up in the first examen was the
      most sensible.
