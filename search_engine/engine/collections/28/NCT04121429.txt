      decrease patients' morbidity. However, following ICU admission, such treatments are
      frequently interrupted and/or modified.

      Few studies have investigated the outcome impact of medications interruption and/or
      modifications following hospital admission. We did consider that it might be interesting to
      study whether treatment continuation, interruption, and/or re-introduction following ICU
      admission may modify patients' outcome either in the ICU or following hospital discharge (at
      3,6 and 12 months).
