        -  Compare survival of patients with relapsed ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cancer
           treated with paclitaxel and either carboplatin or cisplatin vs conventional
           platinum-based chemotherapy.

        -  Compare the quality of life and health economics of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive platinum-based chemotherapy (that is familiar to the oncologist
           and used routinely by the center) comprising either cisplatin or carboplatin alone or
           cisplatin in combination with other drugs.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by either carboplatin or
           cisplatin.

      Treatment for both arms continues every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed.

      Patients are followed at 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 800 patients will be accrued for this study.
