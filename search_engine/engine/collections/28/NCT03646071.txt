    
      This is a open-label, two-part study comprised of a dose escalation part and a dose expansion
      part. In the dose escalation part, RX108 will be administered in ascending doses to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of RX108 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The dose expansion part will assess the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of RX108 at the RP2D.
