      Cohorts A and B.

        -  Cohort A, will include Stage I to III TNBC patients with less than a complete pCR after
           neoadjuvant therapy who will be treated with capecitabine (1000mg/m2/BID; for 14 days
           every 21 days) as standard of care. This cohort will be used to determine baseline bone
           marrow disseminated tumor cells (BM DTC) response to capecitabine alone.

        -  Cohort B, will include patients with metastatic TNBC, HER2/neu-negative and hormone
           resistant breast cancer. A total of 4 doses of sarilumab will be given with the starting
           dose of 150 mg SQ at 3-weeks cycles given 3 days prior to each of the first 4 of 8
           cycles of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2/BID; for 14 days every 21 days). If dose escalation
           is possible, sarilumab will be administered every 3 weeks at 200 mg SQ for 4 doses.

      Phase II is a single arm study in Stage I to III TNBC with less than a complete pCR after
      neoadjuvant therapy evaluating the combination of sarilumab with capecitabine (1000mg/m2/BID;
      for 14 days every 21 days) as compared to historical control patients treated with
      capecitabine alone. There are 8 cycles of capecitabine. The first 4 cycles will be combined
      with sarilumab. The Phase II sarilumab dose will be determined by the Phase I best tolerated
      dose. In patients without bone marrow DTC clearance after 4 doses of sarilumab, 4 more doses
      of sarilumab will be given in combination with the last 4 cycles of capecitabine.
