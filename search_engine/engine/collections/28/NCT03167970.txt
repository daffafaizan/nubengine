      Barrett's esophagus scheduled for an upper EGD at Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Kansas
      City, MO, USA) for check-up of BE will be asked to swallow the pillcam prior to an EGD. A
      member of the research team will approach a potential subject to discuss participation in the
      study, including background of the proposed study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, benefits
      and risks of the procedures and follow-up. If this is of interest to the subject, the
      informed consent form is discussed and presented. The subject must sign the consent form
      prior to enrollment. This form will have prior approval of the study site's Institutional
      Review Board (IRB). Failure to obtain informed consent renders the subject ineligible for the
      study

      Eligible subjects at the participating institution who meet the inclusion criteria for this
      study will be offered the opportunity to participate in this clinical trial. To ensure that
      subjects are approached for potential study participation without bias, a Subject Screening
      Log will be maintained. This Log will track the basic demographic information of each subject
      approached for clinical trial inclusion and the resulting reason for exclusion from the
      clinical study if applicable.

      The duration of the study is expected to be approximately 12 months. Enrollment of Study
      patients will cease when approximately 20 patients have been enrolled.
