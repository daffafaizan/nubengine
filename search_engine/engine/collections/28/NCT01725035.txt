      (magnetic resonance imaging) measurement of liver lipid content to determine hepatic fat
      content. They will undergo a sugary drink (75 grams of glucose and 25 grams of fructose)
      challenge and Hepatic de novo lipogenesis will be determined as the incorporation of
      deuterium, from deuterium labeled water (D2O), into plasma triglycerides. Subjects will
      undergo a 6 hours study assessing de novo lipogenesis, an oral glucose tolerance test, dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging, and Euglycemic-Hyperinsulinemic
      Clamp.

      This study record has been re-opened in 2019 and updated to reflect any changes having
      remained open since its inception with the Yale University IRB and also having obtained
      additional funding though NIDDK.
