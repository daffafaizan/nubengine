      administration of intravenous omeprazole infusion stabilizes clots overlying arteries and
      hastens resolution of bleeding stigmata in peptic ulcer, and facilitates subsequent
      endoscopic examinations and reduces the need for endoscopic treatment. This may translates
      into clinical benefits in those who receive early intravenous omeprazole.

      Consecutive patients with overt signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding will be randomised
      to receive omeprazole or its equivalent placebo (80mg i.v. bolus followed by 8mg/hr) until
      next scheduled endoscopy. Patients with circulatory instability or fresh hematemesis will
      undergo endoscopic examinations urgently after initial stabilisation. The infusion will
      continue until endoscopic examination with or without therapy. Next scheduled endoscopy is
      performed within 24 hours from admission by experienced endoscopists with expertise in
      therapeutic endoscopy. At endoscopy, actively bleeding ulcers or ulcers with non-bleeding
      visible vessels are to be treated by endoscopic therapy. Omeprazole infusion 8mg/hr is to be
      continued for 72 hours after endoscopic hemostasis.

      Patients will be followed-up for 30 days from the time of admission or if patients stay
      longer than 30 days, the time to hospital discharge or death.
