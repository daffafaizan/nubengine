      prostatectomy (RALP) with the intention of identifying whether lower pressures might benefit
      participants. The investigators hypothesize that a low insufflation pressure may provide an
      improvement in postoperative pain and abdominal distension in addition to potential
      physiologic benefits, and that these factors might then allow a shorter hospital stay. The
      investigators previously initiated a protocol in September of 2016 (IRB# 1066864) to perform
      RALPs at an insufflation pressure of 6 mmHg with the intention of increasing the pressure as
      needed on an individual participant level. In order to determine whether this might allow
      earlier discharge when successful, the investigators began allowing for same-day discharge in
      participants meeting appropriate criteria. Having now demonstrated feasibility in over 300
      consecutive participants using this ultralow pneumoperitoneum protocol, the investigators now
      plan to conduct a randomized trial to compare a pressure of 6 mmHg with participants having
      RALP at a standard pressure of 15 mmHg to determine whether there is a true benefit.
