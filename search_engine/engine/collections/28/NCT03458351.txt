      patients with coronary artery disease or patients undergoing ablation for atrial
      fibrillation. Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass has been associated with platelet
      activation. In this randomized study, investigators are going to compare the effects of
      remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on platelet activation using flow cytometry in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
