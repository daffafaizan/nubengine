        -  Determine the efficacy of cyproterone acetate in patients with hot flashes following
           bilateral orchiectomy or medical castration for prostate cancer.

        -  Compare the effectiveness of two doses of cyproterone acetate in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the impact of this regimen on the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study.

      Patients receive one of two doses of oral cyproterone acetate or placebo for 12 weeks,
