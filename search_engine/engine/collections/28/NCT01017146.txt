      tazarotene foam with vehicle foam in subjects with acne vulgaris. Approximately 742 subjects
      will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of the 2 study product groups in a 1:1 ratio (tazarotene
      foam: vehicle foam). Subjects will apply tazarotene foam or vehicle foam to the entire face
      once daily for 12 weeks; study visits will occur at baseline (week 0/day 1) and at weeks 2,
      4, 8, and 12.
