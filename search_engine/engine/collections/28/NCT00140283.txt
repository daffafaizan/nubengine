      sessions discussing clinical cases plus the minimal intervention) reduces the professionals
      referral rate compared with the minimal intervention group (written adapted clinical practice
      guidelines and feedback about their referral rate compared with other primary care teams). It
      is a cluster-randomized controlled trial stratified by the percentage of reform and the
      referral rate. The subjects were primary care physicians of the 51 teams of Barcelona city
      attending 1.160.748 inhabitants.
