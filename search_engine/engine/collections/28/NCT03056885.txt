      causing lung injury. International guidelines have recommended for years the use of
      conventional ventilation (CV) with high tidal volume (VT) (8-10 ml\kg).A body of recent
      evidences have shown that conventional ventilation can reduce systemic oxygenation, increase
      inflammatory products and cause lung tissue damage. In this study we compare the conventional
      strategy , consisted of Vt 10 mL/kg, with the protective strategy, consisted of Vt 5 mL/kg.
      Both Vt were based on predicted body weight (PBW). Broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) are
      selectively performed in the dependent (ventilated) lung before and at the end of the OLV.
      The levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF) and anti-inflammatory (IL-2,
      IL-4, IL-10, INFγ) cytokines are evaluated. We also evaluate patients clinical outcomes in
      terms of incidence of postoperative respiratory complications and length of stay.
