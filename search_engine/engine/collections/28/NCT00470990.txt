      using the models of acute and chronic hypogonadism. All subjects will be in good general
      health and 2 groups of men will be studied in this protocol:

        1. Thirty healthy normal men aged 18-75 years with normal blood pressure, normal
           testosterone levels, and not taking any medications known to influence glucose
           homeostasis or testosterone

        2. Ten adult men (over the age of 18) with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
           (IHH)and normal thyroid, adrenal, and growth hormone axes as well as normal prolactin
           levels and no abnormalities on imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary region. These men
           will be on no medications known to influence glucose homeostasis and will have been off
           hormone therapy for a suitable washout period depending on the type of prior androgen
           replacement.
