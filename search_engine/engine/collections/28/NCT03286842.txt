    
      The study is a phase IIIb, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate the
      clinical effectiveness in a real-world setting of olaparib monotherapy in patients with
      confirmed germline or somatic breast cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA1/2 or sBRCA1/2)
      mutations. This study will generate additional data to support other olaparib studies, which
      may help inform and guide clinical practice. Physician defined the progression-free survival
      (PFS) for gBRCAm patients is the primary outcome measure. Based on the prevalence of gBRCA1/2
      mutations, it is estimated that up to 1400 patients may require screening in order to
      identify 250 gBRCA mutated patients and 20 sBRCA mutated patients. Patients will be
      administered two olaparib 150mg tablets in morning and evening of every day after a light
      meal. Dose reductions may be required for olaparib treatment related toxicities. Patients
      should continue to receive study treatment until documented physician-defined disease
      progression as assessed by the investigator (gBRCA mutated patients), RECIST1.1 disease
      progression (sBRCA mutated patients) or unacceptable toxicity, or for as long as they do not
      meet any other discontinuation criteria. A positive benefit/risk profile is expected and no
      ethical issues are identified from exposing patients to olaparib within the planned clinical
      study.
