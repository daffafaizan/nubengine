    
      Prospective analysis of cardiac CT angiographies enrolled over 1 month

      Collection of 1 axial data set and the "patient dose protocol" (including kV, mAs, CTDI, DLP,
      etc.) on a CD

      Dose estimation in dose/cm with the use of a method proposed by the European Working Group
      for Guidelines on Quality Criteria in CT.

      Assessment of diagnostic, qualitative image quality on a per-vessel basis by the
      participating study sites and in randomly selected cases by the primary study investigators
      (approximately 5-10% of patients to "spot check" interobserver variability of image quality
      assessments)

      Assessment of image quality with the use of quantitative parameters including image noise,
      signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios
