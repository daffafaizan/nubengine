    
      This is a dose-escalation study designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel
      or cabazitaxel when given in combination with clarithromycin. Eligible patients will be
      assigned to docetaxel or cabazitaxel, based on which drug they were previously administered
      prior to study entry. Enrollment to dose levels will be in a 3+3 cohort design until the
      maximum tolerated dose is achieved.

      Docetaxel or cabazitaxel will be administered on day 1 of each (3 week) cycle for a total of
      6 cycles. Subjects in both arms will be administered clarithromycin on days -1, 1 and 2 of
      each 3 week cycle.
