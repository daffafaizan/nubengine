      I. To examine the changes before and after non-radical surgical treatment (simple
      hysterectomy or cone biopsy [fertility preservation] and pelvic lymphadenectomy) on
      functional outcomes of bladder, bowel, and sexual function for stage IA1 (lymphatic vessel
      invasion positive [LVSI+]) and IA2-IB1 (=< 2 cm) carcinoma of the cervix.

      II. To evaluate incidence and severity of lymphedema after non-radical surgery (simple
      hysterectomy or cone biopsy [fertility preservation] and pelvic lymphadenectomy) for stage
      IA1 (LVSI+) and IA2-IB1 (=< 2 cm) carcinoma of the cervix.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate if non-radical surgery (simple hysterectomy or cone biopsy [fertility
      preservation] with pelvic lymphadenectomy) demonstrates greater physical function and less
      toxicity in comparison to historical data on radical surgery (radical hysterectomy or radical
      trachelectomy).

      II. To evaluate incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events, including
      surgical complications, among the entire cohort and by treatment type.

      III. To evaluate changes in quality of life (QOL) (Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Cervix [FACT-Cx]), cancer worries (Impact of Events Scale [IES]) and sexual (Female
      Sexual Function Index [FSFI])/reproductive concerns (RCS) among the entire cohort and by
      treatment type.

      IV. To explore relationships (correlation, interaction, independence) between functional
      outcomes (i.e., bladder function, bowel function, sexual function), adverse events (including
      and surgical complication lymphedema [Gynecologic Cancer Lymphedema Questionnaire (GCLQ)]),
      cancer worry (IES), surgical complications, and overall quality of life (FACT-Cx).

      V. To determine participants' intention for conception & fertility rates (Integrative Care
      for Fertility [ICF]) and assess the reproductive concerns (RCS) of women following cone
      biopsy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for stage IA1 (LVSI+) and IA2-IB1 (=< 2 cm) carcinoma of
      the cervix.

      VI. To estimate the efficacy of non-radical surgery (simple hysterectomy or cone biopsy
      [fertility preservation] and pelvic lymphadenectomy) for stage IA1 (LVSI+) and IA2-IB1 (=< 2
      cm) carcinoma of the cervix.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cone biopsy and pelvic lymphadenectomy or simple hysterectomy and pelvic
      lymphadenectomy.

      Patients complete the FACT-Cx, the IES, the FSFI, the GCLQ, and the Patient Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaires at baseline, 4-6 weeks after surgery,
      and then every 6 months for 3 years. Patients undergoing cone biopsy and pelvic
      lymphadenectomy also complete the ICF and RCS questionnaires.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.
