      randomized to standard of care in-hospital stay for one night or early discharge to a nearby
      hotel. During PCI, patients receive bivalirudin as their anti-coagulant and also must be
      eligible for an angioseal closure device. Patients that stay overnight in the hotel must be
      accompanied by a family member. They return to the cath lab the next day for groin check and
      blood work. Satisfaction questionnaires are filled out by all patients.
