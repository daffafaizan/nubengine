      identify and interpret the nutritional needs of the target population and thus implement the
      quality of life and the nutritional status of citizens through the evaluation of the dietary
      habits, health status and lifestyle of the elderly free-living.

      The information is collected through a questionnaire consisting of 6 sections and includes
      batteries of questions and scales already validated in the literature: i) access to the
      points of sale; ii) consumer behavior; iii) eating habits; iv) opinions regarding
      accessibility; v) state of health, physical activity and sleep quality; vi) other
      socio-demographic information. The collected data will allow to identify different profiles
      of elderly people with respect to the investigated dimensions and to estimate the influence
      of different factors on eating habits and health status.

      parameters are detected which are useful to complete the nutritional assessment of the target

      circumferences, plicometry are measured, and the antripometric indices waist-height
      circumference ratio, waist-hip circumference ratio and arm muscle area are calculated.
