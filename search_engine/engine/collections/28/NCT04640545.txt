        1. The dose escalation phase of LBL-007 combined with Toripalimab:

           The dose escalation follows the"rolling six design" method. These subjects will be
           treated with LBL-007 and Toripalimab. LBL-007 will be administered intravenously every
           two weeks (Q2W) at doses of Dose A, Dose B, Dose C.Toripalimab will be administered by
           IV (Q2W) by the fixed dose of 3mg/kg . Subjects will be treated with LBL-007 and
           Toripalimab for 28 days as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period . After
           all subjects in each dose group have completed the DLT evaluation, a safety monitoring
           committee (SMC) meeting will be held, and the SMC will determine whether it can continue
           to to escalate the next dose group or or reduce to Lower dose group or add more subjects
           in the current dose group .

        2. Expansion phase of LBL-007 combined with Toripalimab:

      After all subjects in a certain dose group have completed the DLT evaluation in the combined
      dose escalation phase, the investigator and the sponsor will determine whether to expand in
      this dose group based on the tolerability and Initial effective results. It is expected that
      a total of about 1~3 expansion For the dose group, the target dose group should be expanded
      to at least 38 subjects (including the number of subjects in the dose escalation phase).
