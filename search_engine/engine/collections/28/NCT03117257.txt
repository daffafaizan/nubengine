      used inducing chemotherapy, cisplatin is the preferred drug for the same period chemotherapy,
      however, due to heavier gastrointestinal reactions caused by cisplatinï¼Œ direct damage to
      renal parenchymal and other adverse reactions often lead to anti-tumor therapy can not be
      smooth Carried out, resulting in treatment failure, thus affecting the survival of patients.
      Therefore, how to improve the efficacy of the same time to reduce adverse drug reactions, as
      a prominent problem. Lobaplatin as the third generation of platinum antitumor drugs,
      anti-cancer activity and cisplatin rather, more than carboplatin. In this study, Phase II
      clinical trials were performed. Patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma were randomly divided into experimental group and control group. The trial group
      was treated with docetaxel + lorosine-induced chemotherapy combined with lorplatin concurrent
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The control group was treated with TPF Cisplatin concurrent
      chemotherapy, observed and compared the efficacy and toxicity of the two treatment to assess
      its safety and patient tolerance.
