    
      Evaluation of the impact of implemented elements of the ERAS strategy on the results of
      surgical treatment of coronary artery disease in the aspect of:

        -  preoperative preparation (comprehensive information, premedication, hydration),

        -  haemodynamic stability (discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and
           angiotensin II receptor blockers immediately before surgery), optimal pre- and
           intraoperative fluid therapy,

        -  occurrence of respiratory complications (assessment of the duration of mechanical
           ventilation and passive oxygen therapy),

        -  demand for painkillers in the postoperative period, after introducing the preemptive
           strategy,

        -  incidence of postoperative delirium,

        -  time to recovery of the normal bowel function (nausea, vomiting),

        -  possibility of early mobilisation on the first day after surgery,

        -  patient's satisfaction with treatment assessed on the basis of a survey carried out on
           the day before leaving the hospital.
