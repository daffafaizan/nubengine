      with BI+TM (brief intervention + text messaging) vs. BI+HC (brief intervention + remote
      health coach) on reducing alcohol misuse and violent behaviors among youth while in the
      Emergency Department (ED); and, 2) Identify the most efficacious second-stage strategy
      post-ED visit for those who initially respond and for those who do not. Specifically, 700
      youth (ages 14-20) in the ED screening positive for alcohol use and violent behaviors will be
      randomly assigned to: BI+TM or BI+HC. After receiving the SafERteens BI in the ED, youth will
      complete weekly assessments over an 8 week period to tailor intervention content and measure
      mechanisms of change, with one month determination of participant response (e.g., binge
      drinking, violence). Responders in each arm will be re-randomized to continued condition
      (e.g., stay the course or maintenance), or reduced condition (e.g., stepped down).
      Non-responders will be re-randomized to continued condition (e.g., stay the course or
      maintenance), or intensified condition (e.g., stepped up). Follow-up assessments will take
      place at 4 and 8 months post-baseline.
