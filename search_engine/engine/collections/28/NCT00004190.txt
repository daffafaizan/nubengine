      patients with refractory metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (phase I portion of
      the study closed as of 7/5/00). II. Determine the objective tumor response rate to this
      combination regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation and efficacy study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8 immediately followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks. Patients achieving stable disease, partial response, or
      regressive disease continue with therapy. Patients achieving complete response for two
      consecutive evaluations receive an additional 2 courses of therapy. Phase I (closed as of
      7/5/00): Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Phase II: Patients
      receive the MTD of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin as in phase I. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-52 patients (12 patients to phase I (phase I closed as of
      7/5/00) and 20-40 to phase II) will be accrued for this study within approximately 11-28
      months.
