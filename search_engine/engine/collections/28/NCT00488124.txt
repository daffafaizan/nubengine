      specific indications. However, besides the benefit in approved indications, a benefit can
      also be achieved in other pathological conditions that lead to growth retardation. However,
      because of their relative low frequency and the long duration of GH studies in children, few
      data or only case reports on GH treatment are available in these conditions. Nevertheless,
      published data have suggested a benefit of GH treatment in children suffering from some of
      those diseases and pediatric endocrinologists sometimes request GH treatment for those
      children to improve growth rate. This protocol is designed to allow such children with severe
      growth retardation to be treated with GH and will allow those children to be carefully
      followed-up and finally evaluated at the end of the GH treatment period.
