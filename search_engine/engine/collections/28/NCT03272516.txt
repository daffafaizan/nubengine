      primary care setting. These patients are often treated with antidepressant or anxiolytic
      medication instead of cognitive therapy, which is the first choice of treatment according to
      clinical guidelines in Iceland. Although these patients are often referred to cognitive
      therapy, there are long waiting lists for group therapy and personal therapy is expensive.
      MBCT has been shown to have good effects on people with recurrent depression and on patients
      suffering from anxiety. Therefore, the investigators main objective is to assess whether MBCT
      is effective in the primary care setting for patients with mild symptoms of anxiety and
      depression and compare its effect to TAU.
