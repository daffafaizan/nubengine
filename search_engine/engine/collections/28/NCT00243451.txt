      over a three-year span to establish the presence of MCI, evaluate progression of disease, and
      determine the validity of this method in detecting early MCI. Specifically, we predict that
      by using our Cognitive Decline Index (CDI) method of objective examination of FDG PET brain
      images from patients diagnosed with MCI or mild AD, we can accurately discriminate very early
      abnormalities in cerebral metabolism, and that this research method can be validated and
      translated into a clinically useful tool for the early detection of MCI. Our long-range goals
      are the development of methods and tools that enable the detection of pathology in individual
      patients at risk for cognitive impairment.
