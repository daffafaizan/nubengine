        -  Determine the efficacy of induction chemotherapy followed by autologous tumor cell
           vaccine and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with
           multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Autologous tumor cells are harvested. The vaccine is prepared in vitro by mixing
      autologous tumor cells with a bystander cell expressing sargramostim (GM-CSF). Patients
      receive induction chemotherapy followed by autologous tumor cell vaccination (ATCV) once.
      Patients then undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. At 6 weeks after
      transplantation, patients receive additional ATCVs every 3 weeks for a total of 8
      vaccinations.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
