      on patients with mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis (AD). All body areas were treatable
      except face, scalp, groin and genital areas. Cream applied BID between 6.00 and 10.00am and
      7.00 and 10.00pm daily for 4 weeks. Blood draws for PK analysis were taken weekly at the
      study centre prior to the morning cream application. Patients returned to the study centre
      approximately one week later for a follow-up visit.
