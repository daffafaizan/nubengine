      sacro-iliac joints. SpA can have functional consequences, often assessed with the Bath
      Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), the Dougados functional index, or more
      globally with the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Global (BAS-G). If these questionnaires are
      validated in English, there are not validated in French. The aim is to do a french linguistic
      validation of these questionnaires.

      A translation, reconciliation and retro-translation will be conducted for each of the
      questionnaires by two bilingual translators. The last version of each questionnaire will be
      then validated by clinicians experts in SpA. The version will be further validated by 5
      patients. If necessary and if changes occured on the version of the questionnaire, another
      version will be validated by 5 other patients until full understanding is obtained.
