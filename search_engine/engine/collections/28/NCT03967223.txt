      that have been found in several tumor types. Clinical trials using adoptively transferred T
      cells directed against NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1a have shown objective responses. Letetresgene
      autoleucel (lete-cel, GSK3377794) is the first generation of NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell
      receptor engineered T cells. This is a master protocol investigating T-cell therapies. It
      will initially consist of a core protocol with two independent substudies investigating
      Letestresgene autoleucel in previously untreated (1L) Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A*02+
      participants with NY-ESO-1+ advanced (metastatic or unresectable) synovial sarcoma (SS) or
      myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) (Substudy 1) and Letestresgene autoleucel as second
      line or higher (2L+) treatment in HLA-A*02+ participants with NY-ESO-1+ advanced (metastatic
      or unresectable) SS or MRCLS who have progressed following treatment with anthracycline based
      chemotherapy (Substudy 2).
