    
      Study IPI-549-02 is a multi-national, prospective, randomized, active-control Phase II trial
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IPI 549 administered in combination with nivolumab
      compared to nivolumab monotherapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 160 checkpoint-na√Øve, advanced urothelial cancer patients
      who have progressed or recurred following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.
      Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive intravenous (IV) nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks
      (Q4W) in combination with oral (PO) IPI 549 40 mg once daily (QD) or IV nivolumab 480 mg Q4W
      in combination with placebo PO QD.

      Eligible patients who have confirmed progression of disease during treatment with nivolumab
      monotherapy may crossover to the combination treatment arm.
