      exercise, indicating protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in humans
      (pharmacological preconditioning). Dipyridamole increases the endogenous adenosine level by
      inhibition of the nucleoside transporter (ENT-1). Activation of the adenosine receptor
      protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We hypothesize that endogenous adenosine
      mediates the protective effect of dipyridamole against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore
      the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine will reduce the benefit of dipyridamole on forearm
      ischemia-reperfusion injury.
