      design, comparing ceramic (test group) and titanium (control group) implants, for the
      replacement of a single-tooth in the anterior maxilla.

      All patients were randomized and assigned to each of the study groups through a
      computer-generated randomization.

      Surgical and restorative procedures In the test group, a Tissue Level Ceramic monotype
      implant was placed (Straumann PURE Ceramic implants®; Institut Straumann, Basel, Switzerland)
      and in the control group a Tissue Level SLA Titanium implant (Straumann Standard Plus Narrow
      Neck CrossFit®; Institut Straumann, Basel, Switzerland). The length of the implants was 8, 10
      and 12 mm.

      The primary outcome was the Implant Crown Aesthetic Index (ICAI). It consists of nine
      sections: mesiodistal dimension of the crown, position of the incisal edge of the crown,
      labial convexity of the crown, color and translucency of the crown, crown surface, position
      of the gingival margin of the peri-implant mucosa, position of the interdental papilla,
      contour of the vestibular mucosa and color and surface of the vestibular mucosa. These
      sections were compared with the adjacent and contralateral tooth as a reference and assigned
      the following score: 0, excellent; 1 or 2 satisfactory; 3 or 4 moderate; 5 or more bad.
