      adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) or globoid cell leukodystrophy
      (GLD, or Krabbe disease). However, for patients with advanced or rapidly progressive disease,
      the morbidity and mortality with transplantation is unacceptably high. Unfortunately, there
      are no viable alternative therapeutic options for these patients; if transplantation is not
      performed the patients are sent home to die. Our group at Minnesota has developed a new
      protocol incorporating transplantation using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen
      designed to decrease toxicity associated with the transplant procedure. This regimen will
      make use of the drug clofarabine, which has lympholytic and immune suppressive properties
      without the neurologic toxicity observed in the related compound, fludarabine, commonly used
      for transplantation. In addition, several agents providing anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory
      properties will be used to assist in the stabilization of the disease processes. This revised
      transplant protocol will test the following: 1) the ability to achieve engraftment with the
      reduced intensity protocol, 2) the mortality associated with transplant by day 100, 3)
      patient outcomes, based on differential neurologic, neuropsychologic, imaging and biologic
      evaluations prior to transplantation and at designated points after transplantation (day 100,
      6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years). Additional biologic studies will include pharmacokinetics of
      clofarabine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), develop experience in kinetics of
      N-acetylcysteine, and evaluate biologic markers of oxidative status during transplantation.
      In addition, for patients undergoing lumbar puncture studies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will
      be requested for determinations of biologic parameters.
