      Phencyclidine is a non-competitive NMDA-antagonist, and it is assumed that the
      pharmacodynamic mechanism of action for ketamine is the same. Receptor binding studies shows
      that ketamine has affinity to many receptor types, including opioid mu and kappa receptors.
      Ketamine has only about 25 times lower affinity for kappa receptors than for the
      NMDA-receptor complex. Naloxone is a specific antagonist for opioid receptors and block both
      mu og kappa receptors. A dose of naloxone 10 times larger than required to block mu receptors
      is required to block kappa receptors. Experiments with naloxone suggest that ketamine is not
      a mu agonist, but experiments with sufficient large naloxone doses to block kappa receptors
      have not been carried out in humans.
