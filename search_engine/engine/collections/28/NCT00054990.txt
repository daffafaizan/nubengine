      excitability, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) control epilepsy by reducing cortical
      excitability. Serum blood levels presently represent the standard measure utilized to track
      the therapeutic effects of AEDs. However, peripheral blood levels do not always reflect brain
      levels, or provide direct information on cortical excitability. Transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that allows accurate measures of this
      parameter. The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that TMS measures of
      cortical excitability will correlate with serum blood levels of AEDs, and reflect clinical
      effects on cortical function directly in healthy volunteers. This information is crucial to
      reach the ultimate goal of developing a reliable quantitative measurement of central
      physiological effects of AEDs in epileptic patients.

      Study Population. 40 normal volunteers aged 18 to 55 years will be recruited for this study.

      Design. Subjects will be assigned to either of two groups, with each group receiving one of
      the following drugs; carbamazepine (CBZ), and lamotrigine (LTG). Measures of cortical
      excitability will be performed using TMS in various drug treatment phases: at baseline
      (before drug intake); during the AED induction period (once a day for the first 5 days),
      after 12 days of drug intake at the maximum dose during steady state; and 3, 7, and 14
      half-lives after, and finally three weeks after abrupt drug withdrawal. Blood sampling for
      drug levels will be performed at each TMS study.

      Outcome Measures. The primary outcome variables will be MEP size, measured from recruitment
      curves. MEP size difference from baseline will be compared to the serum drug level for each
      drug.
