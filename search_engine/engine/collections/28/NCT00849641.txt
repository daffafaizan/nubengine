    
      Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria and without exclusion criteria will be monitored by
      NIRS using InSpectraâ„¢ technology (Hutchinson, USA) for the first three days of their ICU
      hospitalization. Besides registration of the NIRS parameters (tissue hemoglobin saturation
      (StO2), total tissue hemoglobin (THI), dynamic test values by using occlusion testing)
      baseline characteristics (age, sex, SAPS II Score et.), disease relevant information
      (etiology of liver cirrhosis, cause of ICU hospitalization) and ICU data (catecholamine
      therapy, mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid therapy) will be recorded.
      Within the observation time, an indocyanin green-clearance measurement and further laboratory
      testing will be performed on a daily basis. Data will be pseudonymized and kept confidential
      according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee.
