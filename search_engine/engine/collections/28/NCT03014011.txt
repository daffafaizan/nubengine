      including a significant negative impact on quality of life. Further, repeated minor
      hypoglycaemias may result in significant productivity losses. In healthy subjects a number of
      studies show that during a hypoglycaemic episode with plasma levels of 2.2 - 2.5 mmol/L
      (40-45 mg/dl) brain areas responsible for cognition have an altered neuronal function when
      measuring cerebral blood flow. This is accompanied by severely impaired cognitive function
      with a reduced ability to solve simple cognitive tasks. At higher levels of glucose (above 3
      mmol/L (54 mg/dl)), it remains to be settled whether cognitive functions are also affected
      negatively and whether this may be accompanied by changes in brain metabolism. Apart from
      raising the blood glucose directly or indirectly via glucagon, no treatment for hypoglycaemia
      exists, but since Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) based therapies used in type 2 diabetes may
      affect brain glucose consumption, therapeutic interventions to prevent negative results of
      hypoglycaemia may eventually become clinically possible.

      Here, the investigators propose to provide quantitative results on cognition during an acute
      mild hypoglycaemic episode (target plasma glucose 3 mmol/L). Data will be provided on
      executive function, attention and memory.
