      airway management among critically ill emergency department (ED) patients requiring
      intubation. Adequate preoxygenation is intended to prolong the safe apnoeic period. Optimal
      preoxygenation for ED patient undergoing RSI is best described as a two-part process of
      denitrogenation of the functional residual capacity (FRC) and the formation of an oxygen
      reservoir within the alveoli. End-tidal O2 (EtO2) has been shown to be a reliable surrogate
      marker for denitrogenation. Most of the literature supporting EtO2 as an adequate maker of
      adequate preoxygenation has been conducted in the operating room setting. This population
      varies significantly from the population requiring endotracheal intubation in the ED. Our
      study aim was to show that the use of a gas analyzer measuring the fraction of inspired
      oxygen (FiO2) and EtO2 during the preoxygenation phase of ED RSI can reliably predict the
      minimal PaO2 at the end of the ED preoxygenation period.
