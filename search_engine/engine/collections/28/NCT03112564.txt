      Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda, in Madrid, Spain, with the previous approval by
      the institutional clinical research ethics committee. A total of 91 subjects who underwent
      general, gastrointestinal, orthopedic, urology and neurological surgery were randomly
      selected and provided written informed consent before any study-related procedures were
      performed.

      The aim of this study was to identify complications and evaluate the efficacy of pure
      inhalational anesthesia induction to achieve endotracheal intubation without the use of
      muscle relaxant and analgesic drugs.
