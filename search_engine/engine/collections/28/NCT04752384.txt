      /week) in conjunction with oral tramadol (50mg-400mg) as needed for breakthrough pain would
      lead to significant reduction in mucositis-related pain in locally advanced head and neck
      cancer patients being treated with radiation therapy by the end of treatment and follow up
      period of 12 weeks.

      This is a single-arm, interventional, supportive care clinical trial for head and neck cancer
      patients evaluating role of transdermal (TD) buprenorphine and tramadol combination in
      alleviating radiation-induced mucositis pain. This will generate preliminary data to test the
      feasibility and efficacy of study drug regimen. The study will also test the clinical
      usefulness of the smart phone pain app in recording and reporting radiation induced mucositis
      pain.
