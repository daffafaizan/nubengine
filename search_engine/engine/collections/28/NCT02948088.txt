    
      GCT is a rare, benign, but potentially locally aggressive and recurrent disease. Treatment
      pattern and treatment initiation, continuation or changes are solely at the discretion of the
      physician and the patient.

      There will be no attempt to influence the prescribing patterns of any individual treating
      physician. All medication will be prescribed in the usual standard of care and will not be
      provided by the study sponsor.

      Participation in the study will in no way influence payment or reimbursement for any
      treatment received by patients during the study.

      It is the responsibility of the investigator and his study staff to enter all relevant
      patient data required for this registry in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and in the
      patients' medical records.

      Approximately 15 sites from up to 6 European Countries (France, Germany, Italy, The
      Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom) and 4 sites from the US are planned to participate.
      The sites will be specialized sites that treat diffuse TGCT regularly.
