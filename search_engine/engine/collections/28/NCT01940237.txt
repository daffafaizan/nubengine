    
      Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a brief, manualized therapy that has shown efficacy in
      the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in several controlled trials. This study
      will test the efficacy of IPT in a group of prostate, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer
      patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.

      We will test the efficacy of IPT using a variety of outcome measures at different time points
      of the treatment. Those scales will evaluate the patient's depressive symptoms, psychosocial
      functioning and quality of life. Patients that are deemed eligible for the study will have
      IPT for twelve weeks. Patients will receive twelve 50-minute sessions over 16 weeks. To
      facilitate access to treatment, sessions 1,2,3,4, 8 and 12 will be in person, while all
      others will in be person or over the telephone according to the patient's choice. Sessions
      will be audiotaped and periodically reviewed by experienced supervisors to assess therapist's
      adherence to IPT technique. This taping will be optional and is covered in a separate consent
      form. This pilot study is to prove feasibility and acceptability of IPT in this population
      and to show preliminary efficacy.
