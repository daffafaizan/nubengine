      Project Health that addresses dietary intake and exercise to reduce eating disorder symptoms,
      BMI, body dissatisfaction, negative affect, dietary intake, emotional eating, substance use,
      sociocultural pressures to be thin, food cravings, and impulsivity at post-intervention and
      increase levels of cognitive dissonance about engaging in behaviors that produce obesity and
      a sedentary lifestyle. To address this aim, the research will involve a randomized control
      trial that will employ a longitudinal experimental design that will involve: (a)
      phone-screener (pre-screener); (b) baseline appointment consisting of a pre-intervention
      assessment (eligibility); (c) 6-week intervention (randomized to Project Health or Video
      Control); (d) 3-month follow-up.
