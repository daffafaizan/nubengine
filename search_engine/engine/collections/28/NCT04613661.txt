      stretch reflex due to upper motor neuron lesion. The prevalence of post-stroke spasticity is
      between 17-40%. In the assessment of spasticity, although biomechanical and
      neurophysiological methods provide quantitative data, semi-quantitative methods are mostly
      used clinically. The most frequently used spasticity measures are the Modified Ashworth Scale
      and the Modified Tardieu Scale. However, these methods have significant disadvantages.
      Therefore, the search for more reliable clinical measures continues. One of the newly
      developed clinical scales is called the Australian Spasticity Assessment Scale (ASAS).
      Although ASAS has been reported to have a high level of reliability in children with cerebral
      palsy, the same has not been detected in adult patients with acquired brain damage. The low
      number of patients and the heterogeneous study population have been reported as two of the
      important limitations in the reliability study of this measure.

      In this study, researchers aim to investigate the inter-rater reliability of the ASAS in a
      study population consisting of a larger and more homogeneous patient population (those with
      post-stroke spasticity).
