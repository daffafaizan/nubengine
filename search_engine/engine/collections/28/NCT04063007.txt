      internationally established treatment option in children with drug resistant epilepsy. About
      40 -70 % of children with drug resistant epilepsy treated with the ketogenic diet achieve >
      50 % seizure reduction. However, even though the ketogenic diet has been used in the
      treatment of epilepsy for almost a Century, little is known about how the dietary treatment
      reduces seizures and which patients that will respond well. In addition, there is limited
      knowledge about potential adverse effects of the treatment. This is a prospective study
      following the patients from 4 weeks before initiating the ketogenic diet and during the
      treatment. The influence of the dietary treatment on the gut microbiota, epigenetics, quality
      of life, and adverse effects will be investigated.
