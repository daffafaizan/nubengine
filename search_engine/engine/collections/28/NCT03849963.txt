      sensitivity and repeatability of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate and [2-13C]pyruvate in
      healthy human subjects (n =10 each). Each subject will be imaged twice using the same
      hyperpolarized substrate with an interval (<45min) between the injections to evaluate
      repeatability. Finally, eight subjects will be imaged with both hyperpolarized
      [1-13C]pyruvate and [2-13C]pyruvate for comparison.
