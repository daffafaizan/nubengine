    
      The purpose of this multi-center trial is to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG in improving the
      ongoing pregnancy (>20 weeks of gestation) rate in couples with unexplained secondary
      recurrent miscarriage, and; to characterize and compare pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      parameters for IVIG pre-conceptually and in the 1st and 2nd trimesters of pregnancy, so that
      an improved IVIG dosing strategy can be determined.
