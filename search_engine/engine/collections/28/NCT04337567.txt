      terms of safety and effectivity in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, elderly
      patients have been underrepresented in the previous studies. The number of older patients
      with atrial fibrillation is high and the number of who undergo an ablation procedure for
      atrial fibrillation increases steadily. This prospective randomized trial compares the
      effectivity (recurrency of atrial arrhythmias) and periprocedural characteristics of the two
      established ablation methods in patients who are 75 years or older.
