      BMI: 23.8 ± 0.6 kg/m2) to compare 400 kcal lunch meals varying in protein quality. Two
      separate comparisons were performed. The first comparison consisted of macronutrient and
      fiber-matched lunches which varied in protein quality: 24 g beef protein vs. 24 g soy
      protein. The second comparison matched serving size only: 1 serving of beef (24 g protein
      with 0 g fiber) vs. 1 serving of soy (14 g protein; 5 g fiber). For each treatment, the
      participants completed 2 testing days per lunch treatment. During the "Appetite Assessment
      Days," each participant reported to the lab to consume one of the lunch meals. Pre and 7-h
      post-lunch appetite and cravings questionnaires were completed throughout each testing day
      along with plasma, hormonal responses, and plasma amino acid concentrations through repeated
      blood sampling. Ad libitum dinner energy intake was also measured. During the "Reward
      Assessment Days," the participants reported to our facility to again consume one of the lunch
      meals. Pre and post-lunch neural responses to food stimuli, through functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), occurred followed by ad libitum consumption of a lunch dessert.
