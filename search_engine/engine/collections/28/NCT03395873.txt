      tolerability of Avelumab in combination with Decitabine in patients with untreated AML, who
      are unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Decitabine will be given 20mg/m2 IV day 1-5, every 28
      days. Avelumab will be given at 10mg/kg IV (initial dose) day 1, every 14 days. Using a
      standard 3x3 statistical design, protocol defined Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will be
      assessed. In expansion stage, we will perform an expansion cohort of 9 additional patients
      using the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) established in the Phase I portion.
