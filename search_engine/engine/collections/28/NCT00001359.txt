      Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD) and tic disorders from recurring in children with

      Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS).

      A subgroup of children with childhood-onset OCD and/or tic disorders share a common clinical
      course characterized by dramatic onset and symptom exacerbations following scarlet fever or
      strep. throat infections. Such infections may be prevented by the prophylactic (preventative
      dose) administration of antibiotics, such as penicillin. This study will determine the
      effectiveness of penicillin prophylaxis in preventing relapses of OCD and/or tics in the
      PANDAS subgroup.

      Participants receive a comprehensive psychiatric, neurological and physical evaluation.
      Children will initially receive penicillin tablets, and then will be randomly assigned to
      receive either penicillin or placebo tablets for 6 months. Children will be monitored monthly
      by either in-person visits or a telephone interview. Any child who has a significant increase
      in his or her OCD or tics is taken off the randomized medication and put on open-label
      penicillin for the rest of the study.
