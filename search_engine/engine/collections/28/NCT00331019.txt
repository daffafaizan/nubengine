      newborns, nearly all of which are acquired by vertical transmission at the time of
      childbirth. Most cases can be prevented by identifying women who are colonized with GBS in
      the vaginal-rectal area and giving these colonized women prophylactic antibiotics in labor.
      About 15 -20% of women are colonized and nearly all of these women are asymptomatic. Because
      it takes up to 48 hours to obtain culture results, it is currently recommended to perform
      cultures in the clinic about 3 - 5 weeks prior to their due date and then prophylaxing those
      women colonized with GBS with antibiotics when they come in to labor. There are several
      downsides to this strategy. All women who present with preterm labor are treated until
      culture results become available (overtreatment), women who go into labor while waiting for
      culture results are all treated (overtreatment), prior studies have shown 33% of women are
      positive at 35 weeks, but negative at birth (overtreatment) and 10% are negative at 35 weeks
      and positive at birth (undertreatment), lost or missing culture results (over- or
      undertreatment). Using microfluidics and fluorescent PCR, a new test can identify GBS
      reliably in 30 to 45 minutes in vitro. This study proposes to evaluate the clinical
      performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value) of the
      microfluidic rapid GBS technique in selected women presenting at 35 - 37 weeks to antenatal
      clinics at the University of Michigan compared to standard culture.
