      sham devices for self-application at home in addition to standard care. Patients will be
      invited to up to 5 visits at the clinic: baseline (before surgery), post-operative day 1, and
      1, 3, and optionally 6 months after surgery. Evaluations will include physical examination,
      physical activity tests, range of motion measurements, Constant score, thermal imaging, and
      patient reported outcomes including subjective pain level by visual analogue scale,
      functional and quality of life questionnaires.

      The study hypothesis is that B-Cure laser treatments, applied, at home, by the patient, can
      reduce pain and accelerate healing over standard care thereby improving the rehabilitation
      process following rotator cuff arthroscopic surgery.
