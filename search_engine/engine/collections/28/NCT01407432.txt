      multicentric randomized controlled double-blind study comparing 2 parallel groups of 184
      patients. In each group: folic acid 15mg/day versus placebo, orally for at least 3 months
      (duration of a cycle of spermatogenesis). This assay will evaluate the effectiveness of
      treatment with folic acid compared to its placebo in infertile men with the outcome of
      IVF+/-ICSI techniques (pregnancy rate). It will also assess the impact of folate therapy on
      sperm parameters, and further, the impact on abnormal sperm DNA methylation profiles.
