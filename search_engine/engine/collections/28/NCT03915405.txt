    
      This is a two-part (dose-escalation, dose-expansion), multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study
      of KHK2455 in combination with avelumab in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic
      urothelial carcinoma (including bladder, urethra, ureters, and renal pelvis). Subjects will
      be screened for entry into this study after signing informed consent. Subjects must meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria to participate in this study.

        -  Part 1 (dose-escalation phase) has a modified 3+3 design that will evaluate the safety
           and tolerability and identify the MTD or highest protocol-defined dose, in the absence
           of exceeding the MTD.

        -  Part 2 (cohort-expansion phase) will further explore the safety, pharmacokinetics,
           pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity for the combination regimen at the MTD or
           highest dose level tested.
