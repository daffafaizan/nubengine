      schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, 10-15% of individuals in the general population report
      experiencing paranoid thoughts on a regular basis. These individuals who are high in
      sub-clinical paranoia can show impaired work and social functioning as compared to
      individuals low in sub-clinical paranoia. The wide spread prevalence and negative functional
      impact of heightened paranoia reinforces the need to develop interventions that may help to
      reduce problematic patterns of paranoid thinking in both healthy individuals and those with
      mental illness.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive neurostimulation
      which has been proposed as a therapeutic procedure in numerous psychiatric conditions. TDCS
      therefore may be a promising therapeutic technique for reducing symptoms of psychosis, and
      specifically paranoia. This study will compare experiences of paranoid ideation in
      individuals who are high in sub-clinical paranoia across two conditions: active anodal tDCS
      and sham tDCS.
