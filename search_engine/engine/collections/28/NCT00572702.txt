      function of different compartments of the female pelvic floor was achieved. The obtained
      informations were quickly implemented in the clinical practice especially in the application
      of special meshes and of novel techniques of their implantation. Their success rate was
      evaluated only in pilot companies supported studies. We do miss randomised studies not
      sponsored by company comparing different surgical techniques and their impact on the quality
      of life (QoL); the objective estimation of those consequences is for the longlasting effect
      of the surgery inevitable. The new methods bring also new complications which were not yet
      relevantly and objectively documented.

      In the study we compare the techniques contemporary used - in the groups with or without
      mesh, in size relevant for the statistical evaluation
