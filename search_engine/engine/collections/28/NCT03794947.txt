      cognitive or emotional, and presents a large barrier to progressing rehabilitation.

      Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a procedure whereby ischaemia is induced to a limb for
      short periods of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms or legs to above systolic
      pressures (mmHg). This procedure is performed for periods that avoid physical injury to the
      limbs, but induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. Such changes often
      result in improved collateralisation of blood supply to various areas of the body, as well as
      improved efficiencies of cellular metabolism. This may enhance the physical abilities of
      patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke, particularly when aiming to improve
      endurance and fatigue.
