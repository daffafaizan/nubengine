    
      This is a registry study to define the status of lipid lowering therapy in Taiwan and the
      effect of LLT on CVD morbidity and mortality in a large population of patients receiving
      primary or secondary prevention therapy. The medications will only depend on the decision
      made by the primary care physicians. The patient or physician can decide to be withdrawn from
      this registry at any time because of any reason.

      All potential patients will be screened for the eligibility in a screening visit. Those who
      fill the inclusion criteria at screening will be invited for the registry study into
      different groups. The follow-up will take place yearly thereafter for 5 years, through
      clinical visiting, phone follow-up, or records from the NHIB Taiwan. At each clinical visit,
      vital signs, clinical endpoints, adverse events, concurrent medication information and
      laboratory specimens will be obtained as complete as possible. With phone or records from
      NHIB, only clinical endpoints will be recorded. If the primary care physician intends to
      treat the patient's lipid profile to the target, he/she can add, delete or adjust the LLT by
      his/her clinical judgement.
