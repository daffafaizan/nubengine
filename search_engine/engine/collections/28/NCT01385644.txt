    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, single centre, non-randomized dose-escalation evaluation of
      the safety and feasibility of MSC treatment for subjects diagnosed with IPF. The first 4
      patients will receive a dose of 1 x 10^6 placenta-derived MSC/kg. An interim safety analysis
      will be carried out by the Data Safety Management Board (DSMB) when these first 4 patients
      have all undergone their 3 month study visit. Should no serious adverse events be documented
      due, or likely due, to the MSC infusion, a subsequent 4 patients will receive an IV infusion
      of 2 x 10^6 placenta-derived MSC/kg. Therefore a total of up to eight (8) subjects who meet
      all eligibility criteria and who provide written informed consent will be enrolled in the
      study.
