      the number of episodes of NLC is recorded. For further participation in the study, they must
      have at least 4 NLC episodes. Thereafter, an examination of compliance with the study
      requirements is performed and study subjects are randomized to one of the two groups: for a
      60-day of IP use (1 capsule of Magnox Comfort daily) or to the control group (1 capsule of
      placebo daily).
