      significantly improve the clinical management of urinary tract infection. We have previously
      developed a biochip based on microfabrication technology capable of rapid detection of
      pathogens. The specific objectives of the current proposal are: 1) Determination of microbial
      constituents in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients and development of additional
      species-specific probes against these pathogens; 2) Development of a rapid antibiotic
      susceptibility and molecular pyuria assay using the electrochemical biochip; and 3) Clinical
      validation of the biochip as a diagnostic test for urinary tract infection.

      Within a single protocol, two non-interventional studies were conducted at different time
      points to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Sensitivity and specificity of the
      electrochemical biosensor based assay was demonstrated in each study.
