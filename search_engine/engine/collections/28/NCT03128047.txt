      tolerability of the Optune NovoTTF-200A System in pediatric patients with recurrent
      high-grade glioma end ependemomas.

      Patients will receive treatment with the Optune NovoTTF-200A System along with Temozolomide
      and Bevacizumab and will consist of children with recurrent high-grade gliomas and
      Ependamomas. Patients enrolled will receive treatment with the Optune NovoTTF-200A with
      200kHz for a minimum of 18 hours per day in 28 day cycles as monotherapy. Phase I safety
      evaluation will take place over the initial two cycles (56 days) of treatment. Following the
      completion of the safety evaluation period, patients will continue to receive treatment in 28
      day cycles, which may be repeated continuously without therapy interruption for 12 cycles or
      until clinical criteria for discontinuation are met. Patients how appear to benefit from this
      treatment may be allowed to continue treatment beyond 12 cycles if approved by the study
      Principle Investigator.
