      volume vegetables (either added as a side item or mixed with the main entree) will be served
      for lunch, to determine the impact that presentation and liking may have on the consumption
      of energy dense foods.

      Once screened participants arrive for their first experimental session, they will record the
      foods and beverages they consumed in the past 24 hours, as well as write down the minutes of
      physical activity they participated in, within that same 24 hour period. The participants
      will rate their hunger, fullness, and liking of foods using a 100 mm VAS. After completing
      these forms, participants will be presented the appropriate meal, for their condition.
      Following the presentation of the meal, the participant will rate their liking of the meal
      appearance and then be instructed to eat as much or as little as they want of the meal
      provided in 20 minutes. At the completion of the allotted time, the meal will be removed, and
      the participant will evaluate their level of hunger, fullness, and liking of the foods
      consumed. The session will conclude with the collection of the hunger, fullness, and liking
      forms.
