        -  Compare the response rates and time to treatment failure in patients with relapsed or
           refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody anti-B1,
           followed by high-dose carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM), and
           autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) vs historical control
           patients treated with high-dose BEAM or carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and
           cyclophosphamide and APBSCT.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested and selected for CD34+
      cells or granulocyte macrophage colony-forming units. On day -19, patients receive unlabeled
      monoclonal antibody anti-B1 (MOAB anti-B1) IV followed by a dosimetric dose of iodine I 131
      MOAB anti-B1 IV over 20 minutes. On day -12, patients receive unlabeled MOAB anti-B1 IV
      followed by a therapeutic dose of iodine I 131 MOAB anti-B1 IV over 20 minutes. Patients then
      receive high-dose chemotherapy comprising carmustine IV on day -6, etoposide IV and
      cytarabine IV twice daily on days -5 to -2, and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo
      autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0.

      Patients are followed at days 30 and 100, at 6 months, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years.
