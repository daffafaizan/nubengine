    
      Schema-Focused (SF) Therapy is an extension of cognitive therapy that was developed to
      address the treatment needs of patients with long-standing mental disorders. SF therapy
      focuses on early maladaptive schemas (EMS): broad, pervasive themes regarding oneself and
      one's relationship with others, developed during childhood and elaborated throughout one's
      lifetime, which are dysfunctional to a significant degree. SF Therapy involves the
      identification of the particular EMS that is most relevant for each patient and attempts to
      modify the relevant schemas by altering the distorted views of self and others.

      Participants are assessed pretreatment, after 12 weeks, posttreatment, and 3 and 6 months
      posttreatment. The severity of depressive symptomatology is measured and a self-report Beck
      Depression Inventory is administered. At the end of the study and at the follow-up intervals,
      participants are given the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation, an instrument that
      assesses the severity of depression and dysthymia symptoms.
