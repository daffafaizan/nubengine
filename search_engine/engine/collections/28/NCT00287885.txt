      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of metronomic docetaxel in patients with
           progressive or recurrent gynecologic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics associated with this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes daily for up to 6 months in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
