    
      REVEAL is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel phase II clinical study
      that will evaluate the effects of erythropoietin administration on infarct size, left
      ventricular remodeling and circulating endothelial progenitor cells in patients with large
      myocardial infarctions (MI). The study will be conducted in two phases: a dose-escalation
      safety phase and a single dose efficacy phase. Eligible patients who present to the hospital
      with an acute ST-elevation MI and who agree to participate in this study will be randomly
      assigned to receive a single infusion of study medication consisting either of erythropoietin
      or placebo. The size of the infarction and the dimensions of the heart will be assessed by
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 2-6 days of the infusion of the study
      medication, and again approximately 3 months later.
