      drinking for several hours before the procedure. This is due to concerns that such patients
      are at risk of lung damage caused by stomach contents entering their lungs while they are
      asleep (aspiration of gastric contents).

      However, fasting patients for long periods of time can lower their ability to heal well and
      slow their recovery from surgery. Fasting increases anxiety levels and leads to poor patient
      satisfaction with the care received.

      Recent studies have showed that allowing patients to drink clear, easily absorbed sugar rich
      liquids (carbohydrate drinks) until two hours prior to their anaesthetic does not expose them
      to extra risks while preventing the deleterious effects of starvation.

      Carbohydrate drinks with a few other measures aimed at facilitating early recovery after
      surgeries are collectively termed Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). The benefits and
      safety of enhanced recovery have been demonstrated in patients undergoing major bowel surgery
      and have been widely adopted. However, so far, no studies have been conducted to determine if
      these results apply to mothers undergoing planned caesarean sections. We hope to address this
      gap in the knowledge with our proposed study.

      All mothers undergoing a planned caesarean section in the Princess Royal Maternity (PRM) will
      be invited to participate. Mothers will be divided into two groups. One group will receive
      standard care and the other group will receive a carbohydrate drink in addition to standard
      care. Information collected from the groups will be compared to evaluate the expected
      benefits and risks. The study will continue until the target sample size of 100 mothers in
      each of the two study groups is reached.
