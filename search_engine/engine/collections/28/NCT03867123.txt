    
      This is a Phase IB, open-label, dose-finding study. A de-escalation process has been selected
      for the study with a 3+3 design to establish the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).

      The first group of 3 subjects (within each arm), where all 3 subjects may be started at the
      same time, will receive 2-OHOA at the starting dose of 12 g/day (4 g tid). If 0-1
      Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in the first 3 patients, then a new cohort with 3 more
      patients is started at 12 g/day (4 g tid). If 2 or more patients out of 3 or 6 patients
      experience DLT(s) the dose is deescalated.

      De-escalation doses are from 12 g/day (4 g tid) to 8 g/day (4 g bid) and from 8 g/day (4 g
      bid) to 4 g/day (4 g od). This procedure must be applied to the two arms of the study
      described below. Both arms will be independent, and will run in parallel, therefore none of
      the patients from Arm 1 may enter Arm 2.
