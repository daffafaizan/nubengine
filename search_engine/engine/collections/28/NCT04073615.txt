    
      This a multicenter open-label study comparing safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      rivoceranib monotherapy, trifluridine/tipiracil monotherapy and the combination of
      rivoceranib plus trifluridine/tipiracil in subjects with mCRC. Subjects with histologically
      or cytologically definitive adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum who have progressed
      following standard of care therapy for colorectal cancer will be randomly assigned (1:1:2) to
      rivoceranib, trifluridine/tipiracil or rivoceranib plus trifluridine/tipiracil treatment
      groups.

      The study will consist of an initial phase 1b portion to assess the safety of and determine
      the RP2D of rivoceranib in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil. A subsequent phase 2
      portion will assess the primary endpoint of PFS by investigator assessment.
