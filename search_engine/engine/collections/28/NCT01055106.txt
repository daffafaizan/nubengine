      vaginal gel administered in 3 regimens compared to metronidazole 0.75% (QD x 5 days) for the
      treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Subjects will be evaluated at three timepoints (1
      screening/baseline visit, post-treatment phone call and 1 test-of-cure visit). The total
      study duration may be up to 30 days for a subject.

      Study medication will be applied intravaginally once daily at bedtime according to the
      assigned dosing schedule using the supplied 5-gram vaginal applicators.

      Investigator blinding will be ensured by utilizing an independent drug dispensing coordinator
      at each site.

      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection of the vagina (birth canal) that is the result of an
      overgrowth of bacteria that are often normally found in the vagina. This type of vaginal
      infection typically does not cause irritation. The most common complaint of patients who
      suffer from BV is a fishy-smelling vaginal discharge. The amount of vaginal discharge may or
      may not be increased above a normal discharge. The bad odor may get worse after sexual
      intercourse or during the menstrual period. BV is also strongly associated with problems
      during pregnancy, such as premature (early) birth, and with an increased risk of sexually
      transmitted diseases. Therefore, it is important to treat the infection.
