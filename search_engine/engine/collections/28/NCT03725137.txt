      elderly stroke patients, because of occupational obligations and often their role as a
      caregiver for a young family. For example, return to their former workplace may be impossible
      even if cognitive deficits, e.g., in the memory domain, are only "minor" according to
      standardized tests. Thus, cognitive function after stroke is of utmost importance for
      activities of daily life and quality of life in young stroke patients. In order to prevent or
      at least reduce post-stroke cognitive decline, the mechanisms underlying the decline need to
      be further elucidated, to eventually develop new preventive and therapeutic approaches.

      T-cell activation is associated with destruction of brain tissue. In neurodegenerative
      diseases that primarily impair cognitive functions, e. g., Alzheimers Disease, T-cells were
      identified as important mediators of disease pathology. Activation of cells of the adaptive
      immune system, most importantly T-cells, has been also investigated in experimental stroke.
      Here, these cells significantly contribute to secondary brain tissue damage. Stroke is
      associated with massive changes of the central and peripheral immune response. The
      investigators and other groups demonstrated that despite an overall lymphopenia, T-cells are
      functionally intact and pro-inflammatorily polarized, for at least two weeks post-stroke.
      Depletion of T cells has been shown to reduce infarct volume and to improve outcome in mice
      post-experimental stroke.
