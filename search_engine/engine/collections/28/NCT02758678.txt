      The investigators enrolled patients with lung cancer which divided on 3 group: 1- 23 patients
      with operating tumor; 2-ten patients with advanced and metastatic disease who received
      palliative RT (RT - radiotherapy); 3-five patients with advanced inoperable disease, who
      received radical RT or RT + CT (CT- chemotherapy).

      In 1 group the specimens of blood we collected before surgery and 1-2 month after. In 2 group
      - before palliative treatment and in group 3 before radical treatment and one month after
      completion treatment. To compare to serum specimens from patients with lung cancer was
      obtained plasma from healthy volunteers.

      Serum separation and Raman spectroscopy analysis:

      A single 2 ml heparinised peripheral blood sample was centrifuges to get serum specimens. The
      Raman spectra (RS) of the solid residues from serum samples were measurement by placing 10µl
      of serum from the aliquots onto an aluminium substrate and allowed to dry for at least 30
      min. The Raman system (Renishaw inVia Microscope integrated with Leica microscope) was
      calibrated with a silicon standard using the Raman peak at 520 cm-1. Multiple scans were
      conducted on the solid residue by moving the substrate on an X - Y stage. The wavelength of
      excitation was 785 nm and the laser beam was focused on the surface of the sample with a 50x
      objective. The radius on the beam was 3.0 µm and the laser power irradiation over the sample
      was 5mW. Each spectrum was taken with an exposure of 30s, 10 accumulation and collected in
      the region from 400 to 1540 cm-1.
