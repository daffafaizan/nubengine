    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels measured using cancer personalized
      profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) with radiographic tumor assessments using Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 criteria in patients with
      metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate PD-L1 assessment on pre-treatment tumor samples with objective response using
      RECIST v1.1 criteria in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with
      pembrolizumab.

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) using RECIST v1.1 criteria in patients with
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab.

      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST v1.1 in patients with
      metastatic non-squamous NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab.

      IV. To determine the overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC
      treated with pembrolizumab.

      V. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic
      non-squamous NSCLC.
