      Epidemiological data show that the signs and symptoms of TMD start to become apparent from
      six years of age, and in adolescence these signs and symptoms are similar to those of adults.
      The painful conditions of TMD can affect the quality of life of young patients, compromising
      the daily activities of these individuals. The present project aims (1) to estimate the
      direct costs of treatment of muscle pain in patients with TMD with low-intensity laser and
      with occlusal plate and a placebo group; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments
      with low-intensity laser and occlusal plate for muscle pain in patients with TMD; (3) to
      analyze the cost-effectiveness of the two proposed treatments for pain; and (4) to describe
      and compare the results of analyses of treatments for pain in patients with TMD. The study
      will be conducted at the Odontological Clinic of Universidade Nove de Julho. It is a
      prospective trial of clinical and economic analysis. It will include 30 patients aged between
      15 and 25 years with TMD, randomly assigned to a treatment group: G1 (low-power laser), G2
      (occlusal plate) and G3 (placebo). The analysis will be based on the direct costs of each
      treatment during the 12-month period, estimating the cost of each treatment. The outcome for
      the analysis of the effectiveness will be the pain, measured periodically by means of the
      clinical examination of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders
      (RDC/TMD). The cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated using, as endpoints, pain and the
      calculation of the ratio between the difference in costs between the groups studied. The
      evaluation of the impact of the treatment on quality of life will be determined by applying
      the adapted EuroQol-5D.
