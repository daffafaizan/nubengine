      approximately 232,000 diagnoses of adenocarcinoma projected for 2005. More than 150,000 of
      these men are treated with radical prostatectomy. Common sequelae following successful NSRRP
      (nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy)include urinary incontinence and sexual
      dysfunction. Recent advances in surgery technique and treatment have been made but in spite
      of aggressive management, recovery of sexual function is incomplete with fewer than one-fifth
      reporting return to baseline. The etiology of erectile dysfunction following radical
      prostatectomy results most probably from local surgical trauma and neurapraxia, which leads
      to corpus cavernosal hypoxemia in the post-NSRRP period. This hypoxemia is believed to impact
      negatively on the health and maintenance of the smooth muscle cells within the corpus
      cavernosum. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2T) is a unique modality that is able to provide
      oxygen delivery to tissues that have been damaged by traumatic injury.

      Hypothesis: The addition of post-NSRRP hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2T) to a treatment of
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5I) will reduce the incidence of erectile dysfunction
      (ED) and urinary incontinence when measured at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months post-NSRRP for Stage
      I prostate cancer.
