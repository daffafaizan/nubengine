    
      Eligible subjects received one of the following treatments during the preceding Phase IIb
      studies ALX0061-C201 and ALX0061-C202:

        -  Study ALX0061-C201:

             -  Placebo (+ methotrexate [MTX]), or

             -  ALX-0061 75 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) (+ MTX), or

             -  ALX-0061 150 mg q4w (+ MTX), or

             -  ALX-0061 150 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) (+ MTX), or

             -  ALX-0061 225 mg q2w (+ MTX), for 24 weeks

        -  Study ALX0061-C202:

             -  ALX-0061 150 mg q4w, or

             -  ALX-0061 150 mg q2w, or

             -  ALX-0061 225 mg q2w, for 12 weeks

      At the Week 24 (ALX0061-C201) or Week 12 (ALX0061-C202) visit of the previous study, informed
      consent was obtained from all subjects who were deemed potentially eligible for the OLE
      study, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This was marked as the Week 0 visit
      of the C203 study. Of note, the Baseline time point in the analyses of this study was defined
      the Baseline value of the parent study.

      In this OLE study, eligible subjects received ALX-0061 150 mg s.c. injections, beginning at
      Week 0 and every 2 weeks thereafter, up to and including Week 102. Eligible subjects from the
      preceding study ALX0061-C201 also continued their MTX treatment.

      Maintenance of the response (i.e., at least 20% improvement in both SJC and TJC compared to
      Baseline of the preceding study) was reassessed at the study visits at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48,
      60, 72, 84, and 96. Subjects who failed to maintain response and met the Efficacy
      Discontinuation Criteria were discontinued from this study.
