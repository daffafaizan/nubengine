      recurrent oligo-metastases in the brain must be reduced. However, reducing the dose of
      radiosurgery also compromises local control. There is mounting evidence of a local control
      benefit to a hypofractionated approach in radiation delivery for brain metastases compared
      with single fraction radiosurgery. Here we propose a novel therapeutic strategy that builds
      on this concept whereby time between each delivered fraction will enable us to measure and
      adapt to response, with the objective of reducing irradiated volumes and improving outcomes.
      In general, the treatment of malignant tumors benefits from fractionation of the dose due to
      a number of radiobiological properties (redistribution, reoxygenation, repair) that
      distinguish, and select against, malignant lesions in the fractionation process.
      Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) is a method of delivering a highly
      conformal dose distribution in a few treatment sessions using a relocatable stereotactic
      frame. HSRT may be an attractive alternative to SRS because it may 1) improve patient comfort
      by removing the invasive nature of SRS frames, 2) confer a radiobiologic advantage over
      single fraction treatment.
