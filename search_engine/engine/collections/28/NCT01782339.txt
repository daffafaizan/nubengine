      third day, the patient will receive an injection of pegfilgrastim. This stimulates the bone
      marrow to produce white blood cells and shortens the period of risk of serious infection. The
      treatment will be repeated every three weeks. This constitutes one cycle of treatment. We aim
      to give the patient four cycles of treatment over a total of twelve weeks.

      Before each cycle, the following will be conducted - physical examination, full blood count,
      urea + electrolytes, liver function tests, LDH, αFP, βHCG.

      Patients will have a FDG PET-CT scan at baseline, prior to cycle 2(approximately 1521 days
      after chemotherapy starts)and within 28 days of the last treatment, only if clinically
      indicated. On each cycle, serum creatinine should be measured 24 hours after the start of the
      methotrexate to exclude renal failure due to methotrexate.

      The following will be conducted at the end of treatment physical examination, full blood
      count, urea + electrolytes, liver function tests, LDH, αFP, βHCG. The patients will be
      monitored during chemotherapy and then monthly in the first year and two monthly in the
      second year.

      An interim analysis will be performed after 15 patients have completed treatment. If less
      than 9 responses are observed in this group, the study will be terminated. The final analysis
      will be performed after 43 patients have recruited, completed treatment and been followed for
      24 months.
