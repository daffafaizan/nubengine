      the past years. There is little literature especially depicts the therapeutic principle of
      the kind of damage. Posterior wall osteotomy would be conducted to eliminate the fragments or
      callus from the hip joint. Then, the deformed healing acetabulum could become mobile and the
      reduction may be achieved. However, the surgical procedure is technique demanding and some
      intraoperative risk may be accompanied.

      Surgical time, blood loss, complication and fracture healing would be reviewed to assess the
      feasibility of the surgical procedure. The function outcome is evaluated with HHS score at
      the follow up.
