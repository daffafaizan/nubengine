      insufficiency (PI). This places them at risk for caloric, essential fatty acid, and choline
      deficiency, which may in turn, lead to growth failure and a poorer clinical course. The
      purpose of this research study is to find whether or not taking LYM-X-SORB™ over an 18-month
      period, every day, will correct the problem people with CF and PI have with absorbing fat and
      choline. Participation will help CF doctors and other healthcare professionals learn more
      about the potential benefits of LYM-X-SORB™ to children and adolescents with CF and PI. These
      benefits may include better absorption of fat, better choline status, better growth in
      height, weight, muscle and bone, better lungs, and improvement of health status.

      The study will enroll a total of 78 participants from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
      (CHOP) and from several other Cystic Fibrosis Centers. One half of the participants will be
      randomly picked to receive the active powder with the LYM-X-SORB™ supplement and one half
      will receive a placebo (with no active supplement).
