    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To determine the overall response rate of obinutuzumab in relapsed/refractory
      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in both solid organ transplant (SOT) and
      bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Complete remission (CR) rate

        -  Duration of response (DOR)

        -  Progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Time to treatment failure (TTF)

        -  Safety and tolerability of obinutuzumab

      Patient Population:

      Relapsed or refractory post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) patients who have
      received at least one prior therapy

      Study Design:

      Phase II study of single agent obinutuzumab in relapsed/refractory (RR) post-transplant
      lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in both SOT and BMT patients
