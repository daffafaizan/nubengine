    
      This is an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial in the setting of a tertiary academic
      medical center in Israel. Patients with clinical diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD will
      be randomized to either usual care only, usual care with true acupuncture or usual care with
      sham-acupressure. The primary outcome will be clinical improvement of dyspnea as measured by
      mBorg scale. Secondary outcomes included improvement of other patient-reported outcomes and
      physiologic features, as well as duration of hospitalization and treatment failure.
      Acupuncture-related side effects will be evaluated by the validated Acupuncture Adverse
      Events (AcupAE) questionnaire.
