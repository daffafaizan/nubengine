      (CD). Using vasopressors have been considered a gold standard for prevention of post-spinal
      hypotension (PSH) during CD.

      Norepinephrine (NE) is a potent vasopressor characterized by both α adrenergic agonist
      activity in addition to a weak β adrenergic agonist activity; thus, NE is considered a
      vasopressor with minimal cardiac depressant effect; these pharmacological properties would
      make NE an attractive alternative to phenylephrine and ephedrine (the most commonly used
      vasopressors in obstetric anesthesia).

      Norepinephrine has been recently introduced as a prophylactic vasopressor during CD with
      promising results; However, the optimum dose for efficient prophylaxis with the least side
      effects is not known.

      In this study, three doses (0.025, 0.050, 0.075 mcg/Kg/min) of norepinephrine will be
      compared for prophylaxis against PSH during CD.
