        -  Mechanical percutaneous extraction is the conventional technique using locking stylets
           and telescoping sheaths around the pacing leads to separate them from the surrounding
           scar tissue.

        -  Laser-assisted lead extraction is most often used in complex procedures and dissolves
           rather than tear the scar tissue.

        -  Sternotomy is the surgical procedure used when leads cannot be removed by percutaneous
           extraction. It is rarely employed.
