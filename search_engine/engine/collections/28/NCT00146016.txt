      previously untreated patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C comparing double therapy,
      consisting of (PEG-)interferon alpha 2b ((PEG)Intron-A®) and ribavirin (Rebetol®), with
      triple therapy, consisting of (PEG-)interferon alpha 2b, ribavirin and amantadine, for 52
      weeks. Follow-up is completed at week 104. 150 Subjects per treatment group will be included.
      Patients will be stratified before randomisation according to genotype (1 versus non-1).
      Viral load will not be a discriminating factor.

      The aim is to investigate the efficacy of the adjunct amantadine to the currently used
      combination therapy with interferon alpha and ribavirin.
