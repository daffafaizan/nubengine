    
      Study design: this is an experimental, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.

      Study population and study sample: The study was conducted in two family health centers of
      Cankiri Public Health Directorate, Turkey, between April and August in 2015. The study
      population included infants aged 4-6 months and presenting to the family health centers for
      the second and third doses of DTaP/IPV/Hib. The study sample comprised of 128 infants based
      on confidence interval of 95% and statistical power of 80%. Analysis made at the end of the
      study showed a statistical power of 0.83 based on confidence interval of 95%.

      Outcome Measures

      Pain severity: Video recordings obtained were evaluated by two pain specialists separately by
      using Neonatal Infant Pain Scale. The specialists were blinded to the groups to eliminate
      possible mistakes in observations and the possibility of taking sides and to avoid bias. The
      scores assigned by the specialists were used to determine pain scores before, during and
      after vaccine injections.

      Crying time: Video recordings taken were watched by the same researcher and crying time
      before, during and after vaccine injections was calculated for each infant.

      Physiological Changes (heart rate and oxygen saturation): the probe of pulse oximetry was
      attached to the foot not injected vaccine to measure oxygen saturation and heart rate before,
      during and after the injections in each child.
