    
      Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) is a rare and heterogeneous group of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (NHL) originating from mature (or post-thymic or 'peripheral') T- lymphocytes and NK cells.
      They are considered very aggressive and are often resistant to conventional chemotherapy.

      This study employs a stratified randomization with equal allocation within strata of patients
      to receive oral 5-azacytidine (AZA) plus romidepsin (ROMI) versus pre-specified investigator
      choice (ROMI, belinostat, pralatrexate or gemcitabine), for the treatment of relapsed or
      refractory (R/R) PTCL. The dose and schedule of AZA/ROMI has been determined from a phase I
      clinical trial of the combination. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the
      progression free survival (PFS) among patients receiving the combination compared to single
      agent of choice.
