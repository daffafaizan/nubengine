      showed a significant increasing trend in recent years. How can make an early diagnosis of
      bile duct cancer as well as prognostic evaluation and efficacy monitoring, has become the
      hotspot. "liquid biopsy", which is meant to detect cancers by sequencing the DNA in a few
      drops of a person's blood. It may detect cancers early, even before symptoms arise, when
      there is just a few cells in the blood circulation.

      cf-DNA in cancer patients often bears similar genetic and epigenetic features to the related
      tumor DNA. There is evidence that some of the cf-DNA originates from tumoral tissue. This,
      and the fact that cf-DNA can easily be isolated from the circulation and other body fluids of
      patients, makes it a promising candidate as a non-invasive biomarker of cancer. And we call
      the cf-DNA of tumor as ct-DNA.

      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is any peripheral blood cell having a round
      nucleus. These cells can be extracted from whole blood using ficoll, a hydrophilic
      polysaccharide. PBMC contains genetic material of tumor and may be applied as a biomarker.

      This study aims to evaluate the role of ct-DNA and PBMC as biomarkers in the treatment of
      biliary tract cancer.
