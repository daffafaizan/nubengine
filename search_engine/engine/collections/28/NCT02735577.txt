      in order to examine how treatment with disulfiram (DIS) alters neural activity related to
      alcohol-seeking motivation in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). DIS is an
      established, effective, FDA-approved medication for AUD that causes a highly aversive
      physical reaction if alcohol is consumed while it is being taken. The mere awareness of the
      risk or threat the DIS-alcohol reaction deters alcohol use, i.e. it is not necessary to drink
      alcohol while taking DIS to change behavior. By uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying
      this risk/threat-based psychological effect, it will be possible to integrate DIS with
      biologically based treatments targeted at these neural mechanisms, with the goal of improving
      the efficacy of DIS. Furthermore, the results will shed light on the general neural
      mechanisms by which awareness of risks of substance use impacts addictive motivation. This is
      a core process in a number of behavioral treatments for substance use disorders, such as
      Motivational Interviewing and Contingency Management, as well as in behavior change in
      non-treatment settings.
