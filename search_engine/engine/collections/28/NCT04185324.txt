    
      Purpose: This pilot study compares the efficacy of a standard teaching zippering vest
      presented with general verbal prompts to a modified teaching zippering vest presented with a
      related story and vocabulary in the acquisition of zippering skills among typically
      developing preschoolers. Institutional Review Board approval and parent consent was obtained.

      Design: An experimental two group pre-post test design was used. Setting: Research occurred
      in a local preschool. Participants: Participants were recruited from fifty 3.6-to
      4.11-year-old preschoolers.

      Intervention: Eligible children received 3 zippering practice sessions with either a standard
      zippering vest (control group) or a modified vest with added visual and language cues
      (comparison group).

      The treatment protocol for both cohorts of participants was administered over a three-week
      time period to minimize the impact of normal development.
