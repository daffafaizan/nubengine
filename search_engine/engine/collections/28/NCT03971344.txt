      provide support to the child's parents and any siblings, little quantitative information
      exists regarding what could be considered the "collateral impact" on other family members of
      having a child with serious illness in the family. This study seeks to provide such
      information, using existing claims data from the health insurance company, Cigna, to identify
      children with serious illness and then examining the health and health care of their family
      members. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to control families without a sick
      child, parents and siblings of children with serious pediatric illness (SPI) will have more
      new mental and physical health diagnoses, more new prescriptions, increased levels of
      Emergency Department (ED) and acute care services, and reduced levels of use of recommended
      chronic disease management for pre-existing conditions and of preventative services.
