    
      We will evaluate oxygenation under standard ventilator settings (FiO2 0.5 and 1 on PEEP 5 or
      10 cmH2O) in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

      Outcome measures will include: overall ICU mortality, number of patients meeting ARDS
      criteria at 24 hours, and stratification of patients depending on PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 24 h of
      meeting acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria.
