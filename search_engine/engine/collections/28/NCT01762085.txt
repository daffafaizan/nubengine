      randomized to "best care" standard post-ulcer treatment or to best care plus bilateral nerve
      decompression by external neurolysis at 4 fibro-osseous tunnel sites in the leg and foot.
      Comparison of the control group with standard care to the surgical intervention group will be
      made for subsequent appearance of a plantar foot ulcer and ulcer recurrence risks will be
      calculated. Additional subjective and objective secondary outcomes will be monitored. Null
      hypothesis: nerve decompression will not decrease diabetic foot ulcer recurrence risk.

      If protection against ulcer occurrence were to be confirmed, a change in the treatment
      paradigm for diabetic neuropathy and foot ulcer could be appropriate.
