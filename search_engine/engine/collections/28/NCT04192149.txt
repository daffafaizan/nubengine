      resolution that can be applied invasively or non-invasively using acoustic energy to affect
      neuronal activity. In this study the investigators intended to use specific patient
      populations to investigate the effects of FUS on different areas of the central nervous
      system (CNS). Each of our patients groups is undergoing a unique procedure at University of
      Virginia that will provide us different insights into the CNS. (1) Patients receiving an
      awake or asleep craniotomy for brain tumors and/or epilepsy will undergo a brain mapping
      procedure using electrical stimulation as a part of their normal care. The research
      procedures will duplicate this mapping with an invasive FUS mapping. (2) Patients undergoing
      long term monitoring for epilepsy will receive a non-invasive form of FUS stimulation which
      will be measured by their EEG cap and intracranial electrodes which are a part of their
      normal care. (3) Patients undergoing high intensity FUS treatment for tremor will be asked to
      wear a research provided EEG cap while undergoing a non-invasive low intensity FUS research
      procedure and changes in their tremor will be monitored. (4) Patients undergoing Deep Brain
      Stimulation (DBS) treatment for tremor will receive a non-invasive FUS stimulation observed
      through their newly implanted electrode. (5) Patients receiving a spinal surgery will undergo
      a spinal stimulation using electrical stimulation as a part of their normal care. The
      research procedures will duplicate this with an invasive FUS stimulation.
