    
      Jin Fu Kang is a herbal medicine specially developed in China for the treatment of lung
      cancer. It is based on a traditional medicine that is widely used and appears to be safe.
      Although clinical trials in China suggest that Jin Fu Kang may be of benefit, it has never
      been researched in patients with lung cancer in the United States. As such, its risks and
      benefits are not fully understood.

      The scientific aims are to determine the toxicity of Jin Fu Kang/docetaxel combination
      treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, to determine whether Jin Fu Kang
      alters the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and to provide preliminary efficacy and survival
      data for Jin Fu Kang/docetaxel combination treatment in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer.
