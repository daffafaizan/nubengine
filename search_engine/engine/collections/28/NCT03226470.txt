      18,may lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(CIN).HPVs expresses the oncoproteins E6 and
      E7, both of which play key roles in maintaining viral infection and promoting carcinogenesis.
      Previous studies showed that using designated TALENs (T27 and T512) targeted HPV16 E6 and E7
      produced disruption of HPV16 E6 and E7 DNA, decreased the expression of E6 and E7 proteins,
      and induced cell apoptosis.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of T27 and T512 in treating HPV Persistency
      and HPV16-positive CIN.
