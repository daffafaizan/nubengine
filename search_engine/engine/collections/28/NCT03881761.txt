      cell lymphoma. Currently, CAR-T cells approved for relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma are
      mainly CAR19-T cells. Nearly half of patients who relapse after treatment with CAR19-T cells
      are caused by tumor cell antigen escape. Dual-target CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and CD20 may
      reduce the recurrence rate after treatment. This study was to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of CD19/CD20 bispecific CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell
      lymphoma.
