      Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement is crucial in glaucoma diagnosis and treatment. We
      compared a non-contact air tonometer (Topcon CT-1®) with the gold standard Goldmann
      Applikation tonometer (GAT).

      Methods:

      In this prospective, mono centric device comparison study, only healthy eyes were enrolled.
      IOP was measured three times with the Topcon CT-1® followed by three times GAT. Mean IOP was
      calculated and compared with a paired t-test, a linear regression and a Bland-Altman
      analysis.
