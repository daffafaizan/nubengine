      safety and efficacy of directional STN stimulation [STN_D] compared with standard
      omnidirectional STN stimulation [STN_O]. The primary outcome measure is objectively
      quantified muscle rigidity of the upper extremity, i.e., surface EMG recordings of the biceps
      and triceps muscle during standardized extension/flexion of the elbow joint (Levin et al.,
      2009) assessed 6 months after implantation in cross-over design. The trial is designed to
      detect with an 80% power a change of 0.27 mA of the therapeutic stimulation threshold with
      two-tailed P < 0.05 (Wilcoxon rank sum test). Secondary outcome measures address clinical
      motor, non-motor, neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, freezing of gait, and quality
      of life. Visits are scheduled at weeks 1 (V1), 6 (V2), 24 (V3), 27 (V4), and 30 (V5) from
      baseline (V0).
