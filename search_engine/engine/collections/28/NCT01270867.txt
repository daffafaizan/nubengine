      Retriever device and determine if it is substantially equivalent to the predicate Merci
      Retriever. The trial utilized a Primary Effectiveness Endpoint of revascularization and a
      composite Primary Safety Endpoint that included procedure-related serious adverse events
      occurring within 24 hours of the procedure. Subjects who presented to enrolling centers with
      large ischemic strokes were screened for eligibility in the study. If a subject met
      eligibility criteria, then Informed Consent was obtained prior to commencing the angiogram.
      If all inclusion/exclusion criteria were confirmed, including the angiographic criteria, then
      the subject was randomized.The Primary Effectiveness Endpoint was successful
      revascularization of the target occlusion, using the TICI score. Success was determined by
      the central Core Lab.The Primary Safety Endpoint is a composite endpoint, described in the
      protocol as the "Incidence of procedure-related serious adverse events (PRSAEs) through 24
      hours post procedure (-6/+12 hours) defined as: vascular perforation or intramural arterial
      dissection, symptomatic ICH, embolization to a previously uninvolved territory, access site
      complication requiring surgical repair or blood transfusion, intra-procedural mortality,
      device failure (in vivo breakage), or any other complications judged by the Clinical Events
      Committee (CEC) to be related to the procedure."
