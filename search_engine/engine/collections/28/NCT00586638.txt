      designed to enhance cognitive control processes will improve cognitive performance in healthy
      older adults. Cognitively normal adults aged 60-75 will be randomized into three experimental
      groups: 1) Video game play with training strategy; 2) Video game play without training
      strategy (Active Control); 3) Minimal contact (Passive Control). Subjects in Groups 1 and 2
      will be instructed to play the complex, high-demand video game, Space Fortress, for 36
      one-hour sessions over 12 weeks. Subjects in Group 3 will receive all assessments but will
      not play the computer game.
