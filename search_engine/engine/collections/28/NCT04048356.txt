    
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether there is a difference
      in efficacy of two of the most common commercially available vaginal surgical preparations.
      The first objective is to determine whether chlorhexidine gluconate is non-inferior to
      povidone iodine with respect to post-operative infections including urinary tract infections
      (both culture proven and empirically treated) and surgical site infections (as defined by the
      Centers for Disease Control). The second objective is to determine whether chlorhexidine
      gluconate is non-inferior to povidone iodine with respect to vulvar and vaginal irritation.
