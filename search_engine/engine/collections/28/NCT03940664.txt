      Intravitreal injections of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) agents have emerged
      over the past decade as the first line of treatment in some neovascular diseases of the
      retina. Nevertheless, anti-VEGF therapies suffer some limitations, among which a short time
      to recurrence (1 week to 3 months) of retinal neovascularization and an eroding biological
      effect after prolonged use and.

      CD160 appeared in several experimental studies as a marker of activated endothelial cells,
      suggesting it could represent a promising target for novel anti-angiogenic.
