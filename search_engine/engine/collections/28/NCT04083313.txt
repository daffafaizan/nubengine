      appendectomy is one of the most commonly performed procedures in abdominal surgery. Today
      laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) has the status of a ''Gold Standard'' treatment, and it is
      accepted as the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis.There are several ways of closing
      the appendiceal stump.An inadequate closure of the appendiceal stump can lead to morbidity of
      operated patients. The aim of this study is to assess the efficiency of different closure
      techniques by focusing on the intraoperative and postoperative complications.The patients
      will be divided into three groups based on the technique used for appendiceal stump closure,
      whether it is Endoloop, Endostapler or Endoclip. In the patients included in the study the
      investigators will analyse demographic data, peroperative laboratory values, clinical data
      and treatment outcomes. Also, the histopathological findings of the specimens and
      perioperative and postoperative complications will be analysed.
