      including 1 day for the screening visit, 3 days for the ad libitum use sessions (P3L, VUSE
      e-cigarette system and subjects' own commercially available non-menthol CC), 1 day for the
      preference evaluation session (subjects will be given the choice of using ad libitum the P3L
      or the VUSE), the 2 to 10 days of interval between each visit, and 7 days for the passive
      safety follow-up period.

      The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD, i.e., subjective effects) profiles, will
      be evaluated as well as the safety and tolerability of the P3L.
