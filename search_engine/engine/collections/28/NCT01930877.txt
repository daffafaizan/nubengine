      anesthesia will be induced as it would normally be done in any patient undergoing spine
      surgery. Once the patient is positioned for the surgery bolus followed by the infusion of
      either the study drug or the placebo will be administered. The infusion will be stopped at
      the end of surgery and the patient will be transferred to the post anesthesia care unit. Post
      operative pain score will be evaluated for the first 24 hrs and also the amount of pain
      medications used will be recorded. At the end of 24 hours quality of recovery will be
      assessed using a qor-40 questionnaire.
