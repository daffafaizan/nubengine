      followed by doxorubicin and ketoconazole in patients with high-risk, androgen-independent
      prostate cancer. II. Determine whether anticoagulation with warfarin can reduce the frequency
      of thromboembolic complications associated with estramustine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Regimen A: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 3 weekly. Patients also receive oral warfarin daily.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimen B: After completion of regimen A, patients
      receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes weekly and oral ketoconazole twice daily. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
