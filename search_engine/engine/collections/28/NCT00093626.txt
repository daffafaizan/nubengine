      I. Determine the efficacy of sorafenib in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian
      epithelial or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. Determine 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug, in terms of frequency and severity of adverse
      events encountered, in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical response rate (partial and complete response) in patients treated
      with this drug.

      II. Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with
      this drug.

      III. Correlate prognostic variables (platinum sensitivity, performance status, and histology
      [clear cell and mucinous type]) with response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-13
      months.
