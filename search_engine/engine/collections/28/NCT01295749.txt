    
      Multicentric, prospective, controlled, randomized study with parallel groups in single blind.

      Patients will be included in chronological periods to avoid selection biais (one month with
      the first medical device the next month with the other one). The determination of these
      periods will be centralized. The emergency vehicles will be supplied sufficiently with
      devices. This design has been chosen in order to answer to the emergency problem.

      Patients will be included and ventilated by paramedical staff (first responders) before
      medical staff (Mobile Intensive Care Unit) intervention. Complete detailed information will
      be given to the patient or to the family and consent asked.

      The comparison of no flow time between the two strategies in out of hospital cardiac arrest
      will be the following :

      A : ventilation by bag valve mask and interrupted chest compression B : ventilation by
      laryngeal tube and continuous chest compression
