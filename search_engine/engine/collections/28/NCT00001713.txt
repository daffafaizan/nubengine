      treatment with anticoagulation therapy is effective in reducing the associated risk of
      pulmonary embolism, but is ineffective in restoring patency of the venous system of the lower
      extremity. While systemic thrombolytic therapy has been shown to be more effective than
      anticoagulation, catheter directed local thrombolytic therapy is the most effective treatment
      in restoring venous patency. Current treatment regimens are based on use of urokinase,
      infused continuously through catheters imbedded into the thrombus. These treatment regimens
      require doses on the order of 10,000,000 units of urokinase, resulting in significant
      bleeding complications and prohibitive costs.

      Experience at NIH with pulse-spray treatment of axillary subclavian venous thrombosis with
      rtPA indicates that this is a highly effective and safe alternative thrombolytic regimen. The
      proposed protocol is designed to evaluate the efficiency, safety, and doses of rtPA
      associated with pulse spray directed rtPA treatment of the more extensive venous thrombosis
      encountered in the lower extremity.
