      adversities and a variety of eating and weight problems. The research can be extended by
      assessing the cumulative effects of adverse childhood experiences on the severity of
      overweight and obesity rather than focusing on individual categories of events. In addition,
      we can learn much by extending the research to include all overweight and obese patients, not
      just those who have a known underlying comorbid psychiatric disorder such as bulimia nervosa
      or binge eating disorder.

      Lastly, the research on obesity and adverse childhood experiences should be extended to
      include younger subjects because obesity is now a public health problem of epidemic
      proportion in the United States, and it is now affecting younger and younger individuals.

      The study proposed in this protocol will accomplish the goals of 1) assessing the cumulative
      effects of adverse childhood experiences, 2) assessing the association of these events with
      varying degrees of overweight and obesity, and 3) assessing this association in a younger
      population than that previously examined.
