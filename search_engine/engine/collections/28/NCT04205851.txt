    
      KIN-1901 is a fully human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed towards a
      proinflammatory cytokine that is believed to have a role in inflammation and autoimmunity,
      and is found in synovial fluid from patients with spondyloarthritis. Therefore,
      neutralization of this cytokine activity by specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be
      beneficial in treating certain spondyloarthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating
      single-dose or once-weekly repeat-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of KIN-1901 in
      healthy subjects (Cohorts 1 through 4) and in subjects with AS (Cohort 5). The secondary
      objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of escalating single-dose and
      once-weekly repeat-dose SC administration of KIN-1901 in healthy subjects (Cohorts 1 through
      4) and in subjects with AS (Cohort 5). The following exploratory objectives will also be
      evaluated: (1) To explore the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of escalating single-dose and
      once-weekly repeat-dose SC administration of KIN-1901 in healthy subjects (Cohorts 1 through
      4), (2) To explore the PD effects and changes in disease activity by Assessment in Ankylosing
      Spondylitis Criteria ASAS 20/40 (and components) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity
      Score-CRP (ASDAS-CRP) of once-weekly repeat-dose SC administration of KIN-1901 in subjects
      with AS (Cohort 5), (3) To assess biomarkers of efficacy and safety after once-weekly
      repeat-dose SC administration of KIN-1901 in subjects with AS (Cohort 5).
