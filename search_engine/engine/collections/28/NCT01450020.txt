      I. To evaluate the ability of peer navigation (PN) to improve understanding of survivorship
      care planning (SCP) at 6 months.

      II. To promote adherence to the SCP schedule of follow-up examinations at 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of PN on change from baseline in medical efficacy, preparedness for
      life as new survivor, and physical and health related QOL at 6 months.

      OUTLINE: PNs are trained on medical issues and resources, and SCP. Participants are then
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive 4 PN sessions tailored to their needs followed by a 6 month
      booster session and American Cancer Society (ACS) materials.

      ARM II: Participants receive ACS materials.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 months.
