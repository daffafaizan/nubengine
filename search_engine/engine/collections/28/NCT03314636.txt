      sufficient amount of treatment in first-line, and a sufficient respons (VGPR). Eligible
      performed regimens are defined in the protocol. All patients will perform a PET-CT, and
      PET-negative patients will be excluded from protocol treatment. The PET-positive patients
      will do a minimal residual disease (MRD-)evaluation in the bone marrow before entering
      treatment. After 4 28day cycles of Carfilzomib-Revlimid-Dexamethason, a new MRD and a new
      PET-CT will be performed, as measures of outcome. Patients will continue treatment as written
      in the protocol.
