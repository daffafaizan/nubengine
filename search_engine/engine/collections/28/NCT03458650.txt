    
      This study includes 3 dose groups which are 50 mg (Group 1), 100 mg(Group 2) and 200 mg(Group
      3) respectively. For 50 mg and 200 mg dose groups, each is planned to enroll 12 healthy
      subjects (investigational drug :placebo=10:2), half males and half females. Five subjects of
      each gender will receive LXI-15028, while 1 subject of each gender will receive placebo; 100
      mg dose group plans to enroll 14 healthy subjects (investigational drug:placebo=10:4), half
      males and half females. Five subjects of each gender will receive LXI-15028, while 2 subjects
      of each gender will receive placebo. Intra-group randomization will be implemented in each
      dose group; each subject will receive either LXI-15028 or placebo.

      This study includes 2 parts of single-dose and multiple-dose administration. The single-dose
      study will use gradually escalation dosing to evaluate the 3 doses of 50 mg, 100 mg and 200
      mg. Within 4 days after each dose is administered, the investigators will assess the safety
      and tolerability data to decide whether to proceed with the next escalated single dose.
      Within 4 days of 200 mg single-dose administration, the investigators will assess the safety
      and tolerability data to decide whether to proceed with 100 mg multiple-dose study.
      Multiple-dose study will be investigated in 100 mg group only.

      The study consists of screening period, treatment period and follow-up in each dose group.
      The treatment period in 50 mg and 200 mg dose groups include single-dose administration only.
      While the treatment period in 100 mg dose group includes both single-dose and multiple-dose
      administration. The subjects in 100 mg dose group will enter multiple-dose period following
      completing single-dose period.

      In escalated single-dose study, the subjects in each dose group will receive single oral dose
      of 50 mg LXI-15028 tablet or 1 matching placebo tablet at fasted state, or 100 mg LXI-15028
      tablet or matching placebo 1 tablet, or 2 100 mg LXI-15028 tablets or 2 matching placebo
      tablets. Blood samples will be collected before administration (0h), and 15 min (0.25h), 30
      min (0.5h), 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h after administration.
      In multiple-dose study, the subjects will continuously receive oral 100 mg LXI-15028 tablet
      or 1 matching placebo tablet once daily (QD) for 10 times. Blood samples of trough
      concentration will be collected before the 8th to 10th administration (0h) in multiple-dose
      study. And blood samples will be collected at 15 min (0.25h), 30 min (0.5h), 1h, 1.5h, 2h,
      2.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h and 72h after the 10th administration.

      The collected blood samples will be processed to obtain plasma. Liquid Chromatographic(LC)
      /Mass Spectra(MS)/Mass Spectra (MS) method will be used to determine plasma concentrations of
      LXI-15028 and its major metabolite M1 in order to evaluate the pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of LXI-15028 and its metabolite M1 after oral administration of LXI-15028
      tablet.

      The safety will be assessed by physical examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory
      examinations and adverse events in subjects receiving LXI-15028 tablet.
