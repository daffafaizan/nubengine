      tumor cells (CTC) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are planned to have
      curative resection of liver metastasis. Blood will be taken from patients within 7 days
      before liver resection. CTC enumeration is done by a highly-sensitive microfluidic platform
      for which CTC can be subsequently enumerated with or without sequencing performed. Patients
      are then followed up regularly with contrast CT scan for recurrence. The primary study
      endpoint is to define the cutoff value of CTC count in patients with early relapse < 6months
      after liver resection. Seventy-seven patients will be recruited in 24 months.
