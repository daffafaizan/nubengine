    
      This is a single arm phase II trial of docetaxel and diethylstilbestrol for patients with
      symptomatic stage D3 androgen independent prostate cancer. Patients will receive docetaxel
      weekly for 10 cycles (each cycle consists of treatment for 3 weeks out of every 4) and DES
      daily for 40 weeks or until there is evidence of disease progression, whichever occurs first.
      Patients will be followed to determine PSA and objective response. Additional endpoints
      include time to progression, disease specific survival and overall survival. Disease
      progression will be defined as 2 consecutive increases in PSA and/or tumor growth as
      evidenced by examination or radiologic evaluation. Other secondary objectives will be to
      determine the toxicity, and impact on quality of life of this regimen.
