      lysosomal storage disorder. ERT helps many physical ailments due to the disease, but does not
      treat the central nervous system, due to inability to cross the blood brain barrier. Our
      purpose is to test delivery of ERT to the spinal fluid via intrathecal injection in patients
      with MPS I. In this pilot study, we will use recombinant human Î±-L-iduronidase administered
      intrathecally once per month for four months to individuals with the Hurler-Scheie and Scheie
      forms of MPS I and spinal cord compression. If successful, intrathecal delivery could
      represent a practical, straightforward method of treating central nervous system disease due
      to lysosomal storage.
