      research data (e.g. clinical tests, demographical characteristics) with access to biological
      specimens (e.g. blood, urine) obtained from individuals with genetically confirmed FRDA and
      unrelated control research participants.

      The EFACTS patient registry started out as a 4-year study and is currently running without a
      set end date. Eligible subjects are assessed at annual study visits on the clinical symptoms
      and signs of the disease. At each study visit, general clinical, motor function, cognitive,
      and Quality of Life assessments are administered. In addition, participants are providing bio
      samples for the purposes of genetic testing and for research to identify valuable biomarkers
      of FRDA. Biological specimens and clinical data are made available to qualified scientists
      within the EFACTS network whose projects are reviewed and approved by the EFACTS Steering
      Committee. Research projects should aim to advance scientific knowledge towards establishing
      clinically effective treatments that delay onset and/or slow the progression of the disease.
