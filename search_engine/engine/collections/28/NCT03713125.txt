    
      This longitudinal study will be conducted with 260 Kindergartners, staggered across multiple
      cohorts, who are followed through 1st grade. There will be three time points of testing for
      each cohort: fall of Kindergarten, spring of Kindergarten, and in the fall of 1st grade.

      After the third testing time point, in the fall of 1st grade, the bottom 1/3 of readers in
      the sample will be selected to participate in the intervention arm of the study. These
      students will be randomly placed in one of two arms: business-as-usual, in which children
      receive no additional instruction; or the reading intervention condition, in which they
      receive 20 hours of 1:1 reading intervention over 6 weeks. Children in both sub-sample arms
      are assessed again after tutoring is complete, in the spring of 1st grade.

      Neuroimaging through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) will occur as part of study participation in conjunction with testing at fall
      of Kindergarten, fall of 1st grade, and spring of 1st grade time points.
