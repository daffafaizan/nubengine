      cardiogenic shock requiring short-term mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to a
      long-term LVAD might benefit from early mobilization and rehabilitation with IMPELLA™
      inserted via the axillary artery. The aim of this study is to compare the early
      rehabilitation and outcomes after LVAD implantation between patients previously treated by
      IMPELLA™ or ExtraCorporeal Life Support (ECLS)
