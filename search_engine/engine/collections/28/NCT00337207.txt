        -  Determine the safety of single-agent bevacizumab in the treatment of patients with
           recurrent or progressive malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the efficacy of bevacizumab, in terms of progression-free survival at 6
           months, in these patients.

        -  Assess changes in tumoral blood flow based on magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion and
           tissue changes by MR spectroscopy.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.
