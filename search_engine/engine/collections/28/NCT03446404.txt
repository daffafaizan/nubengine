      #201511711). Using a prototype Curve Beam Standing Computed Tomography (SCT) scanner to get a
      3 dimensional picture of the knee joint, bilaterally. This scanner by Curve Beam 175 Titus
      Ave, Suite 300, Warrington, Pennsylvania 18976, has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for ankles and feet. This has been modified to do the scan of the knee
      but is not yet approved by the FDA for the knees. The proposed ancillary study would add the
      key benefit of providing more sensitive and accurate identification of prevalent knee
      osteoarthritis (OA) at baseline and incident knee OA at follow-up than is available with
      plain radiographs. In addition, it would enable biomechanical modeling of the knee joint on a
      larger scale than achieved in any prior study, allowing testing of biomechanical hypotheses
      regarding mechanisms of disease development and progression that have not been possible on
      this scale previously.
