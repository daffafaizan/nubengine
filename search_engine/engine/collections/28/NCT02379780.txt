      scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled into the study. Patients were
      allocated into two groups to receive ultrasound guided subcostal transversus abdominis plane
      block (group T, n=25) or ultrasound guided paravertebral block (group P, n=25). In all
      patients; anesthesia was induced with iv propofol (2 mg.kg-1) and maintained with total
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) in a mixture of 50 % nitrous oxide and 50 % oxygen with a total
      gas flow rate of 4 L min-1. Neuromuscular relaxation was induced with iv rocuronium (0.5
      mg.kg-1). Propofol (2 mg / cc, 2-4 mg / kg / h) and remifentanil (13.3 mcg / cc, 1-3 mcg / kg
      / h) combination was used in TIVA. Propofol and remifentanil rates increased or reduced
      according to the patient's hemodynamic response. Prior to start surgery, ultrasound guided
      subcostal transversus abdominis plane or paravertebral block was performed in patients .

      Blood pressure, heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation,TIVA consumption of 0, 5, 10, 15,
      30, 60 min were recorded for all patients.Before the end of surgery, tramadol was
      administered (2 mg / kg) for all patients.

      All patients were evaluated at postoperative 2th, 4th, 8th, 12th, 24th hours with; operation
      time, heart rate, blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, visual pain scores (VAS),
      analgesic consumption, complications (hypotension, anaphylaxis, hematoma, IV injection,
      intra-abdominal organ injury, pneumothorax ) and patient satisfaction status were recorded.
      In the postoperative period if there is additional analgesic requirements (VASâ‰¥4) tramadol 2
      mg.kg-1 was administered as IV. The first hour is needed analgesia were recorded.
