        1. Colonoscopy will be performed in the same standard of care manner as if no study was
           taking place. The video signal from the colonoscope will be fed into a computer running
           the EndoVigilant CAD software in addition to the standard video output to the procedure
           monitor. The EndoVigilant CAD software will display an annotated video on an additional
           monitor that includes both the colonoscopy picture and annotation by the software
           indicating the location of any polyps on the screen.

        2. The endoscopist performing the procedure will therefore be able to observe a standard
           colonoscopy video on the primary monitor and the annotated video on the second monitor.

        3. The endoscopist will primarily rely on the second monitor (augmented with annotation
           from EndoVigilant ColonCAD software) but the standard procedure monitor will be always
           operational and available for maneuvers such as fast insertion, polypectomy etc.
