      Primary

        -  To maintain and create a University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)
           Radiation Oncology Tissue Resource and Registry/Database that will be used to explore
           genetic variations contributing to clinical outcomes through tissue analysis and outcome
           correlation. Tissue will be stored by the UTSTR and the database managed by Radiation
           Oncology.

      Secondary

        -  To document disease outcome (local recurrence, distant metastasis, overall survival) by
           treatment regimen and disease site.

        -  To document toxicity by treatment regimen and disease site.

        -  To establish a prospective registry/database consisting of patient demographics and
           outcomes to be used for future research.

      OUTLINE: Tissue, including surgical waste, venous blood/serum, urine, bone marrow, and other
      body fluids, may be collected (at planned surgery and routine medical visits) and preserved
      for future research. Demographic and disease and treatment information is obtained from
      patients (by interview or questionnaire), from medical records, and from national datasets.
      Patients may also be asked to provide additional blood samples and/or a small skin-punch
      biopsy sample.

      Patients are followed up every 6 months for the first two years following treatment and then
      yearly thereafter.
