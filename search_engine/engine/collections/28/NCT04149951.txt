      developed, and much of the developing world. Although it has long been realized that Western
      diets that are rich in sugar and fat play an important role in this, it has only recently
      been realized that exposure to these diets, particularly in childhood, can damage the part of
      the brain that determines how much fat there is in the body, which may well play a role in
      the development of metabolic syndrome, deranged glycemic control and type 2 DM. It is
      believed, based on animal and human work, that VeNS pushes the set-point for fat downwards to
      cause fat loss, possibly because this indicates to the brain a state of increased physical
      activity. VeNS may additionally have other direct, yet to be quantified, effects on glycemic
      control.

      The sponsors have unpublished pilot data from Dr Saisailesh Kumar at RDG Medical College in
      India that show an improvement in glycemic control can be achieved by one hour a day of VeNS
      over a three month period. Both groups received a hypocaloric diet tailored to diabetics. The
      aim of this study is to determine whether this effect can be replicated in a slightly larger
      European based population.
