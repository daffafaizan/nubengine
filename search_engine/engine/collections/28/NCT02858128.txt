      our centre who presented biochemical relapse after adjuvant, salvage or radical treatment
      with external beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. After initial tests ( bone scintigraphy,
      CT, pelvic MRI) 35 patients with oligometastases or without them were selected. 11 patients
      with multiple metastases were excluded from the study. WB-DW- MRI and choline-PET/CT was then
      performed on each patient within one week. The results were interpreted by specialists in
      nuclear medicine and MRI. If they were candidates for treatment with ablative SBRT (SABR)
      they were then evaluated every three months with both tests.
