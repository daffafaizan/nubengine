      however, post-surgical pain can be difficult to manage and the optimal peri-operative pain
      management strategy has not been established. This study serves to evaluate the clinical
      outcomes of liposomal bupivacaine PAI when compared to single shot adductor canal block using
      bupivacaine HCl in patients undergoing a TKA. The investigators hypothesized that
      peri-articular injection with liposomal bupivacaine would not be inferior to an adductor
      canal block using bupivacaine HCl. A total of 60 patients were recruited. Thirty patients
      were randomized to receive intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine periarticular injection, and
      another thirty patients randomized to receive a pre-operative adductor canal block using
      bupivacaine. Both groups otherwise received standard pain management strategies
      peri-operatively. The primary outcome of interest was post-operative pain, which was measured
      using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary measures included changes in patient function
      which was measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC), knee range of motion, post-operative ambulation distance, and hospital length of
      stay.
