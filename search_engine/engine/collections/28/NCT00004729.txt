      fasting followed by a very carefully controlled high fat-low protein and carbohydrate diet.
      Studies suggest it is useful in children whose seizures could not be controlled by any of the
      medicines available. This study is designed to test, in a carefully controlled fashion, how
      well the diet works in children with "drop" seizures. Children who experience 15 or more drop
      seizures each day, despite having used at least two medications, may be eligible to
      participate. This study requires children to undergo periods of fasting and to maintain a
      carefully controlled diet. Parents of participating children monitor their children's diets
      and keep daily meal and seizure diaries.
