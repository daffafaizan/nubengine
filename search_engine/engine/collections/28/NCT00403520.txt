      allows confirming these results in patients presenting with pre-dementia Alzheimer's Disease
      (AD), treated with donepezil in order to verify if this product is capable of stopping the
      speed of the atrophy of the hippocampus in patients and more specifically in those who will
      evolve to AD, compared to a placebo. This method is a semi automatic segmentation of the
      hippocampus from MRI, made by competitive region growing.

      It was developed at the cognitive neurosciences and MRI laboratory in Pitié-Salpêtrière
      hospital. This method was validated on healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease patients by
      comparison with manual segmentation.

      Neuropsychological tests will be realized in order to supervise the clinical evolution of the
      patients and to correlate these results to the progression of the atrophy of the hippocampus.
