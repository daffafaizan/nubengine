      visualization of surgical are during laparoscopic hysterectomy. The investigators consider
      that adoption of the uterine manipulator will also facilitate to locate the colpotomy site in
      abdominal hysterectomy. Therefore the investigators are planning to enroll patients
      undergoing an abdominal hysterectomy in this study. Patients will be allocated into one of
      the study groups: Group 1 Uterine manipulator arm in which participants received a uterine
      manipulator during the procedure for aiding to locate the accurate colpotomy site and Group 2
      consisting of control patients who will not receive uterine manipulator but undergo a
      standard abdominal hysterectomy. All abdominal hysterectomies will be carried out by the same
      surgeon under general anesthesia. One week before the surgery vaginal length will be measured
      and the female sexual function index (FSFI) will be obtained from all patients. Following the
      surgery vaginal length will again be measured at 3 months and the female sexual function
      index (FSFI) will be obtained from participants by a research staff who is also a
      gynecologist. Prevalence of postoperative dyspareunia will be asked to the patients at
      postoperative 3 months. Just after the surgery, a 5 points surgeons' satisfaction scale will
      also be completed by the surgeons and residents performing the surgery to address their
      satisfaction in locating the colpotomy site either with the uterine manipulator as in group 1
      or by manually guiding as in group 2.
