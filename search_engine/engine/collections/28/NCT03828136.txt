      allograft cage in single-level ACDF with the use of local autologous bone. VCIBD is a
      restorable cervical interbody cage for the treatment of fusion, following discectomy, of the
      cervical spine from C3/C4 disc space to the C7/T1 disc space. The material used to
      manufacture the implant is 13-93 bioactive glass, which is a silicate-based material as
      described in ASTM F1538-03(R2017). The implant has high porosity and strength and does not
      contain any biological material or constitute a combination product. The device has a central
      lumen for packing with autograft. VCIBD is intended to be used with a supplemental fixation
      system.

      The device, when placed between the vertebrae, provides mechanical stability and prevents
      subsidence prior to bone ingrowth. It restores and maintains the intervertebral space during
      the fusion process. The porosity and material characteristics provide an osteoconductive
      matrix that supports bone ingrowth. Additional stabilization is provided by supplemental
      fixation using anterior cervical plate. The implant incorporates a central lumen, which
      allows for the cage to be packed with autogenous bone graft.
