      the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (BOSU) at the Royal College of
      Ophthalmologists and with the Scottish Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (SOSU). BOSU and
      SOSU operate a monthly reporting card scheme. All UK consultant ophthalmologists and
      associate specialists receive a monthly 'report card' with a list of conditions being
      surveyed. Reporting clinicians will tick a box if they have seen a case of childhood uveitis
      in the preceding month, and return the card to BOSU/SOSU, who will inform us, the study
      investigators.

      Following reporting of a new case, the investigators will directly contact reporting
      clinicians and send them a clinical proforma to collect clinical details about the case. At
      12 months, a follow up questionnaire will be sent. The investigators will use only
      information available from patient case notes, with no direct patient contact. The
      investigators principal aim is to determine incidence of childhood uveitis in the UK.
      Secondary aims are to identify presentation patterns, referral pathways, associated medical
      conditions, management, and outcomes.
