      clinical knowledge base by including 'real world' subjects.

      All subjects diagnosed with a qualifying AAA suitable for elective endovascular repair, who
      meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the registry, are eligible for enrollment and
      should be offered informed consent to participate.
