    
      This is an open-label, non-comparative, randomized, single center, 24-week study. Patients
      are stratified into 3 groups (8 patients in each group) based on kidney function:

      Group 1: Serum creatine less than 2 mg/dL. Group 2: Serum creatine 2-5 mg/dL. Group 3: Serum
      creatine greater than 5 mg/dL.

      All 24 patients are randomized 1:1 to receive 1 of 2 study regimens:

      Arm A: Saquinavir SGC plus d4T plus 3TC. Arm B: Saquinavir SGC plus nelfinavir plus d4T.
      Patients are seen at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. At Week 24, a kidney biopsy is performed with
      patient consent.
