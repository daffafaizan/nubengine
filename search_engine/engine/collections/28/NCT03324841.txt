      demographics, presentation, diagnosis, treatment, cost of associated care, quality of life,
      and outcomes of subjects utilizing Caris Molecular IntelligenceÂ® (CMI) Services for the
      treatment of cancer. Prior to enrolling a subject, the subject's physician will have made the
      independent decision whether or not to utilize the drug associations provided by CMI and made
      clinical treatment choices as appropriate. Thus, data captured and reported provides a "real
      world" perspective on diagnosis, treatment, cost, and outcomes.

      Prospective data will be obtained only from consented patients or patients who have died or
      have been lost to follow-up. Lost to follow-up is defined as a subject who has not returned
      for continued care or evaluation (e.g., disability, relocation or unresponsiveness). Site
      coordinators are required attempt to contact the subject 3 times before deeming them lost to
      follow up. Data collection and the protection of privacy are discussed in the Methods section
      below.

      In addition to treatment and response data, initial diagnosis and staging results will be
      recorded as well as any recurrence information. As the investigators are capturing the
      subject's cancer treatment as a whole, results from pertinent cancer-related tests performed
      by outside entities for eligible subjects will need to be collected by the site coordinator
      and maintained at the site accordingly for reporting and monitoring purposes.
