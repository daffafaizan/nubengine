      with a Doppler transducer to identify the hemorrhoidal arteries. A suture ligation is
      performed to effectively decrease the blood flow to the hemorrhoidal plexus. In case of
      redundant prolapse, the prolapsed mucosa is lifted (mucopexy). THD procedure is performed
      without any incisions or removal of the hemorrhoidal tissue and moreover the suture line is
      above the dentate line, so post-operative pain and morbidities seem to be minimized in these
      patients. This technique differs from Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy, which focuses on excising
      the hemorrhoidal tissue.

      This prospective, randomized, multicenter and controlled trial compares post-operative pain,
      morbidities, quality of life, fecal incontinence and recurrence rate in patients treated for
      grade III and IV hemorrhoids with THD with mucopexy versus Ligasure hemorrhoidectomy.
