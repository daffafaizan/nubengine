      healthy subjects (wife / husband of the patients) that will be recruited at Scientific
      Institute for Research, Hospitalization and Healthcare (IRCCS) Neuromed.

      After signed informed consent patients will be assessed for disease progression (Hoehn and
      Yahr stadium, Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III
      (MDS-UPDRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, no motor symptoms, therapy and
      levodopa induced Dyskinesia (LID) occurrence). Each patient and control will be subjected to
      peripheral blood sampling for the isolation of DNA, RNA, plasma and serum. The investigators
      will use a disease-specific gene panel including about 100 genes related to Parkinson's
      Disease, autophagy and levodopa induced Dyskinesia (LID).

      Bioinformatics analysis will allow to catalog in a database the identified variants/mutations
      according to their frequency and characteristics.

      The investigators will specifically assess if the inheritance of multiple rare deleterious
      variants in Parkinson's Disease genes is predictive of disease risk.

      The presence of one or more variants will be tested for association with phenotypic
      manifestation of Parkinson's Disease (motor, non-motor, and cognitive signs, as well as age
      at onset, LID and neuroimaging changes) to assess the variant burden effect on progression,
      and prognosis of the disease.
