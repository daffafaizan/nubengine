      determine if they meet the inclusion criteria. Participants will undergo the Nd: YAG laser
      capsulotomy procedure and will be examined at 1 hour, 1 day (if necessary), 1 week, 1 month,
      and 3 months following the procedure. Follow-up examinations will evaluate visual acuity
      improvement and possible post-procedure complications. The complication rate following the
      laser capsulotomy procedure is typically minimal.
