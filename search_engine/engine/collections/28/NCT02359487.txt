    
      This study involves a randomized controlled trial of 550 HIV-negative adult men recruited
      from a single Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) center for HIV in Windhoek, Namibia who
      report harmful or hazardous alcohol consumption and more than one sex partner in the previous
      three months.

      After receiving standard counseling at the VCT center, all men who test HIV-negative will be
      invited to be screened for eligibility for the study, and if eligible, to consent to enroll.
      Personnel hired for the study will then administer a baseline survey via Personal Digital
      Assistant to all enrolled men. Enrolled participants will then be randomized to either an
      intervention arm, and receive an additional one-hour counseling session and take-home
      materials plus general alcohol information materials or to a control arm, and receive general
      alcohol information materials alone. All men enrolled in the study will receive the general
      alcohol information materials, consisting of a booklet with alcohol health information and a
      brochure detailing alcohol abuse support services in the local community. Men in the
      intervention arm will also receive two cellphone text messages one month and four months
      following enrollment to boost the risk reduction counseling. Follow-up surveys of all
      participants will be conducted three months and six months after enrollment

      Outcomes measured include self-reported data at baseline, three months and six months
      post-enrollment regarding: 1) Number, proportion of sex acts preceded by alcohol use; 2)
      Number, proportion of sex acts protected by condoms; 3) Number of sex partners; and 4)
      Quantity and frequency of alcohol use; 5) Condom use demonstration scores.
