      clinically asymptomatic for a long time before rupture. However, once the UIAs ruptured, the
      incidence of mortality rate varies from 30% to 60% within 6 months. Thus, the risk of UIAs
      rupture should be weighed, and need an individual criterion for predicting rupture in
      clinical decision making.

      Histopathological studies indicated that inflammation may play an important role in the
      formation, growth, and rupture of UIAs. Wall enhancement of a saccular aneurysm on high
      resolution magnetic resonance (HRMRI) is a proven sign of inflammatory change and might
      predict an unsteady state of an intracranial saccular aneurysm.

      Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and are established
      first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia. Statins produce a range of pleiotropic
      effects in addition to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, especially to reduce
      inflammation, which may be important in reducing the growth and rupture of UIAs.

      In the study, participants known to have UIA that is not planned for treatment and has not
      yet ruptured, take atorvastatin daily for six months, and have an HRMRI scan before and after
      to look for the role of atorvastatin in inflammation.
