      to two groups, taking the generic drugs 3TC+D4T+NVP or AZT+3TC+NVP, 6 months later half of
      the 3TC+D4T+NVP group will switch to AZT+3TC+NVP, in order to observe the efficiency and
      safety of the first line drugs. Arm 2 will recruit 100 patients who are taking ARV for about
      three years already. Arm 3 will recruit 150 patients who have a Viral load of more than 1000
      copies/ml, i.e., drug resistance. The second line drug 3TC+TDF+LPV/RTV will given to them and
      the safety and efficiency will be observed. All patients should be explored in terms of the
      clinical features, drugs side-effects, and immunological and viral response. The drug
      concentration and the metabolism changes would be explored also. Also the immune
      reconstitution will be studied for all patients. This study will be the first large-scale,
      multicentered, randomised, prospective ARV therapy study in China for HIV/AIDs patients. The
      result would provide proves for further practical antiviral therapy for China or other
      resource limited countries.
