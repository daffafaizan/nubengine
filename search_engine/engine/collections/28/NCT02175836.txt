      Cardiomyopathy patients with Heart Failure. Discovering efficient SCD risk stratification
      markers is of high importance. In this study, heart failure patients will be risk stratified
      with indices from the Myocardial substrate (QRS, fragmented QRS, Late potentials, LVEF),
      indices from the Repolarization status (QT duration, QT rate corrected , QT dispersion,
      QT/RR, T wave Amplitude Variability, T wave alternans, QT Variability Index), indices from
      the Autonomic Nervous System function [ Heart Rate variability, Heart rate Turbulence,
      Deceleration Capacity (DC) , DC sign of fraction, Beat to Beat DC, Non linear indices of
      Heart Rate Dynamics], the Non sustained ventricular tachycardia and Ventricular extrasystolic
      activity and the Circadian Properties of Heart Rate observed during Ambulatory Monitoring.
      Furthermore Programmed Ventricular Stimulation will be used. High resolution 30 min ECG
      recordings will performed for further indices research and development. All the Arrhythmic
      Risk Stratifiers will be analysed and their performance for Sudden Cardiac Death Prediction
      and for Total Mortality will be estimated according the follow up.
