      biomarkers previously identified as sensitive to high shear stress in patients with severe
      aortic valve stenosis before and after trans arterial valve replacement. As one of the best
      biomarker is a high degree of platelet-leukocyte interactions, the study will study in
      parallel leukocytes activation/differentiation. These parameters will be compared at 3
      time-points, before and after LAVD implantation in ambulatory patients.
