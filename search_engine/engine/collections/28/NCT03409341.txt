    
      Overall Goal: The long-term goal of this study is to predict whether checkpoint inhibitors
      will be effective in individual patients with solid tumors.

      Objectives: In this pilot study to be conducted in ten subjects with lung cancer who are to
      receive checkpoint inhibitors, we will use cellular and molecular techniques to characterize

        -  tumor immunogenicity

        -  anti-tumor T-cell response

        -  effect of checkpoint inhibitors on antigen presentation and T-cell response, and

        -  the tumor microenvironment

      Planned enrollment:

      â€¢ Ten subjects with lung cancer

      Methods for Informed Consent:

      Investigators will approach subjects for informed consent
