      from previous studies and assuming an alpha error of 0.05 and beta error 0f 0.2 (power of the
      study 80 %), a sample size of 20 patients per group was calculated. A drop out 10% of cases
      is expected, so; 22 cases per group will be required.

      Statistical analysis: Data will be analyzed through SPSS (Statistical Package for Social
      Sciences). Program version 22. Distribution of data will be first tested by Shapiro test.
      Data will be presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), median and range or numbers and
      percentages. For normally distributed data, unpaired t test will be used to compare between
      mean values of both groups. For pain and sedation scores, Mann Whitney U test will be used.
      Fisher's exact test will be used for comparison of categorical data. The P value â‰¤ 0.05 will
      be considered as the level of statistical significance.
