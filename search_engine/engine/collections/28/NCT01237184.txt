      resonance frequency analysis (RFA) employing dental implants surgically placed in posterior
      maxillary bone by engaging alveolar crest and the sinus floor using vertical stopper drill
      and self-threading concept (bi-cortical fixation), engaging only the alveolar crest
      (uni-cortical fixation), and engaging alveolar crest and the sinus floor using indirect sinus
      lift technique (indirect sinus lift technique). The surgical procedures compared in this
      experiment include 3 groups:

        -  Group 1 (15 implants) Short implants placed in proximity of the sinus without sinus
           floor involvement (unicortical fixation)

        -  Group 2 (15 implants) Implants placed using indirect sinus lift technique (indirect
           sinus lift technique)

        -  Group 3 (15 implants) Bi-cortically fixed implants intentionally engaging sinus floor
           beyond up to 1-2mm without graft but using stopper drill and self-threading concept
           (bi-cortical fixation)
