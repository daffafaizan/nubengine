      frequently obtain their asthma care in the ED. Prior studies have had limited success in
      improving primary care follow-up, quality of care, and long-term outcomes after a pediatric
      ED visit for asthma. Prior ED-based interventions have been designed to address barriers to
      follow-up with a primary care provider (PCP) such as an inability to obtain a follow-up
      appointment or lack of transportation. Focus groups and surveys of inner-city families have
      found that beliefs about the benefits of follow-up care and the role of preventive asthma
      medications have a strong impact on adherence to therapy.

      This study will develop a brief educational video about the benefits of follow-up asthma care
      using a multi-disciplinary panel of experts at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and
      focus groups of parents of children with asthma. This educational video will then be combined
      into an intervention along with symptom screening and a reminder phone call that has been
      demonstrated to improve follow-up rates in a previous study. The combined intervention will
      be tested using a randomized trial design to determine its efficacy on healthcare
      utilization, asthma controller medication use, symptoms, and quality of life during the 6
      months following an ED visit. The research is conducted as part of a research career
      development award.
