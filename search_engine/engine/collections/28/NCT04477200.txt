      brain tumors. Eight participants in Phase 0 will receive MMF for one week before undergoing
      an already planned biopsy or re-resection (surgical removal) of glioblastoma (GBM). A small
      portion of the tumor, removed as part of clinical care, will be used for testing in this
      study. Thirty additional participants will be enrolled in the Phase 1 component of the trial.
      The goal of the Phase 1 component is to find the dose of MMF that works best without causing
      severe side effects (the maximum tolerated dose) when combined with radiation. Participants
      in Phase 0 who meet the eligibility criteria for the Phase 1 component may participate in
      both phases.
