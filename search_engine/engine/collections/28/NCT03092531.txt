    
      HIV infected adolescents and young adults will be recruited from Providence, Rhode Island,
      Boston, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois. Participants will be equally randomized to:

        1. "Positive STEPS" - a stepped care, adherence intervention with integrated technology
           (2-way daily text messaging aimed at improving ART adherence). If text messaging is not
           sufficient to overcome the barriers to ART adherence;these individuals will then also
           receive the more intensive component based on general principles of cognitive-behavioral
           therapy.

        2. Standard of Care comparison group including a brief adherence educational session. This
           will consist of a review of medications and recommended dosing (i.e., to understand
           regimen), adherence expectations, toxicity expectations and medication
           misperceptions.The participant will then view a 20-minute animated tutorial which
           explains the importance of adherence to antiretroviral medication effectiveness.
