        1. To perform quantitative PCR using known leukemia specific markers in diagnostic bone
           marrow specimens of patients with newly diagnosed APL and ALL and to correlative
           pre-treatment copy number with other biologic and molecular features, clinical response,
           and treatment outcome.

        2. To evaluate the expression of novel genes or microRNAs implicated in disease
           pathogenesis and treatment response in pretreatment blood and bone marrow specimens of
           patients with APL and ALL and to correlate expression level with other biological
           features and treatment outcome.

        3. To evaluate the clinical significance of sequential quantitative MRD measurements using
           real-time quantitative PCR and/or flow cytometry during and following treatment of ALL
           and APL and correlate these findings with efficacy of novel treatment approaches and
           with other biological and clinical prognostic features.

        4. To compare measurement of MRD in blood with bone marrow specimens in sequential
           remission specimens of patients receiving treatment on ALL and APL treatment trials.
