      predetermined effect-site concentration of remifentanil was started simultaneously. The
      remifentanil concentration was determined using modified Dixon's up-and-down method (initial
      concentration: 3.0 ng/ml, step size: 0.5 ng/ml). Five minutes later, i- gel or LMA insertion
      was attempted. The response of the patients to the insertion of LMA was classified as either
      'movement' or 'no movement'.
