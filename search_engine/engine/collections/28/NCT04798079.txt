    
      This is a prospective cohort study in which pregnant women (at any stage of pregnancy), the
      offspring's biologic father, and the offspring will be enrolled at study sites and the
      offspring will be observed from birth to age 3 years. The enrollment goal is at least 2500
      pregnant women who agree to enroll their offspring at birth. Enrollment of biological fathers
      will be attempted; however, enrollment of the mother or child is not dependent on enrollment
      of the biological father.

      During the study, biological and environmental samples and questionnaire information will be
      collected from the parents and the children, and the children will be assessed for allergic
      diseases at clinic visits at ages 2, 5, 12, 24, and 36 months.
