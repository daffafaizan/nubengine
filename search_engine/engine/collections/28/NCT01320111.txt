      death in adult women. This tumor remains a challenge in modern oncology despite recent
      advances by introducing new classes of chemotherapy like taxanes and antibodies for the
      HER-2/neu positive tumors. Recently it was shown that the combination of conventional
      chemotherapy with a monoclonal antibody against VEGF can further increase the response and
      progression free survival by combination with an antiangiogenic therapy. It is supposed that
      this effect might result in a prolonged survival.

      Sorafenib, a new developed oral inhibitor for tyrosine kinases which are responsible for the
      signal transduction after binding to the VEGF receptor and the RAS-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway seems
      efficient in the treatment of a broad range of tumors.

      The multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib targets the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf
      kinase and the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-Î², thereby affecting both, the
      tumour and the vasculature. Preclinical studies as well as phase I trials showed anti-tumour
      activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with single-agent sorafenib.

      This multicentre, phase II, open-label, randomised study is designed to assess the potential
      prolongation in progression free survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer in
      combination with standard chemotherapy paclitaxel compared with the paclitaxel monotherapy.
