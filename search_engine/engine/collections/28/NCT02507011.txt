    
      Adult PAH patients on a stable dose of an approved PAH medication will undergo the following
      baseline assessments: cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), right heart catheterization
      (RHC), echocardiogram, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), plasma NT-ProBNP (biomarkers of RV
      function) and serum catecholamine (measure of sympathetic activation), and quality of life.
      Patients will be randomized to carvedilol (3.125 mg bid and escalated to 9.375 mg bid, as
      tolerated, over 3 months) or placebo in a 1:1 fashion. After 6 months, testing is repeated
      and patients are crossed over to the alternate treatment. Testing is repeated at the end of
      the study (month 13).
