      four doses of iontophoretic delivery of dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution in
      patients with non-infectious anterior segment uveitis. The current study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of this technology at the four dose levels to determine a
      safe effective dose appropriate for future trials.
