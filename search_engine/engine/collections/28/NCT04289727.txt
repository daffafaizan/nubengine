      microarchitecture occurring during peak bone mass accrual, and this disruption arises from
      hyperglycemia and glycemic variability. Impaired bone development during this period likely
      predisposes to an increased fracture risk across the lifespan.

      The investigators will compare baseline, 12 month and 24 month changes in High-resolution
      peripheral quantitative computed tomography/micro-finite element analysis
      (HR-pQCT/Î¼FEA)-based estimates of bone strength and bone turnover by biochemical measurements
      in 40 T1D children at the onset of peak bone mineral accretion (n=40) versus sex and
      puberty-matched healthy controls (n=40). The investigators will determine relationships
      between changes in bone strength (including trabecular and cortical components) and measures
      of glycemic control and variability by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).
