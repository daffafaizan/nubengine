      group. The intervention group will get written material of healthy diet during pregnancy as
      well as emphasized nutritional guidance given by public health nurses at each visit in the
      maternity care clinic. There will also be two group meetings with a dietitian. The control
      group will get the same written material, but otherwise basic care and guidance at each visit
      in the maternity care clinics. The collected data of both groups include the information on
      weight gain, the result of an oral glucose tolerance test and 4 day food records, Three
      factor eating questionnaire (TFEQ R-18) and Binge Eating Scale (BES).
