      standard Thin prep cytology screening.

      Participants: 100-120 healthy women presenting for standard pap smear screening

      Procedures (methods): After routine care pap smear, another pap smear will be performed and
      placed in the study medium. The study pap medium will be processed using the manufacturers
      instructions and then clinical care pap and study pap will be reviewed by a single
      pathologist to assess for equivalent findings.
