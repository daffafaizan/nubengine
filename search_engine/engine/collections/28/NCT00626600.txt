      receive Oxycodone Hydrochloride 50mg/ml as a subcutaneous infusion. During the treatment
      phase, safety will be assessed by documentation of type and frequency of spontaneously
      reported adverse events and adverse events noted after assessment of the infusion site (every
      24 hours and when resited). The subjects will be followed up for 7 days to collect
      information on ongoing AEs/SAEs and any new AEs/SAEs that may have occurred.
