      a booster vaccination with a different vaccine preparation may produce a better immune
      response than administration of HIVAC-1e vaccine alone.

      Seventy healthy volunteers are randomized to one of four groups. Groups A and D receive one
      initial immunization with HIVAC-1e followed by two boosts with subunit gp120 and Env 2-3,
      respectively, at months 8 and 12. Group B receives two immunizations with HIVAC-1e at months
      0 and 8 followed by a single boost with subunit gp120 at month 12. Group C receives three
      doses of subunit gp120 only at months 0, 8 and 12. (Per 10/01/92 amendment, boosts with
      VaxSyn (gp160) have been eliminated.) Subjects are followed for 18 months.
