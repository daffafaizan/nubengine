      arterial and arterial graft suturing as well as by systemic anticoagulation to prevent
      thrombosis during periods of vascular occlusion. Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) is one of the
      most frequently used graft materials for vascular replacement or bypass in the case when no
      autologous venae are available (1). However, the insufficient elasticity of PTFE and its
      porosity promote the development of suture hole bleeding (2,3) which can cause considerable
      loss of blood and prolongation of operations (2).

      This study is designed to demonstrate the superiority of Lyostypt® to oxidized cellulose
      (Surgicel®) for hemostasis of suture hole bleeding in arterial bypass anastomoses after
      vascular reconstruction. Lyostypt® is an absorbable, wet stable collagen compress made of
      collagen fibrils of bovine origin. Collagen leads to thrombocyte adhesion and to activation
      of coagulation factor XII. Therefore collagen is very effective in hemostasis. Collagen is
      cell-friendly whereas other hemostats significantly disturb cell growth. Advantages of
      collagen fleece are fast induction of hemostasis, low tissue reaction and fast absorption
      (15). Furthermore, collagen was shown to be the best overall hemostatic agent in
      microvascular surgery. Authors concluded that collagen fleece establish faster hemostasis
      than oxidized cellulose and that it was resorbed faster than oxidized cellulose (15).
