      clinical practice, after HMV initiation, the first control examination (follow-up number one)
      with nocturnal diagnostics should take place within the first 4-8 weeks. Annual follow-up is
      required, and it is recommended that subsequent control visits should be performed 1-2 times
      a year. Each patient will be included for 5 years (total duration of the registry).
