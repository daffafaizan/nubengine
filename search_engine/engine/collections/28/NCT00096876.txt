      the 40-item UPSIT in a cohort of first-degree relatives of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.
      The results would also validate the use of the University of Pennsylvania Smell
      Identification Test (UPSIT) as a mail-survey instrument. Once identified, these individuals
      could be followed as a potentially at-risk cohort to determine if the screening evaluation
      was predictive of later developing Parkinson's disease. The results from this pilot study
      have the potential to guide the use of olfactory testing using the UPSIT as a screening tool,
      and to provide necessary preliminary data for planning clinical trials to prevent the
      occurrence of PD in at-risk individuals.
