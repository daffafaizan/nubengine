      I. Characterize the ability of localized ultrasound contrast agent destruction to improve
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response to yttrium Y-90 (Y90) radioembolization.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine if contrast-enhanced ultrasound estimated tumor perfusion can reliably predict
      HCC response to radioembolization 1-14 days post treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive perflutren protein-type A microspheres intravenously (IV) over 10
      minutes and undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) over 60 minutes at 1-6 hours and at
      approximately 7 and 14 days after yttrium Y-90 radioembolization.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo standard of care yttrium Y-90 radioembolization.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and at 3-4 months.
