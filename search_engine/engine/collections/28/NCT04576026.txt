      with detriments in cognitive function which leads to poor decision making and detriments in
      specific sport skills. Ketones can serve as a powerful brain fuel source so they may have the
      potential to delay/ revert the onset of mental fatigue. in this experiment, we will induce
      mental fatigue in individuals who will be performing 45 minutes of intermittent exercise
      right after. During exercise cognitive function will be measured under 2 condition, Ketone
      supplementation and placebo. The purpose of this study is to see if ketones can play a role
      in reverting that initial mental fatigue during exercise, compared to placebo.
