      adjuvant therapies in patients with early stage HCC, although it is widely considered an area
      of highly unmet need.

      The objective of this randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase II trial is to
      examine the effects of pravastatin use versus placebo after 12 months of treatment on
      hepatocellular cancer (HCC) recurrence in 130 patients with liver cirrhosis, HCC meeting
      Milan Criteria or OPTN tumor downstaging criteria for tumor burden, and initial locoregional
      therapy (LRT) with adequate response.
