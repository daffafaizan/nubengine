      80 patients (2x40) with Type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria. Patients will be randomized to
      either 200 mg Alagebrium twice daily or placebo for a period of 24 weeks after an 8 week
      run-in period. There will be a 8 week run-out period. All patients will receive ramipril
      during the entire study period. Efficacy measurements will be performed at baseline, at 12
      weeks and at the end of the study. Measurements for albumin:creatinine ratio(mg/g), plasma
      renin level, collagen markers, AGE related markers and 24 hour blood pressure measurements
      will also be determined. A total of 9 visits will be performed during the entire study.
