      microflora colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, and they selectively stimulate the growth
      or the activity of one or limited number of bacteria within the intestine. Beta-glucans are
      polysaccharides occurring in the bran of cereal grains, the cell wall of Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae and bacteria, certain types of fungi, seaweed and many kinds of mushrooms. The aim
      of this study is to determine the effect of the potential prebiotic beta-glucan on the
      intestinal microflora, the bacterial enzyme activity (beta-glucuronidase and
      beta-glucosidase) in the faeces, the faecal pH, and the concentration of faecal short-chain
      fatty acid in polypectomized patients.
