      Based on the observational design of the trial, the method of insertion (Real-time ultrasound
      navigation versus anatomical-based CVC insertion) will be based on operatorsÂ´ decision.The
      indication for CVC insertion, primary planned site of insertion, USG implementation, site of
      actual CVC cannulation and associated complications will be recorded. The primary aim of the
      study was to compare the effectivity of Real-time ultrasound navigation versus
      anatomical-based CVC insertion in paediatric patients and the 1st percutaneous puncture
      success rate. The secondary aims will be the incidence of associated complications and the
      time form first percutaneous puncture, to definitely securing the CVC in place. The primary
      hypothesis is that the Ultrasound-guided CVC insertion is superior, with the higher overall
      success, higher first attempt success rate and with lower incidence of associated
      complications.
