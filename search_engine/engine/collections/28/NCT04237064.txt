    
      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of atherosclerotic plaque
      imaging using multispectral photoacoustic imaging.

      Study design: This is a pilot study where 60 patients with a plaque in one of the carotids,
      scheduled for an endarterectomy procedure, will be included. Each subject will get a
      multi-wavelength photoacoustic examination of the carotid plaque. In one group (N = 30),
      photoacoustic imaging will be performed noninvasively at the TU/e laser lab, which is
      compliant with laser safety standards, to verify non-invasive, multi-angle, multi-wavelength
      photoacoustic imaging (Study A). In the second group (N = 30), photoacoustic imaging will be
      performed pre- and per-operatively (Study B) prior to plaque removal. Here, to ensure a 100%
      (laser) safe environment, all acquisitions will be performed in the operating theatre. The
      latter group will be subjected to additional Magnetic Resonance Imaging for validation. After
      carotid endarterectomie the plaque sample of each patient (Study A and B) will be transported
      to TU/e for in vitro PA scanning and histology analysis.

      Study population: A total of 60 patients with carotid artery disease scheduled for
      endarterectomy (stenosis grade of > 70% and < 99%).

      Intervention (if applicable): endarterectomy (following normal procedure), with an additional
      photoacoustic image acquisition after incision, before removal of the plaque.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The acoustic (i.e., echographic) and photoacoustic images
      will be analyzed to determine the ability of distinguishing between different plaque
      components (intraplaque hemorrhage, lipid pool, vessel wall), examine penetration depth,
      resolution, and contrast.
