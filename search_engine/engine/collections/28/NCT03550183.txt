      the elderly. And there is as yet no effective drug treatment. Umbilical cord derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) derived from mesoderm owns strong proliferation ability and
      multiple differentiation potential. The investigators used UC-MSCs via intravenous infusion
      to treat PD. With different durations of follow-up, the investigators cleared therapeutic
      effect, the quality of life and prognostic implications of UC-MSCs on PD through the Unified
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), revised Hoehn-Yahr（H-Y） staging, Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE), Hamilton depression scales 24 (HAMD 24), Hamilton Anxiety Scale 14 (HAMA
      14) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In this research, the investigators seek new
      therapeutic approaches for PD, and provide clinical evidences for the clinical application of
      UC-MSCs in the future.
