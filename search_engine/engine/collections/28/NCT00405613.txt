      but is often discontinued prior to invasive dental procedures because of concern of bleeding
      complications. As the goal of aspirin is often to prevent MI and stroke, the risk of these
      CVD outcomes with discontinuation of aspirin must be weighed against the perceived adverse
      event of bleeding during or following an invasive dental procedure with continuation of
      aspirin. The current study is a randomized controlled trial evaluating bleeding complications
      of aspirin vs. placebo in healthy patients schedule for a single tooth extraction.
