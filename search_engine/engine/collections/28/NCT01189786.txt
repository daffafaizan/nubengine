      Before treatment can begin, stem cells will be collected from the donor (a close relative)
      that has been selected as the best match for the participant. White blood cells will be
      collected from the donor. The cells will then be mixed with a special protein, called a CD34
      antibody, that binds to the stem cells, which will then be separated out from the white blood
      cells by a special machine- called a CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System in the laboratory. This is
      an investigational device that is not approved by the FDA. Although this device is not
      approved for use in this country, it has been in use for years and is approved in other
      countries. The stem cells will be collected and frozen before they will be given to the
      participant.

      On about days 28, 100 and 365 after the transplant, the participant will have the same
      tests/evaluations since the time of transplant; however, the participant will also have a
      bone marrow aspirate. This is where samples of bone marrow are taken to evaluate the
      participant's disease and Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) status. For patients who do not
      develop GvHD, they may have an additional bone marrow aspirate about a year after transplant.

      In addition, for purposes of the study, health-related information will be collected for a
      year from the time of stem cell infusion. This will be used to determine survival, relapse,
      infections and GvHD that may occur following transplant.
