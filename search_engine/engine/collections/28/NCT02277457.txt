      NSCLC harboring either an EGFR mutation (n=20) or an ALK rearrangement (n=10). Patients with
      EGFR+ tumors will be treated with erlotinib 150 mg orally QD; patients with ALK+ tumors will
      be treated with crizotinib 250 mg orally BID. Treatment consists of six weeks of concurrent
      PART plus erlotinib or crizotinib, followed by erlotinib or crizotinib for a total of 1 year.
      All patients will be treated with response-driven PART with dose intensified to the active
      (FDG-avid) region based on a mid-treatment FDG-PET/CT scan while maintaining dose limits for
      organs-at-risk. The primary endpoints will be PFS and OS. Primary analyses will be performed
      separately for ALK+ and EGFR+ patients. The secondary endpoint of treatment-related toxicity
      will focus on pneumonitis and esophagitis with a strict stopping rule in place.

      Current standard therapy affords suboptimal outcomes for patients with locally advanced NSCLC
      due to both locoregional and distant recurrences. Since targeted therapy is more effective
      than chemotherapy in patients with relevant driver mutations, the best way to significantly
      improve outcomes in this subgroup of patients is to optimize systemic therapy with targeted
      agents while improving local control with PET-adapted, high-dose RT.
