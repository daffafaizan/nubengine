      weeks postpartum (PP) whether an exercise and yogurt supplementation intervention, compared
      to a minimal care group, will:

        1. Improve body composition. The working hypothesis for this aim, based on previous studies
           (Lovelady et al 2009; Colleran et al 2012), is thatthe intervention group will have less
           loss of lean body mass and bone mineral density but more fat loss compared to the
           minimal care group at 20 weeks PP.

        2. Promote an increase in cardiovascular fitness. The working hypothesis for this aim,
           based on previous studies (Lovelady et al 2009; Colleran et al 2012), is that the
           intervention group will exhibit an increase in predicted maximal oxygen consumption and
           maximal strength compared to the minimal care group at 20 weeks PP.

        3. Increase immunological factors within breastmilk. The working hypothesis for this aim,
           based on a previous study (Lovelady et al 2003), is that the intervention group will
           exhibit an increase in IgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme and Bidfidus factor concentrations in
           breast milk which will improve immunological benefits to the nursing infant.
