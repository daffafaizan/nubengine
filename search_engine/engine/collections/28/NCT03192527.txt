    
      This is a phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose, double blind
      parallel design, first-in-human study. The study design allows a gradual escalation of the
      dose-level with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the subjects. Dose
      escalation will continue until identification of MTD or up to a maximum dose of 100 Î¼g.
      Tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity
      characteristics of KN015 will be assessed in healthy female subjects. Eligible subjects will
      undergo down-regulation of endogenous FSH with a GnRH antagonist Triptorelin prior to
      receiving KN015.
