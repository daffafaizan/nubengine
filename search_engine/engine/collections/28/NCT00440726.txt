      administration of some of the drugs. Treatment will last about 1 month.

      Treatment on this study will consist of a combination of 7 anti-cancer medications. The 7
      anti-cancer medicines are bortezomib, vincristine, dexamethasone, PEG-asparaginase,
      doxorubicin, cytarabine (Ara-C), and methotrexate (MTX).

      If you are in the Phase I portion of this study, you will be given an assigned dose of
      bortezomib. The dose of bortezomib will be based on doses given in previous studies done with
      adults and children. At each dose level of bortezomib, between 3 and 6 children will receive
      bortezomib in combination with chemotherapy. If the side effects are not too severe, the next
      group of children will receive a higher dose. The dose will continue to be increased until we
      find the dose that causes serious side effects. Your dose of bortezomib will not be
      increased. If you have bad side effects, your dose may be decreased.

      The dose used during the Phase 2 part of this study will be determined by the outcome of the
      Phase I study. The highest dose used in Phase I that was tolerated without serious side
      effects will be the one used in Phase 2.
