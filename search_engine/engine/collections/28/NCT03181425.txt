    
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and chronic degenerative disease of the articular
      cartilage. Despite recent progress in the field of cartilage imaging, no routinely used
      clinical imaging modality has the ability to evaluate and monitor changes in cartilage
      degeneration.

      More and more studies report the benefits of Magnetic Resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI) in the study of early knee osteoarthritis and in particular the new MRI contrasts
      generating the Track Weighted Imaging (TWI) technique.

      This observationnal, pilot, prospective, unrandomized and uncontrolled study aim to evaluate,
      for the first time, the new MRI tractography maps for the assessment of early knee
      osteoarthritis. This study doesn't modify the medical care of the patient.
