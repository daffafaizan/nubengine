      aware of the radiation dose of computed tomography. Concerns over the potential for radiation
      induced malignancies have increasingly been published in the scientific literature and
      reported in the popular press. The risk is highest for younger patients, who have more
      radiation-sensitive tissues and longer life expectancies than adults. Recently, the United
      States Food and Drug Administration announced an initiative to reduce unnecessary radiation
      exposure from medical imaging. At present, low-dose computed tomography protocol is widely
      used for the diagnosis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

      Computed tomography-guided lung biopsy is widely used for diagnosis of lung nodules and
      masses. However, it requires repeating scanning to guide the needles, which inevitably
      increases the radiation dose. Therefore, low-dose protocol was also used in the computed
      tomography-guided lung biopsy procedure.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy and complication rate between
      low-dose computed tomography-guided and standard-dose computed tomography-guided lung biopsy.
