      effectiveness of antibiotic and antifungal therapy, reduce adverse events, and help limit the
      emergence of antimicrobial resistance in children and adults.

      In reality, targeted antimicrobial therapy can most effectively be achieved by utilizing
      personalized data to facilitate a tailored and optimized approach to individual patient
      treatment. This can best be achieved by utilizing knowledge gained from both host-centered
      and pathogen-centered parameters during health and disease. Unfortunately, these parameters
      have traditionally, tended to be measured independently (for example using microbial culture
      or PCR-based methods for microbial detection, or measurement of the immune response to
      infections and/or blood-based biomarkers in the host), and used on an ad hoc basis without
      careful integration for the best treatment of the patient. However, recent advances in the
      development of high-throughput and sensitive molecular-based technologies, on-line internet
      database access tools, and bioinformatics analysis, now means that the goal of personalized
      medicine and treatment is in sight. Unfortunately however, there currently exists a
      technological gap between recent state-of-the-art methodologies (for example with respect to
      gaining new insights into novel host-pathogen interactions) and laboratory-to-bedside results
      to benefit patients, physicians and society as a whole. The TAILORED-Treatment project is
      designed to bridge this technological gap in order to generate novel insights and innovations
      that are readily exploitable for the maximum benefit of multiple stakeholders in the field of
      personalized medicine and infectious diseases.
