      with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet therapy
      are varied due to ethnic and/or individual variability. The aim of the OPT-CAD study was to
      demonstrate contemporary status and outcomes of antiplatelet therapy in Chinese CAD patients,
      and to explore predictors of ischemic or bleeding events in such cohort.Patients above 18
      years who were diagnosed as CAD and received antiplatelet therapy were prospectively enrolled
      in this national wide, non-intervention registry. All medications and laboratory tests were
      at physician discretion.
