      Primary

        -  To determine the safety of pentostatin and low-dose total body irradiation followed by
           T-cell-reduced unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, in terms of
           regimen-related toxicity, in patients with hematological malignancies.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen, measured as engraftment rate and establishment
           of donor hematopoietic chimerism, in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Reduced-intensity preparative regimen: Patients receive pentostatin IV over 30 minutes
           once daily on days -10 to -8 and undergo low-dose total-body irradiation on day -1.

        -  Unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo
           T-cell-reduced donor PBSCT on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2
           hours twice daily on days -1, 0, and 1 and then orally twice daily on days 2-70 followed
           by a taper in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive oral mycophenolate mofetil
           twice daily on days 0-27 followed by a taper.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsies and blood sample collection periodically
      for laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed for cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-γ, IL-1β, and
      IL-10) by ELISA; phenotypic, molecular, and functional analysis of immunologic reconstitution
      markers (i.e., PHA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, Fas, FasL, TNF, TGF-β, and IFN-γ) by flow
      cytometry; and cytogenetics by FISH.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
