      adolescents. Usually performed for recurrent tonsillitis or symptoms of airway obstruction,
      the procedure can result in significant post-operative pain. Common analgesic techniques
      include the use of oral acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such
      as ibuprofen by mouth (PO) or ketorolac intravenous (IV), and narcotics. Acetaminophen has
      been shown to be effective in reducing pain and post-operative opioid requirements. Its
      administration can be oral, rectal, or intravenous. NSAIDs, though effective for pain
      control, have been shown to increase bleeding risk and disrupt hemostasis. Narcotics are
      effective for pain control but increase the risk of nausea and vomiting. They also have the
      potential to cause respiratory depression.

      IV acetaminophen (OFIRMEV) is indicated for management of mild to moderate pain, and as an
      adjunct to opioids for severe pain. Several studies have examined the efficacy of IV
      acetaminophen vs placebo and/or active controls (meperidine, rectal acetaminophen (PR),
      tramadol). IV acetaminophen has been shown to be superior to placebo for pain control. Though
      there is data regarding peak plasma and Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) concentration of
      acetaminophen when given by different routes (PO vs IV vs PR), there is no data comparing the
      efficacy of oral vs IV administration for pain control post-tonsillectomy in children.
