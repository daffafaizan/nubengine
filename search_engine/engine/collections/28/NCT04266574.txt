      Perioperative complications lead to impaired quality of life as well as prolonged disability.
      In high risk patients, early hemodynamic optimization with the goal of achieving and
      maintaining tissue oxygenation in the perioperative period has resulted in an improvement of
      outcomes and a reduction in surgery-related complications. Maintenance of adequate oxygen
      delivery to tissue, is one of the fundamental aspects of anesthesia. Regional Oxygen
      Saturation of the brain tissue (rSO2) as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a
      promising tool in vascular surgery and cardiac surgery for the monitoring of global cerebral
      perfusion.

      Objectives:

      This study has the purpose to assess whether an rSO2-based hemodynamic optimization algorithm
      is able to reduce overall perioperative complications in high risk patients.

      Design:

      BRAIN-PROMISE is a monocentric, randomized controlled trial.

      Population:

      Hypertensive elderly or frail patients undergoing major surgery.

      Experimental Intervention:

      Cases will be managed using a NIRS-targeted goal directed therapy.

      Control Intervention:

      Controls will be managed according to standard care.

      Outcomes:

      The primary outcome are the incidence of perioperative complications at 30 days and the
      percentage of successful reversal of reduction in NIRS.

      Trial size:

      A total of 200 patients will be randomized.
