      motivationally-tailored, individually targeted 12-wk physical activity intervention on 1)
      risk of GDM in women at high risk of the condition, 2) serum biomarkers associated with
      insulin resistance, 3) and the adoption and maintenance of exercise during pregnancy.
      Secondary goals are to investigate the impact of the intervention on gestational weight gain
      and selected birth outcomes. The overall goal of the intervention is to encourage pregnant
      women to achieve the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Guidelines
      for physical activity during pregnancy (30 minutes or more of moderate- intensity activity on
      most days of the week) through increasing walking and developing a more active lifestyle. The
      intervention draws from the theory of Stages of Motivational Readiness for Change and Social
      Cognitive Theory constructs for physical activity behavior and will take into account the
      specific social, cultural, economic, and physical environmental challenges faced by women of
      diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. The application is innovative in being the
      first, to our knowledge, to test a physical activity intervention designed to prevent GDM
      among high risk women. The intervention protocol can readily be translated into clinical
      practice in underserved and minority populations.
