    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, double blinded, controlled clinical study comparing two
      doses of immunoselected, culture-expanded, nucleated, allogeneic adult MPCs when combined
      with hyaluronic acid to two control intradiscal injections in subjects with chronic low back
      pain (> 6 months) due to moderate DDD at one lumbar level from L1 to S1 and unresponsive to
      conservative therapy for at least 3 months (including physical therapy).

      After the screening and injection visits, each subject will be evaluated clinically and
      radiographically at 30 days, and again at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after injection.

      Subjects will be evaluated at the same time points for safety.
