      psychosocial and functional problems not identified by routine evaluation. This can
      subsequently guide management of the identified problems. However, the time and resources
      required to incorporate a geriatric assessment into clinic visits remain the primary barriers
      for implementation. There is a need to increase the adoption of the geriatric assessment
      among general oncologists and to address the associated resource limitations. Our long-term
      goal is to utilize an electronic platform to facilitate completion of the geriatric
      assessment. This project assesses the feasibility and usability of the geriatric assessment
      platform (electronic Geriatric Assessment Platform or eGAP) in 50 older patients with cancer,
      their caregivers, and oncology providers. Using an iterative process, we will refine the eGAP
      based on input from stakeholders (patients, caregivers, oncologists, nurses, advanced
      practitioners)
