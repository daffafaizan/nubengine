      American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), version 8, Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM)- H system
      and the International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS). IRSS stage I patients recognized
      as higher risk will be assigned for adjuvant therapy. Those with standard risk will not
      receive adjuvant therapy after enucleation. Higher risk patients are defined as those with
      pathological retrolaminar optic nerve invasion and-or any degree of scleral invasion (pT3b,
      pT3c, pT3d). Based on the results of the GALOP I protocol, they will receive a reduced dose
      adjuvant chemotherapy regimen with 3 cycles of alternating cyclophosphamide, vincristine and
      idarubicin alternating with another 3 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide. Six doses of
      intrathecal topotecan will be given. Patients presenting with severe buphthalmia (cT3c-cT3e)
      will receive neo-adjuvant therapy with the same intensive regimen but including a higher dose
      of carboplatin as per GALOP I protocol plus intrathecal topotecan and secondary enucleation
      followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for a total of 8 cycles. Stage II patients (pT4) will
      receive the same adjuvant regimen plus orbital radiotherapy (45 cGy).
