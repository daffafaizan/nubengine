      foster care system. Children are randomly assigned to the experimental condition (ABC-T) or
      to a treatment control (DEF). In the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up for Toddlers
      (ABC-T) condition, children's foster parents receive an intervention that focuses on
      nurturance, following children's lead, and helping children settle when they become
      overwhelmed. In the Developmental Education for Families (DEF) intervention, children's
      foster parents receive an intervention that focuses on enhancing children's cognitive and
      motor skills. Both of the interventions are provided in families' homes for 10 sessions of
      about 60 minutes duration. Outcomes include attachment (assessed in the Preschool Strange
      Situation), cortisol production (assessed diurnally), child behavior problems (assessed
      through laboratory procedures that stress children), and through psychiatric interviews.
