      defect repair is the procedure of choice for the treatment anterior vaginal wall prolapse.
      This randomized prospective study will attempt to answer this question by assessing the
      change in the stage of prolapse before and after surgery, patient satisfaction through
      quality of life and sexual function questionnaires before and after surgery, and
      peri-operative complication rates. Patients enrolled into the study will be followed up for
      up to 2 years after surgery.
