      pressure can often take many weeks to resolve, and for some women it never resolves
      completely. If untreated, high blood pressure of pregnancy can lead to serious consequences,
      such as seizure or stroke. Unfortunately, because most women are sent home from the hospital
      just 2-3 days after having a baby, the best way of monitoring blood pressure at home is still
      unknown. Most women are given a prescription for a blood pressure cuff to use at home and an
      appointment to see their doctor at about one week after delivery to review their blood
      pressures, but many women have trouble checking their blood pressures, sometimes because they
      have a new baby at home and sometimes for other reasons like transportation or difficult
      social situations. Using a Bluetooth blood pressure monitoring system might help women have
      better blood pressure monitoring after they are discharged from the hospital after delivery,
      and therefore help to prevent some of the complications that can happen because of high blood
      pressure related to pregnancy.
