      in and additional tests will be done according to the standard procedure to screen out who
      have monosymptomatic enuresis.Then participants will complete a 3-day voiding diary or a
      7-day voiding diary before treatment. During the second visit to a doctor, doctors will
      diagnose by voiding diary which type of enuresis is present. Participants need to fill in the
      3-day or 7-day voiding diary at 1, 3 and 6 months after standard treatment. About 800
      patients from 5 to 18 years old will be included in this prospective, randomized, controlled,
      multi-center and large sample study and will be followed up at the outpatient clinic.
