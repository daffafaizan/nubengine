    
      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of home lung function monitoring
      and medication reminders on adherence, clinical outcomes and quality of life in children with
      cystic fibrosis (CF) who are between 10 and 21 years of age.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group.
      Those in the intervention group will receive a personal spirometer device that provides
      medication reminders and allows for lung function monitoring at home. The control group will
      receive the current standard of care. All participants will be aware that their adherence is
      being monitored over the course of the study using prescription refill data. Changes in lung
      function, body mass index and rate of hospitalization will be used as measures of clinical
      outcome. Responses to age-appropriate well-validated patient questionnaires will be used to
      assess the impact of the investigators interventions on quality of life and perceptions of
      treatment burden.

      Since this device has never been previously studied in this patient population, the
      investigators would like to do a pilot study with 5 patients (3 in the intervention group and
      2 in the control group) over a 3-month period to determine feasibility. This will also help
      us with the investigator power calculations and ultimately deciding the number of
      participants that will be needed for the larger study.
