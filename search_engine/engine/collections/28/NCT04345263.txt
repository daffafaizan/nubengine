    
      -  The target sample size is 150 patients medically fit, having vital teeth with carious
           pulp exposure and complaining of pain.

        -  The patients tooth will receive full pulpotomy under aseptic conditions and it will be
           randomly assigned to one of 3 calcium silicate based materials namely, MTA, Biodentine,
           and Bioceramic for capping the full pulpotomy followed by resin composite restoration.

        -  Follow up for pain levels will be done during the first week.

        -  clinical and radiographic examination will be done at 6 months, 1 year and yearly up to

           of pathology in the root and periapex on periapical radiographs.

        -  The 3 materials will be compared in terms of clinical and radiographic outcomes.

        -  demographic data of the three groups will be also compared

        -  predictive factors of success will be also analyzed

        -  tooth color changes will be also measured using vita easy shade and will compared
