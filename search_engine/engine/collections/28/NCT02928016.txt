      meals at noon between 1200 and 1300 hours, with and without the addition of 11 ml extra
      virgin oil, in random order. One week before entering the study, participants kept a detailed
      7-day weighed food record with fingerprick blood glucose measurements pre-and-2hour
      post-meals for calculation of their carbohydrate (g) to insulin (units) ratio. Moreover, the
      individual correction factor was calculated. Thereafter, insulin requirements for the test
      meals were calculated based on the carbohydrate content of each dish and according to the
      personalised carbohydrate to insulin ratio. Postprandial glycemia was measured in capillary
      blood glucose samples at 30min intervals over 195min. For 24hr before each testing session,
      participants were asked to refrain from the consumption of alcohol and to maintain their
      usual physical activity pattern. On the day of testing, subjects were asked to consume their
      usual breakfast and abstain from food for at least 2 hours before their appointment. If blood
      glucose was >7.2 mmol/l at 1200, insulin was administered based on the individualised
      correction factor. If blood glucose was >10 mmol/l at the beginning of the testing session,
      insulin was administered to correct it and the subject was asked to return on another day. if
      hypoglycaemia occurred (defined as blood glucose level <3.8 mmol/l), the test session was
      stopped, the event was recorded and the patient treated appropriately. The on target 2hour
      postprandial blood glucose level was set between 3.9 and 10 mmol/l. Anthropometric
      measurements (body weight, waist and hip circumferences) were performed at every visit.
