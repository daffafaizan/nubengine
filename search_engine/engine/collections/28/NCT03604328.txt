    
      Participants who are currently managing their Open Angle Glaucoma with combination drop
      therapy will be recruited. Drop therapy will cease in the treatment eye and continue in the
      contralateral eye. The treated eye will receive via injection, a single PA5108 ocular
      implant. Participants will be monitored for safety and tolerability of the ocular implant
      until it completely biodegrades.
