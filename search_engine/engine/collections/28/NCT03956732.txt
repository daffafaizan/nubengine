      vitamin D supplements or placebo, in healthy 6-8 year-old Danish children. The study is a
      2×2-factorial randomized controlled trial with 4 study arms. The subjects will be randomly
      allocated to receive yoghurt products with either high or medium protein content (300g/day, 6
      days/week) and to receive tablets with either vitamin D (20 μg/day) or placebo for 24 weeks.
      Measurements and biological sampling will be performed at baseline and at the end of the
      intervention.

      The primary outcome will be bone mineral density (BMD). The investigators will also measure
      effects on children's muscle function, cardiometabolic health, body composition, growth and
      growth factors, nutrient status, immune defence and risk of acute respiratory tract
      infections, as well as appetite hormones. The investigators will also assess potential
      sex-specific effects and the potential modifying effect of genotype.
