      Primary

        -  To evaluate the toxicities associated with aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic
           therapy when administered continuously or in fractionated doses in patients with
           premalignant or early stage head and neck lesions.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of photodynamic therapy. Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral aminolevulinic acid and then undergo continuous
           photodynamic therapy 4-6 hours later.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive aminolevulinic acid as in arm I and then undergo fractionated
           photodynamic therapy 4-6 hours later.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.
