    
      KN026 is an anti-HER2 bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping
      epitopes of HER2, leading to a dual HER2 signal blockade.The HER2- positive mBC subjects
      without systemic treatment will be enrolled in cohort 1 and received 30 mg/kg KN026 and
      docetaxol. The HER2 low expression and hormone-receptor positive mBC subjects failed standard
      chemotherapy and hormone therapy will be enrolled in cohort 2 and received 30 mg/kg KN026
      monotherapy. The HER2 low expression and hormone-receptor negative/weak positive mBC subjects
      failed standard chemotherapy will be enrolled in cohort 3 and received 30 mg/kg KN026 and 5
      mg/kg KN046
