    
      Smokers (n = 722; 10 pilot participants and 712 main trial participants) will be recruited
      when they call to enroll in services with their state-supported tobacco quitline program.
      Eligible smokers who provide consent and complete the baseline assessment will be randomized
      to either usual care quitline intervention plus attention-matched text messaging or an
      enhanced program which integrates standard tobacco cessation counseling with a multi-modal,
      behavioral oral health promotion program.

      Follow-up assessments will be conducted by phone at 2 and 6 months post-enrollment. In
      addition to examining primary and secondary outcomes of interest (focused on tobacco
      cessation and utilization of professional dental care), change in potentially relevant
      intermediate process measures and the incremental cost of delivering the Oral Health 4 Life
      program will be examined.
