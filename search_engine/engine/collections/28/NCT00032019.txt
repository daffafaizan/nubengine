        -  Determine the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients
           with previously untreated aggressive CD20+ B-cell diffuse large cell or immunoblastic
           large cell lymphoma treated with rituximab, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine,
           prednisone, and cyclophosphamide.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor proliferation rate (MIB-1), bcl-2 expression, and p53 overexpression
           with complete response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1; doxorubicin IV continuously, etoposide IV
      continuously, and vincristine IV continuously on days 1-4; oral prednisone twice daily on
      days 1-5; and cyclophosphamide IV on day 5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After 4 courses, patients with complete or partial response receive 2
      additional courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
