      capacity in preterm adults, as seen in other at-risk populations, in correlation with
      measures of vascular health, heart and muscle perfusion and oxygenation, and pulmonary
      function detected by cutting edge and highly sensitive imaging and circulating biomarkers.
      These markers are more sensitive to pre-disease changes than traditional health measures, and
      are largely unexplored in preterm populations.

      The investigators will:

        1. Determine whether a 14-week supervised exercise training improves exercise capacity in
           young adults (18-29 years old) born very preterm at <29 weeks gestational age.

        2. Examine whether improvement in exercise capacity is associated with changes in (a)
           markers of vascular health including circulating endothelial progenitor cells and
           microparticles, (b) cardiac perfusion by cutting-edge oxygenation-sensitive
           cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (c) lung regional ventilation measured
           by newly developed hydrogen proton (1H) MRI, (d) muscle oxygenation during exercise.

        3. Compare the response of the above measures to exercise intervention between young adults
           born very preterm and term controls.
