      center - Riyadh). A total of 15 endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients will be matched with
      15 laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients by age, gender and BMI. Total sample size is 30
      patients. Sample size was selected based on literature, considering the sample will be
      surgical patients and based on booked patients in the clinic. A multidisciplinary team will
      provide post-procedure care (including post-surgery diet stages protocol given by the
      center).
