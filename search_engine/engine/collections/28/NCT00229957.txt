      line. Rehabilitation has been identified as one service that should be offered in primary
      care, to address the needs of adults who have or are at risk of poor health from chronic
      conditions such as arthritis, heart disease and depression.

      Two full time therapists (one physiotherapist and one occupational therapist) will offer
      rehabilitation to a sample of 170 adults with chronic illness over an 18 month period (170
      people will also be enrolled in a control group) at the Stonechurch Family Health Centre. Key
      outcomes include health, hospital admissions and emergency room visits.
