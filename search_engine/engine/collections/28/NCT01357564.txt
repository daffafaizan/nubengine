      reduce the burden of NPS in Veterans with dementia who live at home with family caregivers.
      The innovative intervention, the Tailored Activity Program (TAP-VA), involves 8 sessions over
      4 months in Veterans' homes. An occupational therapist conducts a systematic assessment to
      identify a Veteran's preserved capabilities and deficit areas, and previous roles, habits and
      interests from which to develop and introduce activities tailored to the Veteran's profile.
      Family caregivers are then trained to incorporate tailored activities into daily care
      routines. The intervention was pilot tested in an NIMH funded study with 60 community-living
      individuals with dementia. Findings from this pilot showed statistically significant and
      clinically meaningful reductions in NPS, specifically agitation and less time being on "duty"
      by family caregivers. Results of this pilot phase support moving forward with a full-scale
      Phase III efficacy trial. The investigators tested TAP-VA in a randomized two-group parallel
      design in which 160 racially and ethnically diverse Veterans with dementia and their family
      caregivers (dyads) were randomly assigned to receive TAP-VA or an attention control group.
      All dyads were evaluated at baseline and 4-months (main trial endpoint), and then reassessed
      at 8-months to evaluate long-term treatment effects (baseline to 8 months), including
      continued activity use, caregiver well-being, and costs.
