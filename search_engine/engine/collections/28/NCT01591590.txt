      aggressiveness as opposed to some other's indolent behavior has never been formally assessed
      in daily practice or in clinical studies and remains largely unpredictable. The patient's
      populations are in fact a mix between different tumoral phenotypes that while carrying the
      same apparent disease evolve with different outcomes.

      We hypothesize that,in a population of patients with advanced colorectal cancer for which no
      known effective therapy is available, measuring the spontaneous evolution of tumoral
      metabolic progression index by serial FGD PET-CT and Diffusion MRI can show that tumor growth
      rate is related to the patient's outcome, and that serial FDG PET-CT and Diffusion MRI are
      able to measure it.

      If the hypothesis is verified, this finding could:

        -  Allow to define therapeutic strategies according to the tumoral metabolic progression
           index.

        -  Limit the need for randomization in the early drug development phases as each patient
           could be considered as his own control.

        -  To stratify patients according to their baseline metabolic growth rate in randomized
           controlled trials with overall survival as an endpoint.
