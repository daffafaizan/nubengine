      regimen, no widely accepted standard second line therapy currently exists. Taxanes including
      paclitaxel and docetaxel have exhibited limited clinical activity in this disease and are
      sometimes given off study. Cabazitaxel is a novel semi-synthetic taxane with a low affinity
      for the multidrug resistance 1 protein. In cell lines cabazitaxel is as potent as docetaxel,
      but in tumor cells that are resistant to taxanes, cabazitaxel overcome taxanes resistance.

      In recent clinical data, this drug was shown to have potent activity in patients with
      metastatic prostate cancer resistant to docetaxel. Based on this phase III data, cabazitaxel
      was recently approved in the US, Europe and in Israel for these patients. The main toxicity
      of this taxane is neutropenia and diarrhea, thus primary prevention with GCSF may reduce the
      main toxicity of this agent.

      In this phase II multicenter study, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of this novel taxane -cabazitaxel as single agent second-line chemotherapy for
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

      The patients are planned to receive cabazitaxel at a starting dose of 25 mg/m(2)
      intravenously over 1 h, following premedication as accepted with cabazitaxel. Treatment
      cycles are every 3 weeks. All patients will receive primary GCSF support.
