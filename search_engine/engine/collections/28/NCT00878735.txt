      autonomic activity. Until today, there have been very few imaging studies of the neural
      correlates of meditation. Instead of evaluating the meditation practice itself, our approach
      is to evaluate the neural correlates of performance modulation on an attention paradigm (the
      Stroop word-color task; SWCT) and an emotional paradigm (the frustration paradigm) before and
      after a meditation retreat. The following categories of individuals will be invited to
      participate: healthy regular meditation practitioners (at least three years of practice,
      three times a week), individuals inexperienced in meditation, and patients with a cancer
      diagnosis. The total sample will comprise 96 individuals who will be allocated to groups of
      sesshin meditation, rest groups and groups that will keep their daily activities. If they
      wish to do so, those who participate in the two latter groups may also receive training on
      meditation. The subjects will be between 18 and 65 years old and have no contraindication to
      the fMRI exam. After signing an informed consent form, the subjects will answer anxiety,
      depression and stress inventories; scales that evaluate their feelings of self-compassion and
      mindfulness, as well as the Stroop Color Word task and an emotional paradigm of functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
