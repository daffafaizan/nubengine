      implementation intentions, which are self-regulatory strategies taking the form of "if-then"
      plans (i.e. situation-solution plan).

      Injecting risk behaviour scores and self-efficacy scores will be analysed for differences
      between intervention and control groups.

      To control for contact-time with the researchers, participants in the control group will
      spend approximately 20 minutes with the researcher exploring Zimbardo's time perspective
      constructs (ZTPI, Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) and completing the short Zimbardo's time perspective
      inventory (Orosz et al. 2017). The inventory was selected because the cognitive processes
      involved in accessing time constructs will also be activated in the intervention group for
      the planning of coping strategies and goal achievement during future injecting risk
      situations.

      The study also aims:

        -  To assess the variability in injecting risk behaviour as explained by subjective norms,
           social connectedness and group identification constructs;

        -  To assess the variability in intervention effectiveness as explained by changes in
           mental health, illness perception subjective norms, social connectedness, and group
           identification.
