      Primary

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with completely resected non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with conformal thoracic radiotherapy vs no radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity, in particular cardiac and pulmonary toxicity, of these regimens
           in these patients.

        -  Compare the local control in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine patterns of recurrence in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess second cancers in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess prognostic factors and predictive factors of treatment effect on disease-free
           survival and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the cost per recurrence-free year of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study.

      Patients are stratified according to participating center, prior chemotherapy (neoadjuvant
      alone vs adjuvant vs none), number of lymph stations involved (0 vs 1 vs â‰¥ 2), histology
      (squamous cell vs other), and use of pretreatment positron emission tomography scans (yes vs
      no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning within 4-8 weeks after surgery or 2-6 weeks after chemotherapy,
           patients undergo adjuvant thoracic conformal radiotherapy once daily, 5 days per week,
           for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients do not undergo adjuvant thoracic radiotherapy. After completion of
           study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 700 patients will be accrued for this study.
