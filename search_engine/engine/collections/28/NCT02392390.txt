        -  To estimate changes in several microbiological parameters over three time periods
           (before treatment, after applying the MetvixiaÂ® and after irradiation during a single
           TDP session).

        -  Describe the evolution of the size and appearance of the wound 7d after the start of
           treatment

        -  Describe the potential adverse events associated with a TDP session
