      capecitabine in advanced gastric and gastro-esophageal adenocarcinomas. Docetaxel 30mg/m2
      will be administered on days 1 and 8 of each cycle and capecitabine 825mg/m2 bid (total daily
      dose 1650mg/m2) will be administered orally for 14 days (days 1-14) of each cycle. Each cycle
      is 21 days. Subjects will receive unlimited cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine until there
      is evidence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects.
