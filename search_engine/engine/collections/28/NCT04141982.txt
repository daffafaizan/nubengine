      stored for 0-8 hours post venepuncture and isolated via density gradient separation and
      positive selection with magnetic bead isolation using the T-Cell SelectTM Kit will be
      assessed. Concordance between results of the T-SPOT.TB assay at 0-8 hours post venepuncture
      and using cells isolated with density gradient centrifugation and results obtained from cells
      isolated using the T-Cell Select Kit, following storage between 0-55 hours post venepuncture,
      will be assessed.
