      is to determine the efficacy of the HEART (Heart Failure Exercise and Resistance Training)
      Camp behavioral exercise training intervention on long-term adherence to exercise at 18
      months in patients with HF. A sample size of 246 subjects with heart failure will be
      recruited over a 3 year period. All subjects will receive a cardiopulmonary exercise test and
      9 supervised exercise training sessions during a 3 week run-in period prior to randomization.
      Subjects completing 6 of 9 training sessions will be randomized to the HEART Camp
      Intervention group (HC) or to an enhanced usual care (EUC) exercise group. The HC
      intervention group will receive cognitive-behavioral strategies that address the intervention
      components of knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, behavioral self-management skills and
      social support. The EUC group is provided access to the exercise facility and regular
      facility staff for the 18 month study period. Our central hypothesis is that the HC group
      will have significantly better adherence to exercise at 18 months. We will test our
      hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To evaluate the effect of HEART Camp on
      adherence to exercise (measured by self-report and validated by heart rate monitor); Aim 2.
      To evaluate which components of the HEART Camp intervention mediate the effects of the
      intervention on adherence; Aim 3. To evaluate the effect of HEART Camp on specific health
      outcomes; Aim 4. To explore selected demographic variables (age, race, gender, body mass
      index and left ventricular ejection fraction) as potential moderators of the effect of the
      HEART Camp intervention on adherence; and Aim 5. To explore the perceptions and experiences
      that contextualize exercise adherence.
