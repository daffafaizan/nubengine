      I. To evaluate the image quality of yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (90Y) PET/CT post SIRT
      images as compared to technetium Tc-99m albumin aggregated (99mTc MAA) SPECT/CT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the superior accuracy in both distribution and dosimetry of 90Y PET/CT post
      SIRT imaging compared to 99mTc MAA planar and SPECT/CT imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Immediately after standard of care SIRT, patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres and
      undergo PET/CT over 30 minutes.
