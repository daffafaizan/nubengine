      and every 5 minutes perioperatively and recorded. Also the heart rates,arterial oxygen
      saturation (SaO2), airway pressures and end-tidal carbon dioxide values will be recorded
      before and following induction of anesthesia and in 1st., 5th., 10th. minutes and every five
      minutes perioperatively. Patients will be followed during the hospital stay for any
