    
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without diabetic nephropathy will be
      identified from clinical records and approached for their interest in participating in the
      study. Written informed consent will be obtained from patients who qualify according to the
      eligibility criteria and agree to join the study.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Male or female aged between 21 and 75 years (inclusive).

        2. Has confirmed type 2 diabetes mellitus

        3. With or without diabetic nephropathy based on recent complication screening

        4. Written informed consent given

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Has amputation of arm or leg

        2. Uses beta blockers or drugs known to affect the sympathetic nervous system

        3. Has an electrical implantable device (pacemaker, defibrillator)

        4. Known to have sensitivity to nickel or any other standard electrodes

        5. Sufferers from epilepsy or seizures

        6. Patients on renal replacement therapy

        7. Patients with chronic kidney disease due to known non-diabetes causes e.g. renal stone
           or obstructive uropathy.

        8. Patients confirmed to have urinary tract infection on the day of assessment.

      Primary endpoint:

        1. The optimal eZscan unit to detect the presence of diabetic nephropathy as defined by
           eGFR and ACR using ROC analysis, sensitivity and specificity values.

           Other analysis:

        2. A prediction algorithm using age, sex, body mass index and eZcan score will be developed
           to predict eGFR as continuous and categorical variables using Cox regression analysis.

        3. Students t test and analysis of variance will be used to compare the eZcan values
           between patients with and those without diabetic nephropathy with age and sex adjustment
           Frequency of adverse events will also be listed.
