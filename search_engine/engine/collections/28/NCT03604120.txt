    
      This study will be designed as followed: Patients will be randomized in 2 groups:

        -  Preoxygenation during 4 minutes with High Flow Nasal Cannula (60l/min FiO2 = 1) before
           and during intubation. The device will be maintained in place throughout the intubation
           procedure (including fiber-optic or laryngoscopic) in order to achieve oxygenation.

        -  Or Standard Preoxygenation during 4 minutes with FIBROXYÂ® (Fiber-optic intubation) or
           standard facial mask (Laryngoscopic intubation), at FiO2=100%. FIBROXY mask will be
           maintained in place during the fiberoptic procedure. Standard facial mask, will be
           removed after the crash induction.
