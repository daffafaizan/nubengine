      ventilated. Patients will have a baseline tympanic temperature measurement taken and then
      will be randomized to receive induction of TH by either RhinoChill Transnasal cooling system,
      or standard care using the Blanketrol III cooling blanket.

      All patients will have tympanic and oesophageal temperature measurement every 10 minutes
      until they reach TH (<34 degrees centigrade). Once TH is achieved, the RhinoChill will be
      discontinued, and all patients will then receive the Blanketrol III cooling blanket for
      maintenance of TH for the standard 24 hour period. If a patient achieves a core body temp of
      34 degrees centigrade while undergoing RhinoChill cooling and is still on the cath lab table,
      the device will be turned to low flow to ensure that the temperature is maintained until a
      transfer to the Blanketrol system is possible. For patients that arrive in the ICU on
      RhinoChill with a temperature >34 (i.e. have not reached TH), these patients will have
      RhinoChill and blanket therapy until they reach <34 degrees centigrade when the RhinoChill
      will be discontinued.
