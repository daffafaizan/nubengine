    
      Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible mCRC patients are enrolled. the
      chest-abdonimal-pelvic CT with brain MRI and blood tests are examined to assess base-line
      measurable lesions and guarantee adequate organ function prior to enrollment. The written
      consents are signed before enrollment. Randomise patients into two arms: Arm A-apatinib plus
      FOLFIRI regimen and arm B-bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI regimen. Patients will be given full-dose
      drugs or reduced-dose drugs if serious toxicities ( CTCAE v4.0 criteria grade 3/4) are
      complained since previous cycle of treatment.

      Symptoms and blood test results (including carcinoembryonic antigen（CEA）and CA199) before
      each cycle will be recorded. Radiological assessment consisting of chest-abdonimal-pelvic CT
      together with brain MRI will be performed every 3 months.

      Collect biopsy specimens and peripheral blood from mCRC patients every 3 months since
      randomisation. Identify differential biomarkers between apatinib and bevacizumab and define
      these biomarkers' prognostic and predictive significances.
