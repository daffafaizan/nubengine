      I. To determine if haploidentical stem cell transplant using post-transplant cyclophosphamide
      results in 60% or better disease free survival (DFS) at 12 months at our institution.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), non-relapse
      mortality, and relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) once daily
      (QD) on days -6 to -2. Patients receiving myeloablative conditioning receive busulfan IV
      every 6 hours for 16 doses on days -7 to -4 and patients receiving reduced intensity
      conditioning receive busulfan IV every 6 hours for 8 doses on days -5 to -4. Patients also
      receive cyclophosphamide IV QD on days -3 and -2

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo stem cell transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide QD on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus on days
      5-180, and mycophenolate mofetil on days 5-35.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
