      information seems to be a promising way to reduce anxiety of patients. In the case of
      surgical patients, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is strongly associated with
      uncertainty, unpredictability and anxiety for the patient. Thus, ICU-specific information
      could have a high clinical impact. For this reason this study will evaluate the efficacy of
      an ICU-specific information program for patients who undergo elective cardiac, abdominal or
      thoracic surgery and are scheduled for ICU stay.

      Methods: The trial is designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial including an
      intervention and a control group. The control group receives the standard preparation
      currently conducted by surgeons and anesthesists. The intervention group additionally
      receives a standardized information program with specific procedural, sensory and coping
      information about the ICU. In addition the moderating effect of certain personality
      characteristics (need for cognition, high trait anxiety) will be investigated to identify
      groups of patients who benefit most from the information program.

      Expected Results: A clinically relevant difference in anxiety and unpleasant experiences
      related to the ICU is expected after discharge from the ICU. Power calculation (alpha = 0.05;
      beta = 0.20; delta = 8.50 score points) resulted in a required sample size of N = 120 cardiac
      surgical patients (n = 60 vs. n = 60). Furthermore, N = 20 abdominal or thoracic surgical
      patients will be recruited (n = 10 vs. n = 10).

      Conclusion: The proposed study promises to strengthen evidence on the effects of a specific,
      concise information program and thus should contribute to evidence based nursing (EBN).
