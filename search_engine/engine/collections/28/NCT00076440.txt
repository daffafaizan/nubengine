      hormone drug) to improve the cognitive function and slow the progression of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). The study will include treatment of men 65 years and older with mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's disease who reside in the community. The objective is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of two different doses of leuprolide to improve the cognitive function
      and slow the progression of AD, as measured by the ADAS-COG and the Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI). Measures of behavioral disturbances, and quality of life of the caregiver
      will be made also. The study design is randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group design with a 2:1 randomization of drug to placebo. Sample size will include 90
      participants from multiple test sites.

      Following initial screening and baseline visits, the participant and caregiver will visit the
      site 8 times for a total of 10 visits over 48 weeks. The drug is administered via injection
      every 3 months. Safety assessments are completed and psychometric testing is done.
      Participant's memory, behavior, and global functioning are assessed during the participant
      and caregiver interviews. Each visit takes approximately 2 hours.
