    
      The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is to determine the duration of response of the
      sequential administration of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody followed by six cycles of CHOP for
      patients with previously untreated MCL. The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are
      to determine the response rate, confirmed response rate, complete response rate, confirmed
      complete response rate, duration of response for confirmed responders, duration of response
      for complete responders, duration of response for confirmed complete responders,
      progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and the predictive value of detection
      of minimal residual disease by molecular techniques on response duration. The pharmacokinetic
      endpoint is to determine the total body residence time of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody
      following the dosimetric dose. The safety endpoints are to determine the incidence of adverse
      experiences, hematologic toxicity, (e.g., nadir, time to nadir, and time to recovery), use of
      supportive care, percent of patients converting to human anti-murine antibody (HAMA)
      positivity, the effects of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody on the growth and function of
      hematopoietic progenitor cells, and survival of patients with previously untreated MCL
      treated with Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody followed by six cycles of CHOP.
