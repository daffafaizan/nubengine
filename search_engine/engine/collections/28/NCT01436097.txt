      Roybal Center on Behavioral Economics and Health. Interventions to increase the consumption
      of fruits and vegetables to date have shown promise, but many have limited public health
      impact due to the lack of scalability of their designs. Many interventions only provided
      information on what constitutes healthier eating or provided discounts on specific
      products.Other interventions were limited in generalizability due to utilization of very
      specific eating establishments or vending machines.By contrast, the investigators propose to
      examine the effectiveness and feasibility of an intervention for promoting increased
      consumption of fruits and vegetables by incentivizing their purchase where the overwhelming
      majority of food is sold: grocery stores. Collaborating with Brown's Super Stores and UpLift
      Solutions leadership, the investigators will enroll shoppers in this Randomized Clinical
      Trial using our the web-based research infrastructure called the Way to Health platform.

      The primary aim of this project is to generate preliminary evidence of the efficacy of two
      financial incentive structures in promoting the allocation of a greater percentage of ones
      grocery budget to the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables (hereafter, produce). Secondary
      aims are to evaluate these interventions effects on (1) self-reported consumption of produce,
      and (2) weight. Salutary goals of this pilot study are to document feasibility of using Price
      Plus cards for incentive studies, and to expand the functionality of the Way Health platform.
