      intestine, any disease involving the cecum affects overall functioning of the large bowel.
      Primary cecal pathologies presenting as acute abdomen often pose a challenge to their optimal
      management due to requirement of urgent intervention in most cases and being a common source
      of misdiagnosis. These pathologies often mimic acute appendicitis and commonly misdiagnosed
      as one. This misdiagnosis can lead to under-treatment of the underlying pathology and this
      results in high morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions. So the accurate
      identification of such conditions is required so that the patients can be optimally managed
      and patient outcome can be improved.
