      top reasons for seeking healthcare. High-impact low back pain is particularly problematic,
      defined as chronic pain accompanied by significant restrictions in work, social, and/or
      self-care activities for six months or more. High-impact pain is associated with greater
      pain-related disability, opioid use, and healthcare costs compared to pain of lower impact.
      Thus, efforts to reduce chronic pain impact have become a public health initiative. Low back
      pain and overweight/obesity are highly comorbid; overweight and obese individuals are up to
      43% more likely to have cLBP compared to normal weight individuals. Together, the additive
      effects of overweight/obesity and chronic pain may play a larger role in increasing the risk
      for other adverse health-related comorbidities.

      The aim of this exploratory study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an
      integrated pain and weight management intervention (EMPOWER) for middle-aged and older adults
      with moderate-to-high impact low back pain by addressing mechanisms of environmental reward
      and positive affect. Forty adults (ages 45-80 years) with comorbid overweight/obesity (BMIâ‰¥25
      kg/m2) and moderate-to-high impact cLBP will be assigned to an 8-month intervention, whereby
      they will receive a group- and telephone-based program featuring integrated behavioral weight
      loss treatment and cognitive-behavioral pain coping therapy. To address the key mechanisms of
      environmental reward and positive affect, the proposed intervention will incorporate
      systematic pleasant activity scheduling and values-clarification techniques. Assessments will
      be conducted at baseline and at the 4- and 8-month time points.
