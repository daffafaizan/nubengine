      healthy volunteers (Group 2 and 3 respectively). No investigational medicinal product will be
      administered. For all participants enrolled (Group 1 to 3) the study will consist of an
      eligibility screening examination (from Day -21 up to and including Day 1) and 3 cognitive
      assessment days. Cognitive assessments will be made on 2 subsequent days (Days 1 and 2) which
      are separated by overnight sleep. In addition, a session will be performed on Day 7.
      Completion of the cognitive test batteries can occur at any time during the day provided that
      the completion time is comparable on all test days. For each participant, the maximal study
      duration will not exceed 4 weeks.
