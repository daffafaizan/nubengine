      genetic variations that predict response. Our hypothesis is that effective acamprosate
      response in alcohol dependent subjects may be influenced by genetically controlled variation
      in the functionality of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) and/or the type 5
      metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5). Hypothesis confirmation could lead to development
      of effective individualized treatment recommendations for alcohol dependent patients based on
      pharmacogenomically relevant genetic variations.

      The general goal is to identify genetic polymorphic variants that differentiate subjects
      continuously abstinent for six months while taking acamprosate from relapsed subjects. The
      initial analysis will determine whether any of ten polymorphisms in four target genes (GRIN1,
      GRIN2A and GRIN2B that code for the NMDA receptor and GRM5 that codes for the type mGluR5
      receptor) are associated with successful abstinence. Subsequent analyses will examine whether
      variation in a comprehensive set of 383 linkage disequilibrium haplotype tagged single
      nucleotide polymorphisms of these four genes predicts successfully abstinent subjects.
