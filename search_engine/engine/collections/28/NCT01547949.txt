      a study among healthy, non-exercising individuals demonstrated that tart cherries decreased
      post-exercise weakness and muscle pain. The purpose of this study is to assess the analgesic
      and myoprotective effects of tart cherry juice among healthy subjects in a randomized,
      placebo controlled, double-blind, crossover design trial. Fifteen healthy individuals will
      perform a bout of eccentric elbow flexion contractions (2 x 10 near maximum), and will then
      ingest 10 fl oz of a cherry juice or a placebo juice twice a day for four days, beginning
      immediately post exercise. Before and after exercise, and for three days following the
      eccentric exercise, blood will be drawn to measure serum biomarkers of muscle damage and
      muscle soreness will be recorded. The protocol will be repeated after a 9-10 day washout
      period with subjects consuming the alternative juice for the second trial. The opposite arm
      will perform the eccentric exercise for the second bout to avoid the repeated bout protective
      effect. The study's outcomes are 1) to assess changes in serum biomarkers of muscle damage,
      and 2) to assess changes in muscle soreness.
