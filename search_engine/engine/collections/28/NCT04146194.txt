      department of the University Hospital of NÃ®mes and the Karis medical centre of Perpignan for
      a pelvi-perineal pathology. Other centres will be gradually incremented. Patients will have
      received a letter of information and no objection to the prospective collection of her data
      as part of routine management without any other intervention. These patients should not have
      any contraindications to the use of these new therapies.

      At inclusion, the patient receives a pelvic-perineal clinical examination and a functional
      assessment (vaginal sampling), pain (EVA). The FSFI questionnaire will be administered.

      During this visit, the investigator will set up a treatment with a new therapy. This
      treatment will be chosen by the operator before recommendations are made. The operator must
      detail the type of device and the protocol chosen.

      The patient will be reviewed 4 weeks after the end of her treatment: she will benefit from an
      evaluation identical in all respects to the inclusion visit with the administration of the
      PGI-I questionnaire.

      All information concerning the discontinuation, continuation or change of treatment will be
      documented in this follow-up phase.

      In case of failure, second line treatment may be offered. Possible adverse reactions will be
      collected at all times.
