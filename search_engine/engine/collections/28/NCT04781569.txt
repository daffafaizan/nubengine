      to obtain a comprehensive view of S. aureus adaptations in the infected human host and (i) to
      improve the understanding of the interface between antibiotic therapy, resistance development
      and virulence factor adaptation in S. aureus infected patients, and (ii) to adapt these
      findings into a more sustainable use of antimicrobials for therapy.

      Patients with S. aureus infections who will routinely undergo diagnostic and surgical
      procedures will be identified. Intraoperative samples from the site of infection during
      surgery will be taken. Additionally, two blood drawing events (22.5ml in total) will be
      performed and nose swabs will be taken. The biological material will be analysed. This
      project will be the first to study different phenotypes of invasive S. aureus directly from
      its environment in vivo.
