      defects in sperm production (spermatogenic defect) account for about half of these cases. In
      Drosophila and mouse, targeted disruptions of numerous sterility- associated genes have been
      created. Physiological studies in the Drosophila and in mouse also indicate that
      spermatogenesis is subjected to complex regulation, and male infertility may result from
      aberrant regulatory events. In the human being, deletions of the Y chromosome account for
      only 10% of cases with spermatogenic defect, and etiologies of remaining 90% of cases are
      still unknown. It is evident that multiple genes are involved in male infertility. For cases
      with severe spermatogenic defect , testicular histology shows either decreased number of germ
      cells in all developmental stages (hypospermatogenesis) or complete absence of germ cells
      (Sertoli cell only syndrome or SCOS). It appears that there is an intrinsic defect which
      causes depletion of germ-line stem cells (spermatogonia) for cases with hypospermatogenesis
      or SCOS. Of 25 genes exclusively expressed in mouse spermatogonia, 3 are Y-linked, 10 are
      X-linked, and only 12 are distributed on autosomes.
