    
      Methods:

      60 clinically stable SZ patients and 60 controls will be administered MET, as well as two
      measures of executive function: Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - 64, 6 Elements Test. Functional
      outcome will be assessed through Behavioural Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF-A),
      ECHELLES LAUSANNOISES D'AUTO-EVALUATION DES DIFFICULTES ET DES BESOINS (ELADEB scale) and
      Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF scale). Clinical measures will be recorded in
      patients (Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Y
      (STAI-Y A), Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) and Family Interview for Genetic
      Studies (FIGS)).

      Step1: The investigators will first compare patients and controls on all variables of MET and
      establish normative data.

      Step 2: The investigators will then study the discriminant validity of MET. The investigators
      will compare MET with traditional measures of executive functioning. The investigators will
      assess the correlation between each executive measure and functional outcome.
