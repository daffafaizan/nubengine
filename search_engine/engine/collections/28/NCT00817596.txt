      medical treatment. Chronic pain and spasticity seriously reduce the quality of life and
      restrict normal daily activities for many people. The first line of defense is normally oral
      medications. However, a significant number of these patients require additional or
      alternative therapy due to the side effects of the oral medications or the intractable nature
      of the condition.

      In 1979, Wand et. al. found that small amounts of morphine, when injected into the
      sub-arachnoid space, had significant affect in reducing pain. Since that time a number of
      drug products and infusion pumps have been developed to address this condition. The primary
      drug used for this purpose in preservative-free morphine sulfate solution which is delivered
      via an implanted intrathecal catheter. The Prometra Intrathecal Pump System is only the
      second programmable pump to be used in the treatment of chronic pain.
