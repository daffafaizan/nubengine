      mortality [1-4]. Hemostasis can be challenging during complex cardiac surgery, particularly
      due to friability of the tissue, coagulopathy, poor visualization of the surgical field, and
      limited accessibility to bleeding sites [5]. Failure to achieve and maintain hemostasis and
      reinforce fragile tissue may result in additional bleeding, which can further reduce
      visualization, increase operative blood loss, lengthen surgery, increase the use of blood
      products, and contribute to postoperative complications and reoperation [1-4].

      Postoperative bleeding is a significant concern in cardio-thoracic surgery. Bleeding, either
      intraoperative or postoperative, has been associated with extended in-hospital length of
      stay, reoperations, severe morbidity and death [12]. In addition to surgical technique, a
      variety of therapeutic agents are available to assist in hemostasis. Surgical sealants are
      used to prevent suture line bleeding when ligation or conventional methods are ineffective or
      impractical [13]. CoSeal® Surgical Sealant (CoSeal®, Baxter, Westlake Village, CA) is a
      synthetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer [11, 13]. The polymers cross-link with proteins
      in the tissue and begin to gel in approximately 5 seconds and set within 60 seconds, forming
      a strong, flexible, clear, degradable hydrogel that adheres to both tissue and synthetic
      graft surfaces [11, 13-14]. A secure seal is maintained through covalent tissue bonds even
      under high pressures in vessels, such as the aorta [15]. The gel is completely resorbed
      within 30 days [14].
