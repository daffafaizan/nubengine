      activity (EBA) of four anti-tuberculosis regimens. Participants with acid fast bacilli (AFB)
      smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were hospitalized from screening through Day 15 of the
      study, during which time, sputum, blood, and urine were collected. Participants returned to
      the clinic on Day 28 for the final visit. The study duration was 29 days.

      The purpose of the study was to estimate the primary outcome within each study arm and the
      study was not designed for between arm comparisons.
