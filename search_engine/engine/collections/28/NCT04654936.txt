      intervention) x time(baseline Vs follow up) ANOVA with repeated measures design. Outcome
      measures for COM-B, cognitive function, mood and quality of life were recorded for both the
      intervention and control groups. With power set at .80, and alpha = .05, G*Power indicated
      that a sample size of 36 would be required. Forty-one participants took part in the study.
      Participants were healthy male, and female aged between 40-55 years old living in Northern
      Ireland.

      There are 2 intervention arms and one control group. The intervention was designed using the
      Behaviour Change Wheel, with prior qualitative research informing the intervention.

      All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
      (SPSS) with significance set at P < 0.05 throughout
