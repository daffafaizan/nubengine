      nutrient intake is pivotal to maintain muscle mass. Yet, optimal amounts of protein are
      undefined for preventing or treating sarcopenia in people with cancer as most methodological
      approaches to assess protein requirements are expensive, burdensome and unfeasible for this
      population. This study's overarching goal is to investigate the potential efficacy of diets
      of different protein content on: 1) muscle mass maintenance (primary endpoint); and 2)
      improvements on physical function in cancer patients capable of oral nutrition support.
      Additional study measurements include: energy metabolism (including total body), body
      composition using multi-compartment models, blood biomarkers, and quality of life.

      In a randomized controlled trial approach, we will employ high protein feeding (2 g/kg/d,
      n=16) versus a standard recommendation (1 g/kg/d, n=16) in patients with newly diagnosed
      colorectal cancer for 12 weeks. Prescribed energy intakes will be framed by the amount of
      calories to meet energy needs and to support protein synthesis, but prevent fat mass gain.
      Carbohydrate, fat and protein intake will be adjusted throughout the intervention to achieve
      the desired rate and amount of energy and protein intake. An oral protein powder supplement
      made from high-quality whey protein will be provided to the participants to help increase
      their protein intake as needed. A multivitamin will be given to all participants throughout
      the study. Participants will receive weekly calls from the study coordinator to ensure
      adherence to the dietary intervention.
