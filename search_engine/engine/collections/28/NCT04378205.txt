    
      Forty healthy patients with lower arch mild crowding with less than 2mm contact point
      displacement at any teeth were included. A split mouth study design was applied. Where each
      patient received 2 archwire sizes at one time joined in the midline by crimpable hook and
      applied in the lower arch.

      Patients were assigned into one of 2 groups based on archwire sizes used. Group (1);
      0.014-inch and 0.018-inch NiTi and Group (2); 0.016-inch and 0.018-inch NiTi. A Laser Doppler
      Flowmeter was used to measure PBF at different time intervals (T0-T5).
