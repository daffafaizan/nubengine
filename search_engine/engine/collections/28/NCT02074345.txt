      evaluate its safety and immune response after intramuscular (IM) injection with TAK-816. This
      study evaluated adverse events and the seroprotection rate and geometric mean titer (GMT) of
      anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP)-antibodies in participants who were administered
      TAK-816 IM.

      The study enrolled 31 participants. All participants received 3 doses of TAK-816 IM at 4-week
      intervals as part of the primary vaccination and 1 booster vaccination 52 weeks after the
      third dose of the primary vaccination.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study
      was 64 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic including a final visit 4 weeks
      after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
