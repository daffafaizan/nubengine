      characterized by absent or severely reduced capacity to catabolize circulating LDL particles
      by the hepatic LDL receptor. As a consequence, HoFH subjects present abnormal total plasma
      cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, resulting in severe atherosclerosis often leading to early onset
      of cardiovascular disease. Early initiation of aggressive treatment for these patients is
      therefore essential. Unfortunately, despite existing therapies, treated LDL-C levels could
      remain well above acceptable levels. Thus, the functional replacement of the defective LDLR
      via AAV-based liver-directed gene therapy may be a viable approach to treat this disease and
      improve response to current lipid-lowering treatments. This first-in-human study is intended
      to evaluate the safety of this gene therapy investigational product and assess preliminary
      evidence of efficacy using plasma LDL-C levels as a surrogate biomarker for human LDLR
      transgene expression. Subjects may be asked to participate in an optional kinetics study to
      assess the metabolic mechanism by which LDL-C is reduced.
