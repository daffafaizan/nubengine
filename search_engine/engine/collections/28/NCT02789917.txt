      undergoing PCI require a triple therapy with a combination of oral anticoagulation (OAC) and
      dual anti-platelet therapy. Current guidelines recommend a regimen consisting of aspirin,
      clopidogrel and an oral anticoagulant. Although effective in preventing recurrent ischemia,
      triple therapy confers an elevated bleeding risk, which also has a major impact on the
      patients' prognosis and survival. Data from one randomized trial suggest that omitting
      aspirin in patients with indication for triple therapy may reduce the risk of bleeding
      without an increase of the rate of ischemic events. In addition, the recently introduced
      non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) show less bleeding events as compared to vitamin-K
      antagonist in AF patients. In this trial it is postulated that a dual therapy consisting of
      the factor-Xa inhibitor apixaban and clopidogrel is associated with significant lower
      bleeding rates as compared to traditional triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and a
      vitamin K antagonist (VKA). To test this hypothesis, patients with atrial fibrillation, who
      underwent PCI in the setting of an ACS will be randomized to either a dual therapy
      (apixaban+clopidogrel) or a triple therapy (aspirin+clopiodgrel+VKA). The patients will be
      followed-up for 6 months after randomization.
