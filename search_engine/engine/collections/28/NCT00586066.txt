      dysfunction, even when euthymic, after adequate treatment. The cognitive deficits in
      asymptomatic patients with bipolar disorder are very important for the participant's
      psychosocial function. In this population, cognitive deficits have been associated with poor
      psychosocial functioning, such as inability to hold a job. Memantine is a glutamate
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which has shown efficacy in cognitive
      dysfunction due to moderate to severe Alzheimer disease.

      Demonstrating the role of memantine in reducing cognitive dysfunction in minimally
      symptomatic participants with bipolar disorder promises to provide important clinical
      information, which could lead to improvements in well-being and functional status for large
      populations of participants with bipolar disorder.
