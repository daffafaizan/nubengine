    
      This is a preclinical study prior to the establishment of a cell therapy protocol applicable
      to humans.

      The main objective is to evaluate the decrease in alloreactivity of TCD4 + population by
      partial selective depletion of CD4 + CCR7 + graft to less than 50 % of CD4 + totals. To test
      the alloreactivity of donor T lymphocytes , T lymphocytes CD4 + CCR7 + donor will be
      stimulated by mature dendritic cells (DC) derived from recipient circulating monocytes in a
      mixed lymphocyte reaction model sensitized ( MLDCR ) , experiencing HLA -compatibility . This
      first step will confirm the results previously obtained in a situation incompatible HLA .
