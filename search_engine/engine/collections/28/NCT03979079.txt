      time-dependent Cox model, while addressing the limitations with the knowledge of the true
      marker trajectory. In the first stage, the longitudinal process is modeled using a repeated
      measures component model, such as a random effects model. In the second stage, estimated
      characteristics of the longitudinal marker trajectory, such as slopes, are included as
      covariates in a survival model to assess their prognostic value.

      Our aim was to highlight the flexibility of a two-stage model fitted within a Bayesian Markov
      Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. We applied this model to assess the prognostic value of
      the prostate-specific antigens (PSA) profile (level and timing of the nadir; pre- and
      post-nadir slopes) as well as salvage hormonal treatment (HT) on the risk of clinical failure
      following external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in the presence of confounding by
      indication. We first present the longitudinal hierarchical PSA model that we developed
      earlier. This model was particularly flexible since it allowed us to account for the presence
      of a random changepoint as well as the modeling of the residual variability as a function of
      the PSA concentration. We next extend the longitudinal model to a two-stage model by using
      estimated parameters of the longitudinal process as covariates in a Cox proportional hazards
      model to assess prognostic factors of clinical failure including baseline characteristics,
      PSA trajectory, and HT.
