      the lung. Treatment will consist of Cyclophosphamide (300 mg/mÂ²) to be given IV on day 1 and
      day 57. On day 4 immunization with intradermal vaccine injections at 4 separate sites
      (bilateral upper arms and bilateral upper thighs will be repeated every 14 days times 2
      followed by every 28 days times 3 (day 4, 18, 32, 60, 88, and 116). Decavac (tetanus shot)
      0.5 cc intramuscular (IM) will be given after the first vaccine. ATRA (150 mg/m2/day) oral
      three times daily (TID) dosing administered after the first and fourth vaccines (day 5-7 &
      day 61-63). Those patients achieving stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete
      response (CR) at restaging after the initial 6 vaccines will receive additional vaccines
      every 3 months until disease progression. The vaccine will consist of GM.CD40L bystander
      cells admixed with an equivalent number of the 2 allogeneic tumor cell lines. There will be a
      +/- 7 day window for all study related exams, tests, and procedures.
