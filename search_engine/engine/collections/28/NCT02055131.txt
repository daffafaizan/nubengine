      group, the second is the aspirin group fixed dose and the last group includes patients
      receiving a dose of aspirin titrated by the result of PFA-100.

      At the end of this study the investigators will be able to identify whether systematic
      antiaggregation is suitable for a vascular access for hemodialysis. The investigators will
      also conclude which is better for patients fixed dose or aspirin dose escalation determined
      by the result of PFA-100. The study will analyse the prevalence of aspirin resistant patients
      in this particular population of dialysed patients.
