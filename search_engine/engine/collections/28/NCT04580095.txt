      St. Olavs Hospital. After being informed about the study, all patients giving informed
      consent and meeting the eligibility requirements will undergo their standard clinical
      echocardiographic exam performed by a sonographer at the clinic. Two additional examinations
      will then be performed by a different sonographer and an expert cardiologist, respectively.

      In one of the study arms the sonographer randomized to perform the second exam will use the
      AI algorithm (intervention).
