      health goal education and reminder tool on patient adherence to evidence based therapies and
      subsequent cardiovascular risk factor modification after acute myocardial infarction (AMI);
      2) To assess age-related heterogeneity in antiplatelet response among AMI patients. This is a
      prospective study of ~220 AMI patients, with at least half over age 65 years. Patients will
      be surveyed with questionnaires (at baseline and 6 months post discharge) and biomarkers
      (baseline only) to assess the status of their physical function, depression, nutrition,
      inflammation, and response to antiplatelet therapies. Patients will also be administered a
      walking test and a grip strength test at baseline. About 1 week after hospital discharge, and
      again about 3 months after hospital discharge, about half of the patients and their
      outpatient providers will receive the personalized post-AMI health goal education and
      reminder tool on patient adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention therapies. Data
      will be analyzed in aggregate using descriptive statistics. The primary endpoint of interest
      is a composite measure of adherence at six months to secondary prevention therapies described
      as the sum of measures received divided by the sum of available opportunities. The secondary
      endpoint will be analyzed to describe platelet response profiles as a function of age. The
      study team anticipates the risks for this study to be minimal, since the patient does not
      receive any investigational therapies.
