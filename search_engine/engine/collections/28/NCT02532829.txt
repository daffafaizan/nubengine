      proportions. Diet, exercise and medication remain the cornerstones of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus treatment. But, apart from studies demonstrating promising results in some of the
      developed countries; the long-term success rates of lifestyle and drug modifications are
      disappointing. In cases where classic strategies proved to be inadequate, broad type of
      gastrointestinal (GI) surgery methods offer new alternatives to treat obesity and T2DM. The
      variable levels of incretin stimulation (especially GLP-1) and improved glycaemic control in
      those with diabetes have been shown following various bariatric techniques.

      Therefore, investigators aimed to analyze the levels of GLP-1 and Peptide YY hormones
      together with indices of insulin sensitivity in participants with various health conditions
      and in participants who underwent different surgical options including sleeve gastrectomy,
      minigastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy with ileal transposition and sleeve gastrectomy with
      transit bipartition.
