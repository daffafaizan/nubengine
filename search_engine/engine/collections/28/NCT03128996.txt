      transplant will receive a reduced intensity conditioning regimen consisting of hydroxyurea,
      alemtuzumab, fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan.

      This will be followed by a familial HLA-mismatched bone marrow transplant. The primary
      objective is to establish safety and donor cell engraftment at 100 days and 1 year
      post-transplant.
