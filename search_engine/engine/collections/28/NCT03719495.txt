      completed surgery and radiation therapy to remove the tumor(s) and have not yet started
      standard treatment endocrine therapy. There is one group of subjects who have not been
      diagnosed with cancer. The information learned from this study will help doctors understand
      more about how the immune system responds to endocrine therapy for early stage breast cancer
      in people who are estrogen receptor positive with the goal of developing improved therapies
      that harness the immune system.
