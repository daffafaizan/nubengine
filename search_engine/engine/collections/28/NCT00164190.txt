    
      Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and high-risk characteristics presenting to
      community hospitals without cardiac catheterization facilities will receive thrombolysis with
      tenecteplase and heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin) and will then be
      randomized to one of two strategies: facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or
      standard treatment (thrombolysis with provisional rescue PCI). In the facilitated PCI group,
      patients will be transferred immediately to an angioplasty centre for urgent cardiac
      catheterization, and PCI if appropriate within 6 hours of thrombolysis. In the standard
      treatment group, patients will only undergo urgent angiography for evidence of failed
      reperfusion and/or development of cardiogenic shock.
