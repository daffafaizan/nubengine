    
      Following anesthesia and preload optimisation guided by cardiac stroke volume, patients will
      be randomised to one alveolr recruitment manoeuver :

        -  stepwise increase and decrease in positive airway pressure

        -  sustained 30 secondes 30 cmH2O continuous positive airway pressure The primary objective
           is the change in cardiac stroke volume.
