      intermittent chemotherapy regimen (2 x 4 cycles of paclitaxel) are not inferior to the
      results of a continuous chemotherapy regimen (8 cycles of paclitaxel), both combined with
      bevacizumab in first line treatment of patients with HER2/neu negative, incurable, metastatic
      or unresectable locally advanced breast cancer.
