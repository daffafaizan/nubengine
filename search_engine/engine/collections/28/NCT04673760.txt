      mixed-methods randomized controlled study and is responsible for the informed consents.

      Data collection consists of questionnaires of patients, their family caregivers, general
      practitioners, home care nurses and if involved specialized palliative home care nurses.
      Patients and their family caregivers will fill out baseline questionnaires and follow-up
      questionnaires at 2, 8, 16 and 24 weeks. After the 24 weeks follow up measurement, new
      measurements will only occur if the patients experiences a decline in health like a
      hospitalization or specialized palliative home care crises intervention. Patient follow-up
      will end if the patients dies or the study ends. Family caregivers will be asked to fill out
      a questionnaire two months after the patient's death.

      General practitioners, home care nurses and specialised palliative home care nurses will fill
      out questionnaires after patient's death or at the end of the study. Patient survival data
      will be collected from administrative health data after the end of the study.

      Additionally, a nested qualitative study with semi-structured qualitative interview with
      patients, family caregivers and care providers will provide an in-depth understanding of
      preferences, needs, experiences from this phase of life and facilitated through the
      intervention.
