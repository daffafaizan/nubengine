      result in the reduction of LPS-induced inflammatory sequelae, in particular aGvHD, in
      patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT.

      The rationale for using opebacan in patients undergoing myeloablative regimens and HSCT is
      based on the following:

      Endotoxemia has been demonstrated to play a central pathophysiologic role as a trigger of
      aGvHD in animal models.

      Endotoxemia following HSCT is associated with inflammatory conditions (such as inflammatory
      cytokine release) that have been demonstrated in humans to be associated with organ damage
      and increased morbidity and mortality.

      Endotoxemia and LBP elevation have been demonstrated in humans undergoing ablative HSCT.

      Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia results in a deficiency of endogenous BPI levels.

      The timing of the endotoxemic insult is predictable (i.e., subsequent to myeloablative
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy).

      The return to normal neutrophil levels is not immediate and takes one week to several weeks.

      Well established laboratory techniques for surrogate markers related to LPS presence and its
      activities can facilitate the evaluation of molecules designed to inhibit or antagonize LPS
      and its effects.

      The objectives of this study are as follows:

      To demonstrate the safety of escalating doses of opebacan in subjects undergoing
      myeloablative allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation

      To determine the pharmacokinetics of opebacan in subjects undergoing myeloablative allogeneic
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation

      To determine if IV administration of opebacan is associated with changes in biological
      markers for inflammation

      To develop preliminary descriptive data on the occurrence and severity of Hematopoietic Stem
      Cell Transplantation related complications, including aGvHD
