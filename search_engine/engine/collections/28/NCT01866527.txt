      included for further analyses. Of the 81564 infants, 2433 (3â€¢0%) received early treatment;
      1882 (2,3%) from birth and 551 (0,7%) after six weeks or more of clinical and sonographic
      surveillance. Another 2700 (3,3%) normalised spontaneously after watchful waiting from birth.
      Twenty-six infants (0,32 per 1000, 92% girls, two from the risk group) presented with late
      subluxated/dislocated hips (after one month of age). Another 126 (1,5 per 1000, 83% girls,
      one from the risk group) were treated after isolated late residual dysplasia. Thirty-one
      children (0,38 per 1000) had surgical treatment before age five years. Avascular necrosis was
      diagnosed in seven of all children treated (0.27%), four after early and three after late
      treatment.

      Interpretation The first 16 years of a standardised selective US screening programme for DDH
      resulted in acceptable rates of early treatment and US follow-ups, and low rates of late
      subluxated/dislocated hips compared to similar studies.
