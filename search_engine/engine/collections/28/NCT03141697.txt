      Leipzig for colonoscopy were randomly assigned to either CO2 or air insufflation.

      All examinations were performed by one of four experienced endoscopists. The patients usually
      received sedation. For sedation midazolam and propofol was used. At the beginning of the
      examination the patients usually received between 3-5 mg of midazolam and 20-40 mg propofol.
      During endoscopy propofol was titrated by administration of 20 mg at the time according to
      and pain reaction of the patient and required depth of sedation.

      All patients had nasal insufflation of oxygen with 2 litres per minute. All sedated patients
      were monitored for pulse, blood pressure and blood oxygen saturation.

      For bowel cleansing a solution of Macrogol 3350 (MoviprepÂ®, Norgine) was administered orally
      according to the manufacturer.

      All colonoscopies were performed using Fujifilm Endoscopes (EC 590 Series). For examinations
      with use of carbon dioxide the Fujifilm CO2 Insufflator GW-1 was used with appropriate water
      bottle and endoscope valve. The air pump of the light source Fujifilm System 4400 was
      deactivated according to the manufacturer.
