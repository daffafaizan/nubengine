      analgesia for open cardiac surgeries.

      The hypothesis of our study; PIF block reduces pain and analgesic consumption in the acute
      period (0-24 hours) similar to TTP block in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery
      requiring median sternotomy.

      Patients will be divided into two groups:

      Group PIFB: A bilateral PIF block will be performed intraoperatively (20 ml, %0.25
      bupivacaine + 1:400.000 adrenaline). In addition, IV morphine patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA) will be applied postoperatively for 24 hours.

      Group TTMPB: A bilateral TTMP block will be performed intraoperatively (20 ml, %0.25
      bupivacaine + 1:400.000 adrenaline). In addition, IV morphine-PCA will be applied
      postoperatively for 24 hours.
