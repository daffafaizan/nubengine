    
      This 2-stage study will evaluate participants with locally advanced, unresectable, or
      metastatic HER2-overexpressing colorectal cancer (CRC) (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC
      2+/ in situ hybridization [ISH]+) of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1 (BRAF)
      wild-type and either rat sarcoma viral oncogenes homologue (RAS) wild-type or mutant tumor
      type, previously treated with standard therapy. In the first stage, participants will be
      randomized 1:1 with 2 doses of T-DXd. After Stage 1 enrollment is complete, all further
      eligible participants will be registered to T-DXd administered IV in Stage 2. Participants
      will receive the assigned dose of T-DXd until progression of disease or the participant meets
      one of the discontinuation criteria.
