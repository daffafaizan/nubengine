      of the causes of worse clinical outcome. It is known that in open heart surgeries the glucose
      level must be set less than 200mg/dl, but new trials had set the glucose level lower than
      that: 140mg/dl in some studies and even lower (80-110mg/dl). Our trial had the intention to
      seek if there is difference setting glucose level in 2 different ones would modifies clinical
      outcome.
