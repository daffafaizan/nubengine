      syndrome. Lubricants contain compounds that are purported to improve dry eye symptoms,
      although objective data is not available. The investigators seek to objectively evaluate the
      effectiveness of two lubricants and compare the results to a saline eye drop (control).

      The investigators will assess the lipid layer before and after the administration of three
      products in the same eye of 25 dry eye subjects using the ellipsometry, imaging in a "normal"
      environment. Subsequently the investigators will change the environment to one that causes
      the subjects' ocular surface to experience "evaporative stress" (warmer, less humid and
      greater air flow) and perform the before and after drop administration measurements with the
      same three products in the same eye as the first environment.
