      Incisional hernia is one of the most common complication in general abdominal surgery. An
      overall incidence of 20% has been found in retrospective studies, ranging in up to 50% of
      patients with selected risk factors such as obesity.

      In the general surgical patient the current standard is the closure of the abdominal wall
      using a running, slowly absorbable suture. With this well established clinical practice the
      incidence remains high and incisional hernia repair must be performed frequently in order to
      treat patients'symptoms and to prevent progression of the hernia an possible complications.

      Consequently, in high risk patients prophylactic mesh implantation is performed routinely in
      our institution.
