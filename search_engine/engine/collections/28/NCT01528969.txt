      and decreased counts of mutans streptococci (MS) and the amount of plaque when used on daily
      basis. How xylitol influences mutans streptococci is far from clear. Also the effects of
      xylitol on the normal flora are poorly understood.

      The present controlled, randomized, doubleblind study aims to answer the following questions:

        1. How will the "normal flora" be affected by the xylitol consumption?

        2. Will daily consumption of xylitol change the plaque-saliva distribution of the mutans
           streptococci?

        3. The association of the test results will also be compared with the caries status at the
           baseline.

      After collecting informed consent forms from the parents, about 177 children will be screened
      for the presence of salivary mutans streptococci (SM) with chairside test, Dentocult SMÂ®
      Strip mutans (Orion Diagnostica, Finland).

      Sorbitol is regarded as an inert polyol. Xylitol/Sorbitol gum (6g polyol/day) will be used
      for 5 weeks. Saliva samples will be collected before and after gum use. Studying and
      quantifying of 16 bacterial species belonging to the normal flora by DNA-DNA hybridizations
      and Real-time PCR will show how xylitol influenced the oral flora in general. Comparison of
      MS counts in unstimulated vs. stimulated saliva will show how xylitol affected the adhesivity
      of the MS.
