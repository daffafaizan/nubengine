      Abdominal hysterectomy surgery may be performed to treat benign tumors, such as fibroids,
      heavy periods, painful periods and chronic pelvic pain. The most common route for performing
      hysterectomy is through an incision in the abdominal wall; however, about 20% are performed
      vaginally.Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy is performed when warranted.

      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medication) that has an established safety profile.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cattle tendons and contains bupivacaine.
      When inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at
      the site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at
      the surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery.

      The ON Q system consists of 1 elastometric pump with a fill volume of 270 mL containing 0.25%
      bupivacaine; 1 soaker catheter measuring 12.5 cm in size; and a fill port, tubing, clamp,
      filter and flow restrictor. The pump provides positive pressure and is portable. It may be
      attached to the patient's dressing or placed in a carrying pouch. The catheter is inserted
      directly into the surgical wound providing a continuous flow of bupivacaine into the wound. A
      capillary flow restricting orifice located at the end of the tubing controls the flow rate.

      This study will compare the total narcotic use in patients with the CollaRx Bupivacaine
      Implant with the total narcotic use in patients with the ON Q PainBuster Post op Pain Relief
      System after abdominal hysterectomy.
