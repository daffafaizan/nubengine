      combined to Raman spectroscopy provided for the first time the Raman spectral signature of
      healthy SF. Tribological analysis of simple dried drops of SF showed the potentiality to
      observe physical and chemical changes due to OA process. HA concentration was correlated with
      the dried drop area and the increase of protein content was correlated with the height of the
      peripheral rim. Spectral acquisitions detailed/specified these observations as degradation of
      cartilage and bone tissues was measured using specific Raman band ratios. These results
      suggested that DDRS could be an innovative tool in OA clinical research. In this context, the
      Sponsor would like to assess the clinical pertinence of this innovative analytical tool in a
      PoC study using OA patients receiving IA injection of SYNVISC ONEÂ®.
