      reductions in simple functional patterns of daily living such as crossing a street, walking
      in a crowded area, or performing any functions that occurs in an open (changing) environment.
      This study will use a newly developed yoga program incorporating multi-directional movements,
      cognitive challenges and visuomotor disturbances to improve executive function and associated
      movements in persons over 60 years of age.
