    
      First, the investigators will describe the care pathway for pregnant women who have benefited
      of an early prenatal interview (EPP) between March 2019 and March 2020, namely continued
      classic follow-up or referral to a child psychiatrist / psychiatrist.

      Then, the investigators will define two subgroups within the women oriented towards
      psychiatric follow-up: those who had this follow-up and those who did not.

      Then, the investigators will identify the factors of failure of this referral to psychiatric
      follow-up and describe the eventual difficulties encountered by the lack of this follow-up.

      Finally, the investigators will try to study these observations made with the perspective of
      maximizing the benefit of the Early Prenatal Interview in the monitoring of pregnancy.
