      opportunity to preserve that hearing and provide combined electric and acoustic stimulation
      (EAS). The primary aim of this study is to investigate speech perception performance in
      pediatric CI recipients with functional pre-operative hearing. Specifically, the
      investigators intend to compare speech understanding using EAS and traditional full electric
      stimulation.

      While hearing preservation rates are good, they are not guaranteed. Children with progressive
      hearing loss may continue to lose hearing, even if they maintain some residual hearing
      immediately after surgery. As a secondary aim, the investigators intend to study outcomes in
      children who do not maintain residual hearing and are fit with traditional CI programming
      methods. Children with more residual hearing are being implanted, and this study design
      allows validation of outcomes in both populations.

      Subject enrollment will occur on the initial stimulation date. Those who have maintained a
      low frequency hearing average of 75 dB HL or better will be fit with a SONNET EAS device
      using combined acoustic and electric stimulation. Those who have not maintained low frequency
      hearing will be fit with a SONNET EAS device using electric stimulation only. Subjects will
      be followed at regular intervals throughout the year duration of the study and will be tested
      on measures of speech understanding in quiet, speech understanding in noise, quality of life,
      and discrimination of prosody or pitch changes.
