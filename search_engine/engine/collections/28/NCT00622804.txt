      symptoms by gastric stasis and bile reflux, it so called "post-gastrectomy syndrome", because
      of the diminishment of stomach capacity, the decrease of expulsive ability and the change of
      food passage. Until now, that had been accepted as the inevitable results after gastric
      resection. However, the survival rate has recently been increased owing to the increased
      proportion of early gastric cancer. And thus, to improve the quality of life of patients,
      many researchers have been actually studying for the reconstruction methods which are able to
      minimize the symptom by gastrectomy, but it is dissatisfied until now. Thus, the purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the degree of bile reflux and gastric stasis according the
      reconstruction methods after distal subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and to find out
      the proper method.

      We collect ninety patients who undergo distal gastrectomy for gastric cancers for this study
      from 5 institutions and randomly divide into 3 groups according to reconstruction methods: 1)
      Billroth-II (B-II), 2) Roux en Y gastrojejunostomy (RY-GJ) and 3) uncut Roux en Y
      gastrojejunostomy (uncut RY-GJ). We evaluate the postoperative morbidity rate and then the
      degree of bile reflux, gastric emptying time and quality of life through long term follow-up
      using the gastrofiberscope, survey and so on.

      From this study, we would suggest the standard reconstruction procedure after distal
      gastrectomy.
