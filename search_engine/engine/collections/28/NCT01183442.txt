      translated in a reduced risk for future cardiovascular events, which is of major interest,
      since patients with postchallenge hyperglycemia face a significantly higher cardiovascular
      risk than patients with normal glucose tolerance. Furthermore an improvement in insulin
      sensitivity and/or beta-cell function would identify vitamin D as an important strategy for
      the prevention of type 2 diabetes. In consideration of the rapidly increasing prevalence of
      diabetes and the failure of current prevention strategies this could be an important, safe
      and cheap way to support ongoing lifestyle modifying programs. Our study of course
      investigates surrogate cardiovascular and insulin sensitivity parameters. Assuming a
      beneficial effect of vitamin D in our study, this concept would have to be proven in further
      large outcome as well as diabetes prevention trials.
