    
      Part I and Part II of the Study:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you joined this study. Up to 3 groups of 3-6 participants will be
      enrolled in Part I of the study. After that, up to 90 participants will be enrolled in Part
      II.

      If you are in Part I, you will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 dose levels of TPI 287 based on
      when you join this study. The first 3-6 participants will receive a starting dose level. The
      next 3-6 participants will receive a higher dose if no intolerable side effects were seen or
      a lower dose if intolerable side effects were seen. Your dose may be lowered if you have side
      effects.

      All participants will receive bevacizumab at the same dose level for the entire study.

      If you are in Part II, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2
      groups. If you are one of the first 20 participants in Part II, you will be randomly assigned
      to a group. If you are enrolled after the first 20 participants, you will be more likely to
      be enrolled in the group that is showing better results.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive bevacizumab.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive bevacizumab and TPI 287.

      If the disease gets worse at any time during the treatment with bevacizumab alone, you may
      enroll in the Crossover Group to receive TPI 287 and bevacizumab.

      Other Drugs:

      If you are taking TPI 287, you will be given standard drugs such as Benadryl®
      (diphenhydramine) and cimetidine to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Drug Administration:

      There are 42 days in each study cycle.

           minutes.

           minutes.

      Study Visits for Part I, Group 2, or Crossover Group of Part II:

      Every time you receive the study drug(s), your vital signs will be recorded before and at the
      end of the infusion.

      routine tests.

      On Days 1, 15, and 29 of Cycle 1, urine will be collected for kidney function tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  Your medical history and performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had any side
           effects.

        -  Urine will be collected for kidney function tests.

        -  You will have an MRI scan of the brain to check the status of the disease.

      On Days 15, 22, and 29 of Cycles 2 and beyond, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      needed for your safety. The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug(s) for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. If you enroll in the Crossover Group, you may continue taking the study drugs for
      up to 6 additional cycles in the Crossover Group.

      You may no longer be able to receive the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment and

      asked how you are feeling. This call will take about 5-10 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. TPI 287 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of brain tumors, including glioblastoma. The
      combination of TPI 287 and bevacizumab in glioblastoma is investigational.

      Up to 108 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
