      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary Efficacy of intermittent oral dosing of CM082
      tablets in Chinese patients with wAMD. The study will be performed in two different parts,
      dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and dose-expansion phase (Part 2). Subjects will receive CM082
      orally twice daily for two weeks followed by two weeks off in four-week cycles. There are two
      dose levels, 25mg BID and 50mg BID. In part 1, the starting dose of 25mg BID(n=8) will be
      increased by 100% to the maximum dose of 50mg BID(n=8) if the number of patients who
      experience dose-limiting toxicities is less than 2 during the first cycle. In part 2, based
      on the relevant data from the dose escalation study, an expanded enrollment study was
      conducted at a safe and effective dose.Per dose group will enroll 12-24 patients. All
      patients will take CM082 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The assessment
      of the safety and efficacy will be done every four weeks from 2nd-6th cycle and every 12
      weeks after. Also, single/multiple dose pharmacokinetics in these patients will be studied.
