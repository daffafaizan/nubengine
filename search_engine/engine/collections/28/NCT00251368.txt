    
      -  The treatment patients will receive involves a continuous infusion of 9-AC intravenously
           for a 72 hour period. Since we are unsure of the safest and most effective dose,
           successive groups of 4-7 patients will receive larger doses of this drug until the
           largest dose given safely is established.

        -  Prior to the start of therapy a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be taken for
           diagnostic and research purposes. A bone marrow exam will be repeated at 48 hours in
           order to determine the effects of 9-AC on leukemic cells in the bone marrow. A bone
           marrow scan will also be performed 14 days after the start of therapy to assess
           response.

        -  Frequent blood testing will be done throughout treatment, including blood samples to
           determine the levels of the 9-AC in the blood.

        -  Treatment could be stopped prematurely if any of the following occur: 1) drug causes
           severe side effects, 2) the drug does not control the leukemia, or 3) the doctors or the
           patient feel that it is no longer in the patients best interest to receive this therapy.

        -  Approximately 7 days after the conclusion of the 9-AC infusion, it is likely that the
           patient's blood counts will be low and will require support with antibiotics, red cell
           transfusions and platelet transfusions.
