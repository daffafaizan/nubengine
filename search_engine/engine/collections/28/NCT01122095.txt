      advances in medical knowledge have allowed insight into the wide-ranging systemic effects of
      long-term uncontrolled inflammation, thus shifting the concept of psoriasis from an
      inflammatory disease restricted to the skin to a systemic process. Adults w/ psoriasis have
      higher rates of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and smoking and the
      prevalence of each risk factor increases as the extent of psoriasis increases.1 It is
      uncertain if any of this relates to a behavioral reaction to having psoriasis or as a
      separate part of the disease process. Inflammation has a role in the pathogenesis of
      cardiovascular disease most noted by multiple observational studies of psoriasis patients
      which demonstrate an increased risk of arterial or venous events, notably myocardial
      infarction, cerebrovascular events, pulmonary emboli, cardiovascular death or mortality
      overall. Specifically, Gelfand et. al. show an increased relative risk for myocardial
      infarction and an increased hazard ratio for mortality in patients with severe psoriasis, but
      most notably, show highest risk in younger adult patients. There is a paucity of data on
      risks with psoriasis in the pediatric and adolescent age group.
