      of the joint. To maintain sufficient range of motion, but also not overload the surrounding
      soft tissue structures, reproduction of tibio-femoral kinematics of the healthy knee is
      thought to be beneficial. In previous studies, it has been shown that the medial condyle,
      described by the centre of the medial condylar sphere, does not move anterioposteriorly
      during progressing joint flexion, whereas the lateral condyle has been observed to translate
      in a posterior direction producing tibial internal rotation with flexion (Freeman and
      Pinskerova 2003, Pinskerova, Johal et al. 2004, Freeman and Pinskerova 2005). The GMK Sphere
      prosthesis is specifically designed to mimic the healthy kinematics with providing a medial
      pivot.

      The objective of this research project is to perform a comparative study on the in vivo
      kinematics of the GMK Sphere prosthesis in comparison to the conventional GMK PS Fixed
      Bearing TKA as well as to the GMK UC Fixed Bearing. The study includes the simultaneous
      assessment of the 3D kinematics of the TKA by means of an automated moving fluoroscope and
      subsequent 2D/3D registration based on CAD models of the TKA, whole leg kinematics by means
      of skin markers and ground reaction forces during level walking, stair descent and downhill
      walking a 10Â° inclined slope. Precisely, the aim is to assess tibio-femoral kinematics in
      8-10 TKA subjects implanted one or more years previously with the GMK Sphere prosthesis. In
      addition, 8-10 conventional GMK PS Fixed Bearing TKA subjects, as well as 8-10 GMK UC Mobile
      Bearing TKA subjects will be measured to provide a comparison against the GMK Sphere
      prosthesis kinematics.
