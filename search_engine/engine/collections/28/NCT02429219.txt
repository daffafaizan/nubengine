      therapy of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We want to differentiate two different methods
      of the surgical therapy: the TransUrethral Resection in Saline (TURiS) and the Photoselective
      Vaporisation of the Prostate (PVP). Both methods using saline irrigation. To measure the
      amount of absorbed saline irrigation fluid, we added pure Ethanol to the Irrigation fluid
      resulting in am 0,02% ethanol containing saline irrigation fluid. The conventional
      TransUrethral Resection of the Prostate (TUR) method is using electrolyte free irrigation. In
      the literature this method is well known for the occurence of the transurethral resection
      syndrome ("TUR syndrome"). This is caused by absorption of electrolyte-free irrigating fluid,
      followed by a hyponatraemic hyperhydration, and consists of symptoms from the circulatory and
      nervous Systems.
