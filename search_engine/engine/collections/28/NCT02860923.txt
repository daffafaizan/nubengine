      GLP-1 suppresses appetite and energy intake in both normal weight and obese individuals as
      well as in people with type 2 diabetes and delays gastric emptying. The underlying mechanisms
      that mediate the effects of weight involve not only central regions like the hypothalamus and
      the solitary tractus nucleus and area postrema but also peripheral regions as the
      gastrointestinal tract. These extra hypothalamic effects are of particular interest in the
      cases of obesity due to hypothalamic lesions.

      Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with a high structural homology to
      human GLP-1, a gut derived incretin hormone. Since exenatide causes a dose-dependent weight
      loss, decreasing concentration of glycosylated haemoglobin as well as improving ß-cell
      function and systolic blood pressure, it could be an attractive treatment for both type 2
      diabetes and obesity. In a double-blind placebo-controlled 24-week trial, it has been
      recently shown that non diabetic obese patients maintained on exenatide 10µg x 2/j lost
      significantly more weight than did those on placebo (5.1 kg versus 1.6).
