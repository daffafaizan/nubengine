      predisposition to major depression is caused by genes. People with recurrent depression and
      earlier ages of onset have more relatives with depression. There are probably at least
      several interacting genes, rather than a single gene as in some disorders. The identification
      of predisposing genes is likely to lead to greater understanding of the brain mechanisms
      involved in severe depression. This could lead to the discovery of new treatments.

      This study will create a DNA collection to permit qualified scientists to search for
      depression-related genes. More than 750 families with at least two siblings who have
      experienced major depression are needed for the study.

      Participants in this study will be interviewed about psychiatric and family history, and will
      be asked for a small blood specimen. Interviews can be conducted in person or by telephone.
      For telephone interviews, blood sample collection will be arranged at a location and time
      convenient for the participant. Participants will also be asked for help in inviting other
      family members to participate. No family member will be contacted without the permission and
      assistance of another participating family member.
