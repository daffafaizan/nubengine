      design to determine maximum tolerated dose followed by a dose expansion cohort in
      approximately 30 additional subjects. Study participants will initially receive DSP-0337
      orally for 28 days (one cycle of treatment). If clinical benefit is seen, treatment can
      continue until disease progression.
