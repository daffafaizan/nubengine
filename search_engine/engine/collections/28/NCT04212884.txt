        1. To understand the impact of impaired functional status in PLWH in Asia would be
           important to determine the long-term health burden needs in this aging population in
           this part of the world.

        2. The identification of risk factors associated with impaired functional status would be
           important to guide clinical decisions in patient management, such as the choice of
           anti-retroviral regimen, and screening of and early intervention for modifiable risk
           factors. These are of paramount importance in the promotion of healthy aging in this
           population.

        3. This proposed cross-sectional study lays the foundation for the establishment of a
           longitudinal cohort for long-term follow up of people aging with HIV in Asia, with the
           objectives of evaluating the long-term impact of aging on clinical outcomes and
           functional status in PLWH in this region.
