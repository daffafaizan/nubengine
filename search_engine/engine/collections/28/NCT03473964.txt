      injection) of on disease activity and severity in patients with sarcoid uveitis. The
      retrospective study will evaluate a series of quantitative outcome measures:

      The degree of aqueous and vitreous inflammatory cells as graded by the criteria established
      by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria at intervals of 0 weeks, 3
      weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

      The degree of aqueous flare as graded by the criteria established by the Standardization of
      Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria at intervals of 0 weeks, 4 weeks,12 weeks and 24 weeks.

      Best Corrected Visual Acuity at intervals of 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

      Central Macular Thickness at intervals of 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks as measured
      by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).

      Intraocular pressure at intervals of 0 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks as measured by
      applanation tonometry

      Quality of life assessment using National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire
      (VFQ-25)

      The Investigator expects to retrospectively review the charts of 10 sarcoid associated
      uveitis patients treated with Acthar® Gel over a period of 1 year.
