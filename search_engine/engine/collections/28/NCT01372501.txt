      complications, and are associated with an increased risk in all-cause mortality. The GI
      Endobarrier Liner represents a viable alternative to other short-term weight loss methods. It
      is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure, which may allow patients to recover faster with
      less morbidity and mortality. This study is investigating whether the the GI Endobarrier
      Liner can be reimplanted.
