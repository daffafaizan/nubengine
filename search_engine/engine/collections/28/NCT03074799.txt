    
      Retrospective review of routine program data for child contacts less than five years of adult
      TB index cases who are receiving TB care at local, decentralized clinics in the Matlosana
      district of Northwest Province will be assessed. 16 clinics will be stratified and randomized
      in 1:1 fashion to either TST-based screening, the current standard of care, or symptom-based
      screening, the newly recommended standard of care in South Africa. Those who are TST positive
      in the TST-based group and those who are symptomatic in the symptom-based group will be
      referred to Klerkdorp Hospital for further evaluation of tuberculosis. Nurses in the
      decentralized clinics will initiate those who are TST negative or asymptomatic on IPT. Their
      clinical course will be monitored throughout treatment and adherence to therapy measured. The
      investigators will compare clinic-level outcomes including percentage of patients initiated
      on, adherent to, and completing IPT.
