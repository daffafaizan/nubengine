      induce the activation of several biological systems such as platelets, complement and
      coagulation cascades. The coagulation system generates a key enzyme, factor IIa or thrombin,
      responsible for blood clotting in the dialysis circuit Because clotting in the circuit may
      reduce the dialysis efficiency, the anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit is needed .

      For several years, most of the researches were mainly focused on the improvement of the
      biocompatibility of dialysis membranes .

      The contribution of the various components of the dialysis circuit on the coagulation
      activation has not been clearly established.

      A circuit integrating a cartridge blood set is commercialised for several years. The design
      of this cartridge blood set reduces the surface in contact with blood and minimizes the blood
      air interface which are well known sources of coagulation activation.

      The aim of this study is to collect data to evaluate the biocompatibility of two types of
      blood circuit (cartridge blood set vs standard blood line).
