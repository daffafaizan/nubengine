      Disorders at Boston University. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      acceptance and mindfulness-based strategies plus cognitive behavioral therapy or no treatment
      for 16 weeks. The treatment will involve daily practice of mindfulness techniques to help
      draw attention to and accept various emotional states. Interviews, questionnaires, and
      depression and anxiety scales will be used to assess participants. Assessments will be
      conducted post-treatment and at 3- and 9-month follow-up visits.
