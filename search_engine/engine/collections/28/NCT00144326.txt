    
      This is a 3 month, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group
      study to compare with placebo the long-term effect of tiotropium inhalation capsules on daily
      physical activity in patients with COPD.

      The drugs will be administered in the form of inhalation capsules of tiotropium or placebo,
      taken once daily in the morning.

      The record of daily physical activity using the accelerometer will be carried out at all
      study visits other than Visit 1. The accelerometer will be used for the five day period, from
      Thursday to Monday, closest to the corresponding visit.

      The pulmonary function tests will be carried out at Visit 1 (screening visit), Visit 2
      (baseline visit) and study visits (Visits 3 to 5) with the restrictions detailed at the trial
      protocol.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between tiotropium (Spiriva) and placebo
      regarding the magnitude of exercise measured with an accelerometer. The alternative
      hypothesis is that there is a difference between tiotropium (Spiriva) and placebo regarding
      the magnitude of exercise measured with an accelerometer.

      Comparison(s):

      The difference in physical activity measured in vector magnitude units (VMUs) by the triaxial
      Stayhealthy RT3 accelerometer at the end of the three month treatment period compared to
      placebo.
