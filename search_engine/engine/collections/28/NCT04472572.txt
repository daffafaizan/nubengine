      patients at Hackensack University Medical Center infected with SARS-CoV-2 who have severe or
      life-threatening COVID-19, or who are judged by a healthcare provider to be at high risk of
      progression to severe or life-threatening disease. Following enrollment on the protocol and
      provision of informed consent, patients will be transfused with approximately 200-500 mL of
      ABO compatible convalescent plasma obtained from individuals who have recovered from
      documented infection with SARS-CoV-2 and who have been found to have high anti-SARS-CoV2
      titers. Safety information collected will include serious adverse events judged to be related
      to the administration of convalescent plasma. Other information to be collected
      retrospectively will include patient demographics, resource utilization (total length of
      stay, days in ICU, days intubated, and survival to discharge from the facility.
