      into this pilot and feasibility ancillary study. The aims of this study are to validate and
      test the reliability of the Activity Preference Assessment (APA), as described below.

      Aim 1: To examine the convergent validity of the APA against habitual physical and sedentary
      activity time measured objectively by seven days of accelerometry, as well as leisure
      activity choices during a 30-minute free-choice play period.

      Aim 2: To examine the criterion validity of the APA against concurrent measures of body
      composition, cardiometabolic health indicators, aerobic fitness, and physical strength.

      Aim 3: To measure the test-retest reliability of APA outcomes through repeated measures
      separated by approximately one week.

      Exploratory Aim: To investigate patterns or clusters of activity preferences through
      exploratory factor analysis of activity liking VAS scores.
