    
      This is a 26 week, single arm, single-site, Investigator-initiated, exploratory trial
      evaluating the efficacy of the standard of care revascularization of the lower extremity with
      the addition of revascularization of the lateral plantar artery and anterior pedal loop of
      the foot as treatment for participants with PAD, diabetic neuropathy and have a clinical
      diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes whose main symptoms are numbness and/or tingling of
      the feet with or without pain.

      Participants who satisfy eligibility criteria may undergo standard of care revascularization
      of one lower extremity as required, with the addition of revascularization of the lateral
      plantar artery and anterior pedal loop followed by a 26-week follow-up phase. Standard of
      Care revascularization will be performed in any limb with â‰¥ 50% stenosis as determined by
      intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS) at the time of planned study intervention.

      Participants will be evaluated prior to intervention and at 2, 4, 14 and 26 weeks after the
      pedal loop intervention.
