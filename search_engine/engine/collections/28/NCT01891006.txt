      study examines the effect on wound healing using NPWT compared with conventional wound
      treatment in women, who experience spontaneous dehiscence or where a surgeon deliberately
      opens the wound after Caesarean Section (CS).

      Women, who have given informed consent, will be randomized to either intervention or control
      group via a computer-generated randomization program. It is not possible to blind either
      participants or therapists. The analysis will be carried out on an intention to treat basis.

      Women with post-CS wound infection will be hospitalized and the wound will be reopened and
      cleaned under general anaesthesia. In the intervention group women will be treated with NPWT.
      The change of wound dressing on the second day takes place in the obstetrical or plastic
      surgery ward. On the fourth day, the NPWT material will be removed and the wound evaluated
      before re-suturing. In the control group the wound will be treated with a hydrofiber or
      alginate dressing. Changes of wound dressing will take place on the second and fourth days as
      in the intervention group. In both groups, when the wound is evaluated on the second and
      fourth day, it will be described and measured (depth, width, length). After four days of
      treatment, the wound will be re-sutured in both groups. It is expected that some wounds are
      not suitable for re-suturing on the fourth day. If a woman does not want to participate, she
      will receive the conventional treatment, which corresponds to the treatment in the control
      group. Women, who do not wish to participate, will be asked for permission to use their data
      in the analysis.
