      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies (a type of human protein) that work to stimulate your
      body's immune system to fight tumor cells. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration)
      has approved nivolumab as a treatment option for this disease; however, the FDA has not
      approved the way nivolumab and ipilimumab are being administered in this study. Ipilimumab is
      FDA approved for the treatment of melanoma (skin cancer) and has been previously studied in
      renal cell cancer.

      This study is being done to evaluate nivolumab treatment strategies based on each patients
      individual response to treatment. In participants who have a response to treatment, nivolumab
      will be stopped and participants will be closely monitored. In participants who do not have a
      response to treatment,the investigators will investigate whether the addition of ipilimumab
      improves a participant response to treatment. Participant blood and tissue samples will be
      collected to learn about how certain biomarkers and genes relate to participant outcomes.
