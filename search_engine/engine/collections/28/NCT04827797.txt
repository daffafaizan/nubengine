      of childbirth on birth outcomes and maternal satisfaction. Randomized controlled,
      single-blind clinical study included a total of 180 pregnant women. The study included 3
      groups (A: routine hospital care, B: spherical birthing ball, C: peanut ball). Especially
      spherical birthing ball, were effective in reducing labor pain and facilitating faster rate
      of descent of the fetal head, and they increased maternal satisfaction.

      IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Labor pain and outcomes occurring
      during labor are known and expected situation. Some non-pharmacological methods are applied
      to ensure that birth is easy and maternal satisfaction is high.

      What the results of this study add? There is no studies using the peanut ball and the
      spherical birth ball together. In our study, it was found that both balls are effective, but
      the spherical birth ball is more significant.

      What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?
      Our study suggested that the spherical birth ball had effective on birth outcomes. Future
      studies should be performed to investigate the effects of birth balls in the postpartum
      period, breastfeeding or prenatal period.
