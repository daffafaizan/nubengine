      within first 24-48 hours of birth. The meconium staining of amniotic fluid occurs in 12% of
      all live births per annuum.

      The routine use of gastric lavage in MSAF babies has been advocated for a long time as a part
      of the conventional treatment. Meconium in stomach is hypothesized to act as an irritant and
      cause vomiting and retching. Surprisingly this recommendation is also made in some textbooks
      without supporting evidence.

      Orogastric tube insertion and subsequent gastric lavage can cause complications like
      bradycardia, apnea, vomiting, trauma, aspiration and esophageal or gastric perforations. Some
      researchers have found that gastric suction done at birth is associated with long term risk
      for functional intestinal disorder. The sequence of prefeeding behaviour is disrupted in
      children who undergo gastric suction and it can delay initiation of breast feeding. Small
      elevation in mean arterial blood pressure, increased retching have also been reported The
      role of gastric lavage in preventing feeding problems and secondary meconium aspiration
      syndrome has not been systematically evaluated. If this procedure is not proven to be
      beneficial it will prevent potential complications which may arise due to it in a significant
      number of babies. Also in a resource limited country the cost of materials required and time
      of medical personnel will be saved. Hence the purpose of this prospective randomized
      controlled trial is to compare the incidence of feeding problems and secondary meconium
      aspiration syndrome, in gastric lavage group vs no lavage group.
