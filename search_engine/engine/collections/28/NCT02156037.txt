      intervention condition (IC) involving a "diabetes dashboard" clinical decision support tool
      used by the diabetes team in primary care. The investigators used a parallel-groups
      randomized design. The diabetes team (i.e., diabetes nurses, diabetes dietitians, and
      providers) delivered a 5-visit, 6-month intervention to n=199 poorly-controlled (HbA1c >7.5%)
      Latino T2D patients (mean age=55 years, 60% female) seen at 2 urban community health centers.
      This intervention was compared to an established, in-house diabetes team care program (n=200)
      for its impact on blood glucose control and key psychosocial outcomes (diabetes distress,
      depression, social distress).
