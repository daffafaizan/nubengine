      psychiatric comorbidity and occupational impairment. It is characterized by inappropriate or
      excessive anxiety and worrying that persists over time for more than six months. Common
      features include apprehension, with worries about future misfortune; inner tension and
      difficulty in concentrating; motor tension, with restlessness, tremor and headache; and
      autonomic anxiety symptoms, with excessive perspiration, dry mouth and epigastric discomfort.
      GAD is typically a chronic disorder with a high relapse rate and therefore requires effective
      long-term treatment. Long-term studies are necessary to demonstrate that the short-term
      effect is maintained.
