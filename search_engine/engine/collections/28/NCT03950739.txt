    
      United Therapeutics Corporation (UTC) is developing a combination drug-device product which
      is comprised of a dry powder formulation of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT) and a
      small, portable, dry powder inhaler. In this Phase 1b safety and tolerability study, patients
      with PAH on a stable dose of Tyvaso (6 to 12 breaths 4 times daily [QID]) will be evaluated
      after switching to a corresponding dose of TreT. Patients will undergo PK assessments, safety
      assessments, a 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and questionnaires for satisfaction/preference for
      inhaled devices and patient-reported PAH symptoms and impact. Following 3 weeks of treatment
      with TreT, patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the Optional Extension
      Phase until the study terminates or the drug/device becomes commercially available.
