    
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate in patients recovering from acute
      myocardial infarction (< 8 days after the index infarction) both the safety profile of
      intramyocardial ASCs and the preliminary efficacy of ASCs therapy.

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized patient sponsored multi-center study of ASC
      implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's
      adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen
      for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The injection catheter will be used for
      delivery of the ASCs therapy.
