      suggested an association between the degree of endothelial function in scleroderma and the
      presence of PAH. However, these data is preliminary and has not been used to predict response
      to PAH-specific therapy or the development of PAH. We will test patients with cirrhosis
      because they tend to have PAH in the context of a hyperdynamic instead of a hypodynamic state
      as observed in scleroderma and PAH.

      Aims:

        1. To measure endothelial function and exhaled gases in patients with scleroderma or
           cirrhosis to assess whether they correlate with the presence or the development of PAH.

        2. To evaluate the degree of endothelial response to local treprostinil iontophoresis and
           determine if this test can predict the development of pulmonary hypertension or response
           to PAH-specific therapies.
