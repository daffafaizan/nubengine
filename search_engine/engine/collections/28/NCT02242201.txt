      clinical pathway for pain management has yet to be established. Multimodal pain management
      incorporating the use of regional anesthesia for THA has led to decreased hospital length of
      stay, improved patient comfort, and enhanced patient satisfaction that is efficacious and
      cost-effective. This investigation compared multimodal total joint arthroplasty pathways with
      continuous lumbar plexus blockade versus two different periarticular injection mixtures to
      potentially determine an ideal perioperative analgesia pathway for THA.

      Patients undergoing elective, unilateral primary total hip arthroplasty within a clinical
      pathway utilizing preemptive low-dose opioid and non-opioid medications for multimodal
      analgesia were randomized to one of three different intervention groups after informed
      consent was obtained: posterior lumbar plexus block (PNB), periarticular infiltration (PAI)
      with ropivacaine, ketorolac, and epinephrine, and PAI with liposomal bupivacaine, ketorolac,
      and epinephrine. The investigators hypothesized differences in the analgesia outcomes between
      the three intervention groups would provide for an evidenced-based clinical pathway to emerge
      as a result of this study.
