      Disease-19 (COVID-19) infection and with different disease manifestation who are included
      into diagnostic or therapeutic care at the University Hospital TÃ¼bingen (UKT).

      The COVID-19 Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) study aims to cover as many patients in Germany
      as possible. It is expected to include in Phase 1 (pilot study): 250 patients with different
      disease manifestation (extreme phenotypes) and individual risk factors by whole genome
      analysis Phase 2 (verification study): 1.000 clinically well-defined patients to ensure a
      broader range of overlapping phenotypes, to verify data from the pilot study.

      Phase 3 (confirmation study): > 10.000 patients to increase the power (anticipated).
