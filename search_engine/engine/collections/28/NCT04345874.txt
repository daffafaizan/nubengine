      have access to nutritious foods. Over 25% of children in ECE (1.2 million children) attend
      Family Child Care Homes (FCCH). Improvements in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)
      may introduce new barriers for FCCH, which have limited meal preparation capacity. Limited
      research has examined foods served by FCCH providers, and no group randomized trials have
      been conducted using a Community-Based Participatory approach in FCCH and including an
      evaluation of intervention costs.

      Goals: 1. Determine the effectiveness of a virtual, rural outreach community-based Nutrition
      Technical Assistance Intervention to enhance meeting CACFP best-practices.

      Methods: Conduct a cross-sectional assessment of a random sample of FCCH providers' (n=54)
      menus and meals served. Foods will be evaluated against the CACFP requirements and
      best-practices. Trained Extension Educators will implement both interventions (n=27
      intervention, n=27 comparison) focused in rural counties, reaching underserved rural and
      low-income populations. The intervention is based on theoretical foundations and formative
      interviews, and will consist of two virtual 60-90-minute one-on-one visits with the FCCH and
      one virtual group class lasting approximately 3 hours.
