      rectal cancer with a positive impact on locoregional control and survival. However, patients
      with T4 rectal cancer show high risk of local recurrence (LR) after conventional treatment.
      This was a prospective Phase II study on patients with locally advanced rectal cancer or
      locally recurrences, to evaluate the efficacy in terms of pathological response and
      resectability of concomitant boost RT (55 Gy/5 weeks) with concurrent Raltitrexed and
      Oxaliplatin (Tom-Ox) chemotherapy. The primary aim was to assess the pathological complete
      response rate. Key secondary aim was the resectability. Secondary aims were evaluation of
      treatment-related acute and late toxicity, local control, disease-free survival and overall
      survival (OS). The follow-up period of each subjects started after the radiochemotherapy
      treatment and ended after a maximum of 36 months of observation or until death.
