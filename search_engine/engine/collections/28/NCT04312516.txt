      the researchers according to the relative guidelines for cultural adaptation. Backwards
      translation will be performed by a fluent bilingual specialist in order to ensure optimum
      reliability of the questionnaire.

      Following power-analysis, 110 surgical patients and 70 healthy volunteers will be included in
      the study protocol after informed consent.. Primary screening of the whole population will be
      conducted using the MoCA test by two examiners. Simultaneously, the ACE III will be applied
      in order to set baseline measurements for each participant. Healthy volunteers and patients
      with MoCA scores at least 26 will form the control group. Retesting of patients and controls
      with both questionnaires will be held 48 hours after initial assessment by the same
      examiners. One third of the population will be assessed at the above time-points by an
      observer to minimize subjectivity of examination.

      Total scores and subscores at both time-points will be calculated and comparative performance
      of all participants will be assessed after statistical analysis of collected data.
