      single-dose administration to healthy male subjects. It is a single-blind (with regards to
      AZD9977 and AZD9977 Placebo), randomized, four-treatment, four-period crossover design, with
      a potential 5th and 6th randomized cross-over treatment period. In this study eplerenone is
      used as a positive control and fludrocortisone will be used as a challenge agent. In addition
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics will be assessed.
