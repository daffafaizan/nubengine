      first-line therapeutic (albeit palliative) intervention. Limited data currently exists on
      drainage techniques and the impact the techniques may have on quality of life. Current
      recommendations for IPC drainage range from daily drainage to once a week drainage, as well
      as only when needed for dyspnea. It has been theorized that active drainage of effusions may
      have an impact on the development of chest discomfort/pain, whereas passive regimens may
      allow for more gradual intrathoracic pleural changes and potentially offer a difference in
      drainage discomfort.

      The objective of this investigation is to compare different drainage strategies of indwelling
      pleural catheters (IPCs) regarding patient quality of life and outcomes. Patients will
      undergo placement of a pleural catheter as per standard institutional protocol. Patients will
      be randomized on a 1:1 basis into the suction drainage (active) arm or the gravity drainage
      (passive) arm. Patients will receive follow-up at two weeks, four weeks, twelve weeks and
      then as needed post IPC placement per standard clinical protocol. All patients will be asked
      to fill out quality of life questionnaires and update drainage diary information with
      patient's providers.

      Patients will undergo standard care treatment throughout the disease course and no different
      interventions regarding the pleural disease will be performed as a result of enrollment
      within this study. Study interventions/procedures will consist of questionnaires and patient
      self-reported documentation regarding patient's care and outcomes.
