      21 eye healthy phakic individuals. Measurements: baseline stereopsis and stereopsis after
      size glass (1-9%) is added in front of the right eye and in front og the left eye. This
      measurement provides details on how much size difference a person can endure without
      impairing stereopsis.

      Population 2:

      11 phakic eye healthy individuals awaiting cataract operation on both eyes. Measurements are
      the same as population 1 but this study group is also measured after dilating the eyes. This
      is to see if accommodation affects the measurement. A postoperative measurement six weeks
      after cataract operation is also performed to examine if cataract operation affects the
      measurement.
