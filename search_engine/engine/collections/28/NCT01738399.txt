      trigonelline, niacin, lignans magnesium, and potassium. Several of these compounds have been
      shown to improve glucose metabolism in animal models. Consumption of coffee was inversely
      associated with the risk of type-2 diabetes in prospective cohort studies across the world.
      Consumption of 3 to 4 cups of coffee per day was associated with an approximately 25% lower
      risk of type-2 diabetes. However, direct evidence of the efficacy of coffee to reduce blood
      glucose and insulin resistance parameters in humans from randomized trials is still lacking.
      In recent small trials of short duration (up to 6 weeks) coffee consumption increased levels
      of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin, but did not significantly improve insulin
      sensitivity These results suggest that a larger longer-term trial of the effects of coffee
      consumption on directly measured insulin sensitivity is warranted.
