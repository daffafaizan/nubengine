      cytokines. Recent data suggest that cytokines, and in particular IL-6, may mediate the
      effects of lifetime or prenatal infection on schizophrenia risk. Preclinical models of
      schizophrenia support a convergence between a role for IL-6 in the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia and the major neurochemical hypotheses of schizophrenia-the dopamine and
      glutamate hypotheses. Namely, IL-6 dysfunction or excess promotes schizophrenia-like
      behaviors and schizophrenia-like biochemical and electrophysiological profiles, while IL-6
      knockout or neutralization mitigates these abnormalities. Furthermore, plasma IL-6 levels are
      elevated in acutely psychotic but not treated patients, and Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) studies have shown active inflammation in the brains of individuals with psychosis.
      Finally, treatment of individuals with schizophrenia with non-specific anti-inflammatory
      agents, such as celecoxib and aspirin, has suggested a role for anti-inflammatory agents in
      schizophrenia. These data also suggest that studies of immunologic agents that more
      specifically target the underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia may be more efficacious.
      Tocilizumab (ActemraÂ®) is an FDA-approved humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-6
      receptor used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in individuals who have not responded to
      at least one TNF-alpha therapy and for juvenile idiopathic arthritis
