      of factors. A recent systematic review suggested an association between maternal age and
      adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage and stillbirth. There are also some data to
      suggest that maternal hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elevated serum creatinine and
      proteinuria and some medications such as cyclosporine are associated with adverse pregnancy
      outcomes such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery.There is
      no consensus on whether the transplant-to-pregnancy interval is associated with adverse
      pregnancy outcomes. As well, it is not clear if the findings of other studies will also hold
      true in a Toronto population.

      This study seeks to answer the following questions:

        1. What is the incidence of adverse transplant- and pregnancy-related adverse outcomes in
           renal transplant recipients that have had pregnancies between 2000 and 2014 in Toronto
           and how does this compare with earlier data from Toronto and with recently published
           data?

        2. Are factors such as maternal age, transplant-to-pregnancy interval, hypertension,
           diabetes mellitus, specific treatment regimens and the primary cause for renal failure
           associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy- and transplant-related adverse
           outcomes in these women?
