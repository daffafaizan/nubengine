      feasibility of next generation algorithms for ultrasound data processing and does not test
      any health outcome. All eligible adults (aged 18 or older) will contribute case data from a
      convenience sample of maintenance hemodialysis population available at the study site and
      consistent with feasibility assessment of the technology. A relatively large feasibility
      population is used due to the need to test feasibility of multiple features across variations
      within this population.
