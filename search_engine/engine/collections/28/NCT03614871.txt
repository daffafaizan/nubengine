    
      Aim: The investigators investigated how snuff use and smoking affect periodontal health
      parameters and mortality in a Swedish cohort, hypothesizing that snuff use increases the
      risks.

      Material and methods: Study cohort of 1 532 subjects aged 30 to 40 (758 men and 774 women)
      from Stockholm area was clinically examined and followed up from 1985 to 2015. Associations
      were analysed between periodontal health parameters, snuff use, smoking and age of death. For
      analyses, all subjects were classified into four groups: "dual-users" (current and
      ex-snuffers, current and ex-smokers); "pure snuffers" (current and ex-snuffers); "pure
      smokers" (non-snuffers, current and ex-smokers) and "non-users" (non-snuffers and
      non-smokers). Cross-tabulation, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used.
