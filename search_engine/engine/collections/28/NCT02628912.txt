      evaluate the long-term cardiovascular health and quality of life of oropharyngeal cancer
      survivors using validated survey instruments, cardiopulmonary testing, and measurements of
      cardiac risk factors. Thus, no intervention, other than the assessments will be administered
      as part of the protocol. All participants will have received treatment according to the
      standard of care or a therapeutic clinical trial in which they may have participated
      previously. We will collect information about prior treatment from the electronic medical
      record (EMR).
