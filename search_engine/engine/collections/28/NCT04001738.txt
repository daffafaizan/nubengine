    
      Prospective, randomized, open, treatment-blinded trial of acute stroke patients with
      suspected large vessel occlusion within 6 hours from symptoms onset in which two strategies
      will be compared: Direct Transfer to Angiography Suite (DTAS) vs. Computed Tomography Suite
      (DTCT). The study will be unicentric however there is the possibility of incorporating new
      stroke centers with previous experience of at least 50 DTAS cases.

      The RACE scale (Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation) will be used as a prehospital screening
      tool to identify acute stroke patients with suspicion of LVO. Once prenotifying the imminent
      arrival and the verified inclusion and exclusion criteria by the Neurologist at arrival, the
      patient will be randomized by an app in one of both study protocols.

      Subjects will be followed up to 90 days post-randomization.
