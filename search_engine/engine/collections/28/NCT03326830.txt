      randomized to receive either high-flow nasal oxygen therapy through a dedicated device or
      standard oxygen therapy through standard devices such as nasal cannula or face mask. Need of
      mechanical ventilation either invasive or noninvasive from enrollment to day 28 and time
      course of oxygenation between first SpO2 measured on scene and arrival to the hospital will
      be the main outcome measures.
