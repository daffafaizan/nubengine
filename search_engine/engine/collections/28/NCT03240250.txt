    
      Randomized cohort clinical trial, prospectic, monocentric. Procedure of randomization: the
      day before the operation, with the "Random Allocation Rule" technique

      Arm 1: pulmonary lobectomy and lymphoadenectomy with uni-portal VATS approach

      Arm 2: pulmonary lobectomy and lymphoadenectomy with three-portal VATS approach

      Misurations Total analgesic consumption, normalized to morphine milligrams, recorded in the 7
      days following the operation.

      The choice of cumulative analgesic consumption as parameter of primary outcome is because
      pain valuation with VAS is significantly affected by individual variability.

      Secondary outcomes: measure of postoperative pain with NRS at 2,6,12,24 hours and at
      2,3,4,5,30 days from sugery. A pain score will be assigned to each patient after the total
      amount of NRS.

      Respiratory function will be valuated with spirometry after 7 and 30 days from surgery, and
      compared with pre-operative tests.

      All intraoperative parameters will be compared between the two groups: operative time (skin
      to skin), proportion of conversions to open surgery, number of resected lymphnodes, amount of
      bleeding.

      Postoperative complications will be analyzed: rate of prolonged air leaks, surgical site
      infections, cardiac rythhm disfunctions, pulmonary complications, post-thoracotomy syndrome,
      as well as lenght of stay at the hospital.
