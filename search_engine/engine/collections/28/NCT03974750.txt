    
      Over 3 consecutive days, healthy individuals and chronic stroke patients (1) will be
      evaluated and (2) will train on the neurorehabilitation robot REAplan(R).

      They will practice several tasks on the robot REAplan (R) (bimanual version), requiring
      either movements with the affected arm (unimanual tasks) and complex, coordinated movements
      with both arms (bimanual tasks).

      In addition, several "classical" clinical scales and tests will be used to evaluate overall
      motor-sensory-cognitive functions (clinical tests, questionnaires, ...).
