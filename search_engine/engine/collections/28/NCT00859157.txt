      Primary

        -  To compare post-operative pain after tumescent vs standard mastectomy in women with
           stage I-III breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the total time of operation from incision to completion of wound closure.

        -  To compare the time of operation from first incision to completion of skin flaps.

        -  To compare the total estimated blood loss.

        -  To compare the number of days the Jackson-Pratt drain is left in place under skin flaps
           with wound drainage > 30 mL/24 hours.

        -  To compare the incidence of wound complications such as skin necrosis, hematoma,
           cellulitis, abscess, and seroma between groups.

      OUTLINE: Patients are grouped according to which surgeon provided their evaluation and
      treatment recommendations.

        -  Group 1: Patients undergo standard mastectomy.

        -  Group 2: Patients undergo tumescent mastectomy. All patients receive standardized
           post-operative pain management comprising morphine sulfate for analgesia or an
           equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride for 24 hours following surgery. Patients
           then receive 1-2 oral acetaminophen/oxycodone hydrochloride combination tablets (or a
           comparable amount of another narcotic/acetaminophen combination) every 6 hours as
           needed. Pain is assessed using the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).
