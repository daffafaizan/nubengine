      Stress Reduction (MBSR) classes at Duke Integrative Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. The
      central hypothesis of this NIH-funded clinical trial (K99 AT004945, PI: Greeson) is that
      mindfulness meditation training is associated with increased levels of mindfulness and
      improved cognitive-emotional functioning that, together, are associated with reduced
      psychological distress, improved sleep quality, and decreased stress-related physical
      symptoms, including muscle tension, headache, and gastrointestinal complaints. This study is
      designed to examine psychological mechanisms that may explain individual differences in MBSR
      outcomes. This knowledge is important because it will help us better understand who is most
      likely to benefit from mindfulness meditation training, and why. The results from this study
      are expected to elucidate mechanisms underlying the mental and physical health benefits of
      stress reduction, which can help guide clinicians in referring the most suitable patients to
      local MBSR programs.
