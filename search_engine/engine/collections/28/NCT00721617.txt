      increases blood pressure, impairs endothelial (vascular) function, and increases inflammatory
      markers in subjects with and without diabetes. The effects of FFA on blood pressure and
      vasculature have not been fully investigated. A group of 12 obese nondiabetic, normotensive
      subjects will be admitted to the Grady Clinical Research Center (GCRC) on separate 4
      occasions. Research subjects will receive, in random order, a 8-hour intravenous (IV)
      infusion of Intralipid 20% at 40 mL/h (a fat solution), 8-hour IV infusion of normal saline
      at 40 mL/h, 8-hour IV infusion of dextrose (sugar) 10% at 40 mL/h, and a 8-hour intravenous
      (IV) infusion combination of Intralipid 20% and dextrose 10% at 40mL/h.
