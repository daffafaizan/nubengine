      tissue and / or bipolar needle to burn blood vessels. These Needles use an electric current
      flow for cutting the tissue. When using unipolar needle there's a transfer of the electric
      current through the mother's body and through the amniotic fluid , while when using bipolar
      needle the current goes back through the needle directly the generator so that the flow does
      not transfer to the amniotic fluid and fetus.

      Despite the growing usage of electric needles, there is no literature information about the
      extent of electrical current that is transferred to the fetus during cutting, hence, no
      information about stress level felt by the baby as a result of electrical current exposure.

      The purpose of this experiment is testing the possibility that there is a difference between
      cortisol levels in fetal blood of babies who were born while using a unipolar needle opposite
      to using a bipolar needle, and compared to the control group (infants who were born in a
      vaginal birth).

      Also, we want to check whether there is correlation between maternal cortisol levels and
      newborn cortisol levels (whether motherly cortisol levels affects newborn cortisol levels).

      To assess cortisol at birth, blood will be taken from the umbilical vein following clamping
      of the cord after birth. Saliva-based cortisol will be collected from mothers.

      Other measures which will be taken are: week of birth, newborns weight, Apgar score 5 minutes
      after birth, mother's age and the indication for cesarean section.

      Then we will compare the two experimental groups, as well as compare the two groups, to the
      control group, and see whether there is a statistically significant difference between the
      groups.
