      I. Evaluate the response rate in patients with relapsed non-small cell lung cancer treated
      with AZD2171 and pemetrexed disodium.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior bevacizumab
      treatment (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28 in course 1 and on days 1-21 in course
      2 and all subsequent courses. Patients also receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on
      day 8 in course 1 and on day 1 in course 2 and all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      [Note: * The first course is 4 weeks in duration; all subsequent courses are 3 weeks in
      duration.]

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then periodically
      thereafter.
