      mechanical ventilation. CHH levels will be recorded at admission, 1 month and 1 year after
      ICU discharge. In all survivors, the presence of delirium will be assessed during the ICU
      stay and the functional, cognitive and psychological status will be assessed at short (1
      month after ICU discharge) and long term (1 year after ICU discharge).
