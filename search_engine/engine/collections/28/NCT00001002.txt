      therapy, will be enhanced by 2 weeks of foscarnet treatment, given at the same time by
      intermittent intravenous infusion. In addition, the further lowering of serum p24 antigen
      concentration that should occur during combined therapy might continue when oral AZT therapy
      is continued without foscarnet.

      There is a 4-week prestudy monitoring period during which AZT alone is administered on an
      outpatient basis, followed by a 2-week study period during which both intravenous foscarnet
      and oral AZT are administered in the hospital. During the subsequent 6-month follow-up
      period, oral AZT is administered and patients receive clinical evaluations. AZT is held for
      48 hours on days before hospitalization and for 24 hours at the end of the hospitalization.
