      cancer to MRI versus no breast MRI. Data analyzed will include medical record information
      abstracted from the clinical records. Date and modality of all imaging performed,
      malignancy(s) identified, abnormalities identified, image guided procedures performed,
      surgical procedures performed and pathology results.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess if the use of pre-operative MRI can reduce the
      incidence of re-excisions required to achieve clear margins in women with newly diagnosed
      early stage breast carcinoma.
