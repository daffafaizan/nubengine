    
      In this prospective observational trial 5 cohorts of 4 participants each are investigated.
      The cohorts consist of physicians working at different places in the operating theatre with
      different occupational exposure to sevoflurane and one cohort not working in the operating
      theatre at all. In order to determine the extent of occupational exposure to sevoflurane a
      human biomonitoring is conducted. Urinary Sevoflurane and its metabolite
      hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) are measured after 3 consecutive working days.

      UPDATE: After detecting traces of HFIP in all cohorts even in physicians not working in the
      operating theatre measurements were repated, more cohorts were added including a negative
      control and measurements before the study period of 3 consecutive working days were added.
