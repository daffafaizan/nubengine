    
      The study will be conducted in 2 parts, separately for IV and SC administration: dose
      escalation (Part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2). It will evaluate safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of Teclistamab administered to adult
      participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The overall safety of the study
      drug will be assessed by physical examinations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      performance status, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, adverse event
      monitoring, and concomitant medication usage. Disease evaluations will include peripheral
      blood and bone marrow assessments at screening (performed within 28 days) and to confirm
      stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), or relapse from CR. The end of
      study (study completion) is defined as 2 years after the last participant in Part 3 has
      received his or her initial dose of teclistamab. Study record NCT04557098 is Phase 2 part of
      this study and study record NCT03145181 is Phase 1 part of this study.
