      studies, 1 pivotal Phase 3 study, and 1 Phase 3b study, in surgical indications such as:
      spinal surgery, major hepatic resection, peripheral arterial bypass surgery, arteriovenous
      graft formation for hemodialysis access, and burn wound excision. Limited data currently
      exist on the effects of rThrombin exposure in pediatric patients. This Phase 4 trial aims to
      provide additional information on the use of rThrombin in children by evaluating the drug's
      safety and immunogenicity when administered as an aid to hemostasis during burn wound
      excision and skin grafting in pediatric burn patients.
