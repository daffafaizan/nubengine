    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if a polyvalent vaccine (including GM2-keyhole limpet hemocyanin [KLH],
      Globo-H-KLH, Tn-mucin 1 [MUC1]-32mer-KLH, and Thompson Friedreich antigen [TF]-KLH plus
      OPT-821) decreases the hazard of progression or death compared to a vaccine containing
      OPT-821 alone in women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer in
      second or third complete clinical remission.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the treatment arms with respect to the incidence of toxicities. II. To
      determine if the polyvalent vaccine decreases the hazard of death compared to a vaccine
      containing OPT-821 alone in women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal
      cancer in second or third complete clinical remission.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immune response (by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) in
      participants, in order to determine if the outcome correlates with antigen-specific immune
      titers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive polyvalent antigen-KLH conjugate vaccine and immunological adjuvant
      OPT-821 subcutaneously (SC) once in weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 23, 35, 47, 59, 71, and 83 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive immunological adjuvant OPT-821 SC as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
