        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intravenous emulsified fenretinide in patients
           with refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and in vivo activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, disease or tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive emulsified fenretinide IV continuously over 5 days. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve a complete or partial response may continue to receive fenretinide at
      the discretion of the study chair.

      Cohorts of 1 patient receive accelerated escalating doses of fenretinide until 2 patients
      experience moderate toxicity (cumulative across all dose levels) OR 1 patient experiences
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). After completion of the accelerated dose-escalation portion,
      the standard dose-escalation portion begins. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses
      of fenretinide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience DLT. At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD. An additional 12 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
