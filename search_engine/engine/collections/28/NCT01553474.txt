    
      AREDS2 is a multi-center, Phase III, randomized clinical trial designed to assess the effects
      of oral supplementation of high doses of macular xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) and/or
      omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) as a treatment for age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD), cataract and moderate vision loss. In addition to this objective,
      the AREDS2 study will provide information on the clinical course, prognosis, and risk factors
      for development and progression of both AMD and cataract. Other study goals include the
      evaluation of eliminating beta-carotene and/or reducing zinc in the original AREDS
      formulation on the progression and development of AMD. AREDS2 will also seek to validate the
      fundus photographic AMD scale developed from AREDS.

      The objective of this protocol is to have AREDS2 participants submit blood and saliva samples
      to the AREDS2 Genetic Repository (Fisher BioServices, Rockville, MD) in order to provide
      further materials for the study of the genetic and biochemical bases for eye disease and
      possibly other diseases.
