      taste, and asked to complete a taste-evaluation taste of common snacks. One group
      (intervention group) will be asked to use their personal smartphones to engage in their
      pre-existing Whatsapp chats while doing the taste test. For the two control conditions, one
      group will be tasked with reading a neutral article on their personal smartphones while they
      complete the taste test, while the other group will be asked to complete the taste test
      without any use of smartphones.
