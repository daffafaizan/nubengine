      developed countries; Thoracic computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the first-line
      diagnostic test for PE suspicion, but has a 20 to 35% rate of inconclusiveness during
      pregnancy and postpartum, 2 to 3 times higher than that of the general population. CT
      venography (CTV) consists in a delayed CT acquisition of the abdomen, pelvis and lower limbs,
      3 minutes after starting contrast administration. It can be used for detecting deep venous
      thrombosis (DVT), the source of emboli in most PEs. The investigators hypothesized most
      postpartum PEs are due to pelvic vein thrombosis and that detecting such pelvic DVT by
      performing systematic CTV could increase the overall venous thromboembolism (VTE) detection.
