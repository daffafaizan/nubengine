      review found that PE had small short-term effects on disability, joint counts, patient global
      assessment, psychological status and depression, but this effect disappeared on the latest
      time of follow up (3-14 months). A recent large British study also failed to show an effect
      on pain, physical functioning, or contact with primary care after 12 months, but found a
      significant effect on anxiety and improved the participants' perceived self efficacy. This
      indicates that the present forms of interventions fails to show a long term effect. One
      possible reason for the lack of long term effect might be that these interventions are given
      to groups only. Patients seem to prefer one-to-one interaction regarding information about
      the disease and its treatment together with emotional aspects, while education in groups are
      preferred for physical training and relational topics.
