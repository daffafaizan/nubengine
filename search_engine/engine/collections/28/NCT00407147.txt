      population, ICU patients with empiric antibiotic treatment due to suspected but unproven
      infection, is randomly assigned to either a Standard Care Group or a Procalcitonin (PCT)
      Guided Group. In the standard care group, antibiotic treatment would be based totally on
      clinical decision making with "traditional thought processes" (i.e., cultures, response to
      antibiotics, risk of untreated infection, other laboratory findings, etc.). The PCT guided
      group will use the same "traditional thought processes" and in addition the physician will be
      given access to a PCT value for Day 1 and Day 4 along with the recommended thresholds for
      likelihood of infection. In conjunction with other laboratory findings and clinical
      assessments the threshold of PCT is used to continue or discontinue empiric antibiotic
      treatment.
