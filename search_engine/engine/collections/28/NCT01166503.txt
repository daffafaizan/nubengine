      esotropia requires surgical correction, the proper timing of surgery is controversial. In
      North America, the typical age at surgery ranges from 11-18 months. Unfortunately, despite
      successful surgical realignment of the eyes, the sensory and eye movement deficits often
      persist. Recently, some pediatric ophthalmologists have advocated earlier surgery. The
      rationale for early surgery stems from animal and human research showing that early
      realignment of the eyes within an early critical period allows normal development of the
      sensory and eye movement systems.
