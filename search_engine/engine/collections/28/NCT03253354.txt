    
      The aim of this study is to assess 3 novel neuromodulation approaches - namely, pharyngeal
      stimulation, high frequency (5Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and low
      frequency (1Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on swallowing function in
      patients with dysphagia after Parkinson's Disease. A total of 66 patients are planned to be
      recruited, randomised to one of the 3 technologies or a sham treatment. A single treatment
      will be given and the effects will be assessed with a barium exam called videofluoroscopy
      within the 1st hour after the treatment. In addition, some measures of brain function will be
      recorded, before and after the treatments using single pulse transcranial magnetic
      stimulation.
