      baseline serum S100B and LDH levels of each patient will be retrospectively determined from
      the electronical patient file. In each patient, tumour burden and 18F-FDG uptake of the
      tumour lesions will be measured using multiple standard quantification parameters of the
      baseline 18F-FDG-PET scan. Tumour burden will also be measured on the baseline contrast
      enhanced CT scan. The correlation of each FDG-PET parameter with baseline LDH and S100B
      levels, respectively, will be analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression analysis.
