      paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the safety and tolerability
      of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this treatment
      regimen in this patient population. IV. Determine the pharmacodynamic effects of this
      treatment regimen in serial tumor biopsies in these patients. V. Determine the cytotoxicity
      of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BMS-214662. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours on day 1 and BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour on day 3 of course 1. For all subsequent
      courses, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed 30 minutes later by BMS-214662
      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or
      objectively responding disease receive additional therapy at the investigator's discretion.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18-21 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15
      months.
