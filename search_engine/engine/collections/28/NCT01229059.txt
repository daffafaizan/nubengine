      Patients with type 2 diabetes have reduced whole body glucose disposal, increased ectopic
      lipid deposition in skeletal muscle and the liver and impaired mitochondrial function. Recent
      studies suggest that lipid metabolites such as diacylglycerol (DAG), ceramides and long-chain
      acyl-coA represent the active mediators inducing insulin resistance. Possible targets are
      DAG-sensitive Proteinkinase C (PKC θ, PKC ε) which inhibit the insulin signaling cascade and
      ceramides which interfere with the insulin signaling cascade at Proteinkinase B/AKT. Prior
      studies raised controvesial evidence, thus, it is yet unclear, whether DAG or ceramides are
      the primary agents inducig lipid-induced insulin resistance. Therefore, the current study
      aims to explore the time course of the appearance of intramyocellular lipid compunds during
      lipid infusion in parallel assessing markers of impaired insulin action.
