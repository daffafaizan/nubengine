      treatment. Today, with the CAD/CAM technology, clear aligners treat a broader range of cases
      with greater precision. They consist of a series of plastic aligners that are intended to
      replace conventional wire and bracket technology for many orthodontic cases. Each custom
      manufactured aligner exerts gentle, continuous forces to move teeth incrementally from their
      original state to a final, treated state. Each aligner is worn for about two weeks, then
      replaced by the next in the series until the final position is achieved.
