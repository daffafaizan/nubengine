      storms. Several studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples and indicated that the
      virus could spread via faeces. Importantly, COVID-19 uses the same receptor as SARS and this
      doorway can also be found in the intestine. The cell entry receptor, known as angiotensin
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 and is highly expressed in
      small bowel enterocytes. ACE2 is important in controlling intestinal inflammation and its
      disruption may lead to diarrhoea. In our previous study, stool samples from 15 patients with
      COVID-19 were analysed. Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis were noted even after patients
      were detected negative of SARS-CoV-2. A series of microbiota were correlated inversely with
      the disease severity and virus load. Gut microbiota could play a role in modulating host
      immune response and potentially influence disease severity and outcomes.

      In July 2020, there are more than 15 billion confirmed cases globally with 620 thousand
      deaths. Currently, there are more than 2000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. It is
      important to rebalance the gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients and to improve the symptoms
      and the quality of life of these patients.
