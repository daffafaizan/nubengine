      immediate post-operative pain management of many surgical inpatients. While cared for by APS,
      the patient receives multimodal analgesia, including adjunctive medications (acetaminophen
      and naproxen/ketorolac) scheduled around the clock. When APS discontinues the epidural/pain
      pump, all adjunctive medications are discontinued and the patient is usually started on 'as
      needed' opiate or combination opiate (i.e. Tylenol#3) medications. On occasion, APS will
      write an order for an additional 48 hours of naproxen, but this practice has not been
      formally evaluated at this site. This randomized, placebo-controlled study proposes to
      evaluate this bridging strategy to see if regularly scheduled naproxen after discontinuation
      of other post-operative medications will affect the daily doses of opiate pain medications
      used, side effects of those opiate medications and pain scores of patients.
