      participating in the Elevate curriculum that will help them function better as a couple
      resulting in improved relationship quality/stability, improved co-parenting skills, improved
      financial management, and reduced financial stress. As a result of improved relationship
      skills and better management of stress, couples will then provide more supportive, safe, and
      stable family environments for children.

      Individuals who are eligible (biological and foster parents of children 0-18) and agree to
      participate in the study will complete surveys at three time points--before participating in
      Elevate, 4-6 weeks after participating, and 8-10 months after participating in Elevate. The
      surveys include items related to couple functioning behaviors, relationship
      quality/stability, parenting/co-parenting skills, and financial management and distress.
