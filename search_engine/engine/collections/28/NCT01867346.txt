      Prior to the mid-1980 s, the primary focus of these investigations was the natural history of
      age associated changes in memory and other cognitive functions. While a portion of the work
      of the Cognition Section still involves descriptive studies of cross-sectional and
      longitudinal effects of age on specific cognitive abilities, the cognitive testing program
      was refocused in the mid-1980 s to investigate early predictors of cognitive change,
      including risk and protective factors for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer s disease. In
      collaboration with Dr. Claudia Kawas, and more recently Dr. Richard O Brien of the Johns
      Hopkins Department of Neurology, the research program of the Cognition Section was expanded
      to ascertain incident cases of cognitive impairment and dementia, including home visit
      assessments for inactive participants. In addition, an autopsy program in collaboration with
      the Alzheimer s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Johns Hopkins University was initiated.
      This collaboration has yielded a number of important findings including information on the
      incidence of Alzheimer s disease, and demonstrations that use of hormone replacement therapy
      in postmenopausal women and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in older adults6
      are associated with reductions in the risk for Alzheimer s disease in our community-dwelling
      BLSA participant sample.
