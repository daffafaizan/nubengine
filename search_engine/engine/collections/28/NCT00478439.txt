      will evaluate whether macular pigment augmentation improves the speed of dark adaptation. Two
      groups of participants will be enrolled, old adults with normal vision and early age-related
      macular degeneration patients. Macular pigment will be augmented using EyePromise RESTORE
      (ZeaVision, Inc). EyePromise RESTORE is a nutritional supplement that has been found to
      increase macular pigment levels in some users. Macular pigment level and the speed of dark
      adaptation (how fast a person adjusts to the dark) will be assessed at baseline, 4-months,
      and 8-months. Fundus appearance will be assessed at baseline and 8-months follow-up.
