      safety of adalimumab and to determine how well it works in the treatment of adults with
      moderate to severe HS. HS is a chronic skin disease that creates red, swollen, painful bumps
      which can break open to combine and form tunnels in the skin and scars. Sometimes these bumps
      can heal themselves quickly and sometimes they will become much worse and create sores that
      heal with multiple combined scars, or areas that do not heal. In this study, approximately
      300 adults will be enrolled at treatment centers worldwide. Subject participation in this
      study will be up to 50 weeks. There will be a screening period, which will last from 7 to 30
      days, and a study treatment period of up to 36 weeks. Study visits occur at Screening,
      Baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 and 36 (or sooner if subject leaves
      the study before Week 36). The study is divided into two treatment periods. The first period
      (Period A) will last 12 weeks and the second period (Period B) will last up to 24 weeks.
