      intrathecal drug delivery. Pump reservoirs could be refilled with medication more
      infrequently (every 1-3 months), greatly reducing the risk of infection. Pumps were initially
      driven by the pressure differential of an injected gas, pushing drug at a fixed rate from an
      isolated chamber through an orifice of predetermined size. Later, mechanical pumps were
      developed that allowed for programmability of different infusion rates, and complex
      administration of infusions and preset boluses. These pumps have dominated the US market for
      long-term intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDSs), and have expanded the range of
      conditions and patients that can be treated successfully.

      Because IDDSs characteristically deliver low flow rates of drug to the intrathecal space (<1
      mL/day), the reliability, durability, and accuracy of the pump are critical for the efficacy
      and safety of treatment. This continued access trial will assess the ongoing safety and
      efficacy of a new fully implanted IDDS, the Prometra Programmable Pump.
