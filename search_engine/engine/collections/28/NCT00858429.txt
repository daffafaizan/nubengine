        -  Establish the maximally tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres in combination
           with capecitabine in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or liver metastases.

        -  Characterize the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also
      receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres by intra-arterial hepatic infusion on days 1-7 of
      course 2.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
