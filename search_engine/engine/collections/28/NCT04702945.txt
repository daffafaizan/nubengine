    
      This national multi-centre registry is designed to enroll population-based consecutive
      eligible patients presenting with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to 50 emergency departments
      in eight Canadian provinces from March 1 2020 and data collection is ongoing for the duration
      of the pandemic.

      Data will be abstracted from the medical chart and entered into a central, web-based REDCap
      database. The investigators adopted the ISARIC variables into the database where there was a
      match. The investigators will develop standardized operating procedures for screening of
      potentially eligible patients, data entry and follow-up. Current data dictionaries are kept
      on the registry's website (https://canadiancovid19registry.org/).

      At 30 days, the investigators will contact patients by telephone to obtain verbal consent for
      follow-up. The investigators will measure the Veterans Rand 12-item Health Survey (VR12),
      calculate the WHO Ordinal Outcome Scale and ask contextual questions in consenting patients.
      The VR12 will be measured at 60 days, and 6 and 12 months. The contextual questions were
      developed with input from patients with lived experience with COVID-19 infection and
      addressed cultural, racial, gender, socioeconomic and self-isolation issues.

      The Health Data Research Network facilitated the development of a unique data flow of
      personal health identifiers and study identification numbers from each province for all
      participating institutes. This will allow linkage of registry data with national
      administrative data repositories.
