      on the reinforcing value of nicotine, using a validated cigarette choice paradigm. A key
      question was whether smokers differ in their responses based on the mu opioid receptor gene
      (OPRM1) Asn40Asp (A118G) variant.

      Following informed consent, 64 smokers were enrolled in the study. Of these, 60 completed two
      4-day study phases interspersed with a 5-7 day washout phase. Baseline statistics are
      provided for the 64 smokers who enrolled.

      Each 4-day study phase included a 3-day drug run-up and monitoring phase, then on the 4th day
      participants came to our Biobehavioral Lab (BBL) where they took their final 50mg of study
      medication and completed a cigarette choice paradigm. Following a washout phase, the 4-day
      sequence will be repeated with the alternative study medication. The order of study
      medication was randomized and counterbalanced between subjects.
