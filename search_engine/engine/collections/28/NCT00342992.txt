      to determine whether daily supplementation with a-tocopherol, beta-carotene, or both would
      reduce the incidence of lung or other cancers among male smokers. Between 1985 and 1988,
      29,133 men ages 50 to 69 years, who smoked at least five cigarettes per day, were recruited
      from southwestern Finland. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a-tocopherol
      as dl-a-tocopheryl acetate (50 mg/day), beta-carotene as all-trans-beta-carotene (20 mg/day),
      both supplements, or placebo capsules for 5-8 years (median 6.1 years) through April 30,
      1993. Post-intervention follow-up has continued through the Finnish Cancer Registry and other
      national registries, and epidemiological analyses continue to be conducted.
