      Salivary 8-OHdG levels in the PCOSCP and CP groups were statistically higher than those in
      both the PCOSPH and the PH groups (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the
      PCOSCP, CP, and PCOSPH groups with regard to salivary MDA and TAS levels (P > 0.05). Highest
      serum 8-OHdG and MDA levels and lowest serum TAS levels were seen in the PCOSCP group (P <
      0.05). Serum 8-OHdG and MDA levels in the PCOSPH group were higher than those in both
      systemically healthy groups (PH and CP) (P < 0.05). Salivary TAS levels were highest (P <
      0.05) in the PH group. There was no statistical difference between the CP and PCOSPH groups,
      but serum TAS levels were lower than those in the PH group (P < 0.05).

      CONCLUSIONS:

      CP, which led to an increase in serum and salivary 8-OHdG and MDA levels and a decrease in
      serum TAS levels in patients with PCOS, contributed to increased OS. This effect was more
      prominent in serum levels than in salivary levels.
