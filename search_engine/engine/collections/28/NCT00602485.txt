      medication, diet and exercise. Non-adherence to prescribed treatment protocols is a major
      contributor to morbidity and mortality for these indiviudals. Rehabbilitation programs
      provide the necessary education and supervision needed to promote health, however,
      non-adherence occurs even for those indiviudals with appropriate resources and motivation.
      Most of the research up to this point deals with preparing indiviudals to be adherent. Action
      Control theory is focused on the mental processes that occur between the time an individual
      makes a decision to adhere and the moment when the appropriate activty either occurs or does
      not occur.

      This interventions tudy will compare rates of adherece between indivudals who receive an
      action control based educational intervention and those who do not.
