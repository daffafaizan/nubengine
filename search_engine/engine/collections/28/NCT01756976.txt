      especially for adding calculations for Estimating Blood Loss- (EBL). The OrthoPATÂ® serves as
      the predicate device. The following items will be changed in the OrthoPAT Advance system
      compared to OrthoPAT:

        -  Software & User Interface - ability to enter irrigant and anti-coagulant volumes and
           allow Estimated Blood Loss (EBL) calculation to be made by OrthoPAT Advance.

        -  Hardware -

             -  Redesign of reservoir and filter to process blood earlier by reducing hold-up
                volume and improve fluid visualization in reservoir.

             -  Extended battery life.

      It is not intended to validate the major changes in the OrthoPAT Advance device (reservoir /
      filter and EBL), which will be conducted as lab based tests. The correct functioning of the
      reservoir / filter and EBL changes will be confirmed in the clinical setting in this study.
      However the most rigorous challenge to the filter will be by presenting the worst case media
      and this can only be controlled in the laboratory.
