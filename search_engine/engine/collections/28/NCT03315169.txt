      remained largely unchanged for over 50 years, and comprises surgical incision and drainage
      followed by continued internal wound dressing (packing) until healed. Packing is thought to
      reduce the rate of recurrent abscess and perianal fistula; a known complication of perianal
      abscess. Perianal fistula frequently requires multiple operations to resolve. The evidence
      for postoperative packing is limited¹ and may expose patients to painful procedures with no
      clinical benefit, and at considerable increased cost².

      A multi-centre observational study of outcomes after drainage of perianal abscess (PPAC²)
      (n=141) found packing to be painful (2-3 fold increase in Visual Analogue Score pain scores
      during packing) and costly (estimated cost of £280 per patient; overall cost in the United
      Kingdom of £5 million annually). Fistula rate was 27%.

      This study is a randomised controlled trial designed to assess whether there are differences
      between non-packing and packing of the perianal abscess cavity in terms of the short term
      negative effects of packing (pain, quality of life, return to work) whilst assessing the
      impact on key clinical outcomes (wound healing, fistulae formation) and resource use/cost.

      All participants will be required to complete pain diaries following discharge from hospital.
      Clinical follow up to assess healing and other key clinical outcomes will take place at 4, 8
      (if not healed at 4 weeks) and 26 weeks. Further data will be collected from National Health
      Service Registries at 52 weeks in order to assess abscess recurrences and fistulae formation.
