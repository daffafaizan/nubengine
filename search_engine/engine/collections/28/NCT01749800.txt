      training delivered using a spring-based robot. We intend to carry out the study in a small
      cohort of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors (20 subjects). Subjects with attention span
      deficits but no significant motor impairments will solely undergo a cognitive test of
      attention with/without GVS. Subjects with both attention span deficits and significant motor
      impairments will undergo a cognitive test of attention and robot-assisted upper-limb
      rehabilitation with/without GVS.
