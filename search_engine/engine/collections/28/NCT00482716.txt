        -  Compare the efficacy of recombinant epoetin alfa or epoetin beta with vs without
           parenteral iron in anemic, iron-replete patients with nonmyeloid malignancies.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, prospective study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive recombinant erythropoietic stimulatory activity (ESA) therapy
           comprising epoetin alfa or epoetin beta subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive ESA therapy as in arm I and parenteral iron (i.e., low
           molecular weight iron dextran complex IV over 5-10 minutes or iron sucrose injection IV
           over 10-30 minutes) on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats weekly for up to 10 weeks or until hemoglobin reaches 13
      g/dL, whichever comes first.
