      anesthetized patients: tracheal intubation, tetanic stimulus, and surgical incision. Patients
      are randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: remifentanil-2 or remifentanil-4, corresponding to
      the target effect site concentration of this drug delivered through a TCI system. Other drugs
      included propofol and cisatracurium.

      The paradigm exploring the baroreflex collects information continuously recorded of the RR
      intervals and the changes in systolic arterial pressure, before and during noxious stimuli.
      The hypothesis is that this paradigm explores nociception as the group with smaller doses in
      remifentanil will have more cardiovascular reactions in response to noxious stimuli.
