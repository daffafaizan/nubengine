      (10 mg of mixed amphetamine salts vs placebo) and expectancy (told active medication vs
      placebo medication), resulting in 4 different conditions 1) mixed amphetamine salts/told
      stimulant medication; 2) placebo/told stimulant medication; 3) mixed amphetamine salts/told
      placebo; and 4) placebo/told placebo). Participants will be assigned to four scanning
      sessions scheduled one week apart and will experience each condition once counterbalanced
      across participants. Participants will be administered cognitive tasks in and out of the
      scanner to determine the effects of medication vs expectancy.
