      arthritis and enthesitis due to genetic background and autoimmunity. Patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis usually suffered from chronic pain over spine and peripheral joints since their
      second or third decades. It may also cause severe social and psychological burden to patients
      and their family.

      Exercise and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the standard first-line
      treatments for AS（1）. Only 50% of patients with AS reach the ASAS response criteria（2） in
      clinical trials. Patients with severe disease activity should be put on disease-modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD), such as sulfasalazine（3） and anti-TNF biological agents. Add-on
      of acetaminophen and low dose anti-depressant （4）can slightly improve the response rate.
      However, there is no data if tramadol or ultracet can benefit AS.
