      oxygenated hemoglobins,cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, blood loss,blood hemoglobin
      concentration, water and lipid concentrations of the tissue.

      The researchers can use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to monitor volume changes during the
      hemodialysis treatment and to correlate the changes in volume and blood pressure with the
      measures of oxidative stress and inflammation used in this study. The researchers can use
      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy data to compare to laboratory parameters routinely measured to
      clinical parameters such as cause of chronic kidney disease, blood pressure and
      dialysis-related parameters.
