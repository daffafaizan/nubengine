      for reducing drug or alcohol cravings in individuals diagnosed with a substance dependence or
      substance abuse disorder and participating in a drug rehabilitation program.

      Study Design and Duration: This study will be a 3 to 6 week, randomized, double-blind trial
      involving participants with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of substance dependence or abuse. Consented
      participants meeting enrolment criteria will receive a dose of propranolol (1mg/kg) or
      placebo ninety minutes before undergoing a brief memory reactivation procedure twice a week
      for a three-week period (or once a week for a six week period, depending on the participants
      availability) as an adjunct to their usual drug rehabilitation treatment. Participants will
      be randomized to one of two treatment arms (i.e. placebo group + treatment as usual, or
      propranolol group + treatment as usual) and remain in that arm for the duration of the study.
      Participants from the placebo arm will be offered the opportunity to continue receive
      open-label propranolol treatment for another 3-6 weeks following the double-blind phase of
      the study. A four-month follow-up assessment will also be conducted.
