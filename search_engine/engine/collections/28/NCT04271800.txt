      Lymphoma. CD19 is expressed on most CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma cells so it is an
      ideal target for CAR-T. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      CAR-T targeting CD19 in patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ B Cell Leukemia and Lymphoma.
      The primary goal is safety and efficiency assessment, including adverse events and disease
      status after treatment.
