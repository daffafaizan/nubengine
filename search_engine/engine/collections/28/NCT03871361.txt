    
      To assess the efficacy and safety of Abatacept as an immunosuppressive treatment in Birdshot
      uveitis. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy to suppress active uveitis in
      Birdshot uveitis and to induce inflammatory remission during the 1 year treatment and after 2
      years of treatment. Treatment efficacy will be assessed, using quantitative and qualitative
      measurements of visual function. In this trial we will also assess the utility of
      quantitative outcome measures in detecting disease activity.
