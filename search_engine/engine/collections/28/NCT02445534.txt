      therapy as a part of clinical trials performed at UMC Ljubljana from January 2005 until
      January 2018. Patients will be followed on regular basis in a dedicated heart failure
      outpatient clinic, clinical data will be collected and stored in a secure central database.
      Data will be analyzed in periodic intervals by an independent Data monitoring board in an
      attempt to better define the predictors of clinical response to cell therapy in this patient
      population.
