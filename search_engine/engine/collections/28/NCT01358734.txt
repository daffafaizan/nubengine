      temporarily suspended based on review of the data from the first 13 participants and a high
      rate of discontinuation (11/13 participants). The Data Monitoring Committee assessed the
      study data on September 20, 2013 and reported no safety concerns. The high rate of early
      discontinuation is inconsistent with the treatment duration required for testing the study
      primary endpoint of survival at one year. Consequently, Celgene has decided not to reopen the
      lenalidomide only arm.
