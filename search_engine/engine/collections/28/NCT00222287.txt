      sequences that lead to expansion of the movement repertoire. This Method has been used with
      the aim of improving balance and mobility in several studies, and has been compared to the
      benefits of Tai Chi for improving balance in older adults. The current study investigates the
      effects of a 10 week series of Feldenkrais movement classes on gait parameters as measured on
      an instrumented gait mat, a balance test of stepping and turning (the Four Square Step Test)
      and a questionnaire about balance confidence (the Activites Specific Balance Confidence
      scale.
