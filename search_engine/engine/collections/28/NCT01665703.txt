      biology. Patients with large renal masses (>3 cm, or at the discretion of the investigator)
      who are planning to undergo nephrectomy will be identified, and recruited to undergo a
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography
      (MR-FDG-PET) scan. Samples collected from their tumor after it is removed will undergo a
      variety of laboratory tests, including biomarker assessments and genotyping. By examining
      primary renal masses via a combination of MR and FDG-PET functional imaging in concert with
      tissue based tests, areas of hypermetabolism and hypervascularization will be evaluated as
      features of HIF activation or tumor subtype.
