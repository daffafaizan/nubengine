      elevation with using balloon lifting technique and after that sinus was filled with T-PRF
      produced from the patients' blood and 4 months waiting period has been entered. At the end of
      the 4th month, the bone samples were received from the implant slots and sent to histological
      evaluation. After 3 months, implant stability was measured and recorded. In the control
      group, the same procedures were followed and sinus was filled with only allograft. Waiting
      period was changed to 6 months for this group.
