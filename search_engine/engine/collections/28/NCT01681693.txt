      altered response to metformin, a genotype to phenotype strategy is employed. Specifically,
      the investigators will evaluate this hypothesis in African-Americans, a population which has
      a high incidence of type 2 diabetes and which has high variant allele frequencies (44.5% for
      MATE1-66T>C and 11.3% in OCT3-81G>delGA) relative to other ethic groups. To assess the
      effects of these variants on metformin response, the investigators will measure metformin
      renal clearance (pharmacokinetics of metformin), and plasma glucose and insulin levels
      (pharmacodynamic response) in healthy and diabetic patients who carry either the reference or
      variant alleles.
