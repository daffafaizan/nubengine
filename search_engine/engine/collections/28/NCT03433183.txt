    
      I. Primary Objective

      â€¢ To determine the clinical benefit rate of selumetinib in combination with sirolimus in
      patients with unresectable or metastatic NF1 associated or sporadic MPNST

      II. Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To define and describe the toxicities of selumetinib in combination with sirolimus in
           patients with unresectable or metastatic NF1 associated or sporadic MPNST.

        -  To assess the impact on intensity and pain interference and correlate to changes in
           clinical, imaging response and progression

        -  To assess progression free and overall survival

      Selumetinib will be given orally 50mg twice daily continuously and sirolimus will be given
      orally 4mg once daily with a cycle 1 day 1 loading dose of 12mg. One cycle will be 28 days.
      Patients will be able to remain on treatment as long as they do not experience progressive
      disease or unacceptable toxicity. Stage 1 will require 7 patients, with no further accrual if
      0 of 7 respond. If 1 or greater of the 7 patients respond, accrual will continue until 21
      patients have been enrolled.
