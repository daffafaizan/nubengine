      single IVT dose of CLG561 in 1 of 5 concentration levels A-E, where A=lowest and E=highest.
      All subjects received active CLG561. Progress from one cohort to the next was time-lagged to
      allow for safety review. Dosing was also time-lagged within each cohort. Only one eye
      (designated as the study eye) was dosed per subject. Post-dose safety assessments and ocular
      examination occurred immediately after the IVT injection and continued throughout the
      outpatient visits at pre-determined timepoints. Collection of post-injection blood samples
      began after the IVT injection at pre-determined timepoints. Subjects were followed for up to
      84 days.
