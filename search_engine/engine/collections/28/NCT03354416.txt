        -  Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become an established method for localizing clinically
           significant prostate cancer, and identification of imaging-based prognostic markers
           represents an active research area.

        -  Multiple treatments are available for patients with localized prostate cancer, including
           radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and focal ablation;
           however, therapy-specific indication and imaging-based response biomarkers are poorly
           understood.

        -  As mpMRI is considered a standard of care , there is no patient consent for research
           related to imaging biomarkers and their correlation with other clinical and pathologic
           features.

        -  Translation of imaging, clinical, and pathological-based features into treatment
           decisions has yet to be fully characterized for development of a decision-support
           system.

        -  Therefore, the purpose of this protocol is to enable the collection of data to enable
           research in the development of computer aided diagnosis, decision support and deep
           learning/artificial intelligence research.

      Objective:

      - To evaluate radiological profiling of patients with prostate cancer in support of the
      Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB) for identification of imaging-based prognostic markers in
      prostate cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with an increased risk for prostate cancer, with a diagnosis of prostatic
           cancer or suspicious for prostatic cancer lesions.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

      Design:

      - Imaging evaluation and clinical profiling of patients with an increased risk of prostate
      cancer, with prostate cancer or suspected of prostate cancer obtained during visits to NCI
      and long-term follow up will be collected and analyzed.
