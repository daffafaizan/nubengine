      picture of a hypercoagulable state with abnormal blood clotting has emerged. Fulminant heart,
      lung, kidney, and liver failure are hallmarks of COVID-19 non-survivors and have been
      associated with abnormal blood coagulation parameters, such as elevated D-Dimer levels. The
      current standard of care using prophylactic levels of subcutaneous heparin has not
      significantly mitigated the risk of patients entering a hypercoagulable state, however the
      dysregulated thrombotic and inflammatory events that drive poor outcomes in many COVID-19
      patients may be amenable to early treatment with a factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor. The purpose of
      this study is to study the potential benefit of treatments with a direct FXa inhibitor
      (rivaroxaban) versus standard of care dose subcutaneous LMWH (Lovenox) in hospitalized
      subjects with COVID-19.
