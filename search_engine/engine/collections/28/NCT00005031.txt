      persistent or recurrent, refractory endometrial carcinoma. II. Determine the nature and
      degree of toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene IV over 5
      minutes on days 1-4. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study.
