      statin (MTS) therapy on coronary flow reserve (CFR), reflecting coronary vasoreactivity and
      myocardial tissue perfusion. Impaired CFR is a manifestation of myocardial ischemia which may
      precede clinical CV events (and visible changes in plaque morphology) in high-risk patients
      with psoriatic disease. From previous studies, it is known that traditional risk factors
      underestimate cardiovascular risk in psoriatic disease. The central hypothesis of this study,
      is that MTS therapy - which has known pleiotropic CV risk reduction effects, including
      anti-inflammatory properties -- will quantitatively improve myocardial blood flow and CFR as
      measured by positron emission tomography (PET) over one year and reduce atherosclerotic
      burden, in patients with moderate-severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. In so doing,
      improvement in coronary vasoreactivity, endothelial function, and tissue perfusion may have
      beneficial effects on myocardial mechanics, left ventricular deformation and function and,
      ultimately, symptoms and prognosis.
