        -  Less bone resection, less complicated revision surgery.

        -  Reduced stress shielding of the femur.

        -  Lower incidence of hip dislocations.

        -  Walking function improved by change in mobilisation regime and operative technique.

        -  Risk of femoral neck fracture is reduced by preoperative measurement of bone density.

        -  Risk of avascular necrosis of the femoral head is reduced with the anterolateral
           approach preserving femoral head blood supply and preventing later failure of the
           implant.
