      none of them have evaluated the improvement in the quality of life in patients with multiple
      myeloma. Most study variables used to evaluate the quality of life of patients with multiple
      myeloma are subjective and limited. This study will observe the degree of change in the
      quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma before and after bortezomib administration
      by using EORTC-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of
      Life Questionnaire-Core30) and EQ-5D (EuroQol-5 Dimensions), validated research instruments
      used to measure the quality of life in cancer patients and consequently will provide
      fundamental data regarding the quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma..
      Observational Study - No investigational drug administered
