      It is indicated for average risk patients who are unwilling or unable to be screened with

      The PERT study is designed to assess the test performance of Epi proColon when it is used
      annually for two consecutive years. Subjects enrolled in the study will be offered initial
      testing. Subjects with a positive result will be referred for colonoscopy. Subjects with a
      negative test result will be encouraged to be screened the following year. At the one year
      interval, test negative subjects will be reminded to be rescreened. Subjects with a positive
      test will be referred for colonoscopy, while subjects with a negative test will be be
      encouraged to participate in a screening program in subsequent years.
