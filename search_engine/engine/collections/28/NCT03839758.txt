      by a research assistant. Preoperative status will be characterized by demographic data, range
      of motion, quality of life, and functional status. A CT Scan and x-rays are part of standard
      preoperative care and always done prior to total shoulder replacement in our institution;
      these images will be collected for the study. Patients will be randomized to one of the two
      groups:

        1. Patient-specific glenoid guide group: Glenoid preparation will be done using the
           personalized guide provided by Wright-Tornier. This guide will be ordered after CT-scan
           measurement, using Blueprint software prior to surgery.

        2. Classic method group: Glenoid preparation will be done following surgeon evaluation of
           the 2D CT scan with the institution software. Generic guides included in the regular
           instrumentation set will be used.

      The investigators will use the classification proposed by Iannotti et al. to characterize
      glenoid bone loss prior to surgery. Glenoid bone density will be measured using radiology
      software (Hounsfield units). Blueprint software will be used to measure the preoperative
      anatomical characteristics of the glenoid: surface area, version, inclination and
      subluxation. This will be done prior to surgery in the patient specific group and after
      surgery in the classic group.
