      young persons. There is no evidence of any experimental treatment for non-suicidal
      self-injury in adolescents, superior to treatment as usual. Patients with stigmatizing
      illness such as non-suicidal self-injury may find internet-based interventions more
      acceptable. The study is a feasibility trial, with a randomization procedure in a parallel
      group design. Patients will be recruited from Child- and Adolescent Mental Health Services
      (age 13 to 17 years). The experimental intervention is internet-based, and therapist guided;
      ERITA consists of online Emotion Regulation Individual Therapy for Adolescents (ERITA) as
      add-on to treatment as usual. Treatment as usual is provided by multidisciplinary teams in
      nine outpatient clinics within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in the Capital
      Region of Denmark. Feasibility of recruitment and trial procedures will be monitored as well
      as explorative clinical outcomes.
