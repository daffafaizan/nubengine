      current methods for monitoring pregnancy in labor (tocodynamometer, IUPC) in measuring
      uterine contractions. This will be performed by measuring the expectancy of time differences
      between the tocodynamometer/IUPC and the EUM in the beginning, end, peak and duration of each
      contraction. A good correlation will be 0.9 and significance of 95%.

      100 women will be recruited to the study. The measurement with the EUM100pro will not
      interfere with the usual clinical care, meaning- the EUM100pro will be used in addition to
      the standard care and monitoring.
