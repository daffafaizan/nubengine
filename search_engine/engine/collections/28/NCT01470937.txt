    
      A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of acarbose in subjects with
      type 2 diabetes (an FDA-approved indication). Subjects were identified who had diabetes by
      glucose tolerance test criteria but non-diabetic fasting glucose concentrations. Treatment
      interventions were assessed for their ability to delay worsening of fasting glucose control.
