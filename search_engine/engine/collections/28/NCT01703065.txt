    
      Primary Outcome Measure:

        1. Change in urinary N-telopeptide (uNTX) from baseline to after 6 weeks of treatment with
           cabozantinib in men with non-metastatic CRPC.

           Secondary Outcome Measures:

        2. Changes in serum markers of bone metabolism from baseline to after 6 weeks of treatment
           with cabozantinib. Markers of bone metabolism in blood include bone specific alkaline
           phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, LDH.

        3. Changes in biomarker expression in bone biopsy samples. To include MET, AKT, FASN and
           VEGFR2 expression and phosphorylation status (activation) in osteoblasts/osteoclasts and
           prostate cancer cells. Will also include changes in markers of apoptosis, proliferation,
           and angiogenesis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up for 4 weeks.
