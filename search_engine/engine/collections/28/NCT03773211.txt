      after transplantation is Delayed Graft Function (DGF). Short term, DGF will result in
      patients being put on dialysis in the immediate time-period after transplantation. In the
      longer perspective DGF is associated with increased risk of graft failure, thus decreasing
      the efficacy of the kidney transplantation.

      Renaparin is a new product under development for the prevention of DGF in association with
      kidney transplantation. The product binds to the kidney vascular endothelium and its
      pharmacological effect is based on a local and effective presentation of heparin. Renaparin
      is administered ex vivo to the kidney by adding it to the preservation solution during
      Hypothermic Machine Perfusion (HMP) prior to transplantation.
