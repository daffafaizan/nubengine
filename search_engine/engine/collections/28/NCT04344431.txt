      management over the period of normalization of the oxygen requirement (oxygen dependence) in
      patients with SAR-CoV2 pneumonia not requiring invasive or non-invasive ventilation. It is a
      prospective, interventional, multicentre, controlled, randomized study. Patients admitted for
      SARS-CoV2 pneumonia in the Covid sector of the hospital, who have oxygen-dependence criteria
      will be proposed for inclusion in accordance with the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria.
      Randomization will be carried out to determine the allocation in two groups: an HBO group
      which will perform a daily session after checking for the absence of contraindication to HBO
      and a non-HBO control group with the same clinical criteria, but who will not benefit from
      HBOT sessions. In both groups, the standard continuous treatment with normobaric oxygen will
      be maintained.
