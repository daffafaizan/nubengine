      treatment of sarcoid-associated macular oedema but more than 50% of relapses occur when
      corticosteroids are tapered. Methotrexate (MTX) at low dose has been shown to be an effective
      and safe steroid-sparing agent for lung sarcoidosis and compilation of reported small series
      of patients with sarcoid-associated uveitis suggest that only 25% of relapses could be
      achieved with low dose MTX. We decide therefore to test the clinical efficacy of MTX in
      sarcoid-associated uveitis.
