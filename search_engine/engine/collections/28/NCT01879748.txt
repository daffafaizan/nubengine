    
      This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in healthy
      Japanese and Caucasian subjects after administration of single and multiple doses of
      rasagiline. All subjects will have a screening visit within 28 days of their check-in day
      (day -1) to confirm eligibility. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the investigational
      center on study day -1 and their eligibility to participate in the study confirmed. On the
      morning of day 1, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 0.5, 1, or 2
      mg of rasagiline or placebo at the same time every morning after an overnight fast (of at
      least 10 hours) on days 1 through 10. Venous blood samples (4 mL each) for pharmacokinetic
      analysis will be collected at specified time points through 24 hours after study drug
      administration on day 1 and through 48 hours after study drug administration on day 10. The
      duration of study participation for each subject will be approximately 6 weeks.
