      low specificity and sensitivity. Patients with documented anatomical snuffbox tenderness and
      negative plain radiographs are casted in thumb spica casts and seen by a pediatrics
      orthopedics surgeon. However few patients with clinical scaphoid fractures have documented
      scaphoid fractures, with the most common injury of soft tissue injury to the surrounding
      tissues. The use of CT scan to detect scaphoid fractures is not well documented and may be an
      appropriate substitute for plain radiographs.

      Hypothesis: CT scan of the wrist will have higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting
      pediatrics scaphoid fracture than plain radiographs.
