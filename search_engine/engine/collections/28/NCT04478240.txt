      and data will be collected immediately in the fall (i.e., baseline measure) and in the
      spring, approximately 6 months later (i.e., post-treatment assessment). Overall, the
      investigators will have two assessment points. Data will be collected from teachers and
      students via on-line surveys (i.e., Qualtrics) and through observations; see below on the
      Measures. Intervention schools will receive training and access to the PeerLearning.net app
      immediately, whereas control schools will receive access in the spring after the second wave
      of data collection is completed.

      The investigators hypothesize that usage of PeerLearning.net will promote increasing levels
      of prosocial behavior and have a significant suppressive effects on alcohol use and related
      outcomes (i.e., tobacco/marijuana use, antisocial behavior, bullying, emotional problems).
      The investigators hypothesize that this link will be "moderated" by dosage (i.e., usage of
      the app). Finally, the investigators will examine differences in program effects by sex
      (gender) and ethnicity, which the investigators expect to be small or nonexistent.

      Participants will include both teachers and students at 24 middle and high schools, cluster
      randomized to intervention vs. waitlist control. Teachers will use PeerLearning.net to design
      and deliver small-group peer learning lessons during the school year. The investigators will
      not exclude any participant based upon race/ethnicity, gender, or disability. Participating
      schools, teachers, and students will be rewarded.
