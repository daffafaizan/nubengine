      with confirmed diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension, with
      intraocular pressure (IOP) ranging between 21 and 31 mm Hg. Patients will be randomly divided
      into 2 groups, one of them treated with a new formulation of 0.5% timolol-0.2% brimonidine-2%
      dorzolamide in fixed combination (Krytantek Ofteno®, Laboratorios Sophia, Mexico) and the
      other one treated with 0.5% timolol-2% dorzolamide fixed combination (Cosopt®, MSD
      Laboratories, USA). Patients will receive 1 drop twice a day of either formulations and were
      examined at days 2, 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 after initiation of treatment. The primary
      objective is to compare the efficacy of both formulations, estimated as a decrease in IOP. A
      Goldmann applanation tonometer will be used for IOP determination.
