    
      Randomized, double-blind clinical trial aiming to assess the impact of pancreas enzyme
      replacement therapy in weight loss and quality of life.

      Prevalence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) will be determined with fecal
      elastase-1 test (FE1) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer, without evidence of
      pancreatic duct (PD) or common bile duct (CBD) obstruction based on MRI or / and endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS).

      Patients with PEI (FE1 <200) receive Pertzye or placebo in a cross-over fashion, each for 4
      weeks.

      Body weight, body mass index (BMI), body composition (Bioimpedance), are measured at the time
      of diagnosis of PEI and at 4 and 10 weeks of cross-over treatment. Baseline measurement of
      Vitamin D-25, Vitamin A, iron (ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), iron), Vitamin
      B12,Tissue transglutaminase IgA (tTG) with total Immunoglobulin A (IgA).

      Quality of Life (pain, diarrhea, weight, bloating, etc.) assessed at 0,4,10 weeks with the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with liver, bile duct and pancreas
      cancer (FACT-Hep) for physical, social, emotional, and functional quality of life.
