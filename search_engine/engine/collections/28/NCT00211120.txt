    
      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, multi-center study in patients with CKD.
      Patients who meet the selection criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      arms: GROUP A: PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa) therapy directed at maintaining the hemoglobin level
      as close to 13.5 g/dL as possible (may be slightly higher or lower) or GROUP B: PROCRIT®
      (Epoetin alfa) therapy directed at maintaining the hemoglobin level as close to 11.3 g/dL as
      possible (may be slightly higher or lower).

      Patients will receive weekly doses of PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa). Subsequent doses of PROCRIT®
      will be given weekly as needed with dose adjustments made to maintain the hemoglobin (Hb) as
      close to the target level as possible until the initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)
      or 36 months, whichever comes first.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of patients with CKD randomly assigned
      to 2 treatment groups, which differ only in their targeted hemoglobin levels. This study will
      test the primary hypothesis that the level of anemia correction with once weekly dosing of
      PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa) in patients with chronic kidney disease will decrease mortality and
      cardiovascular morbidity. Patients will receive a starting dose of PROCRIT® 10,000 Units (U)
      subcutaneously (SC) 1x / week. After 3 weekly doses, subsequent doses and dosing intervals of
      PROCRIT®, up to a maximum dose of 20,000 U for 36 months, will be adjusted based on an
      assessment of the two most recent hemoglobin values.
