      Primary

        -  To compare the disease-free survival of previously treated, post-menopausal women with
           early-stage breast cancer treated with standard- (2-3 years of tamoxifen followed by 2-3
           years of letrozole) versus long-treatment (2-3 years of tamoxifen followed by 5 years of
           letrozole) adjuvant letrozole.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the overall survival of these patients.

        -  To compare the safety of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 or 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (standard treatment): Patients previously treated with tamoxifen for 2 years
           receive letrozole for an additional 3 years; patients previously treated with tamoxifen
           for 3 years receive letrozole for an additional 2 years; and patients previously treated
           with tamoxifen for 2-3 years receive letrozole , so the total duration of the endocrine
           treatment (i.e., tamoxifen followed by letrozole) is 5 years.

        -  Arm II (long treatment): Patients receive letrozole for an additional 5 years regardless
           of the duration of the previous tamoxifen treatment.
