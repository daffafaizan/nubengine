    
      Part A:A total of 30 CAD patients are recruited.All patients are on loading dose of 300 mg
      clopidogrel followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg/d for at least 5 days and a loading dose
      of 300 mg aspirin followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/d for at least 5 days. All
      patients plan to receive coronary arteriography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI).The investigators sample blood from PV,PA and IC before PCI.Regional differences will
      be compared between blood samples from PV,PA and IC by light aggregometry (agonists:
      arachidonic acid, LTA-AA; adenosine diphosphat, LTA-ADP), VerifyNow P2Y12 assays. Differences
      between LTA and VerifyNow P2Y12-assay will also be compared.

      Part B:A total of 30 STEMI patients are recruited.Patients are randomly assigned to 2
      groups.A group(n=15) is given tirofiban through PV, the other group(n=15) is given through
      IC.All patients are on loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel and 300 mg aspirin.All patients
      plan to receive emergency PCI. Group PV: a loading dose of 10ug/kg tirofiban is given in 3
      min through PV,followed by a maintenance dose of 0.15ug/kg*min for 48h.Group IC: a loading
      dose of 10ug/kg tirofiban is given through IC,followed by a maintenance dose of 0.15ug/kg*min
      for 48h. Blood samples are collceted from PV, PA and IC before the injection of loading dose
      tirofiban , and 15min after the injection.Regional differences will be compared between blood
      samples from PV,PA and IC by LTA-AA; LTA-ADP, LTA-RIS(agonists:ristocetin),VerifyNow P2Y12
      assays.

      Part C:A total of 30 STEMI patients are recruited.Patients are randomly assigned to 2
      groups.A group(n=15) is given antiplatelet thrombolysin(the frist antiplatelet drugs based on
      GP Ib receptor which completed the preclinical and phase I clinical studies,and already has
      entered phase II clinical studies) through PV, the other group(n=15) is given placebo through
      PV.All patients are on loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel and 300 mg aspirin.All patients
      plan to receive emergency PCI.Both Groups are given in the same way , a loading dose of 5
      IU/60kg in 5 min through PV,followed by a maintenance dose of 0.002 IU/kg/h for 48h. Blood
      samples are collceted from PV, PA and IC before the injection of loading dose of antiplatelet
      thrombolysin or placebo, and 15 min after the injection.Regional differences will be compared
      between blood samples from PV,PA and IC by LTA-AA; LTA-ADP, LTA-RIS and VerifyNow P2Y12
      assays.
