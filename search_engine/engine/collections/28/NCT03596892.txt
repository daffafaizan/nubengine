      (allo-HSCT) could be a valuable treatment choice for mixed-lineage-leukemia (MLL)-rearranged
      acute leukemia. BUCY conditioning regimen is the standard myeloablative regimen for MLL+
      acute leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT. However, it appears to have higher relapse rate and
      lower survival. To reduce the relapse rate and improve the survival, decitabine is added in
      the conditioning regimen. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the safety and
      efficacy of Decitabine + BUCY and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in MLL+ acute
      leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
