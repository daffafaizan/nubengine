    
      The present trial is an investigator-initiated pilot study on the effects of HOPE on
      ECD-allografts in DBD KT. Fifteen kidney allografts with defined inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be submitted to 2 hours of HOPE via the renal artery before implantation and are going
      to be compared to a case matched group of 30 patients (1:2 matching) transplanted after CCS.
      Besides the clinical evaluation of HOPE-"reconditioned" allograft function, a targeted
      biomarker analysis is planned using tissue, serum, and urine samples as the translational and
      basic research aspect of the present study.
