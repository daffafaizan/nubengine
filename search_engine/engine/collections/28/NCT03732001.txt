      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who
      failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance
      were treated with anlotinib（12mg，po. qd. on day 1to14 of a 21-day cycle） or placebo, the
      anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS
      were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore, the investigators envisage using anlotinib plus
      docetaxel treat the advanced Non-small cell lung cancer patients who were failure of
      first-line Chemotherapy , to further improve the patient's PFS.
