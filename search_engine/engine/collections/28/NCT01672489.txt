    
      Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that on road (track) driving performance will
      deteriorate (variation in lateral lane position and the rate of out of lane driving events)
      and the frequency of episodes of severe sleepiness will increase ("microsleeps" on EEG and
      Johns' Drowsiness Score >4) in shift workers following an extended work shift or night shift
      compared to a rested state, following day shifts.

      Specific Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that ocular measures of alertness (percent of time
      with eyes closed, eye tracking and Johns' Drowsiness Score) are related to abnormal driving
      performance (driving out of the lane) and "microsleeps" during on road (track) driving.

      Specific Aim 2a. To test the hypothesis that autonomic measures, ECG, respiration (measured
      with the Bioharness), skin conductance level and peripheral blood flow (measured with the Q
      sensor), are related to abnormal driving performance (driving out of the lane) and
      "microsleeps" during on road (track) driving

      Specific Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that self-reported sleepiness is related to on road
      (track) driving performance and episodes of severe sleepiness following extended working
      shifts or night shifts.
