    
      Over the past several years, new, "atypical" antipsychotic medications have become available
      to treat schizophrenia with little information to guide prescribing for relatively stable
      outpatients.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either continue taking their current medications
      for schizophrenia, or to switch to a new medication. Participants assigned to switch to a new
      medication will begin receiving either olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal),
      ziprasidone (Geodon), quetiapine (Seroquel), or aripiprazole (Abilify), depending on what
      they are currently taking. Participants currently taking a single oral medication will switch
      to olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, or aripiprazole. Participants currently
      taking a single conventional injectable will begin taking long-acting injectable risperidone
      (Risperdal Consta). Participants currently taking two antipsychotic medications will begin
      taking only one of the medications they are currently using. Participants will stay on their
      assigned treatment for 6 months, after which time the participant's prescribing psychiatrist
      will advise the participant on which medication should be used. Study participants are
      interviewed at study start and at follow-up visits for 1 year.
