    
      This clinical trial was conducted in a qualified clinical trial institution. Investigators
      will use Artery Stent Graft System manufactured by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., LTD.
      to treat patients with thoracic aortic dissection involving the aortic arch. This is a
      Prospective, Multi-center, Objective Performance Criteria Clinical Trial. It is expected to
      submit to the ethics committee of the lead unit for review in Sep 2018, and complete the
      implantation of 150 patients in 18 centres nationwide within 12 months, and interim follow-up
      was conducted before discharge, 30 days after surgery, 6 months after surgery and 12 months
      after surgery, long-term follow-up will be performed at 24 months postoperatively, 36 months
      postoperatively, 48 months postoperatively and 60 months postoperatively.

      This trial will evaluate whether the device reached the primary safety endpoint and primary
      efficacy endpoint through two primary endpoint indicators: the incidence of major adverse
      events (MAE) within 30 days and the success rate of aortic dissection treatment 12 months
      after surgery.

      This trail will evaluate whether the device reached the secondary safety endpoint and
      efficacy endpoint through several secondary endpoint indicators:

        1. the incidence of all-cause death at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 2-5 years after
           surgery

        2. the incidence of thoracic aortic dissection-related death at 30 days, 6 months, 12
           months and 2-5 years after surgery

        3. the incidence of severe adverse events (SAE) at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 2-5
           years after surgery

        4. the incidence of the device-related adverse events (AE) at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months
           and 2-5 years after surgery

        5. the Incidence of left upper limb ischemia at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 2-5 years
           after surgery

        6. the incidence of type I or type III leakage at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months after
           surgery

        7. the incidence of graft migration at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months after surgery

        8. the branching vascular patency rate at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months after surgery

        9. the Incidence of Thoracic aortic dissection -related surgical conversion or
           re-intervention at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and 2-5 years after surgery According to
           the guidelines for clinical trials of aortic stent system, the sponsor will apply for
           NMPA listing registration after completing a 12-month primary endpoint assessment, and
           annually follow-up will be conducted until the fifth year for the long-term efficacy
           observation.
