      mellitus (GDM) diagnostic criteria was defined using a one-step approach (75-g oral glucose
      tolerance test -OGTT-).

      However, not all scientific societies have accepted and have implanted this new diagnostic
      criteria. The lowest glycemia cut-off of this criteria regarding the two-step approach
      entails an increase in GDM incidence with discordant studies about its cost-effectivity.

      It will be assessed if pregnancy outcomes and medical costs are different depending on
      diagnostic criteria used.
