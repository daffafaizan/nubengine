      PRECISE-DAPT score assessed at time of discharge vs. the Delta PRECISE-DAPT score, as
      assessed every 3 months in PCI patients receiving DAPT.

      The primary end-point of the study is the occurrence of bleeding, as defined according to the
      criteria of the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC), either in the whole study
      population or in men vs women.
