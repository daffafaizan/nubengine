      of disability, we currently do not have any effective treatments for this symptom. Rasagiline
      is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD. Rasagiline is a
      MAO-B inhibitor that may decrease the breakdown of dopamine. Many patients report an
      improvement in their energy levels when on this medication. A proven treatment for PD fatigue
      would significantly improve the quality of life for numerous patients and their caregivers.
