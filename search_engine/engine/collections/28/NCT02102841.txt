      of adults and leads to significant loss of quality of life. It results from a complex
      interaction of genetic and environmental factors, and is characterised by dysregulation of
      the cutaneous immune system. Specifically, in the skin of eczema patients there is a
      persistence of T lymphocytes (a crucial cell involved in regulating the immune system), and
      an overproduction of certain cytokines (signalling molecules that are essential in producing
      inflammatory responses).

      The study intends to investigate the causes of atopic eczema by examining the number,
      characteristics and function of T lymphocytes in the skin and the blood of eczema patients,
      as well as the types of cytokine they produce. To achieve this the investigators aim to take
      skin biopsies, tissue fluid (from induced skin suction blisters) and blood samples from adult
      eczema patients and healthy controls for analysis. Additionally, in these groups a cutaneous
      immune response will be initiated by injecting tuberculin protein purified derivative (the
      Mantoux test) into the skin, to further investigate how the behaviour of T lymphocytes varies
      between eczema patients and healthy controls.

      This research is important in view of the high prevalence of atopic eczema in the population.
      An improved understanding of its causes will hopefully lead to more effective treatments for
      this condition in future.
