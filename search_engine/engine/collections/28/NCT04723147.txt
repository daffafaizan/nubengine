      medications are effective for many patients; however, more than 30% fail to respond. Of the
      patients that do respond to treatment, some continue to suffer with primary symptoms of
      depression like an inability to experience pleasure, called anhedonia. In this regard, one
      biological pathway that may contribute to symptoms of depression and particularly anhedonia
      is inflammation.

      The purpose of this 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study is to explore
      new treatment options for people with depression who have high inflammation and anhedonia.
      Despite evidence of low dopamine function in patients with depression, the ability of
      existing dopaminergic therapies, like L-DOPA, to affect brain circuits in depression has yet
      to be explored. This study will help determine the best dose of an FDA-approved medication,
      Sinemet (L-DOPA) that might be used in the future to treat sub-groups of depressed
      individuals.

      Forty male and female participants with depression, between the ages of 25-55 years of age,
      will be randomized to two study tracks (A and B) to receive both placebo and three doses of
      L-DOPA, given in different orders. Increases or decreases in each dose will occur gradually
      over 6 weeks of the study. Participants will complete lab tests, medical and psychiatric
      assessments, neurocognitive testing and functional MRI (fMRI) scans as part of the study. The
      total length of participation is about 2 months.
