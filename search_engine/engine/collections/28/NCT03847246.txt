    
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence,
      crossover study to assess the bioequivalence of test formulation Entecavir Tablets 1.0 mg
      with reference formulation Entecavir Tablets (BaracludeÂ®) 1.0 mg in healthy adult subjects
      under fasting conditions. Each subject will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences
      (TR, RT) according to a randomization schedule prepared prior to the start of the study.
      There will be a 21-day washout between each single dose administration. Subjects in each
      group will be dosed on the same day for Day 1 of Period 1, and all subjects in each group
      will be crossed over to the alternate formulation and will be dosed on the same day for Day
      22 of Period 2.
