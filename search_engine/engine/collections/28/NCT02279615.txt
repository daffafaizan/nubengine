    
      Mirabegron (MyrbetriqTM, Astellas Pharma Inc.) is a drug that is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency and urgency
      incontinence. Multiple studies have shown that this drug also has the potential to improve
      patient tolerability, compliance and subsequent patient quality of life without inducing
      unfavourable adverse events commonly associated with antimuscarinic medications. These
      adverse events include, but are not limited to, dry mouth, constipation, confusion, and acute
      urinary retention (AUR).

      Studies now have shown that mirabegron may also provide an effective treatment option for OAB
      in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) without inducing the above mentioned adverse
      events. This study will look at the combination therapy of Mirabegron and Tamsulosin, versus
      Tamsulosin and placebo alone to prove that this treatment (Mirabegron and Tamsulosin) is
      effective for those men who suffer from both overactive bladder along with benign prostatic
      hyperplasia.
