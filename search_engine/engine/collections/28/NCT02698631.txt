      localization of myocardial fibrosis areas prior to an ablation procedure by means of LGE-MRI
      might help to target atrial areas harboring AF, thereby improving ablation outcomes and
      reducing AF recurrences.

      In order to test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized study comparing the isolation
      of pulmonary veins without fibrosis imaging (conventional ablation procedure) vs. isolation
      of the pulmonary veins and pathological (fibrotic) tissue with the aid of LGE-MRI. Fibrotic
      tissue patches will be encircled and isolated in all patients in the active arm; furthermore,
      LGE-MRI will be used to identify, locate and guide ablation catheter to anatomical gaps
      surrounding pulmonary veins in re-do procedures.

      Eventually, we will identify an optimized ablation strategy in patients undergoing AF
      radiofrequency ablation on the basis of left atrium (LA) fibrosis characterization.
