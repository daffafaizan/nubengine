      time to progression and survival compared to procarbazine alone in patients with recurrent
      malignant gliomas. II. Document the toxicity of these two regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to receive
      procarbazine alone or in combination with isotretinoin. Arm I: Patients receive oral
      procarbazine once daily on days 1-14 every 28 days. Oral isotretinoin is administered every
      12 hours on days 15-28 every 28 days. Patient receive 6 courses of combined therapy, then
      continue with oral isotretinoin alone on days 15-28 of each 28 day course, until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive procarbazine by mouth once
      daily on days 1-14 followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients receive a total of 6 courses of
      treatment in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue a total of 194 patients (97 per treatment group).
