      infection, autoimmunity, and tumor immunity. The relationship between HSP70 expression,
      disease activity and cancer prognosis varied according to type of cancer. The overexpression
      of HSP70 by tumor cells contributes to tumor behavior. HSP70 is present in normal and
      abnormal hepatocytes, and was reported to be over-expressed in both hepatoma cell lines and
      human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. Recent study indicated that HSP70 is a molecular
      marker during early hepatocarcinogenesis. It is also involved in anti-tumor immunity in
      HCC.We also investigate the polymorphism of tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter, and
      correlated to clinical relevance.
