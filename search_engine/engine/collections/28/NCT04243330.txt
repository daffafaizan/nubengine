    
      VA Risk ID is the largest implementation of population-based suicide risk screening and
      evaluation in any United States healthcare system to date. Given the considerable scope of
      this initiative, several strategies have been employed to support national implementation. To
      facilitate continuous quality improvement, ongoing evaluation of VA Risk ID and interventions
      to improve implementation of the three-stage screening and evaluation process are needed.
      This project is intended to help VHA facilities address challenges to implementing VA Risk ID
      to fidelity using a sequence of evidence-based implementation strategies (audit and feedback
      followed by audit and feedback plus external facilitation). By doing so, it will ensure that
      more Veterans are screened and evaluated for suicide risk, which is the basis of effective,
      patient-centered suicide risk management. By adapting the implementation intervention "dose"
      based on facility performance and monitoring implementation over time, this project will
      allow the program office to focus resources where and when needed the most.
