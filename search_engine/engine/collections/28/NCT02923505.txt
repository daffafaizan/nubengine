      be quantified. Data of patients who additionally underwent a polysomnography or polygraphy
      between 2012 and 2015 are taken into consideration. The data (risk for hospitalization and
      death, comorbidities, diagnosis and therapy of SDB, costs of health care utilization) will be
      collected 12 months before and 12 months after diagnosis of SDB.

      The patients' medical records will also be reviewed for compliance to treatment for SDB, and
      the patients will be classified as treated or untreated. The treated group will be divided
      into two subgroups: those with "good adherence" to PAP therapy (â‰¥ 4 hours PAP use per night)
      and those with "poor adherence" to PAP therapy (< 4 hours PAP use per night). Healthcare
      Utilizations, HF or COPD exacerbations and mortality will be identified by reviewing medical
      records, National database when available, or self-reported by patient or patient's family
      through phone interview or questionnaire.
