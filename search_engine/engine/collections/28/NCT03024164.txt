      Stroke etiology in this population differs by geographic region and has greater heterogeneity
      than in older individuals. Ascertain the definite etiologic classification in this young
      patients might be the key point to prevent the stroke recurrence and reduce the stroke
      burden. Advances in stroke diagnostic tests, particularly neuroimaging, refinement in
      classification schema. In this multi-center registry study conducted in China, we determine
      to explore the difference of prognosis and stroke recurrence of young patients with different
      ischemic stroke subtypes.
