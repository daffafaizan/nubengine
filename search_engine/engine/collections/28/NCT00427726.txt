    
      This Protocol aims to provide long-term follow-up of breast cancer and multiple myeloma
      subjects previously receiving autologous primitive marrow and blood hematopoietic cells
      exposed to gene transfer retroviral vectors on the following protocols: MB 294 (92-C-0161;
      T-92-0018), MB 310 (93-C-0208; T-92-0192), MB 361 (96-C-0007; T-95-0096) or (92-H-0057;
      T-92-0139) at the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
      Institute. Subjects will undergo an annual health history and annual complete blood counts
      will be performed. Blood samples will also be collected annually (either locally or off-site
      by the subjects' personal physicians) for testing for presence of the gene transfer vector
      and vector integration sites.
