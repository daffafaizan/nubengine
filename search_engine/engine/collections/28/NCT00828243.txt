      of gender, genetic linkage, recurrent familial cases, targeted gene ablation in murine
      lineages, and by racial disparity in risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.
      Successful fetal-neonatal pulmonary transition requires production of the pulmonary
      surfactant, a phospholipid-protein film that lines alveoli and maintains alveolar patency at
      end expiration. Our goal is to understand the genetic mechanisms that disrupt pulmonary
      surfactant metabolism and cause neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Studies in human
      newborn infants have demonstrated that 3 genes are critical for surfactant metabolism:
      surfactant protein B (SFTPB), surfactant protein C (SFTPC), and an ATP-binding cassette
      transporter, ABCA3 (ABCA3). To understand genetic regulatory mechanisms, we will investigate
      the contribution of variation in each of these genes to risk of neonatal respiratory distress
      syndrome by testing the hypothesis that genetic variants in the SFTPB, SFTPC, and ABCA3
      disrupt pulmonary surfactant metabolism. Using high throughput automated sequencing to
      genotype, multidimensional protein identification technology to assess quantitative and
      qualitative differences in surfactant protein B and C expression, in vivo metabolic labeling
      with stable isotopically labeled precursors to estimate surfactant protein B and C and
      phospholipid metabolic rates, and cohort sizes that provide statistical power (0.8), we will
      use race-specific, severity-stratified case-control (N=480) and case comparison (N=250)
      designs to understand genetically regulated, metabolic mechanisms that cause surfactant
      deficiency by disrupting expression or altering processing of surfactant proteins B or C or
      by disrupting surfactant phospholipid composition in human newborn infants. Improved
      understanding of genetic regulation of surfactant deficiency will suggest novel diagnostic
      strategies to identify and categorize high risk infants and therapeutic strategies that
      target discrete steps in pulmonary surfactant metabolism to improve outcomes of infants with
      neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.
