      caracterizad for recurrent epistaxis,cutaneomucous telangiectasias and arteriovenous
      malformations in diferent organs; brain, lung, liver and gastrointestinal are more often
      afected . Afect one in 5000-8000 individual in worldwide. HHT may produce important morbidity
      like brain absces, stroke, hemoptisis and cronic ferropenic anemia.

      Molecular mechanism of this disorder are complex and still no fully dilucidated. The genes
      mutated in HHT encode endothelial cell-expressed proteins that mediate signalling by the
      transforming growth factor (TGF)b superfamily. Endoglin (HHT type I) and ACVRL-1 (HHT type 2)
      mutations are responsible in more than 80% of the individuals. Mutation of SMAD 4 protein
      (MADH4)cause HHT in association with juvenile polyposis. HHT may associated with primary
      pulmonary hypertension en more rare cases.

      There arent HHT register in Argentina and Latinamerican population. This registry may gader
      valious information in order to generate a better diagnosis and treatment of our population
      and others.
