      chemotherapy for metastatic disease they derive similar benefits to their younger
      counterparts. Anthracyclines are associated with a cumulative dose-dependent cardiomyopathy
      with increased rate in patients over the age of 70. Liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin
      improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by reducing significantly the cardiotoxicity
      and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination
      with cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer
