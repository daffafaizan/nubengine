      characterized core deficits of executive function (EF). The EF impairments occurred in
      preschool period could persist to childhood, adolescent and adulthood, causing extensive and
      deep damage of individual's academic and career achievement, social function, and peer
      relationship. Psychostimulants remain a controversial opinion for preschoolers and appear
      less efficacious and more common side effects. It is very important to explore the effective
      nonpharmacological intervention targeting the EF deficits and appropriately tailored to young
      children. Therefore, the investigators conduct this randomized and controlled study to find
      out the therapeutic efficacy of metacognitive Executive Function Training for Preschool
      Children with ADHD (MEFP), and follow the subjects to observe whether the therapeutic
      efficacy would persist. In the mean time, the investigators also observe the factors which
      can influence the therapeutic efficacy. The goal of this study is to provide a new, early
      treatment approach for preschoolers with ADHD, which could facilitate the EF developing well
      to achieve better outcome.
