      patients. Despite numerous available therapeutic modalities, no gold standard therapy has
      been established. Picosecond lasers are a newer advancement in lasers that have primarily
      used in the treatment of tattoos. A fractional 1064-nm picosecond laser has recently become
      available for the treatment of pigmentation and skin rejuvenation. The main mechanism of
      action is tissue ablation via laser induced optical breakdown (LIOB) which occur when pulse
      intensity is high enough to strip electrons and generating plasma, the plasma absorbs the
      remaining laser energy forming a cavitation bubble within the dermis which has been
      demonstrated to improve fine wrinkles and acne scar through the stimulation of collagen
      formation.
