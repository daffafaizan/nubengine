      with brain metastases. Despite this therapy, patients still have poor survival of four to six
      months. Untreated patients have a median survival of one month. Up to one half of these
      patients die of causes related to the presence of brain metastases. In a Phase I/II RTOG
      trial, the efficacy and safety of delivering accelerated fractionation was investigated in
      patients with good prognostic factors. No toxicity was observed with escalating dose of
      irradiation up 70.40Gy in 1.6Gy twice daily treatments. However, in a randomized trial, the
      use of hyperfractionation did not appear to improve survival when compared to 30Gy whole
      brain irradiation delivered in 10 fractions.

      Current therapeutic approach also includes stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Several
      retrospective studies have demonstrated improved local tumor control of 80% with addition of
      SRS to WBRT. These local control rates were comparable to surgery. In a recently published
      randomized trial by RTOG 95-08 (TJU accrued 42 patients to this trial), Andrews et al.
      demonstrated improved survival in patients with solitary brain lesion treated with SRS.
      Median survival was 6.5 months in patients treated with WBRT and SRS compared to 4.9 months
      in patients treated with WBRT alone. Also, these patients were more likely to have stable or
      improved performance status.
