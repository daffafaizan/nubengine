      placebo for relapse prevention in alcoholics. The secondary objective is to establish an
      association between patients' motivational type and drug effects. The aim is to improve
      alcoholism treatment by identifying characteristics for response to specific pharmacological
      relapse prevention. Such items could allow for an individually adapted pharmacotherapy of
      alcoholism. Specifically, we will study the possible dependence of the efficacy of naltrexone
      and/or acamprosate on different motivational types (reward versus relief craving) and genetic
      profiles referring to glutamatergic and opioidergic candidate genes. Lastly, the longterm
      costs and cost-effectiveness of the different treatment strategies for alcoholics chosen in
      our study are established.
