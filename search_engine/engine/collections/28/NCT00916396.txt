      characterized by a severe deficiency in the desire for sexual activity, causing marked
      distress. There is some data that androgens such as testosterone have some beneficial effect
      in this condition. DHEA is a neurosteroid that is metabolized into testosterone and estrogen,
      both of assumed importance in the regulation of sexual libido. The direct involvement of DHEA
      in the regulation of sexual function is unknown, however, DHEA treatment improved libido in
      midlife-onset depressed subjects. In this study, we will treat women and men suffering from
      HSDD with DHEA. The study's first objective is to determine the effect of DHEA treatment on
      sexual libido in menopausal women and both young and mid-aged men. The secondary objective is
      to compare baseline measures of DHEA, androgens, and other neurosteroids, in individuals with
      HSDD to controls. Furthermore, we will investigate possible correlations between plasma and
      urine levels of several neurosteroids and change in measures of libido. Fifty women and men
      diagnosed with HSDD will be treated with either 100 mg of DHEA or placebo for 6 weeks, in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Outcome measures will include several
      17-Ketosteroids, DHEAS and bioavailable testosterone. Psychological outcome measures will
      include sexual function, mood and well-being. Twenty controls without HSDD will also be
      recruited to determine and compare their baseline levels of neurosteroids.
