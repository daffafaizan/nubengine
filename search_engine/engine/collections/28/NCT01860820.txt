      patients. There will be 2 groups and patients will be randomized to one of the two; one will
      receive standard of care IPC or TED stockings to help with circulation, the other group will
      use the geko device which is a newer device with Health Canada approval. Clinical outcomes
      will be compared for those in each group and clinical differences between patients who
      receive routine medical therapy with IPC/TEDS versus the Geko device will also be evaluated.
