      in the pediatric HSCT population and the effect of malglycemia on important post-HSCT
      outcomes. In addition to usual care during the peri-HSCT period, participants in this trial
      will be asked to wear a continuous glucose monitor for the duration of their initial hospital
      admission. Participants will wear this monitor while admitted to the hospital for up to one
      week prior to transplant, and up to 60 days after transplant.
