      suffer from PTSD. Evidence suggests that these individuals often receive inadequate mental
      health services because effective treatments have not been explored. This study will develop
      and implement a CBT treatment that is designed specifically for the SMI/PTSD population.

      In the first year of the study, a treatment manual and a CBT treatment model, including
      education, social skills training, and exposure therapy, will be developed. In the following
      two years, the treatment program will be tested in individuals with SMI and PTSD. Scale
      ratings, self-report checklists, and daily logs of behavior will be used to assess PTSD
      symptoms. Scale ratings and self-report surveys will also be used to measure hostility,
      functional status, depression and schizophrenia symptoms, and satisfaction with the study.
      Assessments will be made throughout the study.
