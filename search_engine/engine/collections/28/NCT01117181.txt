    
      The Apathy in Dementia Methylphenidate Trial (ADMET), funded by the National Institute of
      Aging, is a Phase II, placebo-controlled, masked, 3-center randomized clinical trial. ADMET
      will enroll 60 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and significant apathy from outpatient,
      nursing home, and assisted living facilities along with their primary caregiver. Eligible and
      willing patients will be randomly assigned to methylphenidate (20 mg per day) or placebo. At
      baseline and each in-person follow-up visit, all caregivers and patients will be provided
      with a standardized psychosocial intervention consisting of a counseling session, provision
      of educational materials, and 24-hour availability for crises. Efficacy and safety outcomes
      will be measured at baseline and at in-person follow-up visits at 2, 4, and 6 weeks following
      randomization. Telephone contact will take place at 1, 3, and 5 weeks after randomization.

      ADMET has 80% power to detect a difference of at least 3.3 in change in the Apathy Evaluation
      Scale scores between the two treatment groups. It also has 80% power to detect an absolute
      difference of 35% or more in the change in the proportion of study participants improving on
      te Clinical Global Impression of Change, given that 20% to 305 of participants in the placebo
      group show improvement.
