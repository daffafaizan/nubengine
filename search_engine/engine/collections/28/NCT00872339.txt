      hemoglobin-the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. People with thalassemia often
      experience fatigue, shortness of breath, and pain. Recent medical advances in treating people
      with thalassemia who receive regular blood transfusions-a standard procedure that refreshes
      the healthy red blood supply-have resulted in increased life spans for these people. However,
      with the extended life spans have come additional issues, including pain. There have been no
      previous research studies that have examined pain levels in people with thalassemia, and as a
      result, the sources and prevalence of pain remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the prevalence and severity of pain, common pain sites, and the impact of pain on
      functioning and well-being in people with thalassemia who receive regular blood transfusions
      and people with thalassemia who do not receive regular blood transfusions.

      This study will enroll people with transfusion-dependant thalassemia and people with
      non-transfusion-dependant thalassemia. At a baseline study visit, participants will complete
      a demographic questionnaire and a pain assessment questionnaire. At Months 3, 6, and 9, study
      researchers will telephone participants to go over the same pain assessment questionnaire
      again.
