      encoding the OCTN2 protein. OCTN2 is a cell membrane protein that transports carnitine into
      the cell. The carnitine supplement levocarnitine, FDA approved for human use and with a
      favorable safety profile, was identified for repurposing. SLC22A5/OCTN2 are a class of sodium
      ion dependent, high affinity transmembrane proteins expressed in the heart, liver, muscle,
      and kidney among other tissues. The screen identified "sicca syndrome" (OR 4.56; P = 5.6E-04)
      as well as various other eye diseases as the most significantly associated phenotypes. Sicca
      syndrome is defined as dryness of the exocrine glands, particularly the eyes
      (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and mouth (xerostomia). This condition is most often caused by
      Sjogren's syndrome (SjS), a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic
      infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands.

      Interestingly, carnitine is present in considerable quantities in the tears of normal,
      healthy eyes, and studies have shown a decrease in the tear carnitine levels of dry eye
      patients. Furthermore, eyedrop preparations containing l-carnitine have shown benefit in dry
      eye disease. The overall hypothesis is that OCTN2 dysfunction underlies keratoconjunctivitis
      sicca in SjS patients and that oral supplementation with levocarnitine may be beneficial.
