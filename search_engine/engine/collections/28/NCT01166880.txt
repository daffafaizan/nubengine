      reflected light images provides the type of data necessary to see the blood vessels.

      The researcher want to assess only feasibility of our instrument. If we determine that our
      instrument has sufficient spatial resolution to image directly large vessels, then we will
      proceed with plans for a larger study with statistical power.
