      great deal of concern about effects of medical radiation exposure on the general public and
      regulations are becoming stricter on the radiation doses that are allowed.

      One novel procedure that has been developed to evaluate the function and structure of the
      lung is the use of hyperpolarized gases with MRI scanners. We want to compare the lung
      imaging techniques that we have developed in our lab to a technique that uses hyperpolarized
      3-Helium gas with MRI. This technique is free from radiation and less invasive than many lung
      imaging techniques.

      Hyperpolarized gas MRI is based on the introduction of spins into the lungs, allowing imaging
      to take place. The use of hyperpolarized 3-Helium has a few advantages:

        1. it allows us to see the microstructure of the lungs through diffusion imaging (apparent
           diffusion coefficient) which correlates with the size of airways and alveolar space.

        2. it allows us to see ventilation, or how air moves in the lungs, at a high resolution.

        3. it is capable of ultra fast imaging which will help us assess gas flow patterns within
           the airways.

      and 4) the speed of depolarization lets us measure the partial pressure of oxygen and
      associated gas exchange mechanisms.
