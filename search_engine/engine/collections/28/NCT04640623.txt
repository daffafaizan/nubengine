      high-risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) is unpredictable; rates of recurrence
      vary from 15 percent (%) to 78%, and rates of progression to muscle invasion and metastasis
      vary from less than (<) 1 to 45%. The TAR-200/gemcitabine (JNJ-17000139-AAC) product
      (hereafter, TAR-200) is an intravesical drug delivery system regulated as an investigational
      drug. The drug constituent consists of gemcitabine minitablets, and osmotic minitablets
      containing urea as the osmotic agent. Cetrelimab (JNJ-63723283) is a fully human
      immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds PD-1. This study consists
      3 periods: screening phase (up to 30 days); treatment phase (up to 2 years); follow up phase
      (up to 5 years). Total duration of study is up to 5 years. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics
      (PK), and biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points during this study.
