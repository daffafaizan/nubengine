        -  Estimate the safety and tolerability of induction paclitaxel, cisplatin, and
           radiotherapy or fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiotherapy followed by consolidation
           chemoradiotherapy or radical cystectomy and adjuvant gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and
           cisplatin in patients with operable stage II or III bladder cancer.

        -  Estimate the efficacy of these regimens, in terms of complete response, in patients who
           have undergone prior transurethral resection (TUR).

        -  Estimate the efficacy of these regimens after TUR, in terms of preserving the native
           tumor-free bladder 5 years after therapy, in these patients.

        -  Estimate the function of the preserved bladder in patients treated with these regimens
           after TUR.

        -  Determine the value of tumor histopathologic, molecular genetic, and DNA content
           parameters as possible prognostic factors for initial tumor response and recurrence-free
           survival in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to T
      stage (T2 vs T3/T4 ). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Induction therapy (weeks 1-3):

             -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
                cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Patients also receive pelvic
                radiotherapy twice daily on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-17.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1-3 and 15-17 and
                cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Patients also receive pelvic
                radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Patients in both arms who achieve complete response after induction therapy proceed to
      consolidation therapy on week 8. Patients with operable pT1 or worse tumor response proceed
      to radical cystectomy on week 9.

        -  Consolidation therapy (weeks 8 and 9):

             -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV
                over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, and 9. Patients also receive pelvic radiotherapy twice
                daily on days 1-5 and 8-10.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive 5-FU IV over 24 hours on days 1-3 and 8-10 and cisplatin
                as in arm I. Patients also receive radiotherapy as in arm I.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy (weeks 21-33 or 17-29): Beginning 12 weeks after consolidation
           therapy or 8 weeks after radical cystectomy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30-60
           minutes, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients (48 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
