    
      A pivotal, single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment,
      crossover, comparative bioavailability study for test drug Synflutide HFA 250/25 Inhaler and
      reference drug SeretideTM 250 EvohalerTM in healthy volunteers without charcoal block. Fifty
      healthy, male and female volunteers, 20-65 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) within
      18.0-30.0 kg/m2, inclusive, will be enrolled. A single dose of 4 puffs (eq. to fluticasone
      propionate 1000μg+salmeterol 100μg from valve) in each study period. Plasma samples will be
      assayed for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol using a validated analytical method
      according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice.
