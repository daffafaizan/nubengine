      Norway. Considerable improvements have recently emerged within kidney transplantation in
      relation to survival and quality of life. However, after transplantation, adherence to
      immunosuppressive drug therapy and other medical advices is crucial for staying healthy,
      keeping the graft, and retain good quality of life. In case of graft loss the patient has to
      return to dialysis, representing reduced functioning, fatigue and negative impact on quality
      of life. Dialysis also leads to higher costs for the society and in many cases a need for
      re-transplantation. A key challenge to adherence is the ability to gain access to, understand
      and use health information, defined as health literacy by the WHO. For renal transplant
      recipients preparedness for handling information and going through transplantation is
      essential. Hence, supporting the patients becoming reflective and health literate knowledge
      users is crucial.

      Through a RCT this project aims to test the effect of a new health communication
      intervention, KnowMAP (knowledge management for renal transplant recipients), as compared
      with standard care in patients undergoing renal transplantation.

      KnowMap is a novel intervention designed by clinicians and researchers at Oslo University
      Hospital (OUS), University of Oslo (UiO) and University of Stavanger (UiS). The intervention
      is targeting knowledge management skills of patients by using motivational interview (MI)
      techniques. It represents 4 sessions of individual patient counselling starting the first
      week after the transplantation.
