      values related to the bone indexes of this joint, obtained from CT performed both in
      ortostatism and clinostatism.

      Young patients with patellofemoral joint pathology, for which a diagnostic examination is
      necessary in order to determine a possible surgical indication, will be included in this
      pilot study, and will be evaluated using the "Cone Beam Computed Tomography "(CBCT), a
      machine that use a low dose of radiation compared to traditional CT systems, and allows the
      examination in supine and standing position knee . In this way, for the same patient it will
      be possible to calculate the bone indexes both in weight-bearing condition and in
      non-weight-bearing, comparing the values between them, to identify possible differences due
      to the influence of orthostatism.
