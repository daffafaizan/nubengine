      platelet lysate,is made up of autologous marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo
      expanded numerically for approximately 14 days using pooled human Platelet Lysate (phPL),
      harvested from culture on the day of infusion and suspended at a concentration of 4 million
      cells/ml in Plasmalyte A with 0.5% human serum albumin. This is a phase I dose-escalation,
      open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of EPIC MSC2014-002. The product will be infused intravenously
      and will be administered at one of three dose levels: (Dose level 1): Single Cell infusion 2
      x 10^6 cells/kg, (Dose Level 2): Two weekly Cell infusions 2 x 10^6 cells/kg , (Dose level
      3): Four weekly Cell infusion 2 x 10^6 cells/kg. This Phase I clinical trial will enroll
      12-24 subjects with acute or chronic GVHD. The duration of this study for each patient is 1
      year. The investigators anticipate that this study will be completed within 3 years of
      commencement.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of infusing escalating doses of autologous MSCs
           for patients with acute or chronic GVHD.

        -  To assess the overall response rate of acute and chronic GVHD to autologous MSC
           infusion. These data will be used to plan future, larger clinical trials to evaluate the
           efficacy of autologous MSCs for the treatment of GVHD.

        -  To determine the effect of MSC infusion on lymphocyte phenotype, inflammatory biomarkers
           and GVHD specific biomarker levels
