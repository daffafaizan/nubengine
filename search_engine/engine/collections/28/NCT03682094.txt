      microbiota in older patients with dysphagia at risk for pneumonia. A total of 20 participants
      will be recruited from the UW Health Inpatient Swallowing Consult Service. Participants will
      have a dysphagia diagnosis along with documented aspiration on videofluoroscopy. Each
      participant will receive a once daily VSL#3 probiotic blend (dissolved in thickened liquid as
      applicable) for 28 days. A baseline assessment will be completed to collect data on
      demographics, health history and behaviors, usual diet, level of oral intake, and
      patient-reported swallow function. Oral swab (buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum) as well as
      saliva sample collections will be completed. Data on adherence and adverse events will be
      collected weekly. Bacterial DNA will be extracted from oral samples and 16S rRNA sequencing
      techniques will be used to identify contents of oral microbiota at baseline, week 2, and week
      4. Oral microbial composition will be compared between the time points, and treatment
      feasibility (recruitment and retention rates) in this population will be evaluated.
