    
      This is an outpatient, Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,
      parallel-group study assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MB07811 given orally
      to subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia for 12 weeks. There will be a 3- to 6-week
      screening/run-in period, including washout of any lipid-modifying therapies (as needed) prior
      to randomization. Eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to placebo, or 3 different
      doses of MB07811 for 12 weeks. After the double-blind treatment phase, all randomized
      subjects will proceed into a 6-week off-drug phase. Assessments include: laboratory tests,
      adverse events (AEs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vitals, and PK samples.
