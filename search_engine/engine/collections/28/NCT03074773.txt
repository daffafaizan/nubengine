      will receive paravertebral block with 0.5mg/kg bupivacaine 0.25% diluted with isotonic saline
      (total volume 15ml) and group II (n=30) will receive paravertebral block with 0.5mg/kg 0.25%
      bupivacaine and 0.1mg/kg dexamethasone.intraoperative fentanyl needs, Intra and postoperative
      hemodynamics and OPS pain scores will be recorded. Possible risks as hypertension will be
      treated by nitroglycerin infusion 0.5ug/kg/min or tachycardia (HR more than 20% than
      baseline) will be managed by additional doses of fentanyl 1-2ug/kg, bradycardia (20% decrease
      from the baseline) will be managed by atropine 0.02mg/kg. Also, the complications of
      paravertebral block as peridural and intravascular injection can be avoided by careful
      aspiration before injection and injection while visualization of the needle by U/S.
