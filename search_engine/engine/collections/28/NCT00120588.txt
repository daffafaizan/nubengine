    
      This is a randomized controlled trial at 18 french tertiary hospitals with stratification by
      center and multiple births in women at risk of preterm birth before 33 week's gestation and
      without vascular disease of pregnancy.

      Women received 4 g of a 0.1 g/ml magnesium sulfate solution or isotonic serum chloride
      solution (0.9%).

      The main outcome measures are rates of mortality up to discharge, of severe white matter
      injury (defined by the presence of cavitations and/or intraparenchymal haemorrhages on
      cranial ultrasonographic studies) and of combined death and severe white matter injury.

      The secondary outcome measures are rates of white matter injury (defined by the presence of
      cavitations and/or intraparenchymal haemorrhages and persisting hypechogenicities at 15 day
      intervals on cranial ultrasonographic studies), follow-up at two years of age
