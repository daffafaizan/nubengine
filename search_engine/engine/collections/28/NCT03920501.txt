    
      Cluster randomized trial involving ICUs in Brazil. ICU is the unit of randomization.

      The trial will have two stages:

      Stage I - Baseline data:

        -  Characterize participant ICUs and quality indicators

        -  Characterize patients from each participant ICU to describe baseline outcomes

      Stage II - Intervention:

      This is the main stage for data analysis. ICUs will be randomly assigned to an experimental
      or control group. The experimental group should use a multidisciplinary rounds with a board
      certified physician through tele-critical care and take part in meetings to discuss how to
      improve local quality indicators, and the control group will follow the local standard of
      care.
