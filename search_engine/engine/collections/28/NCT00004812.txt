      are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Patients are stratified into pairs by age,
      time since onset, Frankel grade, and Motor Score Index.

      One group receives body weight-supported treadmill training immediately after baseline
      clinical, biomechanical, and physiological measures. The second group is the control;
      baseline measures are identical but training is delayed for 3 months.

      Patients in both groups receive training 3 days/week for 3 months. Initial treadmill velocity
      is 18 meters/minute; velocity is increased in increments of 6 meters/minute until the maximum
      speed is achieved at which each patient exhibits the best locomotor capability at full weight
      bearing. Patients are trained with the minimal weight support assistance necessary for
      effective limb progression without excessive knee flexion or hyperextension. Polypropylene
      ankle-foot orthosis is allowed.

      Patients are re-tested after maximal treadmill velocity is achieved: following clonidine once
      a day for 3 days; clonidine twice a day for 3 days; cyproheptadine for 3 days; and an
      increased dose of cyproheptadine for 3 days. There is a 3-day washout between clonidine and
      cyproheptadine testing.

      Patients are not advanced if they experience adverse cardiovascular effects during therapy.
      No concurrent therapeutic exercise for the lower extremities is allowed.

      Kinematic, temporal, kinetic, spasticity, Frankel grading, Motor Index Score, metabolic, and
      functional outcome measures are evaluated at 3 and 6 months.
