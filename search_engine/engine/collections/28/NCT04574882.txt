      approaches have improved longevity of patients, risk factors and adverse health behaviors
      (e.g., physical inactivity, smoking) are highly prevalent, and in most contemporary series,
      less than 1% of adults meet all factors of ideal CV health. The logistics and practicalities
      of meeting the goal of ideal CV health have not been clearly elucidated. Practice guidelines
      recommend using the Framingham risk score (FRS) or other risk prediction tools to classify
      patients' risk of CV disease. These models however are imprecise and there is increasing
      focus on identifying markers that provide better measures of risk. As digital platforms are
      increasingly used to document lifestyle and health behaviors, data from digital sources may
      provide a window into manifestations of novel risk factors and potentially a better
      characterization of existing risk factors. While it seems like a cliche to mention the
      profound impact of digital data on everyday lives, there is indeed great substance in the
      opportunities these new media provide for understanding behavioral, social, and environmental
      determinants of health. This project seeks to identify and characterize features derived from
      digital data (e.g. social media, online search, mobile media) which are associated with
      coronary heart disease (CHD) and related risk factors, and develop models that use digital
      data and conventional predictive models to predict CHD risk and health care utilization.
