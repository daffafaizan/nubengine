      associations found between Parkinson's patients' DNA and their disease. To learn more, visit:
      https://www.23andme.com/pd/. You can participate in this research initiative without leaving
      home. If you are eligible to participate, we will send you an in-home 23andMe DNA kit at no
      cost. We will ask you short online surveys (15-20) about your Parkinson's journey, symptoms,
      and response to treatment. Enrollment is on-going and open to individuals who have been
      diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and are residents of the U.S. Participants receive access
      to ancestry information and uninterpreted genetic data. Participants will also receive
      regular updates on our research efforts and findings.
