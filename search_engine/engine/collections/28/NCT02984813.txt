      to evaluate their effect on the structure or function of mitochondria as it relates to the
      autofluorescence imaging being conducted in the study. They are not being studied to evaluate
      their ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, or treat disease.

      These ingredients in these combinations of nutritional supplements have also been reported
      beneficial in diabetic retinopathy. Patients with diabetic retinopathy will be added later as
      an additional arm and an amendment to this effect will be submitted when that portion of the
      study is ready to be initiated. That amendment will include background material, appropriate
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, informed consent, and references. At the current time, only
      the glaucoma proposal and glaucoma patients will be enrolled according to this submitted
      protocol.
