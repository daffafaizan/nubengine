    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blinded, controlled study evaluating
      safety and preliminary efficacy of immunoselected, culture-expanded, nucleated, allogeneic
      MPCs (NeoFuse) combined with MasterGraft Matrix in a commercially available PEEK cervical
      Spacer compared to an active control in subjects undergoing 2 or 3 level anterior cervical
      discectomy and fusion with anterior cervical plate fixation.

      After the screening and surgical visits, each subject will be evaluated clinically and
      radiographically within 3 days and 30 days after surgery, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months
      after surgery.

      Subjects will be evaluated at the same time points for safety.
