      July 2011 were randomized to receive either intervention A (harmonic scalpel) or B
      (electrocautery). The procedure was standardized except elevation of flaps and axillary
      dissection, that was performed as per randomization. Patients were followed up in clinic for
      four weeks. The outcomes were estimated blood loss (EBL), operating time, drain Volume and
      drain Days, complications (seroma, surgical site infection, hematoma and flap necrosis) and
      postoperative pain.
