        -  Determine whether the effects of massage therapy in patients with cancer pain are
           sufficiently promising to warrant a definitive trial.

        -  Determine the feasibility of a definitive trial.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to
      in-patient status (yes vs no) and first baseline pain score â‰¥ 7 (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (massage therapy): Patients receive a light touch ("Reiki") massage over 45
           minutes.

        -  Arm II (volunteer visit control): Patients receive a 45-minute visit from a trained
           volunteer who will be available to sit quietly or talk with the patient to discuss
           issues of concern, as desired by the patient. Volunteers will not touch the patient
           except to pat their shoulder or briefly hold their hand.

        -  Arm III (quiet time control): Patients receive 45 minutes of quiet time. Pain and mood
           are assessed at baseline, immediately after treatment, at 6 hours and 24 hours after
           treatment, and then daily for the next 5 days after treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
