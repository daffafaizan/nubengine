      of Botulin toxin type A (BTX-A) injections. Some authors believe that highly diluted BTX-A
      injections achieve greater neuromuscular blockade resulting in higher spasticity reduction.
      They are arguing that BTX-A in high dilution is the optimal choice especially when bigger
      muscles are injected, for the large volume of fluid administered into the muscle will carry
      the BTX-A molecules to endplates remote from the injection site. Two animal studies suggest
      that increasing the volume of diluents is a potential strategy in order to achieve a more
      efficient and cost-effective manner of BTX-A treatment. An attempt to quantify how the
      location of BTX-A injection affects the drug effect was made, which revealed that injecting
      only 0.5 cm away from the motor endplates yielded a 50% decrease in paralysis2. A newer
      double-blinded study by JM Gracies et al performed on humans comes to the same conclusion,
      that high volume dilution provides greater neuromuscular block and spasticity reduction than
      a low volume dilution. On the other hand, other researchers suggest that there is no
      difference in spasticity decrease if either high or low volume toxin is being injected.

      Previous studies lack either the design or the power of study was low. Therefore, there is no
      clear guideline for an optimal botulinum toxin dilution protocol.
