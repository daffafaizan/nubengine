      and mortality. It is chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from
      a relative deficiency in insulin through either reduced insulin secretion or reduced insulin
      action or both. The subsequent chronic hyperglycaemia causes glycation of tissues, which
      almost inevitably leads to acute disturbances in metabolism and long term end organ damage,
      especially the blood vessels, heart, and nerves, and severe health complications.

      Individuals with T2D have reduced aerobic fitness characterized by lower peak pulmonary
      oxygen uptake. Many potential mechanisms could explain this impaired response, for example,
      reduced muscle blood flow and capillary density, defects in muscular oxygen diffusion, and
      lower mitochondrial oxygen utilization and function.

      T2D is also associated with lower baroreflex sensitivity and abnormal chronotropic response,
      altering heart rate regulation. In addition, prolonged hyperglycemia in T2D causes a number
      of pathological changes in vascular endothelial cells, increasing the production of reactive
      oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines that cause mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
      damage.
