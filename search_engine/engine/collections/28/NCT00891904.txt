      Primary

        -  To assess the toxicity of stereotactic body radiotherapy delivered concurrently with
           cetuximab in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the feasibility of delivering this regimen in these patients.

        -  To assess the impact of this regimen on local control, distant control, and overall
           survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-5. Patients
      undergo 1 fraction of stereotactic-body radiotherapy (RT) in week 2. At 4 weeks after RT
      completion, patients may receive additional cetuximab IV combined with a 28-day chemotherapy
      regimen, per investigator discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every
      3-4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
