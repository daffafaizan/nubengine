        -  Compare the incidence of clinical heart failure in women with c-erbB2-positive
           metastatic breast cancer treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil
           in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin®).

        -  Compare the therapeutic activity of this regimen, in terms of objective response rate,
           in these patients.

        -  Compare the duration of response and time to progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive CMF comprising cyclophosphamide orally on days 1-14 or IV on days 1 and 8
      and methotrexate IV and fluorouracil IV on days 1 and 8. Patients also receive trastuzumab
      (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes once weekly beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for 8 courses. Patients then receive trastuzumab once every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until documentation of disease progression or initiation
      of a new anticancer therapy. Patients developing disease progression are followed every 12
      weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
