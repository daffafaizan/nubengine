      size in pediatric transgender individuals. Information is limited regarding bone health and
      metabolism for this group, and especially for children who are transgender. Further, the
      team's expertise in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS),
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and peripheral quantitative computed tomography
      (pQCT), examining the natal female skeleton in previous NIH funded studies, and extensive
      clinical expertise, provide an ideal foundation to apply this protocol to examine transgender
      female and transgender male skeleton. Findings from this study will allow us to identify
      potential preventative strategies to counter the long-term effects of puberty blockade such
      as osteoporosis and raise awareness of this medical consequence to medical care providers of
      transgender patients. The proposed project seeks to answer the clinically relevant question
      of how bone marrow composition relates to body composition, and its relation to both bone
      density and skeletal strength, in transgender patients who are undergoing puberty blockade,
      the first phase of therapy preceding gender-affirming hormone therapy.
