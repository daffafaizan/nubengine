      worldwide, contributing significantly to serious maternal and fetal complications. There are
      various forms of hypertensive disorders that occur during pregnancy and among them are
      pre-eclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. These two disorders
      present with high blood pressure and proteinuria, which leads often to hospitalization of
      these women. It is believed that with such an accent hospitalization occur in pain conditions
      that often affect pregnant women. Given these complications, this study aims to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a physical therapy protocol used in pregnant women with preeclampsia
      admitted with respect to blood pressure levels, responses maternal-fetal and perinatal, and
      measure an expected improvement in quality of life in the reduction of reported pain and
      anxiety. The study will include the participation of women with preeclampsia and chronic
      hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia, hospitalized, with no significant complications
      that may hinder the normal progress of pregnancy. Pregnant women will answer questionnaires
      about quality of life, anxiety and scales to identify musculoskeletal discomfort. Monitoring
      will be done both the pregnant woman and the fetus through imaging and laboratory, in
      addition, pregnant women carry the exercise protocol previously proposed work. This is
      expected to achieve satisfactory results in the improvement of maternal and fetal
      hemodynamics in aspects of muscle discomfort and quality of life in a secure way for these
      women.
