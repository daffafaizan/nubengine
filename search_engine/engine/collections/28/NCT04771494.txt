      instability on power and speed of execution in the bench press exercise. For the design of
      this quasi-experimental research, with an ad hoc protocol, an intersubject comparison was
      used in 5 different conditions. 20 male participants were grouped into two groups based on
      their previous experience with unstable training and volunteered for this study. Expert group
      (n= 10; 23.70 ± 4.30 years; 81.40 ± 9.67 kg; 179.50 ± 8.95 cm; 3.5 ± 4.10 years of strength
      training experience; 9 ± 10.60 months of unstable training experience) Novice group (n= 10;
      25.60 ± 6.50 years; 77.80 ± 4.44 kg; 176.40 ± 2.80 cm; 3.40 ± 1.96 years of strength training
      experience; 0.90 ± 0.99 months of unstable training experience). Subjects with no experience
      in training with unstable loads (having implemented unstable loads in their training at some
      point) or current or recent injuries (within the last 6 months) that caused them to alter
      their normal physical activity were excluded from this study. This study was in accordance
      with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). All participants gave written informed consent prior
      to the study.

      Subjects performed the bench press exercise by assessing mean propulsive velocity and power
      with 3 different loads for each of the unstable situations: light (40% of 1RM), moderate (60%
      of 1RM) and high (80% of 1RM). In a familiarisation session, subjects performed the relative
      loads with each condition to determine their strength-velocity profiles and their optimal
      work percentages. In addition, an incremental load test was performed to determine the 1RM of
      each of the participants to determine the external load for each load percentage in each of
      the subjects.
