      Part 1 Primary Objectives To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and exposure of apremilast
      following multiple-dose administration of a QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID
      reference IR tablet under the fed condition with a standard meal.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a QD apremilast formulation
      and the BID reference IR tablet.

      Exploratory Objective To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of apremilast following
      multiple-dose administration of the QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID reference
      IR tablet under the fed condition with a standard meal.

      Part 2 Primary Objectives To estimate the PK and exposure of apremilast following single dose
      administration of a QD apremilast formulation relative to the BID reference IR tablet under
      the fasting condition To estimate the effect of food on the PK of a single oral dose of a QD
      apremilast formulation.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a QD apremilast formulation
      and the BID reference IR tablet.
