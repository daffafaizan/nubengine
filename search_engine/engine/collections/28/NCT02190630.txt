      with a discrepancy between their upper and lower jaws. The reason it is worn between these
      ages is to avail of the pre pubertal growth spurt, evidence for full time wear is merely
      empirical.If this appliance only had to be worn part time it would have a significant change
      in orthodontics in terms of patient acceptance and compliance.The investigators plan on
      recruiting 84 patients to the study and these subjects will be referred from hospital
      colleagues. The investigators will randomly allocate the subjects into 2 groups, Group 1 will
      wear the appliance Full Time(24hours), group 2 will wear the appliance part time(12hours).

      The study will be conducted in the Dental Institute at the Royal London Hospital, this
      hospital setting will be the sole site.

      The study will last for 15 months from the time the last patient is recruited. Participants
      will undergo an initial records appointment where a radiograph and clinical measurements will
      be taken followed by 12 months of functional appliance treatment where the patient will be
      reviewed at 6-8weekly intervals and clinical measurements taken.A final radiograph will be
      taken at 15months.
