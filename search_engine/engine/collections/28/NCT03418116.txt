      pigmentosa with at least some light perception in the eye to be implanted.

      The majority of RP patients still have some central vision even at a very late stage of the
      disease. This extremely restricted visual field is, however, highly disabling in daily life.
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and benefit of the Argus II
      System in RP patients characterized as late stage with a central residual visual field
      smaller than or equal to 5 degrees radius . The electrode array will be placed in a para- to
      peri foveal location adjacent to the subject's residual visual field, thus increasing the
      total retinal area receptive to light.

      Safety data will be monitored to ensure continued acceptability of risks to study subjects
      and visual function will be measured to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in this
      "better vision" RP population. In addition, effects on functional vision and quality of life
      will be assessed through the Functional Low-Vision Observer Rated Assessment (FLORA) and the
      National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25).
