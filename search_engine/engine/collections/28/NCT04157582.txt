      on cognition. Individuals can recover from physical disability resulting from stroke, but
      might be unable to return to their previous occupations or independent life because of
      cognitive impairments.

      deficits in multiple domains such as attention, executive functions , memory, language and
      visuoperceptual abilities. Cognitive impairment occurs in up to 64% of people who have had a
      stroke and has been associated with a 3-fold increase in risk for mortality,
      institutionalization and decreased instrumental activities of daily living function.
