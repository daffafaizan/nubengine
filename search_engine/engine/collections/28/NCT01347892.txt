      young to middle age adults. There are several treatment options for symptomatic articular
      cartilage injuries depending on a patient's age, symptoms and duration of complaints in
      addition to the size and condition of the lesion. DeNovo NT Natural Tissue Graft is comprised
      of fresh particulated juvenile cartilage pieces that are secured inside articular cartilage
      lesions using fibrin adhesive. DeNovo NT Graft was developed due to the current need for
      expanded treatment options for the treatment of cartilage lesions, especially large lesions.

      This post-market, multicenter, longitudinal data collection study was established to collect
      clinical outcomes of subjects implanted with DeNovo NT Graft. Data may be obtained either
      retrospectively or prospectively from patients implanted or to be implanted with DeNovo NT
      Graft for the treatment of lesion in the ankle. Data to be collected include details of the
      operative procedure as well as subject pain, function, activity levels, and healthcare
      resource use through a five year post-operative follow-up period.
