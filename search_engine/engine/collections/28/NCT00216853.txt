      potentially harmful if not treated and significantly reduce quality of life. By
      characterizing the vaginal microflora and immune profiles of women that suffer recurrent UTIs
      in contrast to a healthy age matched normal group of women (with no history of recurrent
      UTIs), we can better understand the differences. This in turn can lead to development of
      better quality probiotics that will be based on their scientific basis, clinical efficacy,
      and quality in terms of shelf life and delivery to target sites. The reduction in only one
      third of UTI cases seen each year would have a significant impact on reducing health care
      costs.
