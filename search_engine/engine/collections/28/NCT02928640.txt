      ClariCore System. The ClariCore system is designed to improve how the tissue samples are
      being collected from the prostrate by using light sensors (fiber optics) that can see changes
      in the tissue. Researchers will study the data collected from the light sensor (optical
      readings) to develop a method (like a mathematical equation) that can be used to tell the
      difference between normal and cancerous prostrate tissue during the biopsy. What the
      researchers are hoping to learn from this study is if a light guided biopsy procedure can
      improve the accuracy of prostrate biopsy sampling.
