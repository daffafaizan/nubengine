      a contiguous source of infection.

      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and potentially fatal bacterial infection
      in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, occurring in 10 to 30% of patients, with in-hospital
      mortality rates ranging from 20 to 30% .

      It is secondary to impaired humoral and cellular immune responses that result in indirect
      intestinal bacterial translocation into the ascitic fluid.

      SBP is also associated with a poor long-term prognosis for patients, as mortality rates can
      reach 50 to 70% at 1 year.

      Early diagnosis and early optimal treatment of these infections with appropriate antibiotics
      and the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome with albumin are required .

      Current European and most other international guidelines recommend the use of a
      third-generation cephalosporin as the first choice, or amoxicillin-clavulanate acid or
      fluoroquinolones as an alternative choice.

      These recommendations are based mainly on clinical trials that were very often conducted a
      decade or more ago, and on the assumption that E. coli would be involved in nearly half of
      the cases.

      Several studies have pointed out changes in the epidemiology of the causative bacteria in SBP
      and bacterascites and in their susceptibility to antibiotics. In particular, the development
      of beta-lactamase enzymes, which confer resistance to clavulanate, or extended spectrum
      beta-lactamases in Escherichia coli.The potential emergence of enterococci,
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, following norfloxacin
      prophylaxis, is also a cause of concern since they may be associated with a higher risk of
      therapeutic failure.
