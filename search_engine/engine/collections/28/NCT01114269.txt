    
      The PRE-DETERMINE Study is a prospective, multi-center study of patients with a history of
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and documentation of either a prior myocardial infarction (MI)
      or mild to moderate left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 35-50%). Patients were enrolled at 135
      sites where information on baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, pertinent past
      medical history, lifestyle habits, cardiac test results, and medications were collected via
      electronic data capture. Electrocardiograms along with a blood sample was also collected at
      baseline, sent to central laboratories, and stored for future analyses. Contrast-enhanced
      magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) scans were collected on a subset of patients and
      analyzed. Enrollment closed in November 2013 and patients are now being followed centrally by
      the Clinical Coordinating Center via mail/phone to document interim non-fatal arrhythmic
      events and cause-specific mortality. Questionnaires that inquire about intervening ICD
      implantations, ICD therapies, cardiac arrest, and other pertinent cardiovascular endpoints
      are mailed to participants every six months, and follow-up telephone calls are made to
      non-responders. Study endpoints are being confirmed through review of medical records,
      interviews with next-of-kin, and autopsy reports, if available.
