      evaluate the initial safety of PAE for the treatment of symptomatic bladder outlet
      obstruction. 50 adult male subjects will be enrolled in this study. If eligible patients will
      undergo the prostate artery embolization procedure in the Interventional Radiology
      department. An angiogram of the prostate arteries will be done. Small beads called
      Embospheres will be injected into the prostate artery to slow blood flow to the prostate in
      the hope of providing relief with minimal side effects and complications, for lower urinary
      tract symptoms caused by BPH. After the procedure the patient will be followed at 4 weeks, 12
      weeks, 6 months, 12 months post procedure and then annually for up to 4 years.
