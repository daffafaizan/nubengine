      patient with acute or chronic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are entered on a
      CALGB protocol for previously untreated patients. Bone marrow aspirate and blood specimens
      are obtained from patients at diagnosis, remission, or relapse and stored. Buccal smears are
      obtained at diagnosis, and DNA is extracted and preserved.

      It was anticipated that the specimens collected under this protocol would be used by a large
      number of investigators. This protocol does not describe the details of each approved project
      (eg, eligibility age range).
