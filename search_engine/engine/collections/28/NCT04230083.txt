      Dienogest of 1 tablet formulation with Dienogest 2.0 mg and to demonstrate bioequivalence of
      both formulations in terms of rate and extent of absorption:

        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Andr√≥maco S.A.

        -  Reference Product: Visannette [Trademark], product of Bayer AG, Germany. The 90%
           confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus
           Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma
           concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t) and from time zero to 72
           hours (AUC0-72), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Dienogest will be
           determined. Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 36 hours
           during each study period (for 12 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during
           which pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 16 blood samples will be
           taken up to 24 hours after the administration in each period. Participants will return
           to the site to provide additional blood samples at 48 h, and 72 h postdose.

      The washout period between the two study periods will be at least 14 days. The samples from
      each participant will be analyzed with 2 methods of highperformance liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical assays to quantify total Dienogest in
      plasma.

      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in women by
      collecting adverse events.
