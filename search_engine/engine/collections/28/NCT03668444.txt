      history of collaboration in the development, revision, and evaluation of web-based and mobile
      phone technologies to promote behavior change. For this project the investigators will fully
      develop and implement an interactive text messaging intervention system for individuals
      sentenced to DTC who are entering the program, at which time participants are expected to
      begin addressing underlying issues related to their addiction, and during which time
      participants are highly vulnerable to relapse and noncompliance with mandated activities.
      Outcomes will include participation in and compliance with Court-mandated appointments,
      abstinence from drug use (measured by urine testing), participation in substance abuse
      treatment, participation in education/employment training programs, and participation in
      related programs and workshops as directed by the Court. Data will be collected directly from
      Court records using a database established by the participating courts for this study.
