      allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation preceded by a nonmyeloablative,
      fludarabine based conditioning regimen in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.
      II. Determine the toxicities of this regimen, especially graft versus host disease, in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days -7 to -4,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -5, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days
      -4 and -3. Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is
      administered IV over 1 hour or subcutaneously beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. Patients are followed weekly until day 60 and then monthly for 10 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6 patients will be accrued for this study.
