      receives 80,500 patients for CT or MRI scans in usual care. The length of waiting, the
      environment of the waiting room, the reasons for the examination are factors that increase
      the levels of anxiety during waiting and but also during early examination.

      Previous studies have shown that the integration of nature (real as well as artificial) is
      likely to decrease the level of anxiety. Before implementing a multicentre and randomised
      trial, a pilot study is necessary to assess the feasibility of the procedure, to test the
      relevance of the tools, to identify the influence of socio-cultural and socio-demographic
      characteristics on anxiety's level.

      For this, the present study will be conducted over the same period of the year in order to
      avoid seasonality biases. The study will take place over 8 weeks, during which MRI or scanner
      patients will be exposed either to the neutral environment (standard environment of the
      waiting room) or to one of the 3 environments (wall posters representing the nature ("green",
      "sea", "zen")).

      There is no specific intervention assigned to the study participants, i.e. the patients will
      receive one of the four environments as part of routine medical care, and a researcher
      studies the effect of this environment on anxiety's level. Every week, one environment will
      be set up in the MRI or scanner waiting room and the study will be proposed to all eligible
      patients present in this room. Fifty patients are expected each week so that 100 patients per
      environment and equally distributed between the MRI and scanner waiting rooms are expected.
