    
      A randomized controlled trial in which nurses will be randomized to either medical masks or
      N95 respirators when providing medical care to patients with COVID-19. This Canadian
      multi-centre randomized controlled trial will assess whether medical masks are non-inferior
      to N95 respirators when nurses provide care involving non-aerosol generating procedures.
      Nurses will be randomized to either use of a medical mask or to a fit-tested N95 respirator
      when providing care for patients with febrile respiratory illness. The primary outcome is
      laboratory confirmed COVID-19 among nurse participants.
