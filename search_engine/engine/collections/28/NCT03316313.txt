      cancer in the later stages if left untreated. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
      recommends a one-time screening for high risk birth cohort between the years 1945-1965. Prior
      studies have evaluated methods to improve screening for hepatitis c with focus on increasing
      awareness in health professionals. Targets included nursing staff and electronic medical
      records. This study targets providing patients with education resources to see if screening
      rates improve.
