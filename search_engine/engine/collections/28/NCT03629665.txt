      promising tools for neurorehabilitation, aphasia therapy included. Combined with behavioral
      techniques, Intensive Language-Action Therapy (ILAT), TMS could substantially amplify the
      beneficial effect of such behavioral therapy alone.

      In this randomized study of 17 subjects with post-stroke aphasia in the chronic stage will be
      studied the combined effect of ILAT and 1-Hz placebo-controlled navigated repetitive TMS
      (rTMS) to the right-hemispheric inferior frontal cortex (pars triangularis). Participant will
      be randomized to groups A and B. Participants in group A will receive a 2-week period of rTMS
      during naming training where they name pictures every ten second displayed on the screen,
      followed by 2-weeks of rTMS and naming combined with ILAT. Those in group B will receive the
      same behavioral therapy but TMS is replaced by sham stimulation.

      Language performance will be measured before, during and after the interventions for 3
      months.
