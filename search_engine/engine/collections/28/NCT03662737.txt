      digitizing pencil. Visual feedback is projected on a screen surface in front of the subject,
      which hides the sight of actual movements from the latter. In the experimental condition of
      rotation, the experimenter introduces a rotation of 45 grades between the movement realized
      by the subject and the visual feedback that is provided on the screen. Then, the subject is
      provided with a strategy in order to overcome this perturbation: that is, to make the
      movement aiming 45 grades to the opposite direction from the introduced rotation. This
      explicit strategy leads to immediate correction of the error, but as the time passes subjects
      tend to commit more and more errors due to implicit motor adaptation. This happens because
      the motor control system tends to correct the perceived perturbation between the anticipated
      and the actual location of the hand in an automatic and unconscious way. The conflict between
      the implicit and explicit strategies has the surprising consequence of a persistent and
      accumulative deterioration of performance that can only be resolved when the participants
      abandon the explicit strategy. Subjects with cerebellar damage show deficits in implicit
      motor learning and for this reason they do not show this progressive deterioration of
      performance. Given that chronic cannabis abuse can lead to cerebellar damage, the
      investigators hypothesize that subjects from the experimental group 1 (cannabis use) will
      have a significant smaller directional error on the rotation condition than controls. A
      second hypothesis is that this effect will be cannabis-specific, due to the high CB1R
      concentration on the cerebellum, so the alcohol dependence group is expected to perform
      similarly to control group
