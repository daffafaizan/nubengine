        1. Primary Objective:

           The primary end points are overall survival and cycles of salvage chemotherapy completed
           of malnourished patients in unresectable mGCs

        2. Secondary Objectives:

      Side effects of salvage chemotherapy, quality of life, nutritional status, performance
      status, inflammatory status, safety and complications of HPN. The visit time schedules are at
      the time of enrollment before HPN is delivered, and at the beginning of every cycle of
      salvage chemotherapy
