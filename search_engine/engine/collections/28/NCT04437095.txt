      interventional or control groups. The interventional group will listen to an audio recording
      of psychological support based on positive suggestion for about 30 min each day via
      headphones. At the time of ICU discharge, patients will be administered validated
      questionnaires to screen for symptoms of anxiety/depression (HADS), PTSD (IES-r), cognitive
      dysfunction (MOCA-blind), as well as evaluation of health status (EQ-5D). Six months post ICU
      discharge, patients will again be contacted and repeat the assessment with above
      questionnaires. Scores on the questionnaires will be compared between the groups at the two
      times points. Patient demographic data will also be obtained and assessed to contextualize
      study findings.
