      additional fuel (ketones) for energy metabolism, at least for very prolonged exercise
      (>3-4h). Regardless, this diet is difficult to maintain so it has been suggested that
      ingesting ketone salts along with a normal carbohydrate (CHO) diet might be more practical.
      The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of ketone salt ingestion on shorter term
      (up to ~15 min) exercise performance. Endurance trained (≥2 year training experience; ≥7
      h/week) collegiate athletes (n=20) of similar body mass (♀; 55-60kg; ♂; 75-80kg) and age
      18-25y) consuming 5-6g CHO•kg-1•d-1) will be tested before and after 1 and 7d of ketone salt
      (Prüvit, Carrollton TX, US) supplementation (0.6-0.8g•kg-1•d-1). Participants will perform
      two exercise performance tests (a 10km cycle time trial and a 30s Wingate cycle test on
      separate days) before and after supplementation. Blood samples (glucose, lactic acid, and
      ketone concentration) will be taken at: baseline and following each performance test. It is
      hypothesized that ketone salt supplementation will increase blood ketone concentration but
      will not enhance these exercise performance tests.
