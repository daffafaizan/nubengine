      diamino- pyrimidine (DAPY) derivative with potent antiviral activity against HIV-1.
      Dapivirine is chemically described as 4-[[4-[(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amino]-2-
      pyrimidinyl]amino]benzonitrile.6 The dapivirine matrix VR is a flexible ring containing 25 mg
      of drug substance dispersed in a platinum-catalyzed-cured silicone matrix. Dapivirine is
      known to be well-suited for delivery via VR, as evidenced by favorable safety and
      pharmacokinetic data to date described below.
