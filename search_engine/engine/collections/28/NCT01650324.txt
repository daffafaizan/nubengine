    
      This study represents the first administration of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor
      DBPR108 to humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties following single oral doses in healthy subjects.

      DPP4 is a validated drug target for the treatment of human type 2 diabetes. Objectives of the
      study will be to characterize the safety and tolerability of single doses of DBPR108; to
      characterize the single dose PK of DBPR108 in plasma and urine; to characterize the single
      dose PD of DBPR108 on glucose, glucagon, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 activity, and total and
      active forms of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in plasma levels and insulin and C-peptide in
      serum levels.
