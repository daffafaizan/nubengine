      preceding study "Intrastromal Correction of Ametropia by Femtosecond Laser (study ISCAF),
      study arm 1, Presbyopia sub-group: treatment pattern 5-Rings" and the second study arm
      includes patients of the previous "Intrastromal Presbyopia Correction by Means of Femtosecond
      Laser (study # 0905)".

      The hypothesis of the study is that patients after a INTRACOR treatment are satisfied in the
      long term.

      By detailed patient information and a clarification conversation it is guaranteed that every
      interested and agreeing patient fulfils the inclusion criteria of this study. The
      quantitative measuring values of the patient perception are assessed by a questionnaire. For
      measuring the subjective / objective diagnostic data only certificated diagnostic devices are
      used. No invasive intervention in the eye will be made to change the visual acuity.

      Within the scope of the study between 98 and 135 patients should be examined. 49 to 63
      patient are intended for the first study arm and 49 to 72 for the second study arm.

      The follow-up examinations are carried out at 12 months and/or 24 months as well as for 36
      months after the INTRACOR treatment. The study end points are determined for all follow-up
      examinations. The aim criteria should be reached for the final examination, which is after 36
      months, at the latest.
