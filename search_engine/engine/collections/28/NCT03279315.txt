      Referring to the experience from Harrison and Dworkin, however, considering the negative
      iodine balance reported, during the first 3 weeks, the diet was provided with non-iodized
      salt, while the diet with iodized salt was only offered in the last week. The total daily
      iodine intake consisted of dietary iodine intake, water iodine intake and iodine from
      breathing, while iodine could be excreted out of human body by urine, faces, sweat and
      breathing. The 24-h iodine intake and 24-h iodine excretion were determined in each
      individual participant, and the iodine balance was calculated accordingly.
