      various techniques have been tried to minimize the propofol-induce pain with variable
      results.

      Objective: To compare the severity of pain on injection of MCT/LCT propofol with lidocaine 20
      mg, 40 mg, and without lidocaine.

      Design: Randomize controlled trial. Method: Two hundred and ten ASA class I - III patients
      undergoing elective surgery were blinded and equally allocated into 3 groups. Patients in
      group N, L1, and L2 received MCT/LCT propofol 10 ml mixed with 0.9% NaCl 2 ml, 1% lidocaine 2
      ml, and 2% lidocaine 2 ml respectively. Pain at time of propofol injection was assessed by
      blinded anesthesiologist on a four point scale ; 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate
      pain, and 3 = severe pain. Results: Patient's demographic data of each group were similar.
      There were significant differences in the incidence of propofol injection without pain among
      groups (p<0.001). The numbers of patients who had moderate and severe pain in groups L1 and
      L2 were significantly less than those in group N (p<0.001). The mean blood pressure and heart
      rate were not significant differences in among groups. Conclusion : The amount of 20 mg, and
      40 mg lidocaine to MCT/LCT propofol in our study is equally effective in decreasing pain and
      more effective than MCT/LCT propofol alone group significantly. They were no significant
      differences in hemodynamics change in among groups.
