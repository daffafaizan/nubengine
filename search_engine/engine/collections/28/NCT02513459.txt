      safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of risankizumab in participants with moderately to
      severely active Crohn's disease. This study was terminated early by AbbVie to enable
      participants who completed the study to rollover into Study NCT03105102 (AbbVie M16-000
      Sub-Study 3 [Phase 3 OLE study]) for further OLE treatment within the Phase 3 program, which
      allows for risankizumab dose escalation if needed.
