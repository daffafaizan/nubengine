      appears that three doses do not significantly increase the side effects of transplant
      conditioning, the investigators will give a second group of six patients five daily doses.

      AMD3100 is given in combination with a standard pre-transplant conditioning regimen (total
      body irradiation, etoposide and cyclophosphamide.) AMD3100 causes healthy bone marrow cells
      to be released from the bone marrow into the blood so that they can be collected in patients
      who will have peripheral (blood stream) blood stem cell transplants. AMD3100 also pushes out
      leukemia cells from the bone marrow. Research in animals and in test tubes shows that the
      bone marrow partially protects leukemia cells from chemotherapy and radiation. AMD3100 could
      make leukemia treatments better by pushing out the leukemia cells from the bone marrow and
      making them more sensitive to treatment. Clinical trials combining AMD3100 with normal doses
      of chemotherapy are being done for relapsed acute leukemia. Researchers hope AMD3100 can be
      given with conditioning regimen safely without causing more side effects. Up to 12
      participants will be enrolled and estimated accrual duration is 2 years.
