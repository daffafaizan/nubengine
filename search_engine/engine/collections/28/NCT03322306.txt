      can give rise to most tissue types in the human embryo and possess many of the properties of
      human embryonic stem cells (hESC). The big advantage of human iPS cell over hESC is that it
      circumvents most of the limitations of hESC and remains the pluripotency for regeneration of
      cells and tissues. The unique capacity of self-renewal of iPS can provide unlimited supply of
      pluripotent stem cells for study. The patient-specific iPS cell lines should fundamentally
      eliminate the concern of immune rejection and ethical issues. The disease-specific iPS will
      facilitate the study of the mechanism of nucleotide expansion. It is the ideal medium to
      study the dynamic changes of the expansion from stem cell stage to different differentiation
      stages. It also creates a platform for drug development. The establishment of iPS stem cells
      will also make it realistic for target gene replacement/correction therapy.

      Study subjects will be identified at the members from the Hong Kong Spinocerebellar ataxias
      (SCA) association and neurology clinic in Prince of Wales Hospital. Patients identify based
      on the diagnosis, genetic test results and inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      10ml blood sample for genetic screening will be collected. Skin biopsy will only be scheduled
      if pathogenic mutation was identified by the genetic screening test and generation of iPS is
      considered necessary to study the pathogenic mechanism of the disease.
