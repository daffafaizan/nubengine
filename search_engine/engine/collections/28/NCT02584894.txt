    
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is characterized by intrusive and persistent memory of
      past result from an event causing or able to cause death, be a threat of death, a severe
      injury or constitute a threat for physical integrity. It is a frequent disorder in general
      population (8%). In France, The most frequent traumatic events causing PTSD are serious
      accidents, rape, physical assaults, violence, etc. PTSD treatment involves antidepressant and
      cognitive and behavioural psychotherapy, which encourage exposure to elements that remind the
      trauma (memories, circumstances), with the objective of reducing the fear associated with the
      traumatic memories. Innovative therapeutic strategies aim to improve the psychotherapeutic
      effect with enhancement drugs or using neuromodulatory techniques, such as repeated
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy in PTSD treatment of concomitant voluntary
      reactivation of personal traumatic memories with neuromodulation of the right dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex using 10Hz rTMS, compared to 1Hz rTMS, during 2 weeks.
