      typical serving of the food elicits a significantly lower blood glucose responses compared to
      a serving of an appropriate control food. While many studies have examined the GI of beans,
      few studies have compared the glycemic impact of a typical serving of beans to a typical
      serving of other starchy foods. Therefore, there are insufficient data to allow for a claim
      that beans have a low glycemic response. In addition, in order to make a claim of a reduced
      glycemic response, regulatory agencies also require that the insulinemic response to a food
      is not disproportionately increased.
