      widening scale. A lot of patients who undergo endoscopic treatment for esophageal varices
      eventually require additional treatment for recurrent varices. Many physicians suggest
      repeating EVL every 1-2 weeks until esophageal varices are obliterated to prevent variceal
      rebleedingï¼Œ however, the evidences supporting the efficacy of EVL intervals of 1-2 weeks are
      insufficient.This randomized controlled study was conducted in order to compare the long-term
      results of EVL when performed at two different results from monthly and bi-weekly treatments.
