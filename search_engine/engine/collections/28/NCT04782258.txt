    
      Tolvaptan has been demonstrated to delay the decline of kidney function in adults with
      rapidly progressing ADPKD (CKD stages 1 to 3), a closely related indication to ARPKD, as
      measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and Total Kidney Volume (TKV).

      The trial will be the first trial of tolvaptan in a pediatric ARPKD population.

      Participants in this study will be assigned to tolvaptan for 18 months and closely monitored
      over the course of the study.
