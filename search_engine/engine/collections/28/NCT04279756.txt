      treat hip dysfunctions such as hip osteoarthritis. Physical therapists utilize mobilization
      with movement clinically to increase range of motion that has been limited by hip pathology.
      This study will compare mobilization with movement administered by a physical therapist,
      self-administered mobilization with movement, in which patients are instructed in the
      maneuver and then perform it at home, and dynamic stretching as instructed by a physical
      therapist. Efficacy will be judged through changes in hip internal rotation range of motion,
      a motion which is typically limited in patients with hip pathology.

      The objectives of the study are to quantify the effects of two different modalities of hip
      mobilization with movement and dynamic stretching in terms of hip internal rotation
      increases, and to inform current physical therapy practice by filling gaps in the literature
      surrounding the therapeutic effects of hip mobilization with movement. This study is intended
      to better equip physical therapists to select the most appropriate evidence-based
      interventions, thereby increasing the quality of patient care.
