      flutter (AFL) in the United States (Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics - 2003 Update, AHA).
      These arrhythmias may be occasional or sustained. AF/AFL is usually associated with age, and
      general physical condition, rather than with a specific cardiac event, as is often the case
      with ventricular arrhythmia. While not directly fatal, these arrhythmias cause discomfort and
      can lead to stroke or congestive heart failure.

      This Phase II/III trial is Cardiome's first study with RSD1235 for the treatment of atrial
      flutter. The study seeks to demonstrate RSD1235's abilities to convert AFL to sinus rhythm.
      The patient population will have atrial flutter of duration greater than 3 hours and less
      than or equal to 45 days.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in patients with AFL;
      stratification will be based on duration of AFL. Treatment will be considered successful if
      there is a treatment-induced conversion of atrial arrhythmia to sinus rhythm for a minimum of
      1-minute by Hour 1.5 (Time 0 = start of first infusion). All patients will be evaluated for
      safety.
