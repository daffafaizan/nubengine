      invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) using multi-parametric MRI. However, No validation study on
      VI-RADS has been reported yet. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on
      diffusion-weighted MRI are reportedly significantly lower in MIBC than those in
      non-MIBC(NMIBC).

      We aim to examine the accuracy of VI-RADS for predicting MIBC in final histopathology
      specimen. To assess whether incorporating ADC into VI-RADS improves the MIBC predictive
      accuracy of VI-RADS
