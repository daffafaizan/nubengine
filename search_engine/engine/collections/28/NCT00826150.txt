    
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open label, dose escalation, repeat dose study in 11 subjects with
      recurrent, platinum resistant advanced stage ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma
      designed to determine the tolerability, safety, quality of life, PK, and preliminary efficacy
      of DTA-H19 administered intraperitoneally(IP).

      Primary Objective: The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IP DTA-H19; and,

        -  To identify any dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).

      Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine quality of life of subjects with advanced ovarian cancer, primary
           peritoneal carcinoma treated with IP DTA-H19;

        -  To determine the the reduction in malignant ascites as measured by Ultrasound and change
           in frequency of parecenteses necessary.

        -  To determine the overall survival distribution.
