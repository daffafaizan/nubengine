      specialised on protecting from rumination, would be tested. They will randomly be assigned to
      the treatment group (taking the antidepressant which is in fact an active placebo) or the no
      treatment control group (not taking a placebo). Then sad mood is induced by mood-suggestive
      music and negative autobiographic recall. Then participants in the experimental group take
      the "medication". Afterwards both groups are asked to focus on emotion-focused,
      symptom-focused and self-focused thoughts to induce rumination (e.g. "Think about what your
      feelings might mean."). Sadness will be assessed before and after the negative recall task
      and also after the rumination induction. State Rumination will be assessed before the recall
      task and after the rumination induction.
