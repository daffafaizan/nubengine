        -  Determine response (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial) of patients with
           advanced renal cell cancer treated with gemcitabine and capecitabine.

        -  Determine the 6-month time to treatment failure rate and overall survival rate of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, tumor response with the intratumoral content of the enzymes
           involved in the activation and degradation of these drugs in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral
      capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.8-4.2
      months.
