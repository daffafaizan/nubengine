      leading cause of death. Prognostic scores, like the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory
      rate, arterial blood pressure and age) score and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) have been
      developed and validated to estimate the risk of adverse outcome and to register a patient
      with CAP for hospital admission. Serum biomarkers have been also investigated in patients
      with CAP like Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
      peptide (NT-proBNP) has been shown to be associated with adverse prognosis in several cardiac
      conditions and critically ill patients. NT-proBNP is also shown to be important predictor in
      the emergency department and in hospitalized patients with CAP. A growing number of
      echocardiographic markers have been evaluated as possible predictors of prognosis in patients
      with pulmonary and infectious diseases such as sepsis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease. Although effects of pneumonia on cardiac structures is
      theoretically possible due to increased systemic inflammatory activity, prothrombotic
      conditions, biomechanical stress on coronary arteries, variations in coronary arterial tone,
      and altered myocardial metabolic balance during infections, the role of transthoracic
      echocardiography has never been evaluated in patients with CAP. As echocardiography is a
      non-invasive, reliable, cost-effective, and reproducible diagnostic tool to evaluate cardiac
      function and structures, the investigators aimed to investigate left and right ventricular
      functions and aortic elastic properties in CAP patients. Furthermore, the investigators also
      aimed to observe relationships between echocardiographic findings and inflammatory and
      cardiac serum biomarkers in patients with CAP.
