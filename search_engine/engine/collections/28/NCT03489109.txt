      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals at increased risk for metabolic
      complications emphasizing the need for more aggressive management of obesity and related
      co-morbidities in the aging HIV-infected population. The most effective treatment for obesity
      and metabolic syndrome is lifestyle modification, usually with a combination of caloric
      restriction and increased exercise. Intermittent caloric restriction (ICR) or intermittent
      fasting simplifies caloric restriction by severely limiting calories only a few days per week
      and allowing ad lib diet on the other days. Weight loss benefits are similar to those seen
      with conventional diets, however, data suggests possible added health benefits from
      intermittent fasting.

      We propose to study the benefits of a 2-5 ICR strategy on weight, insulin resistance, and
      cardiovascular disease markers in obese HIV-infected adults with features of the metabolic
      syndrome. In a prospective pilot study, 50 HIVinfected adults will be randomized 1:1 to ICR
      or standard-of-care instruction of healthy diet and lifestyle for a 12-week intervention
      period. We hypothesize that ICR (2 days per week) will be an effective and acceptable diet
      strategy that will result in significant weight reduction, improvements in insulin
      sensitivity, and related metabolic parameters.
