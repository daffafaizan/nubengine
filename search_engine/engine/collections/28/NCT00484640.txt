      dosing based on clinical information including clinical reason for taking coumadin, your age,
      gender, your body surface area, and other medical conditions you may have and dosing with
      dosing estimated by a dosing calculator which adjusts for factors affecting coumadin dosing
      variability including genotypes for genes important in Coumadin metabolism and response. The
      hypothesis to be tested by this trial states that:when compared to patients managed with a
      best practices standard-of-care coumadin dosing regimen, patients randomized to coumadin
      dosing based on genetically programmed metabolic capacity and other known clinical and
      environmental factors affecting dose will: 1)show reduced risk of adverse events (using
      surrogate measures of such events); and 2)more rapidly achieve Coumadin dosing
