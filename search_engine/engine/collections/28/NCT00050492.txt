      retinal tissue damage and subsequent vision loss. Retinal vasculitis can occur as a primary
      ocular disease or secondarily, as a component of a systemic vascular disease. Unfortunately,
      little is known about primary retinal vasculitis. The initiating event in retinal vasculitis
      is most likely multifactorial. Nevertheless, the underlying pathologic mechanisms driving
      this process may be common. We hypothesize that there are biological markers of retinal
      vasculitis, such as, cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, T-cell surface markers and
      autoantibodies which can be useful in determining disease progression, understanding
      mechanisms of pathogenesis, identifying therapeutic strategies and monitoring treatments. The
      purpose or objective of this study is to investigate selected biological markers to collect
      clinical and biologic information to better understand the natural history of conditions
      indicative of primary retinal vasculitis.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate patients with primary retinal vasculitis disorders. We
      will compare this group of patients with two additional types of uveitis patients with
      retinal vasculitis; patients with Behcet's syndrome and HIV patients undergoing HAART therapy
      with immune recovery uveitis. Patient evaluations will consist of the following procedures: a
      full ocular examination, fluorescent angiogram study, blood collection and therapy. Patient
      blood samples will be studied to evaluate the presence of three types of biological markers
      (1) cytokines, chemokines or adhesion molecules, (2) autoantibodies and (3) infectious
      agents. The primary outcome of this study is the identification of biological markers in
      patients with retinal vasculitis.
