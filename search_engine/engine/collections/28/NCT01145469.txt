        -  To identify genetic characteristics associated with the efficacy and toxicity of
           fludarabine-based treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who
           participated on E2997.

        -  To validate these genetic characteristics with a cancer cell model system to confirm
           association and dissect the mechanism of effect.

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for genetic characteristics associated with the
      efficacy and toxicity to fludarabine-based treatment using Affymetrix 6.0 single nucleotide
      polymorphism arrays. The results are then compared with data of genes identified in a cancer
      cell model system, and with clinical data (response, toxicity, overall survival, and
      progression-free survival) associated with each patient sample.
