      pre-transplant conditioning for a second allogeneic stem cell transplant after initial graft
      rejection. Preliminary data suggest that the combination of Flu/TBI at the proposed doses is
      safer and more effective than prior second transplantation regimens published to date. As we
      perform more non-myeloablative transplantations we expect that this issue to arise more
      frequently. The preliminary data available indicate that the proposed regimen is the safest
      and most effective to instill donor hematopoiesis after the initial graft has been rejected.

      We also wish to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Tacrolimus and MMF as GVHD
      prophylaxis in patients receiving a second transplant. Tac/MMF is our current GVHD
      prophylaxis regimen. It has proven to be well tolerated and provide good protection against
      GVHD, even in heavily pretreated patients. We propose to use this standard first transplant
      GVHD prophylaxis to prevent GVHD after second transplantation. DLI may be given in the
      presence of disease progression or for mixed chimerism as clinically indicated.
