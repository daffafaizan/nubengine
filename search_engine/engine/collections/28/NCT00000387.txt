      (Self-Management Therapy) for adolescents with schizophrenia. The primary aim is to test its
      effectiveness in improving the adolescents' level of functioning in role performance,
      thinking/cognitive processing, behavior towards others, mood, and use of substances. The
      second aim is to assess the impact of the intervention on family functioning. The third aim
      is to describe the relationships among the process variables of the intervention.

      Nakagawa-Kogan's self-management nursing model, Kanfer's self-regulation theory, and
      Liberman's theory of stress and vulnerability provide the theoretical basis for the
      self-management intervention developed specifically for a population with deficits in
      cognitive processing. The intervention involves training in symptom awareness, stress
      management skills, problem-solving, and social skills. Parents and siblings are included to
      gain knowledge and skills to support the adolescents.

      The adolescent's level of functioning is assessed using the Child and Adolescent Functional
      Assessment Scale, the Birchwood Early Signs & Symptoms Scale for schizophrenia, and the DISA.
      Family Functioning is assessed by computing a Composite Family Functioning Index using
      weighted scores from the FACES II, Family Apgar, Family Empowerment, and Family Social
      Support scales. One parent is designated by the family to be the family respondent on the
      scales. The adolescents are referred to the study by mental health professionals. The
      intervention is administered in small multiple-family groups in 12 sessions over 7-1/2
      months. Data are collected at 4 points in time: at baseline, after 6 intensive sessions,
      after 6 monthly reinforcement sessions, and 6 months post-intervention. ANCOVA is used to
      test the study hypotheses. Multivariate relationships are examined among the process
      variables of the intervention.
