      development of pain with significant maladaptive plasticity occurring in several brain areas.
      Non-pharmacological treatments, such as neurofeedback, are designed to restore normal brain
      function alongside with relieving pain symptoms. With a neurofeedback approach, the patient
      is provided with a feedback on specific brain waves recorded using non-invasive recording
      techniques (electroencephalography - EEG) and visualized on a screen.
