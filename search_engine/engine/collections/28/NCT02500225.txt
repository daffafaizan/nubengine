      double-blinded, crossover study. Each patient will receive either 0.2 mg/kg etomidate (Group
      1) or 8% sevoflurane (Group 2) in 100% oxygen at 6 L/min fresh gas flow until loss of
      consciousness for their initial electroconvulsive therapy session. In subsequent sessions,
      patients will receive the alternative sevoflurane concentration and then alternated between
      doses until the sixth session. Muscle paralysis will achieve with 1 mg/kg succinylcholine.
      Motor (EMG) and electroencephalography seizure duration (EEG), heart rate (HR) and mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) values, and recovery times will recorde.
