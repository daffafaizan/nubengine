      present to the catheterization laboratory for PCI (elective or setting of ACS) and receive at
      least one bare metal stent.

      Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either rosiglitazone or placebo for 9
      months. Patients will be followed for 9 months post procedure. All patients will be required
      to have a repeat angiogram with optional IVUS analysis at 9 months.
