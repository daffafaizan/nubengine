      medication consists of L-citrulline, respectively placebo given orally; 5 g L-citrulline or
      placebo will be given three times daily. The duration of the study is 48 weeks and
      comprehends one screening and four study visits.

      Additionally, in order to investigate whether PPS is associated with an atrophy of spinal
      cord gray and potentially also white matter as well as motor cortex atrophy, it is planned to
      offer all trial participants an additional optional spinal cord/brain MRI investigation and a
      MRI at week 48 and a follow-up one year later together with a clinical and physiotherapy
      assessment during extension phase. We don't expect Citrulline to affect the spinal cord gray
      or white and gray matter.
