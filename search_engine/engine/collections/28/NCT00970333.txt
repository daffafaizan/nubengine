      neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases requires human validation studies. Expanding
      upon our previous work with B-amyloid ligands (123I-IMPY, 123I MNI-187) for AD and dopamine
      transporter ligands (123I B-CIT, Altropane) for PD, we desire to develop and characterize
      [18F]-FEPPA as a potential marker for microglial activation in association with neuronal
      damage that may be applicable to multiple neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases.
