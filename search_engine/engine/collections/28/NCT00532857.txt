    
      Primary objectives: To evaluate the pathologic complete response rate to preoperative
      administration of Paclitaxel, Gemcitabine, and Trastuzumab (Herceptin√í) (PGH) Secondary
      objectives: To assess breast conserving rate after preoperative chemotherapyTo evaluate
      clinical response rate, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) To assess the
      safety profiles of PGH

      Treatment will be delivered in the outpatient setting. Each three-week cycle consists of
      paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (day 1, 8) and gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2 (day1, 8) in addition to
      trastuzumab, which is given at a dose of 4 mg/kg IV on day 1 of the first treatment cycle
      over 90 min, and subsequently given weekly at a dose of 2 mg/kg over 30 min. Patients will
      receive 6 cycles of therapy unless there is any evidence of no response suitable for
      operation(SD or PD) or unacceptable toxicity or noncompliance by patient with protocol
      requirements. Patients who are unsuitable for op due to SD or PD, will undergo XRT. However,
      when patients are still suitable for op even with SD or PD, these patients will undergo
      op.Such decision will be made at physician's discretion at each institution. Also, even
      though there is neither clear evidence of disease progression nor severe toxicity, if patient
      declines the treatment, study treatment can be discontinued. Response will be documented by
      physical examination, sonography and/or chest CT prior to treatment and every three cycles.
      Postoperatively within 1-3 week, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks x 11 and tamoxifen or AI
      for 5 years will be given as indicated. Radiation therapy will be initiated postoperatively
      in 3-4 weeks according to the standard practice guidelines.
