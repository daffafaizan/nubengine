      versus placebo in a cohort of 100 men or women with IBS with constipation. 50 IBS-C or IBS-M
      patients will receive DS-01 (Daily Synbiotic, once daily) for 12 weeks, while 50 IBS-C or
      IBS-M patients will receive the placebo (once daily). Safety is a paramount concern in the
      study design and will be monitored carefully throughout the study. Study subjects will also
      receive extensive education on use of the synbiotic.
