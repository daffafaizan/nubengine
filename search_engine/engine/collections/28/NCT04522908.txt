      cabozantinib once-daily for 4 weeks and subsequent dose escalation to 60 mg cabozantinib
      once-daily to be maintained until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. Using the
      same study treatment discontinuation criteria as in the pivotal CELESTIAL trial will allow
      for comparison of treatment discontinuation rates due to treatment related adverse events
      (TRAEs) defined as unresolved intolerable Grade 2 TRAEs or any unresolved Grade 3 TRAEs (see
      Section 6).

      Patients eligible for this trial are cirrhotic HCC patients treated with sorafenib or
      lenvatinib in first line.

      Secondary objectives comprise the assessment of overall survival (OS), progression free
      survival (PFS) at 10 weeks, objective response rate (ORR), time on treatment, treatment
      exposure (dose intensity/dose reductions), toxicity, and quality of life (QLQ-C30).

      In addition, tissue samples (optional) will be analyzed for molecular parameters and immune
      cell composition to identify biomarkers potentially associated with clinical efficacy (OS,
      PFS and ORR).

      This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial. 40 patients suffering from
      advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with compensated liver cirrhosis in second line
      treatment, after first line treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib, will be enrolled in this
      trial.

      Patients will be recruited from up to 10 sites and patients withdrawn from the trial will not
      be replaced.
