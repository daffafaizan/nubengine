      by passing a small tube into the patients nose, down the food pipe and into the stomach. The
      participants will be instructed to swallow a determined volume of Gatorade,depending on the
      protocol being followed. All participants will be starting in the supine position followed by
      semi-recumbent,sitting, then standing up. When the esophageal manometry is finished, the tube
      is removed and participation in this study is complete.
