      The objectives for this randomized trial are:

        1. To determine the efficacy of daily low-dose atropine (0.01%) for slowing myopia
           progression over a two-year treatment period in children aged 5 to less than 13 years
           with myopia -1.00 to -6.00D at the time of enrollment (Primary Outcome On-Treatment).

        2. To determine the efficacy of atropine treatment on myopia progression 6 months following
           cessation of low-dose atropine treatment (Secondary Outcome Off-Treatment).

      Synopsis of Study Design The current study is designed as an efficacy study, making effort to
      maximize adherence to treatment group assignments. After a run-in phase during which all
      participants are treated with daily artificial tear eyedrops for 2-4 weeks (and glasses are
      updated if required) to assess their ability to adhere to daily eye drops, participants are
      randomly assigned to daily atropine or placebo for 24 months, followed by 6 months off
      treatment.
