    
      This is a two part study. The dose escalation part will enroll subjects with advanced solid
      tumors for which pembrolizumab is an FDA-approved therapy, to determine the MTD and identify
      the recommended phase 2 dose of paclitaxel administered as Oraxol in combination with
      pembrolizumab. Upon determination of the phase 2 dose, the dose expansion part will enroll
      subjects with advanced/metastatic urothelial, gastric/gastro-esophageal, or NSCLC into 3
      independent cohorts/arms to further evaluate the activity and safety of the study treatment.
