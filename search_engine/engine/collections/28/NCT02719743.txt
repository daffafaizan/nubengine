    
      Safety and immunogenicity of different formulations administered as a 2-dose schedule in
      children 6-35 months of age will be evaluated. In addition, the quality of the 2-dose priming
      will be assessed through the anamnestic response elicited by an antigen challenge
      (unadjuvanted H5N1) administered 12 months later. The persistence of the immune response
      approximately 12 months (Day 385) after dose 2 will also be evaluated.

      Subjects from each group will be enrolled into the CMI sub-cohort comprising of approximately
      100 subjects. Within the participating country(ies), these subjects will be enrolled in only
      selected/qualified sites.
