      Primary Objectives: To assess safety and tolerability of two different fexinidazole dosing
      regimen, for 10 days repeated administration under fed conditions in healthy male sub-Saharan
      volunteers.

      Secondary objectives: To validate the exposure to fexinidazole, M1 and M2 after different
      dosing regimens in fed conditions for 10 days in order to evaluate the more appropriate
      administration regimen for the pivotal phase II/III study.

      Methodology/Study Design:

      Two dose regimens consisting of repeated oral ascending dose (OAD) dosing in fed condition
      with two different ascending loading doses for 4 days followed by the same dose for 6 days
      will be evaluated. The study will be conducted in double-blind conditions for both the
      clinical and bioanalytical parts.

      For each dosing regimen, subjects will reside at the clinical unit from the evening of Day -2
      to the afternoon of Day 17 including an 8 days safety follow up (168 h post last dose).
