      predisposition to develop insulin resistance and its associated metabolic complications such
      as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis. Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis or
      steatohepatitis caused by excessive accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, in fact, is
      a common feature of these disorders. Often a cause for significant morbidity and even
      mortality in lipodystrophic patients, hepatic steatosis poses a significant therapeutic
      challenge. Recent insight into the role of primary bile acids, cholic acid and
      chenodeoxycholic acid, which are endogenous ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), in
      regulating hepatic triglyceride homeostasis offers new treatment options for hepatic
      steatosis. Cholic acid was shown to inhibit hepatic triglyceride accumulation by more than
      50% in a mouse model of hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. Cholic acid has been
      previously used to treat inborn errors of bile acid synthesis in children without any side
      effects. In other studies in adults, cholic acid has been reported to be well tolerated.
      Therefore, we propose to investigate a potentially safe therapeutic option for its efficacy
      in reducing hepatic steatosis in patients with lipodystrophies.
