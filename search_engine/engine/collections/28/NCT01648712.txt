      bypass (CPB). This is associated with a major risk of thrombosis and bleeding in the
      postoperative period.

      Coating of the surface has been shown to diminish these effects. Since the coagulation system
      and platelets are involved in the blood activation process, a coating might be a valuable
      approach to inhibit the different reactions. Improving the biocompatibility of the system by
      reduction of contact activation of blood elements is of significant importance, especially
      for neonates and infants who are more susceptible to the deleterious effects of
      extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Biocompatible surfaces extracorporeal circulation
      technologies mimic critical characteristics of the vascular endothelium to provide
      thromboresistance and enhanced blood compatibility. These biocompatible surfaces mitigate the
      foreign body response that occurs when blood comes in contact with non- endothelial surfaces.

      Recently, a new physiologic non heparin coating with different functional aspects was
      developed as an alternative to heparin based biological coatings. This bio-passive
      Hydrophilic Polymer Coating Without Heparin (BalanceTM Bio-Passive surface) and pediatric
      oxygenation system (Affinity PixieTM Oxygenation System), is designed to mimic the natural
      interfaces of blood.
