      neurophysiology and pathology studies suggested cerebellum as possible target of brain
      stimulation for dual-task walking for theta Burst repetitive Transcranial magnetic
      stimulation

      Objective of the study:

      To test the efficacy of theta burst cerebellar stimulation on gait in Parkinson's disease
      using a cross-over design and wearing sensors technology

      Design:

      Parkinson's disease patients able to walk and without dementia/behavioral disturbances will
      be recruited for a cross-over sham-controlled study. Each patient will undergo a sham
      stimulation or a single session of cerebellar theta burst stimulation with a wash out period
      of at least 14 days.

      Repetitive cerebellar theta burst stimulation will be performed by Duo-Mag XT100, using a 3
      pulses at 50-Hz repeated at a rate of 5-Hz; 20 trains of 10 bursts given with 8-s intervals
      for a total of 600 pulses. Intensity of rTMS was set at the 80% of Amplitude of Motor
      Threshold (RMT) obtained in the left motor cortex for each subject.

      A sample size of 20 subjects with complete stimulation (2 stimulations per subject, for a
      total number of stimulation)

      Each patient will be evaluated before and after stimulation by a battery of gait and movement
      tests using wearing sensors technology.

      Sensors assessment:

      The following gait parameters will be evaluated in normal and cognitive/motor dual-tasks:

      i) step length ii) step variability iii) step phases iv) turning speed
