      surgical stabilization and which will heal uneventfully without surgery. Many authors site
      patient pain and inability to mobilize as indications for surgery, although there is
      conflicting evidence supporting this claim. The presence of chronic pain in the trauma
      population is a growing area of interest, and there is a push towards controlling pain more
      effectively in the acute setting. It remains to be proven that surgical intervention is more
      effective at decreasing acute and longer term pain.

      There is evidence in the literature to support both operative and non-operative treatment of
      patients with LC1 or LC2 pelvic fractures. There is conflicting evidence that surgical
      stabilization decreases acute pain and narcotic requirements, although patients are often
      counseled to that effect. The investigators propose to prospectively randomize patients with
      lateral compression type pelvic fractures to non-operative versus operative treatment and
      track which group has less pain, less need for narcotic pain medications, and who mobilizes
      with physical therapy faster.
