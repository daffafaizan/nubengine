      infants and children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Half of the participants will receive
      CIMT (constraint-induced movement therapy) and others will not.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either CIMT group or control group. Children of the
      CIMT group will wear forearm splint 24 hours for 3 weeks to inhibit use of the unaffected
      arm.
