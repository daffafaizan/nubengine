      practice. Fatigue severity was assesses weekly via phone calls to the cancer patients during
      weeks 1-4 of the intervention. For patients who did not respond to the intervention during
      the first 4 weeks, those dyads were referred to as non-responder and re-randomized. A
      non-responder was determined if the level of reported fatigue remained the same or increased
      from the first week of the intervention.

      The re-randomization placed the non-responders in either a group that received a higher dose
      (more time) with the first intervention or to the alternate practice (meditative practice to
      those randomized to reflexology and vice versa) for weeks 5-8. Those who did respond during
      weeks 1-4 continued the same therapy they began with.
