      of older suicide victims have been to their primary care physician within a month of their
      death, many with a depressive illness that was not detected. However, most research
      concerning treatments for suicide ideation and behavior has focused on adolescents and young
      adults. Very few treatments have been developed to reduce suicide ideation and behavior in
      men aged 60 and above. This study will assess the effectiveness of specialized cognitive
      therapy versus typical treatment in treating older men with suicide ideation.

      Participants in this two-year, single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      cognitive therapy combined with enriched care or enriched care alone. Participants will be
      identified in primary care settings as having experienced suicide ideation in the past month.
      Cognitive therapy will be provided by Ph.D.-level therapists and will be geared specifically
      toward older men with suicidal tendencies. The enriched care condition will consist of the
      usual care that individuals receive for suicide prevention, plus assessment and referral
      services provided by independent evaluators and study case managers. All participants will be
      assessed pre-treatment to attain baseline measures of suicide ideation, hopelessness, and
      depression. Study visits will occur at baseline and Months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 to assess
      suicide ideation. Self-report and clinician-administered measures will be used to assess
      participants' progress.
