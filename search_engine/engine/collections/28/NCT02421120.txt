      addition to standard intravenous antibiotic therapy selected by the site. Just prior and then
      after the final dose, a total of six blood samples will be collected to measure ceftolozane
      and tazobactam concentrations. Data will be fit to a population pharmacokinetic model. The
      final model will be utilized in a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability of
      several different dosing regimens retaining concentrations above the minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) for at least 39% of the dosing interval. These data will be utilized to
      determine an optimized dosing regimen for adults with CF.
