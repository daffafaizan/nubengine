      participant's data and measure their outcomes), international, multicenter (study conducted
      at multiple sites), cohort (group of individuals with similar characteristics) study. The
      study consists of prestudy phase, observational phase (2 years), and follow-up phase (1
      year). Approximately 50 participants who already receiving ERA therapy for anemia will be
      observed in this study. In the observational phase, participants' erythropoietin antibody
      status (positive or negative), clinical progress, treatment for anemia or prevention of
      anemia, and outcome will be monitored. During this study, enrolled participants will continue
      to receive standard-of-care treatment for their disease from their individual investigators
      as before enrollment to this study. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse
      events which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be
      3 years.
