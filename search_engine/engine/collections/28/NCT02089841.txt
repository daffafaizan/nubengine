      Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in all malaria endemic
      countries including Tanzania, that adopted the policy in 2007. ACTs have proven to be highly
      efficacious in different parts of the world with different malaria endemicity. Artemisinins
      clear asexual parasites rapidly and they are also potent against P. falciparum gametocytes,
      hence reducing disease transmission and spread of drug resistance. Nonetheless, a report in
      Kenya shows an increase in proportion of patients with parasitaemia on day 1. Most recently,
      resistance against artemisinins has been confirmed in four countries of South-East Asia, and
      it may spread to Africa.

      In order to safeguard ACTs life span, WHO recommends all suspected malaria cases to be
      confirmed with parasitological diagnosis, followed by prompt treatment with effective
      antimalarials. It also emphasizes on the need to conduct efficacy studies for the first and
      second line antimalarial treatments after every two years so as to be able to detect
      resistance early on its course. Therefore, based on this notion, this study aimed to assess
      the therapeutic efficacy of Artemether/Lumefantrine among children with uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria in Bagamoyo district, five years after its wide scale use in Tanzania.
