      reconstruction in any orientation compared with 2D SE. It is not easy to miss small lesions,
      and shows normal anatomy and lesions more objectively and more accurately.

      Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) can reflect white matter fiber so that can be used to determine
      whether the various diseases affect nerve cell connections.

      Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is non-drug perfusion imaging and completely noninvasive
      technology which can reflect brain perfusion better.

      Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) is used to located the abnormal brain regions whose
      activity is consistent with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) by the abnormal resting
      spontaneous brain activity in patients with depression and the abnormal functional
      connectivity network.
