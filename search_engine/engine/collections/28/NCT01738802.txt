      of oxidative stress and inflammation as well as on blood sugar control in adults over the age
      of 50 who have had Type 2 diabetes for at least 3 months. The purpose of this study is to see
      if these antioxidants reduce the oxidative and inflammatory state seen in patients with Type
      2 diabetes as well as whether or not they make it easier to control blood sugar, affect the
      number and dosage of diabetic medications, and/or reduce the risk factors involved in
      long-term diabetes related complications such as in lipid profile and carotid intima-media
      thickness (CIMT).
