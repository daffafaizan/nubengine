      pathologies such as high intracranial pressure. However, the exam can be challenging in
      uncooperative children. This study looked at whether playing a video during eye examination,
      improves the success, duration and ease of pediatric fundoscopy. The authors plan to recruit
      from 4 different clinical care settings for a total of 101 subjects. Success rate is defined
      as visualizing the optic disc within 60 seconds from commencement of fundoscopy. The ease of
      examination is determined by using a 10 point likert scale.
