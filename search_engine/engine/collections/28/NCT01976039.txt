      Subjects were assessed at baseline and 15 days after interventions for saccharin test, mucus
      contact angle, cellularity in nasal lavage and airways symptoms with the use of SNOT-20
      questionnaire. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures with BonferroniÂ´s
      correction. A passive monitoring-system of nitrogen dioxide was used to assess the individual
      air pollution exposure along the study period. The association between nitrogen dioxide and
      the airways outcomes was analyzed by Spearman correlation test.
