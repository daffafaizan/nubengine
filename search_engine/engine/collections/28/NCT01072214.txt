      safety and tolerability, and the pharmacokinetic profile of repeat doses of a higher strength
      ophthalmic formulation of pazopanib, 10 mg/mL. The higher strength formulation provides an
      opportunity to increase the total daily dose of pazopanib administered. In this 3-cohort
      study, healthy adult volunteers will participate in one 14-day repeat-dose session (plus a
      single dose on day 15), randomized to receive either pazopanib eye drops or placebo. Subjects
      in cohort 1 will receive 1 drop four times daily for a calculated total daily dose of 1.6 mg.
      The dosage regimen for two subsequent cohorts will be determined based on the emerging safety
      profile. The Japanese population chosen for the third cohort will provide a safety and
      tolerability profile as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of pazopanib prior to further
      development of this formulation in Japanese patients with AMD.
