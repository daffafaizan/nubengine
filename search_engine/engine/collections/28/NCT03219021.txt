    
      Measurements of arch widths will be performed in the maxillary and mandibular arches after
      performing a study cast. Alginate impression of the upper and lower arch of all participating
      children will be performed and poured immediately to prevent dimensional changes.

      The inter-deciduous canine, inter-permanent molar, and the distances between the first and
      second deciduous molars will be measured using a digital caliper directly on dental casts by
      a single examiner.

      Distance measurements will be obtained between cusp tips of canines, cusp tips of first
      deciduous molars, mesiobuccal cusp tips of second deciduous molars, and mesiobuccal cusp tips
      of first permanent molars. Estimated cusp tips will be used in cases of wear facets.

      Rationale:

      Children with cleft lip and/or palate suffer from problems in growth of the jaws,
      particularly the maxilla (upper jaw), as a result of surgical repairs of the cleft lip and
      palate. It is important to know the arch dimensions of them to enable the identification of
      specific surgical alterations related to maxillofacial growth concerning the common treatment
      protocol for patients with cleft lip and palate.

      Benefits to the practitioner:

      -Increase the awareness of pediatric dentists about changes of arch dimensions of surgically
      repaired cleft lip and palate patients in Egypt.

      Benefits to the patient:

        -  Inform parents about any disturbances that might be associated with Cleft lip and
           Palate.

        -  Guide them to the orthodontic care if needed.

      Benefits to the community:

        -  Provide the Egyptian community with data concerning patients with cleft lip and palate.

        -  Increase awareness of problems related to Cleft Lip and Palate.
