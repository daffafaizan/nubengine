    
      Patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer and an ECOG of 0-1 who received a
      first-line therapy with Cis-/Carboplatin for at least 2 cycles that had at least Complete
      Response (CR) / Partial Response (PR) / Stable Disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 will be randomized either to Arm A Pembrolizumab or
      to Arm B Placebo for a maximum of 2 years or until progressive disease or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      The aim is to investigate the efficacy of Pembrolizumab vs. placebo in terms of
      progression-free survival in patients with metastatic squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.
      Furthermore to evaluate tumor response, survival, tolerability and safety as well as quality
      of life of patients receiving Pembrolizumab.
