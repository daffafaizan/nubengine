      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of TPEx combination in patients with head and neck cancer in
           term of objective response rate (RECIST, see statistical consideration) Secondary

        -  To assess toxicities of TPEx combination

        -  Determine the efficacy of TPEx combination in patients with head and neck cancer: Best
           Overall Response , progression-free survival and survival.

        -  Translational research objective:To better understand the mechanisms of chemoresistance
           and to identify biomarkers by the analysis of the tumor biopsies (RNA, gene expression
           profile) and protein profile (plasma samples). Exploratory analyses.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label phase II, multicenter study. Patients receive four cycles of
      chemotherapy comprising cetuximab IV plus docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 2
      hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the fourth cycle of chemotherapy, patients receive
      a maintenance therapy with cetuximab every 2 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicities according to the patient or the investigator. Tumor
      check-up will be performed every 6 weeks. This study will allow translational research with
      blood sample and biopsies at baseline before any treatment, during the treatment with TPEx
      combination (week 6).,After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2
      months.
