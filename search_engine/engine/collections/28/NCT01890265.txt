      of participants (N=60) who will be allowed to receive treatment with approved IPF therapy
      with pirfenidone or with nintedanib as concomitant therapy.

      These additional participants will be stratified by background therapy, randomized to
      pamrevlumab or placebo, and followed up for 24 weeks. The main objective of the study remains
      safety. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples to assess drug concentrations will also be collected.

      This sub-study portion only applies to a select United States centers.

      Enrollment for the main study was completed on 29 June 2016. Enrollment for the sub-study was
      completed on 16 December 2016.
