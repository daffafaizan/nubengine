      due to a lack of affordable senior housing. Older adults who live alone have a less healthy
      eating pattern, eat a smaller variety of foods and consume fewer fruits and vegetables than
      those living with others. Additionally, eating alone, social isolation and loneliness often
      accompany living alone and are independent risk factors for lower caloric intake, less
      variety in the diet and malnutrition. Community-based interventions are needed to improve the
      nutritional status of older adults living alone.

      VideoDining uses video chat during mealtimes to virtually eat with another person and could
      provide social interactions and modeling to improve dietary intake in older adults eating
      alone. Extensive observational and experimental research shows that people eat more when
      dining with others than dining alone, called the social facilitation of eating. Additionally,
      a dining partner's modeling of eating can provide a guide for what and how much to eat. The
      investigators have conducted a Stage IA proof-of-concept study of VideoDining in older adults
      and will expand the development of this behavioral intervention with this study.

      The goals are to determine the feasibility and acceptability of VideoDining and to evaluate
      changes in nutritional intake and loneliness in response to multiple VideoDining sessions in
      community-dwelling older adults eating alone at home. In this single-arm intervention study,
      thirty older adult Meals on Wheels participants will be scheduled to VideoDine with a dining
      partner six times. Using a mixed-methods approach, the investigators will collect data on
      older adults' ability to VideoDine, acceptance of VideoDining, dietary intake, and
      loneliness. Data will be collected before starting VideoDining, after each VideoDining
      session, and at the end of the study period. Development, adaptation and refinement of the
      VideoDining intervention are additional key outcomes of this study.
