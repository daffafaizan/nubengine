        -  Topotecan: 4mg/m2 weekly, 3 weeks on and one week off.

        -  Sorafenib: Assigned cohort dose for phase I (up to 12 patients) Maximum tolerated dose
           for phase II (21 total patients)

      Cycles will consist of 4 weeks (28 days) with disease evaluations every 8 weeks.

      Non-PD and acceptable toxicity: Patients will continue protocol therapy PD or unacceptable
      toxicity: Patients will discontinue protocol therapy

      ECOG performance status 0-1

      Life expectancy: Three (3) months

      Hematopoietic:

        -  White blood cell count (WBC) > 3 K/mm3

        -  Platelets > 100 K/mm3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.5 K/mm3

        -  INR < 1.5 or a PTT within normal limits. NOTE: Patients receiving anti-coagulation
           treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin may be allowed to participate.

        -  No evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin < 1.5 x ULN

        -  Creatinine < 1.5 x ULN

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris or angina equivalent within 6
           months prior to registration for protocol therapy (the patient may not be on
           anti-anginal or anti-arrhythmic medications), or have uncontrolled hypertension or
           congestive heart failure > class II NYHA

      Pulmonary:

        -  No thrombolic or embolic events such as a cerebrovascular accident, including transient
           ischemic attacks within the past 6 months.

        -  No pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event > CTCAE Grade 2 within 28 days prior to
           registration for protocol therapy.

        -  No non-pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event > CTCAE Grade 3 within 28 days prior to
           registration for protocol therapy.
