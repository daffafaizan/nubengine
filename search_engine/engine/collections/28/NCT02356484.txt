      Hospital of Lausanne Switzerland (CHUV) between February and December 2015 (NCT02356484). The
      study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (No. 367/15), and all patients provided
      written consent prior to surgery. Inclusion criteria were age >18 years, and elective major
      abdominal surgery-defined as an operative procedure with anticipated duration ≥2 hours.17
      Perioperative care closely adhered to recently published enhanced recovery guidelines
      (http://erassociety.org.loopiadns.com/guidelines/list-of-guidelines). Standardised fluid
      administration was followed by advanced haemodynamic monitoring to avoid intraoperative fluid
      overload. According to the clinical care pathway, intravenous fluid was typically
      discontinued the morning after surgery.

      Biological markers Serum levels of albumin, CRP, PCT and lactate (LCT) were perioperatively
      measured in a fasting state, Following standardised institutional guidelines. Blood samples
      were drawn the day before surgery, the day of surgery (4-6 hours after the end of the
      operation) and on the first, second and third postoperative day. As Baseline values tend to
      show large variations especially for albumin,4 10 we considered that a dynamic value
      (difference between two time-points) might be more informative than a snapshot value. Several
      values based on preoperative and postoperative concentrations were thus calculated for each
      marker (ie, Δ Max: maximal difference between the preoperative and postoperative values; Δ
      POD 0: difference of concentration on POD -1 and POD 0; Δ POD 1: difference of concentration
      on POD-1 and POD 1).
