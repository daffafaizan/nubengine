      sodium. An overwhelming majority of Americans consume more dietary sodium than what is
      recommended by the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The
      investigators recently published data demonstrating that compared to white individuals, 1)
      black individuals have augmented increases in serum sodium concentration to a hypertonic
      saline infusion; and 2) exhibit higher blood pressure for a given serum sodium. In this
      proposal, the investigators will translate these findings by comprehensively assessing
      neurovascular responses to acute (single meal) high dietary sodium. The central hypothesis is
      that high dietary sodium influences sympathetic nerve activity similarly in black and white
      individuals; however, diminished vasodilator capacity and augmented sympathetic transduction
      (vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve bursts) contribute to exaggerated blood
      pressure dysregulation in black individuals. The investigators will also determine the role
      of lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep, physical activity, and nutrition) on potential baseline
      racial differences in cardiovascular function.
