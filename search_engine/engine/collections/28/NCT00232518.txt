      risk of asthma and allergic disease. This association is potentially important not only to
      understanding the aetiology of asthma and allergic disease, but also because it suggests that
      hookworms or their products might be therapeutically effective in these conditions. To test
      the hypothesis that hookworms protect against asthma ultimately requires a clinical trial.

      We have carried out a dose-ranging study to establish the dose of hookworm larvae necessary
      to generate infection at the intensity shown to be protective in epidemiological studies,
      with acceptable side effects, and now propose to test the effect of 12 weeks of hookworm
      infection at this level of intensity in two randomised placebo controlled clinical trials.
      The first will be in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, to determine whether
      hookworm infection improves rhinitis symptoms and also, because these patients will have
      measurable airway responsiveness, to determine whether airway responsiveness changes during
      the lung migration phase of the hookworm life cycle. If this study confirms that hookworm
      infection does not increase airway responsiveness, we will proceed to a similar trial in
      patients with asthma.

      In both studies we will also measure a range of relevant immunological parameters to explore
      the relation between these parameters and expression of the allergic and asthmatic
      phenotypes.
