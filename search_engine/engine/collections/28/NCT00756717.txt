    
      OBJECTIVES

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the gamma-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 in the
      pre-surgical setting in patients with early stage, estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast
      cancer, in combination with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor (AI).

      To establish the feasibility and success of multi-laboratory collaborations in evaluating
      clinical specimens and biomarker testing.

      To provide preliminary data on the impact of MK-0752 on a panel of biomarkers involved in the
      notch signaling pathway.
