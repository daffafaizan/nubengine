      promising role for both calcitriol and NSAIDs in the treatment of prostate cancer. Moreover,
      calcitriol and NSAIDs both exert their antiproliferative effect by decreasing prostaglandin
      levels, but they do so by different mechanisms. Thus, there is reason to believe that their
      combined effects on prostaglandins may be synergistic. Preliminary in vitro assays in which
      calcitriol is given in combination with one of two different NSAIDs (Naprosyn or sulindac) to
      LNCaP cell lines have indicated such synergy. This observation provides the rational for
      using them in combination for the treatment of prostate cancer. In addition, it is hoped that
      any synergy noted would allow for the use of lower doses of NSAIDs.
