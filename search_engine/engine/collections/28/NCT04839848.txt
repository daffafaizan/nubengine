      have been prospectively collected in SHR, which covers > 95% of all groin hernia repairs in
      Sweden. The large database enables assessment of the relative risks for CPIP depending on in
      particular mesh and mesh fixation, adjusted for other plausible risk factors.

      Each participant was entered at the date of surgery, when demographic and intraoperative data
      were registered. One year postop, each patient was sent a questionnaire focusing on present
      pain.
