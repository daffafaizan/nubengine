      months of treatment with LMIS 50 mg under Protocol FP01C-13-001 (with last dose under
      Protocol FP01C-13-001 approximately 6 months prior to Day 0 or Protocol FP01C-13-001-EX) and
      providing a written informed consent, subjects will be screened against baseline
      inclusion/exclusion criteria necessary for study eligibility. Eligible subjects will receive
      LMIS 50 mg from the prefilled syringes (without dilution or other mixing) in up to two single
      subcutaneous injections given 6 months apart.
