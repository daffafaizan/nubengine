      autonomic nervous system. One of these is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS).
      In pediatric populations, symptoms of autonomic dysfunction include an increase in heart rate
      when standing up (tachycardia), dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headaches, abdominal
      discomfort, and sleep disturbances. POTS is specifically characterized by orthostatic
      intolerance and a forty beats per minute (bpm) increase in heart rate upon standing. The
      etiology of POTS is poorly understood, and there is limited literature on the management of
      POTS in pediatric populations. In the U.S., POTS is estimated to affect 1-3 million people.

      The ability of the CRI algorithm to accurately distinguish individuals with varying
      tolerances to reduced central blood volume can be attributed to a unique function of the
      algorithm, which analyzes and compares the entirety of each waveform in a window of time to
      trend subtle features that correspond with varying degrees of central volume loss. CRI can
      also detect vascular changes associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. CRI
      will be evaluated in subjects at supine and standing positions along with traditional
      orthostatic measures.

      Following CRI measurements, subjects and their parents will be asked to complete a series of
      surveys to assess their psychosocial symptoms and functional impairment. The CRI measurement
      and survey completion will occur over the course of one clinic visit.
