      by immune mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, then lead to liver cirrhosis and
      eventually failure.Currently, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only drug approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Novel treatment is urgently needed for patients who have
      an incomplete response to UDCA. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent a promising tool for
      cell-based therapies of autoimmune diseases. To explore the therapeutic effect of MSCs for
      PBC, the investigators plan to conduct an open-label, randomized clinical trial. Patients
      with PBC will be enrolled and randomly divided into two groups which will receive MSCs and
      UDCA respectively. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSCs for PBC by
      comparison of symptom improvement, survival rate and side effects in the two groups.
