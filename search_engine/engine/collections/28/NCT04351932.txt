      populations obtained from two clinically relevant sources: injections containing BM-MSC or
      AD-MSC or a combination of both BM-MSC,and AD-MSC in a randomized non blind clinical trial.

      To assess the efficacy and safety of 3 kind of MSC injections in relation to pain, function
      and quality of life in patients with knee OA.

      A total of 54 patients with the diagnosis of knee OA grade II and III will be recruited to
      receive a single intra-articular injection of MSC: Group 1 (n 18 patients) will receive
      BM-MSC, Group 3 (n 18 patients) will receive AD-MSC. Group 3 (18 patients) will receive a
      combination of BM-MSC and AD-MSC.

      A randomized non blind clinical trial with active control. For this purpose, the random
      number generator is 54, found on the RANDOM.ORG Â® website (available at
