      12,000 to 15,000 daltons for unfractionated heparin) administered subcutaneously and
      intravenously. It is a marketed drug FDA-approved in various clinical situations for: the
      prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis; and in the treatment of acute myocardial
      infarction. Minocycline is an orally administered antibiotic of the tetracycline class. It is
      a marketed drug FDA-approved for the treatment of various bacterial and rickettsial
      infections. Both medications have been found to be neuroprotective in experimental stroke
      models. Minocycline has shown promise in a human acute stroke study.

      This study is designed to investigate two logistically simple treatment regimens, singly or
      in combination, employing these medications for acute ischemic stroke:

        1. pulsed intravenous (iv) administration of enoxaparin initiated within 6 hours and
           completed by 24 hours after stroke onset; and

        2. oral minocycline treatment once daily for five days.

      The goal of treatment is neuroprotection: the limitation of the loss of brain tissue that
      follows ischemic stroke.
