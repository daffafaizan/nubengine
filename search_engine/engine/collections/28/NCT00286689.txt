      ill children from our clinical practice. We will obtain medical records for each patient 12
      months prior to starting the study. Those patients without pre-study medical records will be
      studied for 12 months prior to starting GH. If we can obtain 6 months of prior medical
      records, then the patients will be studied for 6 months before starting GH. Anything less
      than 6 months will be studied for the full 12 months prior to starting GH. Patients will
      receive treatment with GH (0.3 mg/kg/wk) for 12 months and their growth will be compared to
      the year before treatment. All subjects will be followed every three months for the entire
      study. We will measure height and weight using a standardized stadiometer and scale,
      respectively, every three months during the study. From these measurements we will calculate
      height and weight velocity and height and weight Z score. Lean body mass (LBM) will be
      measured by DEXA every six months. Utilizing the stable isotope 1-[13C] leucine, we will
      measure whole body protein turnover (WBPT). Measurements of WBPT will be correlated with LBM
      and changes in height and weight velocity. This data will be compared to that from age
      matched normal children (archival data maintained by the PI). We will measure IGF-1 and the
      cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL 10 at baseline and very six months. We will evaluate GH effects
      on these levels.
