      worldwide. In the absence of an approved vaccine or medical treatment, there is an emerging
      need for treatment options, especially in critically ill patients. Multiple pharmacological
      and non-pharmacological therapies are being investigated. In 2019, the Seraph® 100 Microbind®
      Affinity Blood Filter (ExThera Medical Corporation, CA, USA) was approved for the removal of
      pathogens in Europe. On April 17th the FDA granted Authorization for Emergency Use in
      patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU with confirmed or imminent respiratory failure.
