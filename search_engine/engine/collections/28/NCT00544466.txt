    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility in terms of toxicity and safety of HT in
      combination with Fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) and Melphalan as a preparative regimen
      for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with Hematological Malignancies: acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndromes
      (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate within the confines of this pilot study, incidence of
      neutrophil and platelet engraftment, survival on day +180, the overall survival, and disease
      free survival in patients with Hematological Malignancies: ALL, AML, and MDS.

      II. To evaluate incidence of primary and secondary engraftment failure, incidence of relapse,
      incidence of acute and chronic transplant related complications, including veno-occlusive
      disease of the liver (VOD), organ toxicity, secondary malignancies, including
      treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD), as well as post-transplant chimerism.

      OUTLINE: PREPARATIVE REGIMEN*: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on
      days -7 to -3 and melphalan IV on day -2. Patients also undergo HT twice daily on days -7 to
      -4.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day
      0. NOTE: *Treatment begins 2 days earlier in patients receive tacrolimus and/or sirolimus for
      GVHD prophylaxis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
