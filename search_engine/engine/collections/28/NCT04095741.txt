      Psychiatry Department (PAika) of the University Hospital in Brussels, will be contacted to
      ask if they would volunteer in this investigation. If the minors and their parents give their
      permission, they will be asked to fill in multiple questionnaires, measuring the current
      symptoms of anorexia nervosa, characteristics of autism spectrum disorder and global
      functioning of the minors. The questionnaires will be send and returned by post.
