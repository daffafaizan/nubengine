      be enrolled and randomized in a blinded fashion using a computerized random number generator
      (permuted-block randomization) for treatment with colistin and rifampin combination and
      colistin only at a ratio of 1:1. We will perform the E-test MIC:MIC ratio method to predict
      in vitro synergy of colistin and rifampin combination therapy.
