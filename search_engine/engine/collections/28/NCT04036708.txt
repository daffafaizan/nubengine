    
      Early childhood (1 through 4 yrs) is a period of dramatic developmental change that can be
      seriously compromised by exposure to toxic cyanogenic cassava (konzo disease), with
      potentially great impact throughout central and western sub-Sahara Africa in regions
      dependent on this food staple. In the face of ongoing economic instability and nutritional,
      medical and educational deprivation affecting konzo at-risk communities in the Democratic
      Republic of Congo, no programs exist for sustaining a favorable developmental milieu for
      these children. By establishing the viability of caregiver training interventions to enhance
      functionality among caregivers and improve caregiving quality while preventing konzo, the
      present R21 proposal can benefit tens of millions of children at-risk neurodevelopmentally;
      not only from poorly processed cyanogenic cassava, but also from a myriad of other
      non-infectious and infectious diseases.
