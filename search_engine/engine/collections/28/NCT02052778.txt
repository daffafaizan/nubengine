      Phase 1 Dose Expansion: (CLOSED)

      Up to approximately 185 patients will be enrolled among the 8 groups as outlined below:

        -  Group 1- CCA (iCCA or eCCA) with FGFR2 gene fusions.

        -  Group 2- CCA (iCCA or eCCA) with FGFR2 gene fusions that are chemotherapy naive or
           intolerant to first line chemotherapy (i.e., on chemotherapy regimen ≤ 1 cycle).

        -  Group 3 - CCA (iCCA or eCCA) with FGFR2 gene fusions treated with prior FGFR inhibitors.

        -  Group 4 - CCA (iCCA or eCCA) with other FGFR2 abnormalities, ie, gene mutations,
           rearrangements or amplifications.

        -  Group 5 - GBM or grade III glioma (i.e, anaplastic astrocytoma or anaplastic
           oliogodendroglioma) with FGFR gene fusions or activating mutations

        -  Group 6 - Advanced urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 fusions or FGFR3 activating
           mutations.

        -  Group 7: Basket of tumor types with tumors harboring FGFR2 amplification (≥10 copies).

        -  Group 8 - Basket of tumor types (except CCA, brain tumors and advanced urothelial
           carcinomas) with tumors harboring FGFR gene fusions or activating mutations.

      Phase 2:

      Approximately 100 iCCA patients with confirmed FGFR2 gene fusions will be treated. Patients
      will be centrally screened for FGFR2 gene fusions. This is a Single arm study with the
      primary endpoint of ORR.
