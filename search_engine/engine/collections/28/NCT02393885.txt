    
      The objective of this study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of a dual epicardial
      and endocardial ablation procedure for patients presenting with Persistent Atrial
      Fibrillation or Longstanding Persistent Atrial Fibrillation utilizing the AtriCure Bipolar
      System and AtriClipÂ® PRO LAA Exclusion System in an endoscopic or open ablation procedure,
      followed by an endocardial mapping and ablation procedure utilizing commercially available RF
      based, irrigated, power controlled, ablation catheters for endocardial lesions. The
      endocardial procedure will be staged to occur after 90 days post epicardial surgical
      procedure.
