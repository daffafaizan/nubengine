      disability. Injection of the sacroiliac joint with a local anesthetic/corticosteroid mixture
      has shown efficacy in treating this condition, when conservative therapy fails. The use of
      fluoroscopic guidance and anatomic landmarks are traditional methods for performing this
      injection; however, ultrasound imaging has recently been utilized for performing this
      procedure. Although studies exist that describe and validate the ultrasound technique, no
      studies exist that compare the techniques with respect to short-term and long-term outcomes.
      In this study, the primary objective is to determine if a difference exists between a
      fluoroscopic-guided technique and ultrasound-guided technique with respect to pain and
      function. A secondary objective is to compare the two techniques with respect to procedural
      characteristics.
