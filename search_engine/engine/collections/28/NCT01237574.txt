      The natural history of these two diseases is not well known. Indeed, most of the studies were
      retrospective and evaluated alcoholic disease or metabolic disease but never both diseases.
      However, these two diseases have the same histological lesions and can be associated. The
      knowledge of the natural history of these diseases could improve the management of patients
      in order to decrease complications and improve survival. The aim of this prospective study is
      to describe the natural history of chronic liver disease due to alcohol and/or metabolic
      syndrome and to identify factors associated with complications (ascites, encephalopathy,
      death, complications of obesity, diabetes or chronic alcohol abuse). All patients will be
      followed every 6 months for 3 years with clinical, biological and morphological parameters.
