      expression levels of EpCAM. Only the patients having tumor with high expression levels will
      be included.

      50-100ml blood with be drawn to get enough CD3 T cells at least 2x10^7. After separation,
      PBMC will be activated via antibodies of CD3 and CD28 and then transduced by lentivirus
      bearing the EpCAM CAR gene. Then the EpCAM CAR-T cells will proliferate up to 10-100 folds
      for infusion. The produced cells will be frozen or infused if available.

      Included patients will be preconditioned by cyclophosphamide for lymphodepletion if the
      levels of white blood cells and lymphocytes are normal. Infusion of T cells, at least 1 day
      after lymphodepletion, is dose escalating and beginning at the lowest level. If the first
      level is proven to be safe, the next level will be proceeded. Once severe side effects were
      observed, the dose will be lowered or the dose will be stopped.

      During infusion, patients will be taken care of by cardiogram monitor. Blood drawing will be
      taken before infusion, at 4h after infusion and on day 4, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 to
      determine the presence of CAR-T cells. At the same time, cytokines including IL-6, TNF-alpha
      and IFN-gamma and C-reactive protein levels will be determined. Routine imaging studies will
      be proceeded.

      To see whether there are long-term side effects of this therapy, patients received CAR-T
      cells will be followed up to at least 15 years.
