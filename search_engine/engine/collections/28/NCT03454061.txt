      specific 16-week-long physical education program (PEP) on the quotient of gross motor
      development (QGMD) in preschool children. This study involved 119 children who were clustered
      in a control group (CG, n= 29, age: 52.1±8.65 months; height: 1.1±0.07 m, body weight:
      19.2±5.55 Kg, BMI: 16.9±3.16) and an intervention group (IG, n= 90, age: 57.4±9.42 months;
      height: 1.1±0.06 m, body weight: 19.3±3.65 Kg, BMI: 16±1.75). Participants were assessed for
      locomotor ability and object control skills using the Italian version of gross motor
      development test, before and after the experimental period.
