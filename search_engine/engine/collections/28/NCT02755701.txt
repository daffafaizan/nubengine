      associated with insulin resistance and has been reported to improve the progression of liver
      fibrosis when used in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme. With regard to the
      effect of liver function improvement, in a research conducted in South Korea, approximately
      41.2% of the patients showed recovery of the normal albumin level when BCAA was administered
      to them for about 10 weeks during radiation therapy for liver cancer. Additionally, in other
      overseas researches, the changes in the values of total protein and albumin were
      significantly smaller in the patients who underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) to
      whom BCAA was administered than in those to whom BCAA was not administered.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the serum albumin value will be increased significantly
      in the cirrhotic patients with ascites to whom BCAA is administered than the patients to whom
      placebo is administered.
