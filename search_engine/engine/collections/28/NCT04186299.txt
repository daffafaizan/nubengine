      agents currently used in dentistry. However, their anesthetic efficacy and pain control in
      patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis via inferior alveolar nerve block is very
      low. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of clonidine versus
      articaine/epinpephrine as a local anesthetic agent for a buccal infiltration after IANB
      administration with lidocaine for (1) successful IANB, (2) hemodynamic stability, and (3)
      reducing dental anxiety for endodontic treatment in mandibular molars diagnosed with
      symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. 100 patients with first or second mandibular molars
      diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis will be enrolled. Patients will randomly
      receive either 1.7mL of clonidine (1:100,000) or 1.7mL of 4% articaine with epinephrine
      (1:100,000) using buccal infiltration technique after administration of 1.7mL of 2% lidocaine
      with epinephrine (1:100,000) using an IANB technique. 15 minutes after injection, lip
      numbness will be checked. Those who reported lip numbness will be checked for pulpal
      anesthesia. Those who achieve profound pulpal anesthesia will be included in the study.
      Patient's pain score will be recorded using a Heft-Parker visual analog scale before, during
      and after endodontic treatment. Success in IANB is defined as no or mild pain upon endodontic
      access cavity preparation and initial canal instrumentation. The hemodynamic parameters and
      pain management will be measured before and after root canal treatment with specific
      intervals. Patient's dental anxiety level will be measured by VAS-Anxiety preoperatively,
      before IANB administration, before endodontic treatment and after the treatment.
