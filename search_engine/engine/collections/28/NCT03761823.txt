      The group of healthy subjects will be recruited using posters at the local university and the
      internet. The healthy subjects will be studied before the group of patients to assess the
      feasibility and possible interactions of simultaneously recording FEES, HRIM and EMG. Then,
      the group of patients will be studied. They will be recruited from the Intensive Care Unit.
      See In- and Exclusion criteria for details.
