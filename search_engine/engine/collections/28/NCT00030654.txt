      Primary

        -  Compare the survival of patients with high-risk hormone-naive prostate cancer treated
           with androgen blockade with concurrent chemotherapy vs delayed chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare biochemical control in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the time to clinical failure, as measured by progression on bone scan or CT scan
           or a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time of â‰¤ 32 weeks, in patients treated
           with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      therapy (surgery vs radiotherapy and/or brachytherapy vs both), original combined Gleason
      score (6 vs 7 vs 8-10), and prior vaccine therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive androgen blockade (AB) comprising a luteinizing-hormone
           releasing-hormone agonist continuously and oral flutamide or oral bicalutamide once
           daily for at least 1 month. Within 4 weeks of initiation of AB, patients begin
           chemotherapy. Patients receive 1, and only 1, of the following chemotherapy regimens:

             -  Regimen A: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and
                docetaxel IV on day 3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence
                of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Regimen B: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-5 and
                paclitaxel IV on days 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38. Treatment repeats every 56 days
                for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Regimen C: Patients receive oral ketoconazole 3 times daily on days 1-7, 15-21, and
                29-35; doxorubicin IV on days 1, 15, and 29; vinblastine IV on days 8, 22, and 36;
                and oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 8-14, 22-28, and 36-42. Treatment
                repeats every 56 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Regimen D: Patients receive oral estramustine 3 times daily on days 1-4 and
                docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 3, 10, and 17. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
                4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Regimen E: Patients receive docetaxel IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
                for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Regimen F: Patients receive docetaxel IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats
                every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
                toxicity.

             -  Regimen G: With approval from the protocol chair, patients may receive a regimen
                that has been demonstrated in a published phase II study to have at least a 50%
                response rate as measured by PSA decrease from baseline over 2 measurements 28 days
                apart or a decrease in measurable soft tissue disease by 50% in 2 dimensions.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive AB as in arm I. Patients continue with AB until clinical
           failure, at which time patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I. Patients who have a
           response may continue to receive chemotherapy beyond 4 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,050 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-6 years.
