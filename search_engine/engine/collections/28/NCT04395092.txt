    
      The study is a Phase II, single arm, open label, multicenter trial evaluating the cumulative
      incidence of relapse when K-NK002 is used for relapse mitigation in patients with high-risk
      AML and MDS receiving an allogeneic haploidentical bone marrow graft.

      Part One (Safety run-in):

      An initial safety run-in to confirm the starting dose, and safety and tolerability of
      K-NK002;

        -  Dose cohort 1 will include 3 patients who will receive a dose of K-NK002 at 1 x 10E7 NK
           cells per kg.

        -  Dose cohort 2 will include 3 patients who will receive K-NK002 at 1 x 10E8 NK cells per
           kg.

      Part Two (Open Enrollment):

      Enrollment into the second part of the study (Open Enrollment) can begin following Part One,
      confirmation of dose and safety.
