      administered study agents), multi-center, drug-drug interaction study. Approximately 18
      patients may be enrolled in this study, and there will be one treatment group. All patients
      will receive a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of sirukumab. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)
      enzyme-specific study agents (5-probe cocktail) will consist of oral doses of midazolam,
      warfarin/vitamin K, omeprazole, and caffeine administered on 4 separate occasions throughout
      the study. A blood sample for CYP genetic analysis (genotyping) will be collected during
      screening from all prospective patients to determine eligibility for the study. Participation
      in CYP genotyping prescreening is mandatory for all patients. The CYP genotyping blood sample
      will not be used for any additional genetic research and will be destroyed after completion
      of this study. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 12 weeks for
      all patients included in the study, including a screening visit up to 4 weeks prior to first
      study agent administration. Patients will have five in-patient periods, four consisting of 3
      days and 2 nights each and one consisting of 2 days and 1 night. Patients safety will be
      monitored throughout the study, and there will be approximately 7 weeks of safety follow-up
      after sirukumab administration.
