      pain during peripheral IV (PIV) placement. Adult patients who require PIV placement for
      elective surgery will be consented for intervention while in the peri-operative suites (PS).
      The VR intervention will consist of a headset and immersive VR software that allows the
      patient to engage in a virtual world during PIV placement. Subjects will be queried
      immediately after PIV placement using the validated graphic rating scale regarding the
      sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects of discomfort they experienced with PIV placement
      (Appendix A). They will also be asked two validated questions concerning patient satisfaction
      (Dexter et al 1997). A control group of patients will undergo a similar assessment with
      slightly different wording after receiving PIV placement without iVR.
