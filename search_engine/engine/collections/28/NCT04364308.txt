      gestation) pregnancies delivered by a scheduled nonlaboring term singleton caesarean
      deliveries.

      This was an observational study carried out at a single university tertiary care center

      For every patient, an ultrasound examination was performed within one day of delivery and the
      fetal doppler indices were recorded. The umbilical venous pH were obtained immediately after
      delivery and before placental detachment with heparinized syringes

      The primary endpoints were CPR, umbilical (UA) and fetal MCA arteries indices. The second
      endpoints analysed when measurable were ductus venosus (DV) and uterine artery (Ut)
      pulsatility indices, all indices were examined using colour Doppler ultrasound according to a
      standard procedure and CPR was evaluated as the ratio between the MCA and UA pulsatility
      indices.

      The venous umbilical cord pH at birth was correlated with ultrasound doppler parameters,
      calculating the correlation coefficient r2 and P-value. Statistical significance was fixed at
      P<0.05. the investigators performed a linear regression analysis to find the association
      between the different ultrasound indices and the venous pH.
