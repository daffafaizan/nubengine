      expansively, and shows a wide diversity of techniques and concepts that are used in variable
      intensity. Until now there is no consensus on the optimal intensity of these interventions to
      have a positive impact on the activity and participation level of these children. A recent
      systematic review and meta-analysis already showed evidence for the effect of intensive
      training of hand function in children with CP, including short bursts of highly intensive
      therapy. In contrast, studies on the effect of intensive therapy of gross motor function were
      limited, and training was performed at a lower intensity during a longer period, resulting in
      effects that are more inconclusive. Moreover, none of the reviewed studies included
      improvement of trunk control as one of their treatment goals, although it is known that most
      children with CP experience some problems with trunk control, to a variable extent.

      This research project has two aims, i.e. 1) investigating the effect of intensive therapy
      camps on qualitative and quantitative parameters of lower limbs and trunk; and 2) comparing
      the effect of two therapeutic approaches, namely a functional approach versus a more
      qualitative-functional approach on these parameters.
