      studies shows that patients experience anxiety and depression years after surgery. Anxiety
      and depression appear frequently at the same time and strengthen each other. Studies
      underline that CABG-patients especially the first month after surgery want follow-up by
      health care provider. Anxiety and depression are assessed as independent risk factors for
      morbidity and death in heart patients.

      203 CABG-patients were randomised into the study. Both patient group, the experimental- and
      control group, answered the same three standardised questionnaires before surgery, 6 weeks
      and 6 months after surgery. The questionnaires are Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      (HADS), Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and SF-36.

      The intervention consist of two home visits 2 and 4 weeks after CABG undertaken by project
      leader. The intervention protocol has been approved by The Norwegian Committee for Medical
      Research Ethics.

      Knowledge from this study may generate a basis for clinical guidelines and patient pathways.
      Results from this study will show if the home based intervention in the future will be
      performed for only a risk group of about 20 % that have responded best to the intervention.
      In the future the intervention also may be individualized electronically.
