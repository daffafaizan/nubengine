      named EGD automatic quality-control system (AQCS). Investigators carried a prospective
      multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the performance of this system in quality
      control of real-time EGD, including detecting the early upper gastrointestinal cancer and
      precancerous lesions, assessing inspection completeness, mucosal visibility, time of EGD
      procedure and other indicators.
