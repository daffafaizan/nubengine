      enrollment and claims data for individuals enrolled in commercial health plans to estimate
      the measureable demographic, clinical and historical economic risk factors that may be
      associated with medically diagnosed pertussis/whooping cough infection among commercially
      insured infants less than one-year of age. Healthcare costs and utilization among infants
      with a reported diagnosis of pertussis/whooping cough will be stratified by the number of
      DTaP vaccinations received prior to infection.
