      clean air, ultrafine particles, or ultrafine particles and ozone in an exposure chamber. The
      investigators will determine blood pressure, heart rate, respiration as well as cardiac
      output and directly record sympathetic vasomotor tone using the microneurography technique.
      To elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which particles and ozone affect the autonomic
      nervous system, the investigators will assess the local and systemic inflammatory response as
      well as the changes in neurotrophic factors in sputum and blood. In addition, the activation
      of inflammatory cells in sputum and blood will be analyzed at different points in time after
      exposures. Changes in sympathetic activity will be correlated with the degree of airway
      inflammation and oxidative stress assessed in induced sputum and blood. This study will
      provide important insight in the mechanisms through which air pollution, particularly
      ultrafine particle exposure, increases cardiovascular risk in human subjects and generate a
      human model for mechanistic and therapeutic studies.
