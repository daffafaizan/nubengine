      (GnRH) analogue Leuprolide Acetate for use in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Leuprolide Acetate is
      currently used in adults for prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids and in
      preparation for in-vitro fertilization, and in children for central precocious puberty. The
      purpose of this study to confirm and extend results from a prior phase II study (Bowen et al,
      2015) which demonstrated that Leuprolide halted cognitive and functional decline in a
      subgroup of women with mild-moderate AD who were also taking the acetylcholinesterase
      inhibitor donepezil. Objectives are to replicate, in the same subgroup, Leuprolide's clinical
      EFFICACY in this prior trial and to add neuroimaging and plasma BIOMARKERS that will help
      elucidate Leuprolide's likely multiple mechanisms of action in AD. These mechanisms include
      decreasing levels of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) based on extensive preclinical evidence that
      decreasing LH preserves cognition and decreases amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation in
      animal models of AD, as well as new evidence that GnRH analogues may have anti-inflammatory
      effects.
