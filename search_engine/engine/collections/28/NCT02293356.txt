    
      This clinical study is designed as an open, single group, multi-center, phase 4 clinical
      study to assess the safety of Nimotuzumab in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and to
      provide a more reasonable basis for clinical drug programs.

      Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are administered of Nimotuzumab based on
      medication instructions or adjusted by clinicians according to the treatment. In case of the
      progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of the consent, or judgment by
      investigator that the treatment needs to be stopped, the treatment of Nimotuzumab is stopped.
