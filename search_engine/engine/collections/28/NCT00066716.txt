      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of complete pathological response and/or minimal residual microscopic
           disease in patients with squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus treated with
           preoperative celecoxib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the chemotherapy-related toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression, disease-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days
      1, 22, and 43. Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning 3-7 days before the
      first dose of chemotherapy and continuing until the morning of planned surgical resection
      (between days 64 and 71). Approximately 28-56 days after resection, patients may resume oral
      celecoxib twice daily and continue for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed periodically for 18 months after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
