    
      Study RIN-PF-301 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled treprostinil in subjects with IPF over a 52-week
      period. Subjects will be randomly allocated 1:1 to receive inhaled treprostinil or placebo.
      All subjects will initiate inhaled treprostinil or placebo at a dose of 3 breaths
      administered 4 times daily (QID) and will titrate to a target dosing regimen of 12 breaths
      QID. Study drug doses may be titrated up as tolerated, until the target dose or maximum
      clinically tolerated dose is achieved. Once eligible, 6 Treatment Period visits to the clinic
      will be required at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 28, 40, and 52.

      Efficacy assessments include spirometry (forced vital capacity [FVC]), time to clinical
      worsening, time to first acute exacerbation of IPF, overall survival, King's Brief
      Interstitial Lung Disease (K-BILD) questionnaire, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
      peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration, supplemental oxygen use, and lung diffusion capacity
      (DLCO). Safety assessments include the development of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse
      events (SAEs), vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and electrocardiogram (ECG)
      parameters.

      Subjects who complete the Week 52 Visit may be offered the opportunity to enter an open-label
      extension (OLE) study after completing the final study visit.
