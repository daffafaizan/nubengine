    
      Male and female COPD patients participating in a 12 week pulmonary rehabilitation program at
      the University of Texas Medical Branch enrolled in the study will be randomized into either
      placebo or testosterone enanthate (100mg men, 25mg women) treatment. Testosterone and placebo
      will be given in a cyclic fashion during the pulmonary rehabilitation with single injections
      given on weeks 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 and 11. Baseline (during week 1 of rehabilitation) and post
      (during week 12 of rehabilitation) study testing will measure the effectiveness of
      testosterone on several measures listed in the outcome section.
