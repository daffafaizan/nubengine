      severe circumstances. However BG levels following spine surgery have never been described
      before. Our primary purpose is to measure postoperative changes in BG levels of non-diabetic
      patients undergoing spine surgery.

      Methods: Non-diabetic consecutive adult patients undergoing spine surgery are going to be
      prospectively included during a 6 months period. BG capillary measures are collected from the
      preoperative fasting period to the end of postoperative day 3, six times a day. Three main
      glycemic parameters are calculated: Delta Day 0 (DD0), Day 2 mean (D2), and Hyperglycemic
      Index (HGI). In the peri operative period, no change in oral intake nor in intravenous fluids
      is prescribed. Patients are followed-up for three months postoperatively for any early
      adverse event, requiring or not surgical revision.
