      approach. One of the main challenges to effective behavior change interventions is the
      complexity of the systems in which these behaviors are situated. Namely, health behaviors are
      the result of the confluence of macro-level influences (e.g., the built environment, family,
      etc.) and micro-level influences (e.g., stress). Furthermore, it is imperative that attempts
      to support healthy childhood growth consider the foundational contribution of a person's
      culture to their health behaviors, especially as children from traditionally underserved
      minorities are often hardest hit by obesity.

      This program will test a 15 week behavioral intervention followed by 3 months of coaching
      calls that uses principles from the learning sciences and health behavior change to help
      shape healthy behaviors in the context of family. The follow-up of the study will last 1
      year. The content of the intervention will focus on health behavior change, including
      teaching goal-setting and self monitoring skills, as well as parenting strategies.

      The primary outcome of interest will be early childhood BMI trajectory over 1 year.
      Additional measures will include survey data to measure parent and child health behaviors
      (e.g., diet, physical activity, sleep, media use) that are associated with obesity.
