    
      The trial is a phase Ib study evaluating the safety and efficacy of OH2 injection combined
      with HX008 injection in patients with Melanoma.

      In the Phase Ib dose escalation trial, two doses (1x10e6, 1x10e7 CCID50/mL) of OH2 will be
      combined with HX008(at a fixed dose of 200mg) will be tested.

      In the Phase Ib dose expansion trial, OH2(1x10e7 CCID50/mL) will be injected individually in
      the first week, followed by every two weeks while HX008(200 mg) will be injected every three
      weeks after the first injection which will be in the second week.

      Blood samples will be collected and radiological imaging will be performed to evaluate safety
      and efficacy during the trial. Besides, patients will be subjected to cutaneous swabs, and
      blood/urine/feces sampling to determine virus shedding. Participating patients will be
      evaluated for objective response rate, progression free survival and overall survival.
