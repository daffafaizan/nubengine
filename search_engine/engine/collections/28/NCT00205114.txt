        1. To test, in a randomized, controlled, single-blind study design, whether a
           multifactorial intervention for high-risk older adults will decrease the rate of falls
           compared to a control group receiving a home safety and nutrition booklet by mail;

        2. To enhance existing health professional knowledge base to support fall prevention;

        3. To test, in a quasi-experimental study design, the ability of a community-wide health
           professional educational program to decrease the rate of fall-related hospitalizations
           among older adults (both high and low-risk) in Dane County compared to control counties
           in Wisconsin.

      We hypothesize that:

      The rate of falls will be 40% lower over one year among high-risk older adults randomized to
      the individualized multifactorial intervention (combined with health professional education),
      compared to those randomized to home safety and nutrition booklets (combined with health
      professional education) in Dane County.

      A health professional education program about fall prevention will decrease the rate of
      fall-related hospitalizations among older adults (both high and low-risk) in the intervention
      county by 10%, compared to an anticipated no change from baseline in control counties.
