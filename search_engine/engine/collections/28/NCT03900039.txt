      what.

      Traditionally surgeons used metal (Cobalt-Chrome) against a conventional polyethylene
      (plastic). More recently (around 15 years ago) a newer more dense type of polyethylene
      (called XLPE) had been developed and a new type of head called Oxidized Zirconium was also
      developed.

      In this trial, adults who were undergoing hip replacements were randomized assigned into one
      of the four groups:

      Group 1: old plastic vs metal head Group 2: Old plastic against Oxidized Zirconium Group 3:
      New plastic versus metal head Group 4 New plastic vs Oxidized Zirconium

      All patients were followed up for a minimum of 10 years to assess which group wore the most
      amount of polyethylene and which group had the best survival rate.
