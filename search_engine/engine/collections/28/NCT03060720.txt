      genetic evaluation. A patient's personal and family history of cancer is the information
      typically used to make this decision, but there are currently no accurate, evidence-based
      guidelines that exist to help doctors use this information to make a decision.

      The investigators hope that by testing all new pancreatic cancer patients, they can determine
      which clinical factors predict for genetic mutations in order to create a risk assessment
      tool.

      The investigators want to determine which patients with pancreatic cancer will benefit from
      genetic testing. To do so, the investigators will offer all patients with pancreatic cancer
      in the Dana-Farber Gastrointestinal Oncology clinic referral for genetic evaluation. At the
      Cancer Genetics and Prevention clinic appointment, the provider will review the patient's
      personal and familial history of cancer and offer genetic testing.
