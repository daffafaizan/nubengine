      implemented and completed, the efficacy will be verified in this Phase II clinical study. The
      rationale of this study is based on the animal studies that transplanted cardiac progenitor
      cells may regenerate damaged myocardium by giving rise to cardiac muscle and vascular cell
      types. Preclinical and phase I studies indicate the possibilities of cardiac function
      improvements and reduced myocardial fibrosis by progenitor cell infusion.

      The efficacy of cell transplantation is assessed as the primary endpoint of the Phase II
      clinical study. The improvements of cardiac ejection fraction assessed by echocardiography,
      ventriculography, and cardiac MRI, which are conducted before and after treatment, are
      assessed as the evaluation items. The absolute values of the improvement of cardiac ejection
      fraction obtained by the above three imaging modalities before and after treatment are
      compared between two groups of the transplantation group and non-transplantation group.
