      fludarabine (120-180 mg/m^2) and busulfan (less than or equal to 8 mg/kg or IV equivalent)
      (Flu/Bu) or fludarabine (120-180 mg/m^2) and melphalan (less than 150 mg/m^2) (Flu/Mel).
      Patient randomized to MAC will receive one of three regimens: busulfan (16 mg/kg oral or 12.8
      mg/kg IV equivalent) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) (Bu/Cy); or, busulfan (16 mg/kg PO or
      12.8 mg/kg IV) and fludarabine (120-180 mg/m^2) (Bu/Flu); or, cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg)
      and total body irradiation (greater than 1200-1420cGy) (CyTBI). A total of 356 patients (178
      to each arm) will be accrued on this study over a period of four years. Patients will be
      followed for up to 18 months from transplantation.
