    
      LAM is a rare disease that predominantly affects women of child-bearing age. To study in more
      detail this rare disease, this multi-center project will establish a registry of persons with
      LAM. By combining data from 6 centers and outside physicians, this study may yield valuable
      information regarding the rate of decline in pulmonary function and quality of life in
      individuals with LAM. These patients will be followed over a five-year period. Tissue
      collected from study participants may facilitate future studies into the molecular basis of
      LAM.
