      groups would be expected. To calculate sample size, a 42% morbidity rate would be expected in
      sarcopenic patients while a 22% rate would be expected in the non-sarcopenic group.
      Considering a two-sided α=0.05 and β=0.1, the minimal sample size required to achieve
      statistical significance was 224 subjects. Considering a 10% drop-out rate of patients
      undergoing explorative laparoscopy or laparotomy without parenchymal resection a total of 249
      patients will be required for completion of the study
