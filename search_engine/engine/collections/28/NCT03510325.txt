      schizophrenia. We plan to get a clear initial regimen and the drug recommendation in the
      treatment of first episode schizophrenia in China, based on the efficacy, adverse effect and
      pharmacoeconomics evaluation for the most widely used antipsychotic drugs (amisulpride,
      risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole ) and paliperidone injection. We will carry out
      sequential treatment trials in first-episode treatment resistant patients (Phase 2:
      Randomized controlled trials of other antipsychotic drugs that are not used in Phase 1 and
      paliperidone injection; Phase 3: Clozapine monotherapy, oral administration of other drugs or
      long-acting injection in treatment; Phase 4: Clozapine combination therapy or any combination
      of two other antipsychotics), so that we could get a better sequential treatment protocol
      based on the therapeutic outcome. The current project has great clinical significance.
