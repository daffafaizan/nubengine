      randomized to one of the treatment groups: Wrist/hand Functional Electrical Stimulation
      (FES)+whole arm motor learning group; shoulder/elbow robotics + whole arm motor learning
      group; and whole arm motor learning group. For all groups, treatment will offered 5 hrs/day,
      5 days/week, for 12 weeks. All three treatment groups will receive motor learning therapy.
      For the Wrist/hand FES+whole arm motor learning group, there will be the addition of FES
      during treatment. For the Shoulder/elbow robotics + whole arm motor learning group there will
      be the addition of robotics training. Outcome measures will be collected at weeks 1, 6, 12,
      and three months after the end of treatment. Measures will include muscle strength (Manual
      Muscle Testing); coordination of joint movement (Fugl-Meyer Coordination Scale); motor
      control of target acquisition, pathway maintenance; and smoothness of movement (robotics
      measures); performance of 13 functional tasks (Arm Motor Ability Test); and quality of life
      (Stroke Impact Scale). Measures of brain function will be non-invasive and will include
      cognitive planning time, cognitive effort level, and location of brain activity during simple
      shoulder and arm movements. Changes in brain function measures will reflect plasticity or
      adaptability in response to treatment.
