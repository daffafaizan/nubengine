        -  Determine the efficacy of dutasteride followed by contrast-enhanced, ultrasound-guided
           targeted biopsy in detecting prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the detection rate of prostate cancer with targeted biopsy using
           contrast-enhanced ultrasound combined with dutasteride.

        -  Determine the efficacy of targeted biopsy using contrast-enhanced ultrasound vs
           systematic biopsy in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the reduction in post-biopsy bleeding after dutasteride in these patients.

        -  Determine the cost effectiveness of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dutasteride once daily on days 1-14.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily on days 1-14. On day 14, patients in
           both arms undergo blood collection and contrast-enhanced (perflutren protein-type A
           microspheres) transrectal ultrasound. Conventional gray-scale imaging, color Doppler
           imaging, and power Doppler imaging are performed. Biopsies are then performed; first up
           to 6 targeted ultrasound-guided biopsies and then up to 12 systematic biopsies.

      After completion of study procedures, patients are followed at 1 day.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients will be accrued for this study.
