      the inability to perform many activities of daily living, an increased propensity to fall,
      and decreased independence. These conditions include mobility disability and low vitality.
      Elderly men also experience increased anemia, metabolic syndrome, decreased sexual function
      and memory impairment. These conditions likely have multiple causes, but one cause that could
      contribute to all of them is a low serum testosterone concentration. When young hypogonadal
      men are treated with testosterone, they experience improvements in sexual function, muscle
      mass and strength, bone mineral density, sense of well being, and anemia. However, the
      benefits of testosterone therapy in older men with age-related decline in testosterone
      concentration are not known and are the subject of this investigation.

      Participants will be treated with testosterone or placebo gel for 1 year. The dose will be
      adjusted in a blinded fashion to achieve a target T level range. Participants will be
      followed for one additional year following the treatment phase to assess adverse events.

        -  Men participating in the Cardiovascular Trial will be assessed for changes in
           atherosclerotic plaque burden from 0 to 12 months.

        -  Men participating in the Bone Trial will be assessed by QCT of the spine and hip, DXA of
           the spine and hip and clinical fractures at 0 and 12 months.

        -  Men participating in the PK Study will attend 3 additional study visits for blood draws
           at the time of the 4-month assessment.
