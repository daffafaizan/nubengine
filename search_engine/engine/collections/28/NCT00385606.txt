    
      The primary end-points of the GECO study

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of three innovative schedules of treatment for advanced
           NSCLC

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the addition of rofecoxib to first-line chemotherapy in the
           treatment of patients affected by advanced NSCLC

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of prolonged continuous infusion (p.c.i.) of gemcitabine, with
           the fixed infusion rate of 10 mg/sqm/minute) versus the standard administration in 30
           minutes, in combination with cisplatin, in the treatment of patients affected by
           advanced NSCLC

      Four treatment arms are planned.

        -  ARM A standard treatment : cisplatin + gemcitabine

        -  ARM B cisplatin + gemcitabine + rofecoxib

        -  ARM C cisplatin + p.c.i. gemcitabine (10 mg/sqm/minute)

        -  ARM D cisplatin + p.c.i gemcitabine (10 mg/sqm/minute) + rofecoxib

      The phase II part of the study for experimental arms B, C and D will be conducted to evaluate
      tolerability in the three treatment arms.

      The phase III study for efficacy has been designed according to a factorial 2x2 model with
      the planned comparison of

        -  The efficacy of rofecoxib: A + C (arms without rofecoxib) vs B+D (arms with rofecoxib)

        -  The efficacy of p.c.i. gemcitabine: A + B (arms with standard infusion of gemcitabine)
           vs C+ D (arms with p.c.i gemcitabine)
