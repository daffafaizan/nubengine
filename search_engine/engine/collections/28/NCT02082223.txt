      patients' care givers quality of life/resilience deficits and thus improve outcomes. This
      initial pilot study will test the feasibility of offering patients and their care givers
      prehabilitation interventions prior to complex gastrointestinal surgery such as
      pancreatectomy, esophagectomy, proctectomy, or hepatectomy.
