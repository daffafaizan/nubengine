      metastases. It is nowadays admitted that the complete resection of these hepatic metastases
      represents the only treatment that has been shown to increase survival. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the efficacy/safety ratio of the liver surgery when performed simultaneously
      or at distance of the primitive tumour ablation. Patients are randomized to undergo liver
      surgery either during, or 12 to 14 weeks after the primary resection. The primary endpoint is
      the rate of patients with at least one severe complication within 60 days after surgery.
      Secondary endpoints evaluate long-term clinical outcomes, in particular recurrence-free
      survival.
