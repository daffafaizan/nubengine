      and initial tumour characteristics in patients with metastatic breast cancer in Austria. The
      data collected will include: median age at metastasis, median disease-free survival (DFS)
      between initial diagnosis or first date of absence of disease and occurrence of metastasis,
      histological subtype of the primary tumour, initial TNM stage, grade and receptor status of
      the primary tumour, type and form of adjuvant therapy, pattern of metastasis and metastasis
      site. Characteristics that have a negative prognostic value are expected to be
      overrepresented in the metastatic patient group.

      Also, this AGMT registry is intended to assess the distribution pattern of these metastatic
      stage subtypes in Austria. Additionally, their influence on treatment strategy and outcome is
      to be studied. Furthermore, the frequency and tumour characteristics of breast cancer in male
      patients will be assessed and the influence of gender on treatment strategies identified.

      The AGMT breast cancer registry will conduct an exact analysis of survival data, thereby
      enabling accurate calculations of average survival duration in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer in Austria. Further parameters that reflect the quality or course of
      oncological treatment are the survival rates from the time of metastasis development at 1, 2
      and 5 years after diagnosis.

      This AGMT registry is intended to investigate the response to various therapies in a real
      life population in relation to previous treatments, concomitant diseases and breast cancer
      subtype. The aim is to assess which therapies are used at which time point and on which
      disease subtype they depend.
