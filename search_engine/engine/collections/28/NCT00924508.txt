      subjects age 13 and older with eczema. The primary objective of this clinical study is to
      determine whether occlusion of triamcinolone 0.1% cream (TAC) used to treat eczema with
      hydrogel patch improves its efficacy. A secondary objective is to determine whether eczema
      improves under occlusion with hydrogel patch alone. All subjects will have 3 target lesions
      of similar severity followed throughout the study. Patients will apply hydrogel patch alone
      to the first lesion, TAC 0.1% cream to the second lesion, and TAC 0.1% cream occluded by
      hydrogel patch to the third lesion. All treatments are twice a day for a maximum of 4 weeks
      or until lesions are cleared. The modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score will
      be used to evaluate each lesion.
