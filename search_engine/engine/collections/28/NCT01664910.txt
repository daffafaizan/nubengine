      I. To characterize the safety of anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) 22 immunoconjugate
      inotuzumab ozogamicin (CMC-544), when administered in conjunction with fludarabine
      (fludarabine phosphate), bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride), and rituximab as
      non-myeloablative preparative regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplantation for
      CD22-positive lymphoid malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate tumor response. II. To determine overall and event-free survival rates by
      histology subtype.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of inotuzumab ozogamicin.

      Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day -13, and
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes to 1
      hour on days -5 to -3. Patients with CD20-positive disease also receive rituximab IV over 4-6
      hours on days -6, 1, and 8 and patients with matched unrelated donors (MUD) receive
      anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 3-4 hours on days -2 to -1. All patients also receive
      tacrolimus IV over 24 hours continuously or orally (PO) daily beginning on days -2 to 180
      followed by taper in the absence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and methotrexate IV over
      30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 6 (1, 3, 6, and 11 in patients with MUD). Patients undergo
      allogeneic bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
