      ablate BCCs. The investigators consider this a non-significant risk study because our
      PulseCure system only applies 0.4 watts to the skin compared to the 40 watts applied by the
      currently used electrosurgical unit to remove skin lesions, the Hyfrecator. Since the
      PulseCure applies 1/100 of the energy and does not even heat the skin significantly, it
      represents a non-significant risk to the patient. Our study will provide the first data on
      the response of BCCs to these 100 ns pulses. The investigators will first treat three BCCs on
      BCNS patients with different pulse numbers to determine the pulse number needed to ablate.
      Once the investigators have the optimal pulse number, the investigators will use it to treat
      20 normal patients with sporadic BCCs on their trunks. This should provide sufficient data to
      conclude whether or not nsPEF can ablate BCCs on normal individuals.
