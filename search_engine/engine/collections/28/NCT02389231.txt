      autoantibodies, which leads to marked decrease in their lifespan. The investigators
      demonstrated two years ago in a multivariate retrospective study that the CD3+CD8+ HLA-DR+
      T-cell population was associated to a better outcome. The investigators observed that the
      proportion of circulating CD3+CD8+CD25highFoxp3+ T cells was significantly higher in patients
      with wAIHA in remission than in controls and correlated to hemoglobin levels. Extensive
      phenotyping and functional analysis revealed that those cells were bona fide Tregs acting in
      an IL10-dependent manner. Finally, culture of PBMC from normal donors or active wAIHAI
      patients with low dose of IL2 promoted the expansion of functional CD3+CD8+CD25+Foxp3+. Those
      observations constituted the rationale to propose low dose of IL2 to treat patients with
      active wAIHA with the objective of demonstrating that this treatment is able to induce the
      expansion of CD8Tregs, over a 9 week treatment period.

      Four courses of IL2 (aldesleukin [Proleukin, Novartis]) will be administered subcutaneously
      for 5 days. The first course will be limited to a dose of 1.5 million IU per day and followed
      by a 9 day wash-out. The other courses of 3 million IU per day will be initiated after a 16
      day wash-out.

      Patients will be evaluated on day 1 and day 5 of each treatment course, before the first and
      last administration of interleukin-2 and will also be evaluated at 6 months.
