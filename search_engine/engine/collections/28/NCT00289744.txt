    
      To evaluate the long-term antibody persistence, volunteers will be bled at Years 6, 7, 8, 9
      and 10 after the first vaccine dose of the primary vaccination course to determine their
      anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody concentrations.

      If a subject has become seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies or lost anti-HBs seroprotection
      concentrations at the long-term blood sampling time point (i.e. Years 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10), he/
      she will be offered an additional vaccine dose.
