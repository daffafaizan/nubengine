      canal treatment for mandibular molar teeth with acute irreversible pulpitis following laser
      activation.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study will account the patients who are referred to the Department
      of Endodontics,both male and female patients,with pain due to acute irreversible pulpitis
      from carious mandibular first and second molar teeth requiring root canal treatment. Subjects
      of age 13 to 70 years who met the inclusion criteria and responded positively to cold test
      will be included in the study.

      Single visit root canal treatment with 2.5 mL of 2% lignocaine containing 1:80,000 adrenaline
      for an inferior alveolar block injection will be administered for each individual. After
      achieving anesthesia, patients who exhibit pain following access opening will be subjected to
      diode laser application on the pulp canal orifices. With regard to intraoperative pain, pre
      laser and post laser intraoperative pain incidence will be recorded. Once when the
      intraoperative pain incidence is reduced, patients will be reassessed for the need of
      additional anesthesia. If fully anesthetised, root canal procedure will be completed.
      Preoperative, intraoperative( before and laser application) pulse rate will also be measured.
      The levels of preoperative and post-operative pain at 24 hrs and 48 hrs for each patient will
      be recorded using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS).
