      infarction Study (TAPAS) has shown that thrombus aspiration improves myocardial perfusion and
      clinical outcome compared to conventional primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in
      patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Impaired myocardial perfusion due
      to spontaneous or angioplasty-induced embolization of atherothrombotic material also occurs
      in patients with Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The aim of this study is to
      determine whether thrombus aspiration before stent implantation will result in improved
      myocardial perfusion in patients with NSTEMI compared to conventional PCI.

      The study is a single-centre, prospective, randomised trial with blinded evaluation of
      endpoints. The planned inclusion is 540 patients with acute NSTEMI who are candidates for
      urgent PCI.

      If thrombus aspiration leads to significant improvement of myocardial perfusion in patients
      with acute NSTEMI it may become part of the standard interventional approach.
