      epidemiology of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) among Chinese pregnant
      women in the real world at present, which is anticipated to complete enrollment in two
      months. A total of 24 hospitals are selected from 6 regions (north, northeast, east, south,
      southwest, and northwest) of China by the method of multi-stage stratified sampling, each
      region with one tertiary teaching hospital and three general hospital or health care hospital
      for women and children. According to the sample size calculation formula combined with the
      feasibility and flexibility of study, 12000 eligible outpatient pregnant women are expected
      to be enrolled. Structured questionnaires, which are needed filled in both by patients and
      doctors, are used to collect participants' data, including basic demographic characteristics
      (age, occupation, educational level, family income, etc.), reproductive factors (menstrual
      history, times of pregnancy or parity, history of cesarean section, etc.), pre-pregnancy
      weight, pregnancy comorbidities and complications, laboratory test of blood routine and serum
      iron protein, use of iron supplements, diet and living habits during pregnancy, and others.
      The outcomes are defined by the recommendations on the guidelines for the diagnosis and
      treatment of Chinese iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during gestation period in
      2014. All these data are requested to input the electronic data collecting (EDC) system in
      time and managed level-to-level, with Chinese Evidence-based Medicine Centre finally
      monitoring the quality of data. During the whole course, no intervention is given to the
      participants and thus will not have a negative effect on the health and rights of the
      participants.
