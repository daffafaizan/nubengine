      content, temperature, viscosity etc. In infants the protein composition affects gastric
      emptying. Children with cerebral pasly commonly have foregut dysmotility - with nausea,
      vomiting, feeding intolerance and gastroesophageal reflux. Tube feedings, usually based on
      cows milk are commonly used.

      Our hypothesis is that the source and thus protein composition of feeding affects gastric
      emptying rate and electrofysiology.

      Using four different tube feedings, standardized for content of fat, glucose and calories, we
      will measure gastric emptying rate using C13 octanoic acid as well as electrogastrography
      will be recorded. The protein modules are derived from casein, whey/casein mixture,
      hydrolyzed whey and aminoacids. Children with cerebral paresis and gastrostomy will be
      included. Each serves as his / her own control.

      The primary endpoint is gastric emptying rate, the secondary endpoint electrogastrography.
