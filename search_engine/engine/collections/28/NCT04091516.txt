      and efficacy of 12-week plant-based, weight-loss program that is carried out in an office
      setting and is open to participation to the general public via local print and online
      advertising or whichever methods apply. The program will include weekly education and
      support, and assessment of blood pressure, lipids, hemoglobin A1c, and body composition
      before and after starting the program. The price of the program, $645, will cover the costs
      of weekly education, blood pressure check, laboratory testing and body composition analysis.
