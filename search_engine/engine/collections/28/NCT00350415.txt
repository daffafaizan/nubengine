    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, multi-center, multi-national, active-control study in
      patients who are experiencing a moderately active flare of UC. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either Asacol 2.4 g/day (400 mg tablet) or Asacol 4.8 g/day (800 mg
      tablet) for 6 weeks. Patients will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups in a 1:1
      ratio. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Asacol 4.8 g/day
      (800 mg tablet) compared to Asacol 2.4 g/day (400 mg tablet) in this patient population.
      Following successful screening, patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms.
      Patients will be evaluated after 6 weeks of treatment with an interim visit after 3 weeks.
