      abilities independent of health status. Low T levels over time are associated with increased
      risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings suggest that men with low T
      levels are most at risk for age-related cognitive decline and AD and therefore most likely to
      benefit from T supplementation to prevent the development of AD or age-associated cognitive
      decline. The current study will assess cognition, mood, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
      biomarker response to T supplementation in older men with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
      low T levels.

      Participants will be randomized to either receive T treatment or a placebo for six months.
      Participants will come in for about five visits within the span of six months where they will
      complete cognitive & memory tests, fill out mood questionnaires, and have their blood drawn
      to monitor the medication level. A sample of blood will also be taken at one visit to test
      for apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is a genetic risk factor associated with AD. Participants
      will have the option to get a spinal tap in order to measure biological markers associated
      with Alzheimer's disease including beta-amyloid 1-40, 42, total-tau, and
      phosphorylated-tau-181-231. This will require an additional two visits.
