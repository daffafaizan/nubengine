      daily adaptive skills based on executive functions and help the transition into adulthood in
      young adults with ASD. Before and after the intervention, the participants and their parents
      completed questionnaires that measure executive functions and adaptive skills, and the
      participants additionally completed an assessment of social adaptive skills. The differences
      between pre- and post-intervention scores of the outcome measures were analyzed using
      Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to evaluate the effect of the program.
