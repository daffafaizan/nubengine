      diameter is 5 cm (T3) or larger, or which present with involvement of the chest wall or skin.
      Surprisingly, the simultaneous presence of clinically detectable distant metastases is
      relatively infrequent (~8%), a peculiar finding since in 73% of these large tumors it is
      possible to document shedding of tumor cells into the blood.

      While LABC has become a rare clinical presentation of breast cancer in the general population
      as a result of improved early detection by mammographic screening, it remains relatively
      common among minority women of low socioeconomic status. For instance, in a consecutive
      series of 363 African-American women presenting in a large urban hospital, one out of three
      women newly diagnosed with breast cancer had LABC.

      It is well documented that although the incidence of breast cancer among African-Americans is
      lower than among white women, breast cancer mortality in African-Americans is significantly
      higher. In 1998, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute and the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention reported an overall downward trend in cancer incidence and
      mortality between 1990 and 1995 for all cancers combined. Many minority and medically
      underserved populations, however, did not share equally in these improvements. These patients
      have continued to encounter multifactorial barriers to early detection and care, warranting
      interventions to improve access.

      At the same time, it is equally important to offer the best chance for survival to those
      underserved women who have already availed themselves of medical care. Paradoxically, while
      the medical community is aware of the inadequate accrual of minority patients to clinical
      trials, only few trials exist for LABC.
