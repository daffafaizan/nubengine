      pain relief by an epidural catheter.

      This is done by placing a thin plastic catheter in the epidural space in the lower back of
      the patient, and injecting a medicine solution usually consisting of local anesthesia and
      opioids.

      To ensure an effective pain relief through the labor process, additional medicine solution is
      injected through the catheter. Traditionally, this is done by a continuous infusion, often
      with the addition of patient controlled boluses.

      In this study the investigators investigate if maintaining the pain relief through programmed
      hourly intermittent boluses is more effective than continuous infusion. This is done in other
      studies with promising results, but the difference in this study is the addition of
      adrenaline to the medicine solution in order to make it more effective.
