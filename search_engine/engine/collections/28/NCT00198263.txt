      manage local tumors without the potentially undesirable side effects of systemic chemotherapy
      agents or radiotherapy. Surgical resection of solid tumors often leaves subjects with
      significant organ dysfunction and/or permanent disfigurement requiring reconstructive
      surgery. In contrast, electroporation therapy may offer equivalent disease control to
      conventional surgery with lessened need for reconstructive surgery. Electroporation therapy
      may also provide economic benefits over conventional surgical and or radiation procedures
      through reduced operating theatre costs, hospital stays and post treatment interventions. The
      ability to shrink or eliminate local tumors with the MedPulserÂ® System when used in
      conjunction with intralesional Bleomycin is an important new possible treatment for the
      conservative local management of SCCHN and provides a possible alternative treatment option
      to surgical excision in the management of cancer.
