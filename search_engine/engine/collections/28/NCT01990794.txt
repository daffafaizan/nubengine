      but little is known regarding their clinical effects and biokinetic distribution and body
      burden with long-term use. This study assessed blood kinetics, steady-state levels,
      biochemical responses, and clinical effects in five adult males and five adult females who
      voluntarily ingested approximately 1.0 mg Co/day of a commercially available Co supplement
      over a three month period. Volunteers were instructed to take the Co-dietary supplement in
      the morning according to the manufacturer's label. Blood samples were collected and analyzed
      for a number of biochemical parameters before, during, and after dosing. Hearing, vision,
      cardiac, and neurological functions were also assessed in volunteers before, during, and
      after dosing.
