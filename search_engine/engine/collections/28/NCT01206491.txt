      classes of chronic disease which will be important globally in the future. And the sixth
      class is "Chronic Rheumatic Condition", which includes rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis,
      osteoporosis, spinal disorders and severe limb trauma. Obviously the osteoporosis is a
      globally important health topic.

      Osteoporosis draws more and more attention, because osteoporosis has various influences, for
      example, (1) psychologically impact which occurs frequently in many chronic diseases, such as
      depression will appear evidently in patients with osteoporosis (2) patients with osteoporosis
      often lose their social role (3) osteoporosis might induce pain and limitation of body
      function (4) osteoporosis increases greatly the possibility of fracture. Osteoporosis will
      induce adverse outcomes, such as the fall of life quality, the increase of morbidity and
      mortality, as well as the increased abuse of medical service. In this project, we will set up
      the intervention model for prevention of osteoporosis as well as falls.

      In this project, we will recruit patients form outpatient services at WanFang Hospital.
      Through the collection of baseline data from questionnaire and bone density measurement, we
      can clarify the risk of osteoporosis and falls in studied patients. By using double-blind
      randomized design, the patients will be collected to either one of intervention and control
      group. After eight weeks of intervention programs, we will follow on both groups to
      understand the effect of this program and to increase the bone density of intervention group.
      The hospital or the Health center might take the outcome to be the reference of taking care
      the Osteoporosis.
