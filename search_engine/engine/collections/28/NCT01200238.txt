      therapeutic options. The recent discoveries of GNAQ and GNA11 mutations leading to MAPK
      pathway activation and the over-expression of c-Met generate the hypothesis that inhibition
      of hsp90 client proteins will provide clinical benefit. This study tests the feasibility and
      efficacy of hsp90 inhibition in patients with metastatic ocular melanoma. Multiple components
      of the MAPK pathway (B-Raf, C-Raf, cdk4) in addition to c-Met are client proteins of hsp90
      and dependent of active hsp90 for stability. Inhibition of hsp90 should lead to decreased
      expression of these client proteins.
