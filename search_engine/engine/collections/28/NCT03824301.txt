      into 3 groups (P: pressure controlled ventilation, V: volume controlled ventilation, C:
      control) in accordance with the mode of ventilation. Patients studied for chest x-ray, lung
      ultrasound, arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2),
      Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, static lung compliance and dynamic lung compliance, taken
      after induction of anesthesia, 1h post cardiopulmonary bypass, 1h after arrival to cardiac
      surgical unit.
