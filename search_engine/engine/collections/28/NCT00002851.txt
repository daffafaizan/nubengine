        -  Compare the effect of irradiation of the homolateral internal mammary and medial
           supraclavicular lymph node chains vs no further therapy on survival, disease-free
           survival, metastasis-free survival, and cause of death in women with resected stage
           I/II/III breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating
      institution, tumor location, type of prior breast surgery, pathologic T and N stage,
      menopausal status, and time sequence of radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive no nodal irradiation.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive irradiation of the internal mammary and medial supraclavicular
           lymph node chains delivered at 1 fraction per day, 5 sessions per week, for a total of
           25 fractions over 5 weeks. Radiotherapy must begin no later than 8 weeks after surgery.
           If adjuvant chemotherapy is given, radiotherapy begins within 6 weeks after the last
           course of chemotherapy and within 8 months after surgery.

      Patients are followed at least yearly after randomization for up to 20 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
