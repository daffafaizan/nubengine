      Older adults incur more than 90% of the disease burden, and those residing in nursing homes
      are the most affected subset given their immune senescence, multi-morbidity, and close living
      quarters. Each year, the majority of influenza-related hospitalizations occur during the
      period with the greatest influenza activity.

      Influenza vaccination has been associated with reduced hospitalization, strokes, heart
      attacks and death in non-institutional older adult populations, but the benefit of influenza
      vaccine for the oldest population has been questioned. The new high-dose influenza vaccine is
      considerably more immunogenic in older adults, and has recently been approved for use in
      individuals aged 65 years and older. No clinical data yet confirm whether the improved
      immunogenicity translates into added clinical benefit, such as further reduction in
      hospitalization or death. Estimating the benefit of influenza vaccination among older adults
      in long-term care settings using randomized controlled trials requires extensive effort and
      is costly. Instead, a pragmatic RCT in a nursing home population has several advantages as a
      model for comparing therapeutic approaches.

      This clinical trial aims to test the feasibility of our protocol for a subsequent larger
      study. We aim to demonstrate that we can recruit and enroll facilities; randomly assign and
      coordinate vaccine delivery; collect data; conduct site audits for data validation; create
      outcomes using multiple data sources; and conduct analyses.
