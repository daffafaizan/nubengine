      lead to low sperm motility and sperm count, and also recognised some microbes which may lead
      to the low sperm motility and sperm count. It is obvious that gut microbiota can influence
      the sperm quality. And the supplement of n-3 PUFA is significantly correlated with microbiome
      alpha diversity. So investigators want to collected the fecal samples from the participants,
      to ascertain whether the supplementation of n-3 PUFA can promote sperm parameters by improve
      gut microbiota ecosystem.

      The potential microbes planing to cultivate: Prevotella spp, bacteroides spp.
