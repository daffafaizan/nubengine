    
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with PledOx for
      prevention of chronic CIPN induced by oxaliplatin in patients with Stage III or high-risk
      Stage II colorectal cancer (CRC).

      Patients with CRC, who are indicated for adjuvant modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) chemotherapy
      for up to 6 months, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

        -  Arm A: PledOx (5 Âµmol/kg) + mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy

        -  Arm B: Placebo + mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy

      Before March 2nd., 2020, the investigational medicinal product (IMP; i.e. PledOx or placebo)
      was administered by an intravenous (i.v.) infusion on the first day of each chemotherapy
      cycle. IMP was not to be administered if mFOLFOX6 was not given to the patient.

      If a patient discontinues oxaliplatin, treatment with 5-FU/folinate and IMP may be continued.

      As of March 2nd., all patients have to stop IMP but may continue mFOLFOX6.
