      (TC) can positively impact major risk factors of CVD, activities thought to be related to
      their phytochemical content. However, data from human trials is less clear. TC have been
      shown to reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) after acute, short-term and chronic intake, and
      to improve vascular dysfunction, presumably due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      activities. Other studies have not shown benefits of TC on SBP or vascular function and
      studies are difficult to interpret with different populations, dosing and durations being
      used as well as a lack of understanding for any underlying mechanisms. To account for the
      latter, the use of metabolomics has become increasingly popular in nutritional research.
      Therefore, the aim of this preliminary study was to characterise the effects of TC
      supplementation on vascular function with a 4-week intervention and explore if metabolomics
      can provide mechanistic evidence and this will inform for future chronic studies with TC
      juice.
