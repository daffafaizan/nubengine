      delivery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Secondary objectives include estimating
      grade 3-5 acute toxicity (within 90 days) and describing patient-reported outcomes (PRO) of
      toxicity during and after TFRT. This study is planned as a single arm feasibility trial to
      demonstrate clinical delivery of TFRT plans. Five patients will be accrued as a single
      cohort.

      When using standard-of-care intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a single radiation
      plan is created and delivered on a daily basis Monday-Friday for a total of 7 weeks. In
      contrast, when using TFRT, up to 5 different plans are created and delivered each specific
      day of the week. Treatments will still occur on a daily basis Monday-Friday for 7 weeks. In
      each of these radiation plans used for TFRT, the radiation dose that will be delivered to the
      nearby healthy tissues will vary, allowing for increased time for normal tissue to recover
      from radiation-induced damage. Once weekly, a slightly higher radiation dose will be
      delivered to the "feathered" organ. On the remaining four days of the week, a slightly lower
      radiation dose will be delivered to the "feathered" organ. The radiation dose that will be
      delivered to the areas of cancer will not be changed. In this study, only the radiation dose
      delivered to the normal healthy tissues will be changed.
