      Surgeons.

      First series of questions are relative to age, qualification, usual surgical practice, in
      order to define different "surgical profiles".

      Second series of questions are relative to knowledge in the field of knowledge about trauma
      and massive casualties surgery.

      Third series of questions are relative to the feeling of easiness in case of various
      situations involving severe trauma and massive casualties.
