      Primary objectives are to study the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on

        -  Postprandial insulin secretion and pancreatic beta-cell function

        -  Physiological and subjective parameters related to satiety and appetite

      Secondary objectives are to study the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on

        -  Miscellaneous markers of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity

        -  Kinetics of alcohol-induced increase of adiponectin

      A tertiary objective is to study the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on

        -  Gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue in normal-weight pre menopausal women
           with normal fasting plasma glucose.

      Study design: Randomized, partially controlled, open label, cross-over study with a one week
      wash-out preceding each treatment period

      Study population: 24 apparently healthy pre menopausal Caucasian women with fasting blood
      glucose <6.1 mmol/L, aged 20 - 44 years at inclusion of the study, with a BMI of 19 - 25
      kg/m2, who use oral contraceptives will participate in the study.

      Intervention: Participants will drink daily a test substance for three weeks (2 cans of
      Amstel beer per day; 66 cL ~ 26 gram alcohol) followed by a reference substance (2 cans of
      Amstel alcohol-free beer per day; 66 cL < 0.5 gram of alcohol) for three weeks or vice versa.
      Both treatments are preceded by a one-week wash-out period in which no alcohol is consumed.
