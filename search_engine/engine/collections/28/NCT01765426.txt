    
      This is an exploratory trial to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      vaccination with a tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV) in healthy adults delivered intradermally
      using the conventional needle/syringe or a needle-free PharmaJetÂ® injector.

      Two (2) intradermal injections of either vaccine or placebo will be administered to qualified
      participants (one in each arm) on Day 0 of the study. A subsequent injection will also be
      given on Day 90 with either vaccine or placebo (in one arm only).

      Participants will be evaluated for safety and dengue neutralizing antibody to all four
      serotypes. All participants will also be evaluated for injection site reactions and have
      blood drawn for viremia, neutralizing antibodies, cell mediated immunity and innate immunity.

      Participants will be required to participate for approximately 10 months from recruitment and
      collection of data for primary outcomes (through Day 120) including collection of additional
      samples for measurement of longer term antibody titers (through Day 270).

      This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the National
      Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of
      Health and Human Services, under Contract No. HHSN272201000034C.
