      nicotinic analogue, through focused measures of potential psychological and physiological
      mediators. Varenicline is an FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation that is
      believed to provide relief from craving and withdrawal through agonism and antagonism of some
      central nervous system nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptors. However, no controlled studies
      have established the physiological and psychological processes that mediate the efficacy of
      varenicline in humans. The main goal of the proposed pilot study is to evaluate and compare
      the effects of varenicline on subjective, cognitive, and physiological outcomes, using a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind between-groups design. The study will combine
      both brief clinical trial methodology with human laboratory approaches. A secondary goal is
      to validate the utility of the laboratory paradigms for the identification of future smoking
      cessation agents.
