      protocols: (i) per os premedication only with alprazolam (BDZ group) or (ii) premedication
      with alprazolam combined with target control infusion (TCI) of propofol (BDZ+TCI) for awake
      carotid endarterectomy. A total of 50 consecutive patients with significant carotid artery
      stenosis will be enrolled into this prospective randomised study. All surgeries will be
      performed in regional anaesthesia. As premedication, all patients took 0.25 mg alprazolam 30
      minutes before the procedure. After randomization 25 patients will be grouped to both arms of
      the study: either to "sedation with target controlled propofol infusion", or to "only
      premedication". Stress markers, such as cortisol plasma levels will be serially analysed:
      prior to surgery (T1), before (T2) and after release of carotid clamp (T3), at 2 (T4) and 24
      post-operative hours (T5). Alprazolam levels were also measured before and after the surgery.
