      Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT). SAINT-induced remission is associated with significant
      reductions in the functional connectivity of the neural network underlying explicit suicidal
      cognition (between sgACC-DMN). This project aims to further elucidate the SAINT induced
      neural network changes underlying explicit suicidal cognition.
