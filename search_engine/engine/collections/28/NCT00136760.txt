      smoking treatment programs for these smokers. In this study, we are investigating whether the
      combination of bupropion (also called Zyban and Wellbutrin) and a behavioral treatment
      program (contingent vouchers) can reduce smoking in people with schizophrenia. This is a
      3-week study aimed to investigate the feasibility of this treatment approach. Participants
      are randomly assigned to bupropion (300 mg/day, in 2 divided doses) or placebo. After one
      week on medication, participants are randomly assigned to the active behavioral treatment
      (contingent vouchers) or the control treatment (non-contingent vouchers). Over a 3-week
      period, participants come to the study site about 2-3 times per week, and provide information
      about their recent smoking and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. They also give saliva and urine
      samples that are analyzed for levels of cotinine, a nicotine metabolite. Participants in the
      active behavioral treatment group receive gift cards to local grocery stores when their
      cotinine levels indicate that they have reduced their smoking. Participants in the control
      behavioral treatment group receive gift cards regardless of cotinine level. Any participant
      who significantly reduces their smoking at the end of the trial is followed up 2 and 4 weeks
      after the end of the trial too see if they have sustained these smoking reductions. If we
      have favorable results from this trial, we will expand it into a smoking treatment program.
