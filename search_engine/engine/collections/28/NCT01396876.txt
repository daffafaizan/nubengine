      increase pain tolerance. Humor can be an important intervention, able to reduce stress to
      both the child and the parent. In the last decade there has been a rapid growth in the
      presence of therapeutic clowns in hospital, particularly in pediatric settings. If
      therapeutic clowns are shown to positively affect any of the parameters being measured in
      this study, they should be included as aprt of the standard of care in the pediatric
      emergency setting.
