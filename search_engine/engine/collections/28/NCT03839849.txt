      scaling and root planing as adjunctive therapy to traditional mechanical therapy. 15
      periodontal patients will receive traditional mechanical supra and subgingival scaling and
      root planing. I-PRF will be applied subgingivally in the deep pockets in a half mouth design.
      The injected half mouth (study group) for each patient will be allocated randomly. The
      opposite side will be injected with saline (control group). Clinical parameters will be
      evaluated: plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical
      attachment level (CAL). Clinical measurements will be performed at baseline and at 8 weeks.
