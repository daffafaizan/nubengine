      or three-dimensional imaging of skeletal tissues acquired through radiography, with little
      analysis of soft tissue structures. The advantages of stereophotogrammetry surface scanning
      include easy image acquisition, the procedure is non-invasive, and images may be easily
      repeatedly taken for longitudinal evaluation of facial morphology. No radiation is used in
      acquiring these images.

      The purposes of this study are to: 1) characterize the surface tissue facial features in
      different genetic diseases and syndromes; 2) define facial parameters of age-related growth
      and development; and 3) establish the use of stereophotogrammetry surface tissue imaging in
      aiding the diagnosis of genetic conditions and prediction of the clinic course of
      craniofacial dysmorphologies and associated genotypes.

      Procedures will entail the acquisition of facial images from patients with known and
      suspected dysmorphologies as well as healthy controls. Facial parameters of various patient
      groups will be characterized in a standardized manner. In addition, composite (mean) images
      of patients with a particular diagnosis will be compared with controls using software
      algorithms. These facial parameters will be used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity
      of this technology to predict the genetic dysmorphology.
