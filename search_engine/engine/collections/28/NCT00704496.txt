      decongestant, will decrease nasal congestion leading to increased patency of the nose and a
      decrease in nighttime sleep fragmentation in individuals with year round perennial allergic
      rhinitis (PAR). This decrease in sleep fragmentation will reduce daytime somnolence and
      fatigue. We studied patients treated with placebo compared to FDA approved dose of
      pseudoephedrine and assessed sleep, QOL and daytime sleepiness.
