      to a local Tucson hospital involving activities designed to reduce 30 day post hospital
      discharge readmission rates. The organization has had a fee for service contract with this
      hospital since 2017 to provide pharmacist delivered transition of care services. The
      organization collects internal tracking outcome data as part of the contract deliverable and
      is required to report it to the hospital once per month. The investigators look to assess
      LACE+ and medication risk scores to learn if there is an association with the 30 day post
      hospital discharge readmission rate post pharmacist intervention. The outcomes will not be
      generalizable and will be reported back to the hospital client to demonstrate value added.
