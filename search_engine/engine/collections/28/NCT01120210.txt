      JNJ-39588146 or placebo (which looks like the drug being studied but has no active
      ingredients) in patients with heart failure. This study is being conducted in two parts. Part
      1 is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      physician nor patient knows the identity of the assigned drug) study of 3 intravenous doses
      of JNJ-39588146 or placebo administered in 1-hr intervals (for a total of 3 hours) in 60
      patients with heart failure. Part 2 is an extended infusion of JNJ-39588146 and placebo that
      will administer the highest tolerated dose from Part 1 for an additional 18 hours. The entire
      duration of the infusion could be as long as 21 hours. There is a 1 in 4 chance of getting
      placebo. The participation period is a maximum of 42 days, including a screening visit, a
      2-day in-clinic period and two follow-up visits. For both parts of the study, patients will
      have a cardiac catheter in place to monitor heart function. Safety evaluations, which will
      include ECG (electrocardiograph, measuring the electrical currents in the heart), vital signs
      and monitoring of side-effects will be performed. Additionally, blood and urine samples will
      be collected for evaluation. Part 1: Patients will receive an intravenous (IV) solution of
      three different doses of JNJ-39588146 or placebo administered over 1 hour periods for a total
      of 3 hours. Part 2: Patients participating in the sub study will continue receiving an IV
      solution for 18 more hours for a total of up to 21 hours of administration.
