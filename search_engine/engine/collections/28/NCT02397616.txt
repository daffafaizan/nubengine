      esophageal manometry. These patients have been tested using liquid swallows and a test meal.
      We will analyze the HRM measurements for presence of manometric signs of hiatal hernia and
      determine predictive factors for hernia presence. We will correlate hernia description versus
      presence of acid reflux, clinical complaints and HRM measurements.
