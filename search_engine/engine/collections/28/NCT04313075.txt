    
      This is a single arm, compassionate use study with 30 patients for leronlimab (PRO 140)
      combined with a treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in patients with CCR5+ mTNBC.

      Leronlimab (PRO 140) will be administered subcutaneously as weekly dose of 350 mg until
      disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC) is defined
      as one of the following single-agent chemotherapy drugs administrated according to local
      practice: eribulin, gemcitabine, capecitabine, paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, vinorelbine,
      ixabepilone, or carboplatin. The selected treatment should be administered as per the dosing
      schedule included on the package insert.

      In this study, patients will be evaluated for tumor response approximately every 3 months or
      according to institution's standard practice by CT, PET/CT or MRI with contrast (per treating
      investigator's discretion) using the same method as at baseline. Tumor measurements will be
      done using RECIST v1.1.
