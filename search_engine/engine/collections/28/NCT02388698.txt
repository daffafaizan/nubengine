      survival of women with locally advanced cervical cancer to 58%, there is much room for
      improvement. Post-therapy FDG-PET at 3 months can help predict progression-free and overall
      survival. Tumors continually shed their DNA into the circulation, where it can be accessed to
      measure disease burden. Cervical cancer is caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV); plasma HPV
      DNA could be used to monitor response and detect recurrence early. While plasma HPV DNA has
      been shown to correlate with prognosis and predict recurrence in other cancers, there is
      limited data in locally advanced cervical cancer.

      This prospective multi-institutional study will recruit 20 patients with locally advanced
      cervical cancer to determine if plasma HPV DNA predates clinical recurrence and/or improves
      the accuracy response on post-therapy FDG-PET scan at 3 months. Patients will undergo
      phlebotomy at the following time-points for the measurement of circulating HPV DNA levels: a)
      baseline; b) end of radiotherapy;c) 3 months post completion of chemoradiation, along with
      3-month FDG-PET and d) at recurrence. This study will provide preliminary estimates of the
      correlation between plasma HPV DNA level, PET finding and clinical outcome, and inform sample
      size calculation for a larger study. If proven useful in the future, plasma HPV DNA could
      enable the identification of patients at high risk of recurrence and individualized
      treatment.
