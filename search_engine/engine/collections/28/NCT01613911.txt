      activity are invited to participate in this study. While the electrodes are in place,
      patients are asked to view several scenarios on a laptop computer. During these scenarios,
      for example, patients are asked to click a mouse button if they see the same picture twice in
      a row or to remember a film clip of a scooter ride. Trigger points in the computer scenarios
      are recorded on a separate channel alongside the brain-wave activity to allow correlation
      between the brain activity and the task requested in the scenario. Using this technique,
      researchers can determine what areas of the brain were active during recognition or recall
      activities.
