      factors for the onset and recurrence of depressive episodes. Accumulating evidence suggests
      that the tendency to ruminate is linked to impairments in cognitive control functions,
      especially to problems discarding no longer relevant negative material from working memory
      (=working memory updating).

      The aim of the present study is to examine whether training to update emotional material in
      working memory will have an effect on the frequency of using rumination as well as on the
      impact of rumination on mood in the daily lives of clinically depressed participants.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 10 sessions of either online cognitive control
      training or an online placebo condition. The ability to update emotional material in working
      memory will be assessed pre and post training by two computer tasks (close and far transfer
      tasks). The effects of the training on daily rumination and the dynamics between daily mood
      and rumination will be assessed pre- and post-training, as well as at 3-months follow-up
      using ambulatory assessment (via smartphone app). It is expected that individuals in the
      training as compared to the placebo group will show a greater reduction in rumination
      frequency as well as a reduction in the negative impact of rumination on mood.
