    
      The Nutritional Research Foundation, in conjunction with Northern Arizona University, is
      conducting a long-term health study for women ages 18 and older. This study will address the
      effects of a nutrient dense, plant-rich diet on the long-term risks of cancer and other
      chronic diseases.

      Participants enroll in a 30-day training module which outlines the benefits of a
      nutrient-dense, plant-rich diet. At the conclusion of those videos and written modules, they
      take a short quiz to assess their knowledge and they can enroll in the full study.

      All participation is online with ongoing modules on nutrition and lifestyle. There is a
      comprehensive health history and lifestyle index to be completed. Nutrition questionnaires
      will be administered an average of every 3-6 months; PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) &
      PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) questionnaires an average of every 12 months; serum
      cardiometabolic measures and liquid biopsies an average of every 18 months.
