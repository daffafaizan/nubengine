      annual treatment, and a single treatment. Each treatment consisted of a single dose of oral
      azithromycin to the entire population over the age of 1 year (when the study was started,
      azithromycin had not yet been approved for ages below 1 year). We assess the prevalence the
      ocular chlamydia that causes trachoma in the peak prevalence age of 1-5 years at baseline,
      and 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post treatment. An extension of the study monitors infection
      at 30 and 36 months post treatment. Untreated villages from the same area are enrolled in a
      step-wedge design to assess the presence of a secular trend. A random sample of those not
      within the 1-5 year old age group are examined to assess the prevalence of infection in the
      entire community.
