      identify and characterize a large cohort of people who are interested in, and may be eligible
      to participate in, current and future preclinical Alzheimer's disease research studies and
      clinical trials based on their genetic background, and (2) provide information to these
      individuals about research studies for which they may be eligible, based in part on their
      genetic background. Cognitively unimpaired individuals age 55 to 75, inclusive, are eligible
      to enroll in GeneMatch. GeneMatch will provide participants with a genetic sample kit (a
      cheek swab) to test for a specific gene called apolipoproteins E (APOE). GeneMatch does not
      disclose the results of the APOE test to participants. GeneMatch may use the APOE test
      results to match participants to research studies. Participants are under no obligation to
      pursue these study opportunities.
