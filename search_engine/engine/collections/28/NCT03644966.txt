      addition to standard of care in changing sensitivity patterns of MDR bacteria causing
      recurrent UTI, (2) analyze the genetic composition of MDR bacterial isolates causing
      recurrent UTI before and after administration of probiotic vs. placebo, with standard of care
      antibiotics.

      Study subjects will be asked to take a either a probiotic supplement or placebo at a dose of
      1 caplet per day for 24 weeks in addition to antibiotic regimen. Subjects will be followed
      for 12 months. The outcome measure is the percent of probiotic ingestors vs placebo ingestors
      who experience a change in antibiotic susceptibility over this time period. The secondary
      outcome measure is the evaluation of genetic composition of bacteria recurring after
      probiotic vs. placebo administration.
