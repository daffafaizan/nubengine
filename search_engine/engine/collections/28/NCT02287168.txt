      in patients with gastric cancer. Spreading of these cells occur by three routes: direct
      seeding via infiltration through gastric wall, via blood vessels and via perigastric
      lymphatic channels disturbed during lymph node dissection. Conversion of negative
      preoperative peritoneal cytology to positive cytology after curative gastrectomy has been
      shown by previous studies.

      Although extensive intra-operative peritoneal lavage (1 L of physiologic saline 10 times) has
      been shown to be an effective method to eliminate cancer cell dissemination during surgery,
      to cause significant improvement in survival after gastrectomy, widespread use of this
      approach has not existed most probably due to its time consuming technical difficulty.
      Therefore,intra-operative peritoneal lavage (1 L of physiologic saline 3 times) may be used
      more frequently during gastric surgery.If it is possible to show effectivity of
      intra-operative peritoneal lavage using a total of 3 L physiologic saline to eliminate cancer
      cell dissemination occurred before or after gastric surgery, use of this approach may gain
      acceptance to decrease risk of peritoneal metastasis.
