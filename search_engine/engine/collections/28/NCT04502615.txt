      and kinetics at the knee joint when performing a single leg jump landing task (dominant leg),
      comparing sand with a firm surface and pliable grass control. 2) To investigate the sEMG
      activity of the hamstring, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles of the dominant leg during
      the jump landing task on these different surfaces (from take off through to terminal knee
      flexion at the end of the landing phase).
