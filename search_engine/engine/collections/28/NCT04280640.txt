      with liver and/or lung metastases who will receive systemic treatments. The CTCs will be
      cultured and given the same treatment as the patient received. The main goals of this project
      are 1) to assess CTC cultures' treatment response and compare the in vitro response to the
      clinical response, and 2) determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
      (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTC cultures' response in predicting clinical
      response including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and
      progressive disease (PD).
