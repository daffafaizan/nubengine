      randomized controlled trial consisted of 70 patients who applied to the emergency department
      with a migraine attack and met the study criteria. Data were collected via Patient
      Information Form, 24-Hour Migraine Quality of Life Scale, Visual Analogue Scale,
      Sphygmomanometer, and Pulse oximeter. Along with the medical treatment, patients of
      experimental group were massaged for 15 minutes with an aromatic oil mixture (lavender and
      peppermint) applied on the temple and root of the neck, and this application continued for
      three weeks. Control group patients, however, received only medical treatment. Descriptive
      statistics methods, Shapiro Wilks test, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, Mann Whitney U Test,
      Kruskal Wallis Test, Fisher's Exact Test and Chi-Square Test were used for data evaluation.
