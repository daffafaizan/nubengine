      the absence of clinically hormonal pituitary secretion. These adenomas are typically not
      diagnosed until they become very large and cause compressive neurologic symptons (e.g. visual
      impairment or cranial nerve palsy). Most of them are able to synthesized gonadotropins but
      not secreted it.

      Transsphenoidal surgical resection is the first-choice therapy in NFPA. However, complete
      removal is difficult and tumor rest is very common. In these cases, the pragmatic use of
      radiotherapy is effective to reduce residual tumor growth or recurrence, but it is related
      with severe side effects. Another possibility is the clinical observation, or wait-to-see
      approach, but it is associated with tumor progression: 40% in 5-10 years. The efficacy of
      some medical treatment are not defined yet.

      Since the identification of dopaminergic and somatostatinergic receptors in NFPA, the
      pharmacological treatment of the NFPA has been considered as a possibility for treatment. To
      date, clinical use of dopamine agonist (DA) in NFPA patients has been evaluated in some
      studies. However, these studies present modest and inconclusive results and the DA role in
      the NPFA management remains undefined.

      In this study, the investigators plan a clinical trial designed to investigate the efficacy
      of cabergoline in NFPA individuals with remaining tumor after primary neurosurgery. These
      results could help to define the efficacy of DA in NFPA management.
