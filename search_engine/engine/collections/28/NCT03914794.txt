    
      It is a single-arm phase 2 window of opportunity study to assess the antineoplastic activity
      of pemigatinib in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients with recurrent tumors
      and a prior history of low- or intermediate-risk NMIBC tumors. Enrolled patients will receive
      pemigatinib for 4-6 weeks prior to standard of care transurethral resection of bladder tumor
      (TURBT). The primary endpoint will be complete response rate as determined at TURBT.
      Secondary endpoints will include safety profile, associations between complete response rate
      and tumor mutation/fusion status (e.g. FGFR3 specifically, others will also be examined) and
      NMIBC risk group (low- vs. intermediate-risk), and assessment of pemigatinib post-treatment
      urothelial tissue concentrations. The study will be conducted at 4-5 high volume bladder
      cancer institutions within the US and managed through the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel
      Comprehensive Cancer Center clinical research office.
