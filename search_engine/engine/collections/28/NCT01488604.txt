    
      This is an investigation in healthy subjects with early signs of common cold. Subjects will
      be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Polymeric Nasal Spray or a matching
      placebo nasal spray.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility and randomized to treatment at the Screening/
      Randomization Visit (Day 1). Subjects will apply the first dose of the nasal spray at this
      visit under supervision. The other applications will take place at home on Day 1. On Days 2
      through 7, subjects will use their assigned nasal spray as 2 sprays per nostril, 4 times per
      day.

      One Follow up Visit will be conducted within 3 days of the last application of nasal spray.

      Enrollment will continue until 200 subjects have completed the investigation (100 per
      treatment group). The subject and the investigative staff will be blinded to the assigned
      nasal spray.

      Efficacy will be measured, and recorded in the subject's diary, and safety will be assessed
      by reported AEs and ADEs.
