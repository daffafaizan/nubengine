      with the motivating aspect or attractiveness of exercise and therefore the choice to exercise
      rather than be sedentary. They propose to study the association of the genomic signatures
      with the reinforcing (motivating) value of different types of exercise. This has never been
      investigated and may uncover underlying mechanisms that would help to understand individual
      differences in exercise motivation. The ultimate impact of this work is a greater number of
      Americans being physically active, meeting the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
      dietary guidelines for physical activity, and maintaining a healthy body weight. This study
      will be funded and undertaken at the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center (GFHNRC).
      The purpose will be to assess genetic underpinnings of the motivating value of resistance and
      aerobic exercise, and to determine whether the motivating value of aerobic and resistance
      exercise are associated with usual participation in these modes of exercise.
