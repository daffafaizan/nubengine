    
      Elderly patients visiting the congestive heart failure clinic at Meir Medical Center will be
      assessed for frailty twice. Once in an "eyeball" test by their cardiologist at the clinic,
      and a second time in an objective test based on fried and Edmonton frailty scores.

      The second subjective assessment will be made by geriatric and internal medicine physicians,
      and the cardiologist won't be aware of the results of the objective assessment.

      The results of both tests will be compared.
