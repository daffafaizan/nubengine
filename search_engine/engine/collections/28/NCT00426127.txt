      docetaxel and liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy combined with enoxaparin in patients with
      advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Docetaxel (TAXOTERE) belongs to the group of anticancer drugs called mitotic inhibitors.
      Liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) is an anthracycline, and is thought to prevent nucleic acid
      synthesis that is needed to make DNA. Enoxaparin (Lovenox) is an anticoagulant. We are
      interested in combining chemotherapy with the blood thinner enoxaparin because there is a
      scientific link between blood clotting and malignancy.

      This research is being done to improve on currently available chemotherapy treatments for
      advanced pancreatic cancer. The main goal of the study is to find out if this combination
      chemotherapy and enoxaparin increases the number of individuals whose tumors shrink. Another
      purpose of this study is to find out how this study treatment effects blood clotting levels
      in individuals. We will also determine the incidence of elevated D-dimer and the effect of
      this regimen on the level of D-dimer, and collect safety data on this regimen.
