      to interruption of flow as occurs during carotid surgery, or due to inadequate arterial
      pressure which can occur in settings as diverse as heart surgery or shoulder surgery. This is
      a prospective observational study of brain oxygen levels, brain metabolism and blood pressure
      in 40 adult surgical patients under general anesthesia using a CPOM Optical neuromonitor.

      This is an observational study. The primary objective of this study is to describe the
      changes in redox state of brain CCO (reflecting oxidative metabolism), CBFi, and brain tissue
      oxygen saturation in relation to systemic blood pressure in patients during the transition
      from the awake state to general anesthesia. This study represents the first opportunity to
      assess this combined technology in adult patients and will provide important pilot data to
      support further investigations in brain-at-risk patients.

      These 40 patients will be used to help the investigators to obtain pilot data about the
      relationship between brain cytochrome C oxidase (bCCO), cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2),
      and blood pressure using a CPOM device. No intervention will be applied.
