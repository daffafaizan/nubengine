      small molecule core and targets an extracellular region of PSMA with high affinity. Although
      comparable to other inhibitors in terms of affinity for PSMA, this unique class of
      phosphoramidate agents are the only known irreversible PSMA inhibitors. Due to its
      irreversible binding to PSMA and rapid uptake by PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells,
      accumulation at the cancer target is expected to be rapid, specific and sensitive.

      Twenty patients will be enrolled in parallel in two cohorts:

        -  (Cohort A) Patients with prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy (N = 5).

        -  (Cohort B) Patients with evidence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (N
           = 15)

      Participants receive a single intravenous (IV) dose (370 MBq, or 10 mCi) of CTT1057 in this
      first-in-human trial. Combined PET/MR imaging (prostate + whole body) will be performed
      following tracer injection. The 5 patients in the pre-prostatectomy cohort will comprise the
      dosimetry/pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort to establish organ dosimetry and PK profile. Patients
      in cohort A will undergo planned radical prostatectomy (plus lymph node dissection) within 12
      weeks following CTT1057 PET/MR. Patients in cohort B (metastatic prostate cancer) will have
      the option for metastatic tumor biopsy following CTT1057 PET imaging.

      The one-time nominal injected dose will be 370 MBq (10 mCi). Estimated mass dose is 20 Âµg of
      CTT1057. Dose will be in a volume of 3 - 5 mL, and will be injected intravenously as a bolus
      injection.

      Vital signs, adverse event assessment, and 12 lead ECGs will be performed on day 1 before and
      after dosing.
