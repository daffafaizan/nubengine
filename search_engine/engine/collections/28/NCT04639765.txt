      questionnaire and provided the opportunity to consent to participate. Upon entry to the
      study, eligible participants will complete several questionnaires pre- and
      post-randomization. Randomization will be to view either a video detailing a type of
      depression treatment (cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medication, or the
      combination of both treatments) with and without an emphasis on personalization. A no video
      condition is also included.
