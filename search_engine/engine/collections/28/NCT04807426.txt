      nervous system due to vascular causes, which includes cerebral infarction, intracranial
      hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.Stroke is categorized as ischemic stroke (85%) and
      hemorrhage stroke (20%). Hemorrhagic stroke is further classified as interacerebral
      hemorrhage (15%) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (5%). Transient Ischemic attack (TIA) is a
      temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain and its symptoms resolves within 24 hours of
      the injury. Stroke is currently the second leading cause of death worldwide and is one of the
      leading causes of long-term disability in the United States. Almost 15 million stroke cases
      occur each year worldwide, resulting in 5 million deaths and leaving about 5 million stroke
      survivors with unchangeable abnormality and dependency.According to world health organization
      (WHO) in 2002 approximately 5.5 million people died due to stroke and 20% of these deaths
      occurred in south Asia .In Pakistan stroke cases reported are estimated to be 3,50,000
      annually.Stroke survivors experience damaged upper limb function which also affects their
      activites of daily living. A large number of them is left with impaired upper extremity
      function, even after completion of conventional rehabilitation programmes.Only 5-20 % of
      patients regain Upper extremity functional status.Along with motor impairments somatosensory
      impairments are also assosoiated with severity of stroke but is overlooked most of the times.
      Sensory impairment decreases the ability to discriminate textures, weights ,shapes and
      sizes.Proprioception and stereognosis were found to be more impaired than tatile sensation
      ,7-53 % had impaired tactile sensations ,31-89% impaied sterognosis and 34-64 % impaired
      proprioception.Mostly, the focus is on motor recovery in paretic limb but the studies showed
      that improvement in sensory functions also leads to motor recovery. By only focusing on motor
      performance without sensory dysfunction assessment, maximum outcomes cannot be achieved.Not
      only Sensory dysfunction but Cognitive issues after stroke such as ,decreased perception and
      attention ,memory deficits ,difficulty in problem solving tend to be disregarded which
      eventually effects patient performance of daily activities.Multisensory stimulation exercises
      also known as neurocognitive therapeutic exercises, cognitive exercise therapy or cognitive
      sensory motor training was proposed by Carlo Perfetti of Italy .The Hallmark of this training
      is that it focuses on sensory retraining along with emphasis on joint position perception. It
      considers recovery as a learning process, the movement as a means to know and the body as a
      surface receptor for information.Laia Salles et.al conducted a randomized controlled pilot
      study to compare the effectiveness of the cognitive exercise therapy with conventional
      treatment protocol on upper limb in sub-acute stroke patients. The result showed favourable
      clinical progression regarding upper extremity functional gain.Sunghee Lee et.al did a study
      on effect of the cognitive exercise therapy on chronic stroke patients upper limb function,
      activities of daily living and quality of life .They compared it with Task oriented exercise
      group. There was significant difference between two groups and application of cognitive
      exercise therapy was found more effective for functional recovery in stroke patients.A study
      compared the effectiveness of cognitive sensory motor training therapy with conventional
      therapy on recovery of arm function in acute stroke patients. There were no significant
      differences found between two groups in acute stroke patients. The studies based on
      Multisensory stimulation exercises of perfetti focused on evaluating motor function of upper
      limb ,activities of daily living and quality of life but cognitive elements such as attention
      and memory also activated in discriminatory tasks and were not evaluated. The past records
      shows that in randomized controlled trials Multi sensory stimulation therapy is used alone
      for the experimental group .Combination of two protocols has not been analyzed yet .So, the
      aim of the study is to observe and determine the combine effect of Task Oriented Exercises
      and Multisensory stimulation exercises on upper limb function , Activities of daily living
      and Cognition .It is expected that the combination of these two approaches will give more
      significant results in improving sub-acute and chronic stroke patients condition.
