      to use a pre-transplant immunization tool while their child awaits transplant. The tool will
      provide information about vaccines, information about vaccine-preventable infections in the
      transplant population, a central easily accessible vaccine record, and a communication
      portal. The tool will also send vaccine reminders when vaccinations are due. The
      investigators will assess 1) the effectiveness of the tool in improving pre-transplant
      immunization rates, 2) the acceptability of the tool to users and 3) the feasibility of the
      tool.
