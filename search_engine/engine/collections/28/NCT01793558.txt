      mother during caesarian section. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether newborns during
      cesarean section are endangered to get hypothermic while bonding on the mothers chest. The
      investigators want to investigate the effects of active cutaneous warming of the mothers and
      babies during a 20 min intraoperative bonding period. The investigators plan to enroll 40
      parturients scheduled for elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia to receive
      passive insulation or forced-air skin surface warming. The investigators will measure core
      temperature of the newborns and their mothers. The investigators hypothesize that newborns
      became most often hypothermic without active warming during the bonding procedure and that
      active warming will be able to decrease the number of hypothermic newborns significantly.
