      connection to the SMART platform. In-person training on tablet use and the online SMART
      platform will be provided for participants. A 'quick startup' guide will be affixed to the
      back of the tablet. Participants will be asked to complete one education module per week at
      their own convenience over the 10-week intervention period. The educational modules include
      psychological adaptation, residual limb management, nutrition/weight control, managing a
      prosthetic limb, managing chronic conditions and enhancing mobility. The modules include
      instructional movies, goal setting logs, and quizzes. A module can be stopped or "re-wound"
      at any point, and the participant's place and work-to-date is automatically saved. The SMART
      platform will be asynchronously monitored through a web portal by the trainer, who will be a
      PhD candidate in Rehabilitation Sciences and observe participant progress and provide
      feedback if required. If there is no online activity within a 7-day (consecutive) period, the
      trainer will contact the participant to inquire the reasons for inactivity and troubleshoot
      any problems including technical issues.

      Clinical outcomes measures will be collected at three timepoints (T1-T3).
