      indicated use of maternal oxygen in the first and second stages of labor in the setting of a
      category 2 fetal heart rate tracing (FHR) tracing, as defined by American Congress of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
      (NICHD) guidelines. All patients who are at term and are undergoing labor at Memorial Hermann
      Hospital in Houston, Texas during the time frame of the study will be included in the study.
      The study will be conducted over 18 weeks. It will involve two 8 week time periods during
      which all patients will under either a strategy of liberal administration of oxygen use
      (current practice) in the "before" portion of the study and indicated administration of
      oxygen in the "after" portion of the study (new practice). There will be a transition period
      where training, education, and audit + feedback will be done to prepare for a strategy of
      indicated administration of oxygen.
