      recruit 100-120 patients with ATSUD in three years and allocate them to add-on low dose
      dextromethorphan and memantine (DM 30mg/day+MM 5mg/day) or placebo group in a 1: 1 ratio
      (patients will also undergo usual psychosocial interventions). We will follow up the
      participants for 12 weeks and measure the treatment responses, urine drug tests, craving
      scales and side effects to evaluate the therapeutic effects of add-on DM+MM.
      Neuropsychological assessments and tests for inflammatory parameters and neurotrophic factors
      will also be measured during 12-weeks follow up. The study results will show that whether
      add-on DM+MM is able to improve the treatment outcomes for ATSUD, and be associated with
      improvement in inflammatory markers, neurotrophic factors and neuropsychological tests.
