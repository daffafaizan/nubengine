      distress symptoms (depression and/or anxiety). Apart from the adverse effects on the woman
      herself, pregnancy distress negatively affects pregnancy outcome, infant health, postpartum
      mother-child interaction and child development.

      Mindfulness-based interventions are a type of intervention that is increasingly being used to
      treat symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. They are cheap and accessible to the whole
      population.

      Current study aims to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness training to reduce distress
      during pregnancy. Women who score above cut off on the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and
      Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale (TPDS) at 12 weeks of gestation, will be randomly allocated
      to the intervention or control group. Women in the intervention group will be contacted and
      invited to participate in the mindfulness-based intervention, which consists of 8 weeks of
      internet mindfulness training. The control group will receive care as usual.

      The primary outcome of the study is: Does the mindfulness internet training "Ontspannen
      zwanger", offered during pregnancy, reduce pregnancy distress, compared to care as usual? The
      secondary outcome is: Does the mindfulness internet training result in better mindfulness
      skills?
