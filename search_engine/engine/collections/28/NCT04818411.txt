      delivery pattern and changing lifestyle. Medication with synthetic drugs not only has been
      unable to effectively curtail the spread of this disease conditions but also is most of the
      times linked with co-occurring side-effects. The exercise and manual therapy-based approach
      could lead in reducing the functional limitations and morbidity rate in females with the
      postpartum pain. This research could also help in spreading the awareness globally, to
      Prenatal and Postnatal Hospital Caregivers.
