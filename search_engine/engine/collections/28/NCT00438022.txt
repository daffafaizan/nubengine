      is caused by irritants in the environment and that symptoms of EH become worse with stress
      and changes in hormone levels. This study will examine skin cells collected from study
      participants to determine the risk factors for EH that are present in people with AD who
      develop EH.

      This study will examine dendritic cells (DC) from the skin and blood of study participants to
      determine the differences between DCs of study participants. This study will recruit four
      types of participants:

        -  Group 1 will include participants with AD, EH, and recurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV)

        -  Group 2 will include participants with AD and recurring HSV infections but without EH

        -  Group 3 will include participants with AD but without EH or HSV infection

        -  Group 4 will include participants in good general health without AD, EH, or HSV
           infection

      At the single study visit, skin and blood collection will occur.
