      to have an acceptable safety profile for clinical applications. We aimed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of MSC transplantation in active progressive MS and investigate possible
      neuroprotective effects.

      Methods: This single-center double-blind crossover trial enrolled 48 patients with
      progressive MS (expanded disability status scale (EDSS) range: 3.5-6.5, mean: 5.6+/-0.8).
      Patients were randomised into three groups and treated intrathecally (IT) or intravenously
      (IV) with autologous MSCs (1x106/Kg) or placebo. At 6-months, treatment groups were crossed
      over and patients re-treated with either MSC or placebo. During the 2-months run-in period
      and the 12-months after treatment, participants were followed using EDSS, 25-foot timed
      walking, 9-hole peg test, neurocognitive tests, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), functional MRI, optic coherence tomography (OCT), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and
      dynamic visual tests.
