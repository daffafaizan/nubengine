      and to accept or reject the hypothesis. In addition, the researcher will conduct supplemental
      interviews with patients who have lived with the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
      device for at least six months and who are not in the intervention. The qualitative data
      gathered from these interviews will document concepts of illness and healing and general
      beliefs about mind-body interventions.
