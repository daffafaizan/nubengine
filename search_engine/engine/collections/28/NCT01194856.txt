      weeks in HIV+ patients with clinical lipoatrophy. From a virologic standpoint, EFV and ATV/r
      are medications which are recommended equally as preferred components of antiretroviral
      regimens in the December 2009 version of the Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents
      in HIV-1 Infected Adults and Adolescents.[20] The study subjects should be receiving a stable
      EFV-containing antiretroviral (ART) regimen for at least 48 weeks prior to study entry. Blood
      will be saved for further investigations if needed. Safety parameters will be regularly
      assessed throughout the study. In addition, a subcutaneous fat biopsy will be obtained to
      measure fat mtDNA, mtRNA, and fat apoptosis. These measurements would provide significant
      insight into the clinical changes which have been recently described.
