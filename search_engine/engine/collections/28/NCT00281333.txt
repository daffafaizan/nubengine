      increasing bleeding episodes. Although recent literature has shown that with routine muscle
      strengthening and physical activity, the frequency and duration of bleeds was reduced. Our
      study has built a routine of strength training exercises and karate training. The study is
      built in two stages, each stage being three months. The participants fill out a bleeding
      diary that includes information from the previous six months. It includes place of bleed,
      duration, pain level, spontaneous or traumatic bleed, factor replacement and joint
      limitation. Before the exercise, the participants are tested for muscle strength and
      endurance. The bleeding diary will be filled out following the first three months and the
      second phase as will the muscle strength and endurance. We are hoping to see a drastic
      reduction of bleeding episodes occurring especially from spontaneous bleeds.
