      in this observational study. Participants will remain under the care of their usual
      physicians. Questionnaires will be completed and tests will be conducted that will provide
      information about aspects of kidney and heart health status.

      Participants who reconsent to this phase will return to the center for a more extensive
      visit. At the Clinic Visit the following will occur:

        -  weight is measured

        -  blood pressure and heart rate are recorded

        -  information about medical history and medication used recently

        -  blood draw (about Â½ cup) for the following tests: CBC (Complete Blood Count), tests of
           metabolism, and several other heart and kidney tests

        -  blood pressure in the leg and arm calculated as the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)

        -  urine sample collection for kidney function testing

        -  complete questionnaires about quality of life, diet, mood, thought processes and
           physical activity

      This visit takes about 1 to 2 hours. Participants will be contacted by telephone six months
      after the Baseline Visit to ask about recent medical events and medications.

      Participants will be asked to return to the center for annual visits during which many but
      not all of the procedures described above will be conducted.

      Additionally, up to 1500 CRIC participants will be asked to participate in one of two
      substudies using remote data collection techniques to identify trajectories of kidney
      function and cardiovascular risk sub-phenotypes.
