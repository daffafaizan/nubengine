      The participant will have blood taken and this will be analysed for baseline levels of
      nitrate, nitrite and nitroso species. They will then have a baseline MRI to assess coronary
      flow in normoxia. Next, hypoxia will be induced using 12% oxygen/88% nitrogen. The
      participant will then have a baseline MRI to assess coronary flow in hypoxia (3 breath-hold
      image captures).

      After all baseline images have been captured, the investigators will commence an intravenous
      nitrite sodium infusion, dose 70μmol, of 5 minute duration (14μmol /min-1). At the 5th
      minute, the participant have a further MRI image to assess coronary flow with the
      intervention in normoxia (3 breath-hold image captures).

      A 10-minute washout will follow (with the half-life of nitrite being documented as 110
      seconds). There will be optional repeat 3 breath-hold image captures at 5 minutes and at 10
      minutes.

      Next hypoxia will be induced using 12% oxygen/88% nitrogen again. The investigators will
      commence a second intravenous nitrite sodium infusion, dose 70μmol, 5 minute duration (14μmol
      /min-1). At the 5th minute, the participant will have a further MRI image to assess coronary
      flow with the intervention in hypoxia (3 breath-hold image captures).

      At the end of the study the participant will have blood taken and this will be analysed for
      repeat levels of nitrate, nitrite and nitroso species.

      All interventions will be performed by fully trained and competent medical staff.
