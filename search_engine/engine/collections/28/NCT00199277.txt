      pre-operative period by a decrease of iron intake and the bleeding in the site of neoplasm.

      In the postoperative period, iron deficiency can be aggravated by surgical bleeding.

      Iron plays a leading rol in haemoglobin production, cell mitosis and immune system. Animal
      experimentation has shown that induced iron deficiency and mild anemia lead to postoperative
      mortality and lactacidemia in a model of peritonitis.

      Moreover, anemia is the main risk factor to require intra and postoperative blood
      transfusions, and iron deficiency and anemia are associated to a larger number of
      postoperative complications (infections and longer hospital stay).

      Oral iron therapy is the standard treatment in patients with preoperative iron deficiency,
      but iron levels inside red cells may not reach normality in time before surgery, and it can
      not be resumed until the patient can start again oral feeding.

      In these patients, any increase in preoperative haemoglobin decreases the risk to need a
      blood transfusion during or after surgery.

      This trial will compare standard oral iron and intravenous iron.
