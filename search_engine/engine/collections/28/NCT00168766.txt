      be randomized to receive Avonex alone or Avonex plus methylprednisolone (MP). Patients will
      receive MP as 500 mg po for 3 days every month or matching placebo. The patients are followed
      on a 3-monthly basis for 4 years with disability as the primary parameter of efficacy over
      that time.
