      plus talimogene laherparepvec compared to CRT alone in previously untreated patients with
      locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) for which surgical
      resection is not clinical indicated. The efficacy endpoints of the study aim to demonstrate
      overall clinical benefit for patients treated with talimogene laherparepvec as compared to
      CRT alone.
