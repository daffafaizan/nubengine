      debated for many years. It has been reported that fewer bacteria adhere to monofilament
      polypropylene than braided polyester sutures in vitro but the results are opposed by a
      non-randomized clinical study where the use of monofilament sutures was identified as an
      independent risk factor for leg wound infections after CABG.
