      is much data about risk factors for severe outcome in the general population, there is less
      focus on younger group of patients. Therefore, we aimed to detect simple prognostic factors
      for severe morbidity and mortality in young patients with CAP.

      Patients 60 years old or younger, who were diagnosed with CAP (defined as Pneumonia
      identified 48 hours or less from hospitalization) between March 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008
      were retrospectively analyzed for risk factors for severe morbidity or mortality.

      Complicated hospitalization was defined as at least one of the following parameters:
      hospitalization longer than ten days, admission to intensive care unit and in- hospital
      mortality. Otherwise, the hospitalization was defined uncomplicated
