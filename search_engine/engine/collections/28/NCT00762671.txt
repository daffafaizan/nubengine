      Endothelial dysfunction is an important, if not primary, factor in atherogenesis. Nitric
      oxide is an important substance made and released by the endothelium. Many prior studies in
      animals and humans have shown that the ability of the blood vessel to dilate is impaired in
      diabetes. This process of vasodilation is mediated by a substance, nitric oxide, which is
      thought to be highly susceptible to destruction by oxidant molecules. In previous studies, we
      found that acute administration of the antioxidant, vitamin C, improves endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation in blood vessels of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This suggests that
      by scavenging oxidants, such as superoxide, vitamin C may reduce the destruction of nitric
      oxide and thereby preserve endothelial function. Additional mechanisms, including activation
      of a substance called protein kinase C, and oxidant stress from excess soluble peroxides may
      be present in diabetes and interact with oxidant stress to cause endothelial dysfunction in
      patients with diabetes. Accordingly, we would like to study both of these mechanisms to
      determine their contribution to endothelial dysfunction.
