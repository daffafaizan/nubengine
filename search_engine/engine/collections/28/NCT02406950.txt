      by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). In addition to its attractive merit in type 2
      diabetes, interest in the cardioprotective effects of GLP-1 has been increased with various
      reports and evidence. Previously, the investigators could show exenatide, GLP-1 receptor
      agonist protects ischemic/reperfusion injury-induced endothelial dysfunction through opening
      of KATP (ATP-sensitive potassium) channels in human ischemic/reperfusion injury model. But,
      recent clinical studies showed 2 different DPP-4 inhibitors, alogliptin and saxagliptin, did
      not decrease major adverse cardiovascular events even though improving glycemic control. The
      investigators will investigate the role of sitagliptin in human ischemic/reperfusion (IR)
      injury model of forearm conductance vessels as previous described method.
