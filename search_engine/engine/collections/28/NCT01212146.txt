      different gastrointestinal symptoms.Different therapeutic strategies have been proposed, but
      a new therapeutic approach for constipation could be based on the modulation of intestinal
      microflora by administering prebiotics and/or probiotics. Currently, probiotic products are
      mainly incorporated in fermented milk-based products or concentrated probiotic preparations.
      To enlarge the range of choice and to exploit the nutritional qualities of plant matrices, an
      innovative line of probiotic vegetable products such as artichokes has been developed. The
      use of these vegetables containing live probiotic strains can take advantage of some their
      peculiar features for growth and improved bacterial survival. Artichokes can, therefore, work
      as valid "active" vehicles for the transport and release of adequate amounts of bacterial
      populations.
