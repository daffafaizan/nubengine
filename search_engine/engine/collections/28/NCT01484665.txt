      PSA screening decision-aid (DA) administered in an urban primary care clinic populated with a
      significant number of African-Americans. All subjects will complete a survey assessing their
      knowledge and attitudes about PSA screening and shared decision making (SDM), and physicians
      will also be briefly queried about their perceptions of the SDM process.

      After the first three month implementation period we will conduct focus groups with clinic
      staff to guide changes and refinements to the use of DA in the clinical setting. Another
      three month implementation period will follow using the same methods to assess outcomes.
      Finally we will conduct another round of focus groups to assess the overall impact of the
      interventions.
