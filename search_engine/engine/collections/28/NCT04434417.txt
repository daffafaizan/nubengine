      method to be used in clinical settings to timely inform and refine strategies that can
      prevent, control, and stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test
      Cassette (Whole Blood/Serum/Plasma) is a qualitative, membrane-based immunoassay for the
      detection of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2in
      whole blood, serum or plasma specimen. This test consists of two components, an IgG component
      and an IgM component. In the IgG component, anti-human IgG is coated in IgG test line region.
      During testing, the specimen reacts with 2019-nCoV antigen-coated particles in the test
      cassette. The mixture then migrates upward on the membrane chromatographically by capillary
      action and reacts with the anti-human IgG in IgG test line region, if the specimen contains
      IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study aims to validate in a real life study a self
      diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 with the advantages of high speed, simple operation and low
      cost, and overcomes the shortcomings of the existing molecular detection methods. Clinical
      specimens from patients who were suspected of being infected with 2019-nCoV will be used to
      evaluate the performance of the assay. In parallel, we will also use molecular assays for the
      detection of the presence of the viral RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs since Polymerase Chain
      Reaction is currently the gold standard.
