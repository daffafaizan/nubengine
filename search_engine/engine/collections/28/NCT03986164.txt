      installation of immediate implants in the esthetic zone through computer-guided-surgery and
      conventional surgery. To this end, 22 patients who need implant-supported replacement on the
      anterior region of the maxilla will be selected and after extraction will receive: Guided
      surgery (GS): installation of dental implant with the aid of the virtually planned guide by
      means of specific software; Conventional surgery (CS): installation of dental implant
      performed freehand using a conventional surgical guide made by study models. Tomographies
      will be performed 10 days after the surgery for the measurement of both linear and angular
      shifts between the installed implants and the virtual planning. All the clinical and
      radiographic assessments (Plaque and Bleeding Index, Drilling Depth, Relative Clinical
      Insertion Level and the Margin Position of Peri-Implant Mucosa) will be carried out after the
      surgery and within 6 and 12 months of post-operative. Assesments of the esthetic success
      (pink/white score) and survival and success of the implant will also be carried out. In the
      prosthetic part, it will be assessed the abutment mobility; corrective measures for the
      prothesis; repair on prothesis or abutment. The success and survival assessments of crowns
      will be done through structure fracture, occlusal roughness, marginal integrity and contour
      of the restoration. It will also be assessed the procedural impact in quality of life by
      applying a 36-closed-question-survey focused on appearence, pain, oral comfort, general
      performance, feeding and chewing. Subsequently, the data will be tabulated, and according to
      their distribution, the appropriate statistical tests will be applied, considering a 5% index
      of significance to all the analyses.
