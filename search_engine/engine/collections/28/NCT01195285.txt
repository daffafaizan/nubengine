    
      Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) is accepted as a form of surgical treatment.
      Traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (TLC) is well tolerated, with a low complication
      risk and high patient satisfaction; thus a SILS procedure needs to be at least equivalent to
      be a justifiable replacement, and should not result in higher costs.
