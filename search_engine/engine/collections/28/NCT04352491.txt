           isolate them at home, potential respondents will be invited through a text message which
           will lead to a survey monkey page (designed by IT team at ILBS, New Delhi).

        -  All people who have shown at ILBS (1st January 2018 - 31st March 2020), will be sent the
           SMS for participation. They will be asked to provide phone numbers for retrieval of
           their Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores from
           hospital records. Patients with education more than 10th standard (or able to understand
           / read English) will only proceed with the survey.

        -  After clicking the link users will complete an online survey. The first page will give
           them basic information about the FEELIV-COVID survey and if they consent to participate,
           they will complete the survey. The decision to undertake the survey voluntarily, and
           will have no impact on their ongoing treatment.

        -  Informed consent will be obtained in the form of electronic name entry at the beginning
           of the survey. Their name entry will be taken as an approval to allow the investigators
           data regarding their Liver disease. Only the following data will be taken from the
           patient's records:

             -  Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score

             -  Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score

             -  Etiology of Liver Dysfunction

        -  No other data will be retrieved for the purpose of this study from patient's records.
