    
      Patient blood management (PBM) involves the timely and conscientious use of the current best
      evidence in making medical and surgical decisions about the care of patients to maintain red
      blood cell levels, optimize blood clotting, and minimize blood loss, in an effort to improve
      patient outcome. PBM focuses on the treatment of the individual patient and comprises
      transfusion therapy and drug therapy. PBM is based on three points: (1) optimization of the
      (preoperative) red blood cell volume, (2) reduction of diagnostic, therapeutic, or
      intraoperative blood loss, and (3) increasing individual tolerance towards anemia and
      accurate blood transfusion triggers. PBM primarily identifies patients at risk for
      transfusion and provides a management plan aimed at reducing or eliminating anemia and the
      need for blood transfusion donated from someone other than the patient (allogeneic
      transfusion), thus reducing the risks, blood bank inventory pressures, and the escalating
      costs associated with transfusion. The implementation of a formal UAB Preoperative Anemia
      Management Program (PAMP) may help achieve consistent PBM.

      Efforts will be made to coordinate patients' scheduled surgery date and their initial
      evaluation in the UAB Highlands Hospital Preoperative Assessment, Consultation, and Treatment
      (HPACT) Clinic, so that their first PACT Clinic visit occurs approximately 14 days prior to
      the planned total hip replacement or total knee replacement
