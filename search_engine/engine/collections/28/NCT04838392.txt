    
      This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, single-arm pivotal study
      without a control group. In total, 150 subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes will be
      enrolled at 16 investigational sites in the United States. All subjects are required to wear
      1 Sensor on the back of each upper arm for up to 14 days (up to 336 hours) and participate in
      both study visit and home use portion in this study. All subjects will have venous blood
      draws for evaluation of the blood glucose reference measurements in in-clinic visits, and to
      collect accuracy information against a laboratory reference method.
