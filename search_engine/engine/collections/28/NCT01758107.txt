      in Chulalongkorn University. The investigators published the safety of this regimen in
      Transplantation Proceeding 2008; 40: 2206-8.

      The investigators now further study in those patients who doing well with this regimen more
      than 1 year. The patients will be asked for kidney biopsy to evaluate and make sure they
      don't have subclinical rejection. The patients who don't have subclinical rejection will
      discontinue cyclosporine and continue with only sirolimus and prednisolone.
