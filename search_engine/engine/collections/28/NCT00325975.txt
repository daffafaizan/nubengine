      information is available regarding cellular immune responses to vaccinia virus. We will
      obtain blood from vaccinated persons and measure immune responses in vitro to the virus and
      correlate these findings with symptoms from vaccination. Elucidation of these responses might
      help to predict side effects associated with vaccination, and suggest new therapies to reduce
      these side effects.
