      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of decitabine and
      FR901228 (depsipeptide) in patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia, myelodysplastic
      syndromes, or myeloproliferative disease.

      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12 and FR901228 (depsipeptide)
      IV over 4 hours on days 5 and 12 OR days 5, 12, and 19. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for
      at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      experiencing complete remission for 1 year are removed from the study.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine and FR901228 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
