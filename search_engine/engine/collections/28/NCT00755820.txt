      combination with a type of psychotherapy called Exposure Therapy is helpful to patients with
      anorexia nervosa. DCS is approved by the FDA as an antibiotic medication, but has not been
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Past studies have found that DCS
      together with Exposure Therapy can help people with height phobia, social phobia, and
      obsessive compulsive disorder. Anorexia nervosa often includes phobia-like fears, obsessive
      thoughts, and compulsive rituals, so the current study aims to determine whether DCS paired
      with Exposure Therapy can also help people with anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is a
      disorder characterized by self-starvation, extreme weight loss, and difficulty maintaining a
      normal weight. You have been asked to participate in this study because you have been given a
      diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. In this study you will receive one of three therapies:
      Exposure Therapy with DCS, Exposure Therapy with placebo (inactive medication), or Treatment
      as Usual. You will participate in a total of four test meals in a laboratory setting. A total
      of 70 individuals with anorexia nervosa will participate in this study. Twenty individuals
      who have never had an eating disorder will participate in one portion of this study.
