      January 2013 and February 2020 were retrospectively analysed using patient records and
      radiology reports. A total of 174 patients (sexe ratio = 0.51, age range 9-91 years; mean
      age, 54 years) were included in the study.

      Ureteral obstruction was caused by bladder cancer (n=92), uterin cancer (n=31), prostate
      cancer (n=28), colorectal cancer (n= 15) and retroperitoneal tumor (n= 8) (Table 1).
