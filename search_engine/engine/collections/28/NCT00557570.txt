    
      This study is designed as a prospective, observational and treatment study, with ongoing
      monitoring of the progression of HIV infection and HIV-related disease processes. A data
      base, not otherwise obtainable, will be collected of unusual disease processes related to HIV
      infection, and of the long-term effects of experimental treatments that patients may have
      received under earlier protocols for HIV and related infections. Up to 500 patients with
      known or suspected HIV-infection will be enrolled. Minimal studies scheduled for each visit
      will include monitoring of immune status, routine safety laboratory tests, and evaluation for
      possible opportunistic infections. Treatment plans will be individualized for each patient's
      particular condition, and the number and length of additional visits and diagnostic
      evaluations will vary accordingly. Specific treatment regimens will be in accordance with
      standard medical practice.
