      receptor expression as well as ERBB2 amplification. It has no response to endocrine or
      anti-ERBB2 therapies. Recent studies have found some potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.
      However, it still has a poor outcome. It was reported that TNBC has six subtypes, including 2
      basal-like (BL1 and BL2), an immunomodulatory (IM), a mesenchymal (M), a mesenchymal
      stem-like (MSL), and a luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. Different subtype may be
      sensitive to different treatment. Bicalutamide is an oral, non-steroidal, androgen receptor
      (AR) antagonist. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment
      of metastatic prostate cancer. Recently, a study explored the efficacy of bicalutamide in AR
      positive, estrogen receptor negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which showed a high
      clinical benefit rate (CBR) and a good safety profile. Based on the above reasons, we
      initiate this phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bicalutamide in AR
      positive metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patients.
