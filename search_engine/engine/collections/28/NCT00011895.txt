      those with plasma HIV-1 RNA under 50 copies/ml, participate in the 48-week Maintenance Phase.
      Patients are randomized equally to receive either TZV plus EFV or TZV alone.

      An immunology substudy will be conducted, including approximately the first 100 patients
      enrolled who agree to participate.
