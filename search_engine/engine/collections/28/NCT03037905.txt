      methods to reduce anxiety prior to entering the operating room (OR). These studies have
      involved some form of distraction, almost all finding that some form of distraction prior to
      entering the OR decreases both physiologic signs and patient reports of anxiety. Very few of
      these studies have carried the intervention into the OR itself. Steris Corporation has
      developed an automated surgical suite environmental system, called SignatureSuiteâ„¢, that
      controls the level of lighting, images on OR monitors, and ambient background audio via
      preset, computerized automation for use before and after anesthesia. The research question
      is: What is the effect of the SignatureSuite OR environment on patient anxiety and analgesic
      use? Study methods: The proposed study will be a two arm randomized controlled trial.
      Randomization will occur at the surgeon level, based on SignatureSuite operating room
      environment (experimental group) versus a standard Marymount Hospital operating room
      environment (control group).

      Data collection: The study will take place in the perioperative department of Cleveland
      Clinic's Marymount Hospital. Patient anxiety will be measured before and after surgery using
      an anxiety visual analog scale (VAS). Data about patient characteristics will be retrieved
      retrospectively by chart review. The effect of SignatureSuite on OR time will also be
      determined.

      Sample characteristics: The patient sample will comprise patients undergoing thyroid and/or
      parathyroid surgery at Cleveland Clinic Marymount Hospital.

      Sample size: 40 subjects per group will provide adequate power to detect large effect sizes
      (0.80) and is feasible in a reasonable period of time.
