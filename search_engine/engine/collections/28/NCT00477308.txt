      95 children treated with dual NRTI. The study showed almost all children to have some degree
      of NRTI resistance and 40% with multi NRTI resistance. The mutation reported was major
      mutation.

      After the study, the patients were managed based on the physician's judgment using genotyping
      results. The 95 patients in HIV-NAT 013 are categorized into 3 groups.

        1. No viral resistance

        2. Low grade resistance with or without clinical/ immunological failure

        3. High grade resistance with or without clinical/ immunological failure.

      There are limited prospective studies evaluating outcome of decision regarding salvage
      therapy after genotyping results

      There are also new mutations that are not considered major mutation that may affect treatment
      outcome

      Knowledge learned from this study will benefit Thai children with NRTI resistance by helping
      pediatricians better choose salvage treatment options
