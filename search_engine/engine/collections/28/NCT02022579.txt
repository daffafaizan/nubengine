      lesions identified by conventional breast MRI. The investigators will determine whether an
      ADC threshold can be defined for distinguishing benign and malignant lesions on DWI, assess
      the difference in ADC cutoffs for mass and non-mass lesions, and investigate the potential
      improvement in accuracy using techniques such as nonzero minimum b-value (to remove perfusion
      effects in the ADC measures) and normalized ADC measures (to account for variations in water
      content and other factors).
