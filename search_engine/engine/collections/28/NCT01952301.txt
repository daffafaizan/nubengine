    
      A single-blind, randomized, controlled, split-mouth study of 30 subjects with insufficient
      zones of KT (< 2mm). The study utilized a within subject treatment comparison design to
      establish non-inferiority of the test (CM) versus control (FGG) therapy. The primary efficacy
      endpoint was KT width at 6-months. Secondary endpoints included traditional periodontal
      measures, such as clinical attachment, recession and bleeding on probing. Patient reported
      pain, discomfort and esthetic satisfaction were also recorded. Biopsies were obtained at
      6-months.
