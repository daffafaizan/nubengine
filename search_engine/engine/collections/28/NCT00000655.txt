      isetionate. Although both treatments are equally effective, side effects prevent completion
      of therapy in 11-55 percent of patients.

      Patients are randomized into one of two treatment groups to receive either (1) 566C80 for 21
      days, or (2) SMX/TMP for 21 days. Patients will be stratified according to severity of PCP.
      Group A will be those with an arterial-alveolar (A-a) DO2 < 35 mm Hg. Group B will have an
      A-a DO2 of 35-45 mm Hg., and will also be required to receive therapy with Corticosteroids.
      All doses are taken with food. During the 21 days of treatment, patients are examined
      clinically for adverse effects and have hematology (blood-related) and clinical chemistry
      studies conducted a minimum of 2 times weekly. More frequent monitoring may be required at
      the discretion of the investigator. To evaluate the effectiveness of study medication, the
      clinical status of each patient is evaluated 2 to 3 times per week (e.g., dyspnea score,
      cough score, chest tightness/pain score, vital signs). Also, on days 7 and 21 of treatment,
      an arterial blood gas measurement and chest X-ray are performed. Patients who experience
      severe toxicities will be discontinued from the study and placed on alternative therapy.
      Patients will also be removed from study if they show significant clinical deterioration
      within the first 7 days of therapy or if there is no improvement after 10 days of therapy.
      This study involves a double placebo with one group randomized to receive oral 566C80 and
      placebo tablets which look like SMX/TMP while the other group will receive SMX/TMP and
      placebo tablets looking like 566C80.
