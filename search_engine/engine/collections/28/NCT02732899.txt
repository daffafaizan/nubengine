    
      This study is a single-center, masked, randomized, 36 week study, designed to evaluate the
      safety and treatment efficacy of intravitreal Sirolimus with adjunct EYLEA® (aflibercept) in
      patients with persistent edema due to neovascular AMD versus EYLEA® (aflibercept) alone.
      Twenty (20) patients will be randomized to receive study medication in a 1:1 ratio. Study
      treatment will be administered by intravitreal injections. The sham injections given in the
      EYLEA® alone group are needleless and they are given in order to help preserve the masking of
      those subjects in that treatment group.
