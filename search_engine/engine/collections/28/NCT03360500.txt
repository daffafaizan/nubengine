      protocol in pain control, function and quality of life in individuals with knee
      osteoarthritis. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial, double-blinded. Will
      participate in the study 120 patients with knee osteoarthritis, diagnosed with clinical and
      radiographic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, of both sexes, aged between 40
      and 75 years. The total number of subjects will be divided randomly into three groups of 40
      subjects each. During eight weeks, three times per week, each group will receive one type of
      intervention: Exercise protocol for knee osteoarthritis + cryotherapy, Exercise protocol for
      knee osteoarthritis + placebo or Exercise protocol for knee osteoarthritis only. A medical
      certificate will be requested for all participants, showing the capability of practicing
      physical activities. Every individual will have the following variables evaluated one day
      pre- and one day post-intervention process: Pain index (VAS), physical function
      questionnaires (WOMAC) and quality of life (sf-36 questionnaire). Three physical function
      tests will also be carried out: the 30s sitting and standing chair, Stair test and fast paced
      test in 40m. Moreover, participants will perform VAS in every physical function test. A
      follow-up period will be performed.
