      requirement for the growth of nearly all tumors. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is a
      malignancy characterized by abundant vascularization and a high degree of resistance to
      chemotherapy which makes antiangiogenic therapy an intriguing concept for treatment. This
      concept has been established by the initial successes observed in recent studies of
      antiangiogenic therapies for CCRCC. ATN-161 is an attractive candidate for investigation as a
      therapeutic agent in CCRCC because it binds to several fully activated integrins, which are
      essential downstream components in the angiogenic signaling cascade.

      Functional imaging using dceMRI has been demonstrated as an effective way to show effects on
      the vasculature across different tumors, including CCRCC. Preclinical experiments have shown
      that ATN-161 affects tumor perfusion in tumor bearing mice. Therefore, use of imaging in this
      study is expected to be an effective method for evaluating the antiangiogenic response to
      ATN-161.

      Patients will be administered ATN-161 three times weekly by short (10 minute) IV infusion at
      1 of 3 dose levels (20, 100, and 600 mg). Patients will be treated until progression of
      disease, unacceptable drug toxicity, or withdrawal of consent occurs.

      Functional imaging (dceMRI) will be performed within 1 week prior to first treatment, again
      during the second week of treatment, and finally during the fourth week of treatment.
