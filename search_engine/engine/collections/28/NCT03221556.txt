    
      This is a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of 230 mothers with clinically
      significant depressive symptomatology being conducted at Boston Medical Center (BMC). The
      effectiveness component of the study (which is the trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov) is
      a pragmatic, parallel group randomized trial that measures patient-reported outcomes over 12
      months of follow-up. The implementation portion comprises a series of qualitative interviews
      to discern barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation.

      The investigators will enroll 230 mothers with clinically significant depressive
      symptomatology according to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a widely used
      screening instrument valid during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

      Engagement-Focused Care Coordination will be compared to Problem Solving Education (PSE).
      Whereas Engagement-Focused Care Coordination emphasizes referral to formal depression
      services following a brief engagement session, PSE offers initial depression treatment
      onsite, followed by referral to further care if depressive symptoms persist or worsen.
      Patients in both arms will have access to the same array of community-based mental health
      services upon referral. Both intervention arms are designed to be peer-delivered; thus, the
      investigators will enlist their existing team of PCMH family advocates - a group of women
      (approximately age-matched with our study participants) - to serve as intervention providers.
      To minimize contamination across comparators, this team will be divided into those trained in
      Engagement Interviewing and those trained in PSE.
