      focuses on two main issues that are important in clinical practice: (1) the tolerance of
      anti-androgenic treatments traditionally used for many years in young sexual offenders with
      severe paraphilias (2) the maintenance of the efficiency of SSRIs not yet approved for this
      indication (despite their current use in the treatment of minor paraphilic disorders).

      The paraphilic sex offender population are divided into three groups: those receiving SSRIs,
      those receiving anti-androgens (either GnRH agonists or CPA) and those receiving no
      pharmacological treatment.
