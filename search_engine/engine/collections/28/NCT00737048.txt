    
      This is a multi-center (conducted in more than one center), double-blind (neither Physician
      nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), randomized (study drug assigned by
      chance), parallel-group (each group of participant will be treated at the same time) and
      comparative study in participants having pain intensity of at least 50.0 millimeter (mm) (on
      visual analog scale, score ranging from 0 mm [no pain] to 100 mm [worst possible pain]),
      following extraction of an impacted mandibular wisdom tooth. The study consists of 3 parts:
      Pre-observation (7 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (Day 1, consists of
      single oral dosing of either tramadol plus acetaminophen and placebo; or tramadol and
      placebo; or acetaminophen and placebo) and Follow-up (Day 2 and 8). All the eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 study treatments. Efficacy of the
      participants will primarily be evaluated through total pain relief, which will be evaluated
      on numerical rating scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
