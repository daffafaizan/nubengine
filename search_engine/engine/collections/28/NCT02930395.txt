      overlooked. The Head Injury Assessment (HIA) is the current gold standard used by the
      national Rugby Medical Authorities in accordance with international safety protocols. The HIA
      protocol relies on neurological or neuropsychological endpoints, potentially subjective or
      not ensuring sufficient sensitivity. As a result, defining the immediate and long-term
      pathophysiological consequences of concussions remains challenging. The introduction of an
      objective blood test to detect the presence and the evolution overtime of neuro-vascular
      damage could represent a pairing approach filling a sensitive gap in the management of
      concussed players. Recent evidence has proposed the use of serum biomarkers aiding
      post-concussion management . Remarkably, serum biomarkers of neuro-vascular functions are
      currently being used in emergency room settings. Serum levels of the brain protein S100β were
      demonstrated to have an excellent negative predictive value for neurovascular damage after
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Measurement of blood S100β was proposed as a tool to
      grade TBI, limiting unnecessary CT scan examinations in emergency cases . However, whether
      the use of serum makers of neuro-vascular damage could benefit the management of
      sport-related concussion remains unclear. Moreover, repeated concussions have been linked to
      an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Parkinson's disease . Serum
      biomarkers could be of diagnostic and prognostic value, facilitating return to play decisions
      or predicting lingering risks of cognitive decline.
