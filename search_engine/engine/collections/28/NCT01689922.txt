    
      A prospective, randomized, parallel group controlled clinical study is proposed. The patients
      will be divided into the two study groups according to the surgical procedure:

        1. patients undergoing one-level microdiscectomy for lumbar herniated disc

        2. patients undergoing one-level lumbar fusion for degenerative disc disease without
           notable spinal stenosis.

      Each group will consist of 60 patients (see sample size calculations below) who will be
      randomized into the two equal groups to undergo:

        1. Standard postoperative rehabilitation program

        2. Standard postoperative rehabilitation program with addition of lower body positive
           pressure (LBPP) treadmill training
