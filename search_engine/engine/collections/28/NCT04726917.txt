    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), manifested by coughing, shortness of breath,
      sputum production, wheezing and reduced physical performance, is one of the most frequently
      diagnosed lung diseases. Anxiety and depression have been found to increase the number of
      acute exacerbations and hospitalizations (thus reducing quality of life), weight, appetite,
      sleep disorders, fatigue or loss of energy, lack of concentration, pessimism about the future
      and suicidality. Anxiety has been estimated to occur in 21-96% and depression in 27-79% of
      patients with COPD, values that are higher than for the general population or other chronic
      diseases. Pulmonary rehabilitation leads to the improvement to the physical capacity and
      overall fitness of the patients with COPD allowing restoration of independence in daily
      functioning. Psychological support is required in order to reduce the negative psychological
      symptoms related to both the pulmonary disease itself and the comorbidities. In the presented
      study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of levels of depression, anxiety and stress in
      patients with COPD qualified for In-hospital pulmonary rehabilitation program.

      The program includes the following elements:

      Three weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation conducted in an outpatient care facility:

        -  5- time a week for 30 minutes a specific respiratory exercises- relaxation exercises for
           breathing muscles, exercises to increase breathing, prolonged exhalation exercise, chest
           percussion

        -  5- time a week for 20-30 min training on a cycle ergometer

        -  5- time a week for 30 minutes a fitness and respiratory exercises - coordination and
           balance exercises, stretching exercises

        -  relaxation training by Schultz. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions
           that last around 15 minutes. During each session, the practitioner repeats a set of
           visualisations that induce a state of relaxation.
