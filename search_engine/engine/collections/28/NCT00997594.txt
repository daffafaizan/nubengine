      unresectable adrenal tumors. But one of the major complication is a increase in blood
      pressure. Hormonal release during RF ablation is considered the cause of hypertension. But
      there has been no evidence that adrenal hormones affects changes in blood pressure. In this
      prospective study, we evaluate the changes in adrenal hormones during RF ablation and clarify
      the cause of hypertensive crisis.
