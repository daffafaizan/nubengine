      obtain standardized uptake value（SUV）while single-photo emission computed tomography(SPECT)
      does not have. Recently with the developing of technology, the ability of SPECT has been
      extended.

      On the other hand, thyroid imaging by SPECT can only play an auxiliary role in
      hyperthyroidism diagnosis mainly since it is regarded as nonquantitative. So the
      investigators design this study to search the capacity and accuracy of SUV provided by SPECT
      and CT(CT is used for reconstruction algorithm) in diagnosing GD.

      This is a multiple-center study containing nine groups in China that use GE Discovery NM/CT,
      an advanced equipment. Thus, the data can be more accurate and more available.

      And this is a perspective clinical trial, taking about eight months. The investigators plan
      to evaluate at least 50 Grave's Disease(GD) patients and 50 normal humans as contrast in all.

      Every GD patient must have been diagnosed and the results of thyroid function tests(such as
      TSH,FT3,FT4） must be available. If necessary, the patient's rate of iodine uptake should also
      be known before he/she being included in this study. As for normal people, the results of
      thyroid function tests should be within the range of normal value.

      The data of each participant will be gathered and stored. And the data processing will be
      done with the help of GE staff, using the software Q.Metrix to get the value of SUVmean,
      SUVmax. Finally T test will be used in comparison of the differences.
