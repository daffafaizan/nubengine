    
      Development of an integrated database of genetic background from treatment-na√Øve and
      TKI-refractory populations, clinical information, and therapeutic outcomes in advanced NSCLC.

        1. To enroll 500 patients who fit the criteria of this study in the enrolled period.

        2. To perform large-scale NGS analysis for specific populations, create a map containing
           important genetic characteristics to help understand the mechanisms of drug resistance,
           and find novel treatment strategies.

        3. To collect tumor sample collection for NGS testing

        4. To record previous therapeutic agents and accompanying treatment response and adverse
           events
