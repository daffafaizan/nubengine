      population. The prognosis for women with a platin refractory ovarian cancer is very bad. The
      median survival time amounts for less a year. Especially in this palliative situation
      therapies regarding efficacy as well as quality of life are needed. in Germany Topotecan is
      approved since 1996 for patients after previous treatment with platin, the rare
      non-hematological side-effects making it interesting for a palliative therapy. Since best
      results in a chemo-therapeutical treatment are commonly obtained with the combination of two
      or more cytostatic agents this study tests a Topotecan Monotherapy and two Topotecan
      combinations. Both combination agents show efficacy alone against solid cancer using from
      Topotecan different mechanism resulting in different main side effects. Total survival,
      remission rates, time ti progression and quality of life are the main criteria investigated.
