      we examined sexual functioning in a large groups of patients with idiopathic Parkinson
      Disease compared with healthy subjects in the Italian community. To assess sexual function in
      PD we used the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning [(BISF-M for man; BISF-W for woman), the
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).
      Participants were also assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

      This study aimed to provide a thorough epidemiological description of sexual dysfunction in
      Parkinson's disease. The knowledge of sexual function in PD might help to plan effective
      interventionist measures and ultimately to optimize patient's and the partner's quality of
      life.

      Parkinson patients (aged 40-80) and 123 healthy controls (aged 40-80) will be recruited from
      four Italian Movement Disorders Clinics.
