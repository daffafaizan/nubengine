    
      Poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) 1/2 inhibitors are a novel class of
      anticancer agents that have shown activity in tumors with defects in DNA repair and may
      induce synthetic lethality in combination with agents that induce DNA damage by preventing
      DNA repair.

      The rationale of this study is to determine whether a DNA damaging agent can potentiate the
      cell death induced by PARP inhibitors in individuals with tumor that are more susceptible to
      chemotherapy.

      The study will evaluate the potential benefits of BMN 673 in combination with weekly
      carboplatin in patients with metastatic tumors associated with BRCA germ line mutations or
      patients with triple negative breast cancer with no known BRCA mutation, subsequently if
      tolerated, an additional cohort will examine the feasibility of adding paclitaxel to this
      combination for any solid tumor malignancies with potential benefit to this combination.

      This is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN 673 in combination with
      carboplatin in patients with either BRCA mutations or TNBC. If tolerable paclitaxel will be
      added to the combination in any solid tumor malignancies with potential benefit to this
      combination.
