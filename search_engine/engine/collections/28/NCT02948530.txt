      tidal variations of airway pressure subtracted by tidal variations in esophageal pressure
      divided by the tidal volume (Method 1). This requires the presence of a esophageal balloon
      catheter which is cumbersome and costly.

      In this study values obtained as described in Method 1 above are compared to values obtained
      with a new method (Method 2) in which a PEEP-step is performed with a size of the lung volume
      increase which corresponds to the tidal volume which the patient is ventilated with.
      Measurements using Method 1 and 2 are performed in sedated and mechanically ventilated
      patients in the intensive care unit.
