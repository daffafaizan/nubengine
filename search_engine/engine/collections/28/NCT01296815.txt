      localized Kaposi's sarcoma of the airway will be randomized to receive HAART only or HAART +
      intralesional bevacizumab.

      The primary outcome will be the size of lesions according to RECIST criteria. Patients in the
      HAART + bevacizumab arm will undergo series of 3 bevacizumab injections of 5 mg/cm3.
      Follow-up will be carried out through scheduled meetings for office setting examination every
      week for the first 8 weeks, then every 15 days for two months and finally every month for
      eight months.

      Size of the lesions will be assessed by an independent observer and adverse events will be
      recorded.
