    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the 2-year progression free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. To estimate the 2-year overall survival.

      III. To estimate the 2-year cumulative incidence of progression.

      IV. To estimate time to hematopoietic recovery, using absolute neutrophil and platelet
      engraftment.

      V. To estimate incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities by Bearman Scale, Day 0 to Day 100.

      VI. To estimate the response rate (CR/PR).

      VII. To estimate 100-day treatment related mortality.

      VIII. To estimate incidence of myelodysplasia and therapy related acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML).

      IX. To descriptively compare the outcomes of patients treated on this protocol to a
      comparable patient population treated with chemotherapy alone.

      OUTLINE: RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan intravenously
      (IV) following rituximab IV on day -14.

      HIGH-DOSE COMBINATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive carmustine IV on days -7 and -6;
      etoposide IV over 1 hour twice daily (BID) and cytarabine IV over 2 hours BID on days -5 to
      -2; and melphalan IV on day -1.

      STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant
      on day 0. Patients also receive rituximab on day 8*. NOTE: * Some patients may also receive
      rituximab on day -1. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically.
