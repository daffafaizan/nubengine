      health care environment in order to provide safe care to patients. One of the important and
      difficult to accomplish skills that nursing students must learn is the ability to administer
      intramuscular injections. In order to avoid complications due to IM injection application, it
      is necessary to comply with surgical asepsia, to know the method of application correctly and
      to have psychomotor skills. Therefore, nursing students are expected to graduate with
      knowledge and skills related to IM injection application during their education. Basic
      plastic mannequins without advanced technology, mannequins or models with low technological
      features that present the selected anatomical parts of the human body can also be used in
      standard patient and hybrid simulation. Hybrid simulation applications contribute to learners
      ' ability to develop psychomotor skills in a safe and realistic environment, as well as
      problem solving, critical thinking and decision making. Furthermore, hybrid simulations have
      become an ethical requirement to improve students ' skills without causing any potential harm
      to actual patients. In this study, the effectiveness of HS method will be evaluated to gain
      IM injection skills in nursing students. It will be ensured that the students ' knowledge and
      skills will be sufficient by increasing their desire to learn about IM injection, where they
      experience intense fear and anxiety before going to the clinic.
