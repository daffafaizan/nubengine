    
      To document and describe the clinical, microbiological, and pharmacoeconomic outcomes of two
      hundred patients who failed to respond to outpatient macrolide or beta-lactam therapy.
      Evaluable patients must have a positive culture obtained after they failed their initial
      macrolide or beta-lactam. The isolated pathogen must have a known MIC to the antibiotic class
      they failed to respond to (i.e. macrolide or b-lactam). The isolate must be available to be
      sent to the central laboratory for MIC testing
