      leukemia patients treated with homoharringtonine to those treated with hydroxyurea. II.
      Compare the time to progression of these patients treated with these two drugs. III. Estimate
      the complete and major cytogenetic response and describe the serial cytogenetics of these
      patients treated with these two drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to receive one of two
      treatments. Arm I: Induction: Patients receive homoharringtonine IV continuously over 24
      hours daily for 14 days. Induction continues every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses or
      until hematopoietic recovery. Maintenance: Patients receive homoharringtonine IV continuously
      over 24 hours daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days. Arm II: Induction: Patients
      receive oral hydroxyurea daily for 28 days until acceptable blood counts are achieved.
      Maintenance: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea daily every 28 days to maintain acceptable
      blood counts. Treatment in both arms continues for a minimum of 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for a
      maximum of 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 480 patients (240 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 4 years.
