      pancreas at a set point of 100 mg/dl. The co-primary outcomes will be the mean Dexcom CGM
      glucose level and time <54 mg/dl, both in the last five days of each arm because these will
      be predictive of outcomes in long term use. The first two days will be excluded to allow for
      the extended washout of long acting insulins.
