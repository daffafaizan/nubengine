      I. To evaluate the use of MRI in delineating clinical target volumes, as well as endorectal
      balloon target immobilization in patients treated with radiation following radical
      prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      II. Trends over time in CTV, bladder and rectum volumes and percent change from baseline at
      each time point. III. Frequency of events in which the CTV falls outside the PTV. IV.
      Proportion of the total CTV which falls outside the PTV at each event. V. Trends over time in
      dose-volume exposures for bladder and rectum.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo MRI and CT scan-based simulation for treatment planning with
      endorectal balloon target immobilization. The treatment target volumes and surrounding organs
      at risk are contoured, treatment plan developed and approved.

      Patients then undergo 39 fractions of image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy over 8
      weeks. Patients also undergo weekly MRI scans of the pelvis (in the planned treatment
      position) during radiotherapy.
