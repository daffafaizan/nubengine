      be treated according to clinical guidelines, and receive circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid
      biopsy at the time of diagnosis, at mid treatment, at the end of treatment and during
      follow-up. The study will be ended when the patients have progressive disease (PD) or reach
      the longest follow-up time (2 years).
