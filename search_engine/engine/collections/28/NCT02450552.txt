      rodent and stem cell-based model studies support the hypothesis that neuronal
      hyperexcitability may contribute to neurodegeneration in both sporadic and familial ALS. The
      investigators are doing this research study to find out whether retigabine will reduce motor
      neuron excitability in people with ALS. the investigators will also determine whether the
      drug is tolerable and safe for patients with ALS.

      The proposed study will determine how the potassium channel opener ezogabine (retigabine)
      affects neurophysiological measures of upper and lower motor neuron excitability in ALS
      patients as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and threshold tracking nerve
      conduction studies (TTNCS), respectively. The study will include the recruitment of
      approximately 60 unmatched healthy control subjects for analysis of variability of the
      neurophysiological tests prior to recruitment of ALS subjects. There will also be 12 matched
      healthy control subjects, recruited at the same time as ALS subjects.
