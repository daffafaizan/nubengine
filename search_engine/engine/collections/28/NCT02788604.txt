      diagnosis and treatment can have devastating psychosocial effects on the family. Tools to
      screen for psychosocial risks (PSR) in pediatric oncology are rare. Our preliminary work
      adapted the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT) for the Canadian population, PATrevised
      (PATrev), and developed the Psychosocial Care Checklist (PCCL). The PATrev is completed by
      parents of children with cancer, and yields a summary of the psychosocial needs of the
      patient, parents, and siblings. The PCCL assesses HCPs knowledge of family's psychosocial
      needs and services. Importantly, psychosocial screening is associated with reduced parental
      anxiety and improved child's quality of life (QOL). Demonstration of the tool's ability to
      maximize patient and family psychosocial outcomes is needed. Participants will be parents of
      children newly diagnosed with cancer, (patients and siblings (> 8 years), if available).
      Design: RCT with concealed allocation to experimental group (EG) and control group (CG), with
      repeated measures (after diagnosis= T1, 6 months later=T2). The EG treating team will receive
      a summary of PATrev risk information based on parent report. No risk information will be
      provided in the CG. Parents in both groups will complete the PATrev, family environment
      questionnaire, self--report and proxy reported QoL, distress and mood measures for the
      patient and one sibling. Patients and siblings will self-report on QOL, distress and mood.
      Patient charts will be reviewed (T2) to determine treatment intensity and documented
      psychosocial services for each family.
