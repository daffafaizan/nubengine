      isthmus-dependent right atrial flutter. Achieving bidirectional conduction block in the
      cavotricuspid isthmus is decisive for both acute and long-term therapy success and
      essentially depends on the selected ablation method and the lesion size. By using an 8 mm tip
      electrode instead of a conventional 4 mm electrode, deeper lesions can be made, thus
      significantly reducing the required number of energy applications for achieving a
      bidirectional conduction block. Experimental studies have proven that using an ablation
      electrode made of gold alloy allows the creation of deeper lesions than with conventional
      platinum-iridium electrodes. Due to the greater heat conductivity of the gold alloy as
      opposed to platinum-iridium, the cooling of the ablation electrode is improved and more
      electric energy can be transmitted to the tissue at identical temperatures.

      The combination of both technologies in the form of an 8 mm-long gold electrode anticipates
      that the lesion depth required for an isthmus block can be achieved more quickly in
      comparison to the platinum-iridium electrode.
