      study. Subjects will be assigned randomly to PME and PMI treatments (2:1 proportion). After
      treatment completion (15 sessions of 2 hours each) and follow-up period of six months,
      patients that received PMI will be given the choice to receive PME. The design is double
      blinded as the patient will be informed that the treatment received, regardless of which, has
      been shown effective in previous studies. The person conducting the pain evaluations will be
      blinded to which treatment each patient receives, and will not take part on providing
      treatment (evaluator and therapist are different persons).
