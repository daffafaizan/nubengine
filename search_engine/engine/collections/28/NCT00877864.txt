      resistance exercise or their combination resulted in significant improvements in glycemic
      control in type 2 diabetes. It has also been shown that programs which include a
      psychological/behavioral component in addition to diet and exercise have been most effective
      for long-term treatment of obesity in diabetes. The supervised exercise program has stronger
      evidence for improvement of metabolic control and cardiac risk, but its longer-term
      sustainability has not been demonstrated, and it is relatively costly. A stage-matched
      printed materials/pedometer intervention has been shown to increase physical activity over a
      longer period of time, and likely at a lower per-patient cost than the supervised exercise
      intervention, but with less evidence for improvement of metabolic control.
