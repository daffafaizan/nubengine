      components, require step-by-step adjustment in order to move teeth in the planned direction.
      At the moment there is no tool, that allows to predict the treatment result. Using
      conventional orthodontic treatment methods the orthodontist approaches the final result using
      the trial-and-error-method, bending the wires in each appointment until both, patient and
      orthodontist are satisfied. Usually there is only a general treatment plan, but not a
      detailed treatment plan of each tooth movement. This leads to a longer treatment time and
      causes more costs. Besides the probability of side effects (such as caries root resorption)
      increases with the duration of the treatment.

      In this case the chosen technology is called SureSmile(R)(by OraMetrix). SureSmile allows the
      collection 3D-data intraorally and from plaster models, it gives a possibility of computer
      aided treatment planing (Computer Aided Design) and the manufacturing of customized archwires
      (Computer Aided Manufacturing).

      This new technology promises to reduce the time and effort of an orthodontic treatment
      providing predictability and quality also minimizing negative side effects.

      This technology could - using this diagnostic 3D-system - help to understand orthodontic
      movement and basic principles of the remodeling of the periodontium and to improve
      orthodontic mechanics.
