      blocks of four directly to transsphenoidal surgery or to 6-month preoperative treatment with
      octreotide.

      To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects in the pretreatment group, octreotide
      is initiated at a dose of 50 µg sc three times a day for the 1st week and 100 µg sc three
      times a day for the 2nd week. From the 3rd week on, the patients receive octreotide LAR
      (Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) 20 mg im every 28th day for 6 months.
      Patients receive transsphenoidal surgery within 28 d of the last injection. If surgery are
      delayed, an extra octreotide LAR injection is given before surgery.
