    
      AIMS: To assess the diagnostic validity and cost-effectiveness of a home respiratory
      polygraphy (HRP) performed at home compared with the standard polysomnography (PSG) in
      children with clinically suspected Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

      METHODOLOGY: DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, multicenter, double blind and crossover trial.
      The study will include 320 children, both sexes, with clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA). MEASUREMENTS: To all patients with clinical suspected OSA and referred to the
      sleep units, the following questionnaires and measurements will be performed: a) clinic
      history; b) Anthropometric variables: weight, height, body mass index, neck circumference and
      percentile; c) Chervin questionnaire, quality of life and clinical questionnaires and
      comorbidity; d) PSG in the sleep laboratory; e) HRP at home; f) Quantitative unbiased
      proteinic urine analysis and g) Cost-effectiveness variables.

      ANALYSIS: Data from HRP and from full PSG will be compared as follows: 1) Agreement of
      results according to the different apnea-hypopnea index by using the ROC curves; 2) The
      concordance of the diagnosis and treatment decisions when using clinical findings and data
      from PSG or HRP at home, 3) All data will be analyzed independently by participating
      hospitals according the Cohen Kappa method, 4) A diagnosis paradigm based on proteinic
      defined variables and 5) A cost-effectiveness analysis of the different diagnostic and
      therapeutic procedures will be performed.
