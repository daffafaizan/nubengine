    
      Patients undergoing cardiac transplantation will be enrolled in the study after giving a
      written, signed informed consent.

      The participants will be randomized into two groups:

        -  intervention group (30 patients): a cytokine adsorber (CytoSorbÂ®) will be installed into
           the cardiopulmonary bypass circle during the operation

        -  control group (30 patients): no cytokine adsorber will be used during cardiopulmonary
           bypass

      The investigators will collect demographic, clinical and laboratory data about patients
      before, during and after the operation.

      The incidence of early cellular or humoral rejection, length of ventilation, ICU and hospital
      stay, the use of vasopressors and inotropes in the perioperative period and incidence of
      perioperative complications and survival will be documented.

      The level of cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alfa) and complements
      before, during and after the use of cardiopulmonary bypass will be determined if the
      investigators find relevant difference between the two groups in clinical variables.
