      as an adjuvant to standard clinical evaluation to gauge burn wound and severity of infection.
      Researcher can image the burn wounds of and compare with current standard of care, clinical
      exam, and can use the outcomes information in terms of time to healing and treatment

      Modulating Imaging is a noninvasive optical modality measure the metabolic functions of the
      burn wound.

      Laser Speckle Imaging is a noninvasive optical modality can measure blood flow of burn wound.
