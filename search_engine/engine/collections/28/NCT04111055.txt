      impact organ perfusion.

      The investigators have developed a closed-loop vasopressor (CLV) controller to more
      efficiently correct hypotension.

      The investigators tested it extensively in preclinical studies and recently demonstrated its
      feasibility and excellent performance metrics in a short series of high-risk patients
      undergoing major surgical procedures.

      In these studies, the controller was linked to a minimally-invasive advanced hemodynamic
      monitoring device utilizing an arterial line which then controlled a vasopressor infusion.
      However, the vast majority of patients who undergo surgery do not require an arterial line
      but should still benefit from rapid corrections of hypotensive episodes that are less rapidly
      detected via an intermittent non-invasive blood pressure cuff. Fortunately, completely
      noninvasive technology now allows us to continuously monitor blood pressure and therefore
      extend the use of our closed-loop vasopressor system to patients in whom an arterial catheter
      would not typically be placed. Patients undergoing renal transplant surgeries are the ideal
      patient population.

      The investigators aimed to test the feasibility of guiding our CLV controller with a
      continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring device (ClearSight system, Edwards
      Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) in three patients (case series)
