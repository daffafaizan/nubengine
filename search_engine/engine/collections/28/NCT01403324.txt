      administration of rhTSH an injection of I-124 will be performed. Positron emission tomography
      with computed tomography scans (PET/CT), blood tests, and measurements of whole body
      radioactivity will occurred during the 4 to 96 hours following I-124 administration in order
      to perform dosimetry (i.e.) to estimate the radiation dose delivered to the metastases. After
      4 weeks under thyroid hormones patients will undergo thyroid hormone withdrawal and a new
      administration of I-124 will be performed. The same dosimetry study will be realized with
      PET/CT, blood tests, and measurements of whole body radioactivity. A therapeutic activity of
      I-131will then be administered followed by whole body scan realized 24 to 72 hours after the
      administration of I-131. Dosimetry studies will be compared in order to determine whether
      rhTSH stimulation can replace thyroid hormone withdrawal for the treatment of distant
      metastases.
