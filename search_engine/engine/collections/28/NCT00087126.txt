        -  Determine the antitumor activity of topotecan in patients with persistent or recurrent
           carcinoma of the cervix that failed higher priority treatment protocols.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patient are followed for every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
