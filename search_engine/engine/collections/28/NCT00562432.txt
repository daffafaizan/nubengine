    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a non-surgical and non-destructive approach to
      providing a temporary, protective parasympathectomy as a means to reducing postoperative
      atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery. Applications of Plexisyl-AF will be placed in
      the cardiac fat pads as a means for creating a "non-destructive" cardiac denervation.

      This is a randomized assessment to demonstrate the safety of Plexisyl-AF in patients
      undergoing open heart surgery. Eligible patients will be those submitted to undergo
      open-chest CABG. Patients will receive Plexisyl-AF, administered via direct application to
      the SA nodal and AV nodal epicardial fat pads during the surgical procedure.

      Patients will be monitored for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation via the use of
      continuous cardiac monitoring for a period of 120 hours following surgery. Patients will
      return the clinic for brief follow-up, including electrocardiographic recordings, 10 days, 30
      days and 90 days after the date of surgery.
