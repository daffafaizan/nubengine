      possible cure of a number of hematological malignancies. A major obstacle to this treatment
      is the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), affecting the majority of
      transplanted patients to some extent. Today, combinations of various cytotoxic and
      immunosuppressive drugs are used to prevent and treat GVHD, but many of them are associated
      with severe side-effects. Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP) offers an alternative to chemo-
      and immunosuppressive therapy and confers apparently only mild side effects. The postulated
      rationale of ECP is to treat the patient's white blood cells ex vivo with ultraviolet
      irradiation after sensitization with 8-methoxypsoralen to dampen their immunoactivity. After
      engraftment the intervention group receives 2 consecutive ECP every week in 2 weeks then 1
      ECP every week in 4 weeks ( a total of 8 ECP procedures).
