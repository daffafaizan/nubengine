    
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial comparing
      the safety and effectiveness of supplementation with Trenev Trio速/Healthy Trinity速 vs.
      placebo in otherwise healthy subjects with recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms. Subjects will
      be recruited and, following successful completion of a 2-week run-in period, will be
      randomized to Trenev Trio速/Healthy Trinity速 or placebo and will consume their assigned study
      product daily for 10 weeks. The study endpoints of this trial include relief of overall
      gastrointestinal symptoms, acid indigestion, abdominal cramping, constipation, diarrhea, gas,
      and bloating as well as product safety over the 10-week supplementation period.
