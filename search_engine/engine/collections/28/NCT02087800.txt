      finding ways to maximize quitting behavior is critical. Women have a more difficult time
      achieving smoking abstinence than men. The risk for smoking relapse appears to vary by
      menstrual phase such that the follicular phase is associated with greater risk compared to
      the luteal phase. Women are also more likely to smoke in response to stressful stimuli than
      men. Allopregnanolone (ALLO) is a stress-reducing neuroactive steroid that is primarily
      metabolized from the sex hormone progesterone and, therefore, varies by menstrual phase in
      women. Recent preclinical literature has indicated that ALLO may protect against drug abuse
      behaviors. Unfortunately, ALLO remains largely unexplored in clinical samples containing
      women.

      In this study we aim to characterize the effect of smoking on stress-induced ALLO response in
      women by menstrual phase. To achieve this goal, we will recruit a sample of premenopausal
      women who smoke (n=30) and do not smoke (n=30) to participate in a controlled cross-over
      study. All participants will complete two four-hour lab sessions timed to occur in the
      Follicular (F; low ALLO) and Luteal (L; high ALLO) menstrual phases. Each lab session will
      contain an acute stressor along with a timed series of assessments including blood samples
      (for ALLO measurement) and self-report of mood and perceived stress.
