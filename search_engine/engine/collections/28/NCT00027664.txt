        -  Determine the safety of interferon alfa and thalidomide in patients with metastatic
           renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Compare the relative toxicity of interferon alfa with or without thalidomide in these
           patients.

        -  Assess the antiangiogenic effect of thalidomide by monitoring the
           angiogenesis-associated factors in these patients.

        -  Compare, in a preliminary manner, the efficacy of interferon alfa with or without
           thalidomide in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously 3 times a week and oral
           thalidomide once daily for 12 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa only as in arm I. Treatment in both arms
           repeats every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Patients in arm II who develop disease progression discontinue interferon alfa and
           receive thalidomide only as in arm I.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 weeks during each study course.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.
