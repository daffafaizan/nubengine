      temporary protection of oral mucosal tissue and to provide pain relief, the proposed study
      will further investigate the safety and efficacy of hemostasis of the dressing for use in
      dental surgical procedures that do not require primary closure (suturing) such as tooth
      extractions. This protocol will specifically research the safety and efficacy of hemostasis
      within a population of subjects taking anticoagulant medications.
