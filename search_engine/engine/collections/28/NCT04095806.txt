      With the demographic transition and population ageing in SSA rates of stroke are set to
      continue to increase rapidly as part of the double burden of disease (still a major burden of
      infectious diseases, as well as an unfinished agenda of maternal and newborn health).

      Previous studies have already established a global high level of hypertension in the adult
      population in Zanzibar, and low performance of the health system for managing this.

      It is important to identify the peculiar genomic, gene-environmental and environmental risk
      and protective factors for stroke occurrence, pattern, type, outcome, and current incidence
      velocity in SSA in order to inform preventive measures especially effective and
      cost-effective control of raised blood pressure/hypertension; the best model for the
      provision of inpatient care and rehabilitation in a resource poor environment with lack of
      access to dedicated stroke units and limited multidisciplinary team input; and to include the
      particular East Africa population in existing or future international stroke collaborations
      to ensure that genetic variations relevant to the population there are represented.
