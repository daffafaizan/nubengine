      because of the population ageing and behaviors modification (time spent using screens
      increased, wearing of contact lensesâ€¦). Photophobia deteriorates the quality of life in
      patients with dry eye syndrome decreasing outdoor activities. This symptom is not understood
      and does not seem to be linked with dry eye syndrome severity. The study will compare
      cortical activation after luminous stimulation of 16 patients eyes (8 patients with dry eye
      syndrome and photophobia vs 8 asymptomatic patients) using functional MRI (fMRI).

      The primary study endpoint was the extent of magnetic signals in visual cortex after luminous
      stimulation. Secondary endpoints were the spatial activation extent in the 3 areas of the
      visual cortex (Brodmann areas 17,18,19).
