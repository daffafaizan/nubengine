      on target. Actually, however, the general control rate is not good and partially due to the
      complex etiology in type 2 DM. GLP-1 deficiency is the mostly emphasized in modern practice.
      In order to study the effect of GLP-1 analogue in insulinized type 2 DM patients,
      investigators have to optimize the insulin therapy in the first priority. Continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or insulin pump is a viable choice for patients with
      type 1 or type 2 DM who want close-to-physiologic insulin treatment. By means of the insulin
      pump therapy, standardized sugar control profile in type 2 DM patients could be achieved in a
      short time. Investigators can further evaluate the clinical response under GLP-1 analogue or
      not.
