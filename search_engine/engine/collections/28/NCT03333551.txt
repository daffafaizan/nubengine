      advantage of the ability of the radiopharmaceutical to bind specifically to amyloid fibrils.
      It has previously been established that the degree of radiotracer uptake correlates with the
      density of Beta-amyloid plaque. The ability to quantify this uptake makes [18F]-florbetapir
      imaging a potential tool to evaluate cardiac response in patients undergoing therapy for AL
      amyloidosis. It would provide a much-needed tool to monitor cardiac response to chemotherapy
      to potentially adjust chemotherapy if response was not adequate. It could also provide a tool
      by which investigators would be able to evaluate new therapies designed to decrease the
      burden of formed amyloid fibrils within the heart.
