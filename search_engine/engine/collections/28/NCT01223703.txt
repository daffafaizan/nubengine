      medical therapy and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV, long term
      treatment with n-3 PUFAs 1 g daily reduces mortality and hospitalizations for cardiovascular
      reasons. Several potential mechanisms may underlie the beneficial effects of n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in HF patients, including, but not limited to,
      antiarrhythmic, and hemodynamic actions. The current investigation was therefore designed to
      test the hypothesis that treatment with n-3 PUFAs improves LV systolic function expressed as
      EF in patients with stable chronic HF secondary to a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy
      (NICM). Additionally, we sought to determine if n-3 PUFAs also exert positive effects on LV
      diastolic function assessed by echocardiography; functional capacity assessed by
      cardiopulmonary stress testing (CPET); and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
      class.
