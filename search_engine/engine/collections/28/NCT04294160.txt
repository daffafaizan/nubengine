      patients with advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 (E, D, or K) in order to characterize safety
      and tolerability of each treatment arm tested and to identify recommended doses and regimens
      for future studies. The open platform design of this study is adaptive to allow removal of
      combination treatment arm(s) based on emerging data and facilitate introduction of new
      candidate combinations. The study is comprised of a dose escalation part and may be followed
      by a dose expansion part for any combination treatment arm.
