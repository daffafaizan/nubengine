      is high, especially shortly after the event. Because AF-related strokes are usually larger in
      their size and more fatal than other types of ischemic stroke, it is important to prevent
      recurrent cardioembolic strokes with adequate secondary prevention. However, as damaged brain
      tissues and vessels are prone to bleed, early anticoagulation may be harmful.

      For this reason, urgent anticoagulation has not been recommended in stroke patients with AF,
      and the appropriate time point to start anticoagulation remains controversial. Guideline
      recommends 1-3-6-12 rule* in initiating anticoagulation. However, this rule is not derived
      from a scientifically proven study results. Furthermore, although the risk of intracranial
      hemorrhage may be reduced to some extent with this strategy, the risk of early recurrence of
      embolic stroke may outweigh the potential benefit of delayed anticoagulation.

      Edoxaban, which selectively blocks factor Xa, has a lower risk of hemorrhage, but with a
      similar efficacy in preventing ischemic events in patients with AF compared with warfarin.
      Even compared with the other factor Xa inhibitors, it is considered to have a lower risk of
      bleeding. Therefore, edoxaban may be safely given in the early phase in patients with stroke
      associated with AF, while not significantly increasing the risk of hemorrhages.
