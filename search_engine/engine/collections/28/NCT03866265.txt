    
      The present study investigates the putative anti-platelet effects in healthy human subjects
      (N=20) following ingestion of a novel supplement containing food-grade extracts of bio-active
      salmon polar lipids (FGE-Salmon-PLs).

      The study has a double blind randomized cross-over placebo-controlled design in healthy
      subjects.

      After appropriate screening, 20 of the recruited subjects will provide baseline blood samples
      and then 10 of them will be initially administered a food supplement capsule (containing
      0.125 g of FGE-Salmon-PLs) per day for a period of 28 days, while another 10 of them will
      initially be administered a placebo capsule (containing 0.125 g of glycerin) per day, in a
      double blind and randomized way.

      After the period of 28 days, each participant will provide blood samples at the 29th day.

      Then a washout period of 14 days will follow, in which each participant will not be
      administered any kind of supplements or placebo capsules.

      After this washout period of 14 days, each participant will provide again new baseline blood
      samples and then in a crossover design the participants that were initially administered the
      food supplement will now be administered the placebo capsules for 28 days (a placebo capsule
      per day), while likewise the participants that were initially administered the supplement
      capsules will now be administered the food supplement capsules for 28 days.

      After this new period of 28 days, each participant will provide again blood samples at the
      new 29th day.

      Plasma reach in platelets of all blood samples from each participant, before and after each
      kind of administration (of either placebo or supplement capsules), will be tested for their
      platelet sensitivity against both PAF and Thrombin induced platelet aggregation.
