      at least one third of women older than 35 years, and after 40 - in every second. We will test
      a new tablet preparation, V3-Myoma, obtained from hydrolyzed, inactivated blood and tumor
      tissues of patients with uterine myoma. When administered orally, V3-Myoma should cause a
      specific anti-tumor immune response and an anti-inflammatory effect. Such an effect is due to
      the phenomenon known in immunology, called oral tolerance, leading to a reduction in tumor
      mass and a decrease in inflammation. An important advantage of our approach is the absence of
      any negative side effects. In the next three month, we will conduct Phase II open label
      clinical study of this intervention in 30 women with confirmed diagnosis of myoma.
