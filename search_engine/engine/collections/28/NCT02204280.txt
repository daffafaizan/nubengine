      leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western countries. Diabetic nephropathy
      has been reported to occur in 25%-40% of people with diabetes. The appearance of
      microalbuminuria usually is regarded as incipient nephropathy, but recently, work has
      suggested that some individuals with diabetes and decreased GFR may not have an increased
      urinary AER.Identification of markers for prediction of the clinical course of diabetic
      nephropathy remains a major challenge. Previous research showed that m/z14766 protein by mass
      spectrometry, was selectively excreted in the urine of diabetic nephropathy patients, the m/z
      14766 mass peaks were identified as UbA52. We suppose that UbA52 can be regard as a simple
      and practical biomarker for diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.
