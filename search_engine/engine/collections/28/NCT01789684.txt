      due to an inherited mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes (BRCA mutation carriers). Breast
      cancer patients who are BRCA mutation carriers have up to a 65% risk for a new primary breast
      cancer in the future. Additionally, BRCA mutation carriers have a 10-45% lifetime risk for
      ovarian cancer.

      Effective options to decrease these high future cancer risks are available to breast cancer
      patients who learn they carry a BRCA mutation - including prophylactic mastectomy and
      oophorectomy. Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy reduce the risks for future primary
      breast cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively, by more than 90%. Because of the high risks
      for future cancer and the opportunity for effective risk reduction among mutation carriers,
      national guidelines consistently recommend referral of breast cancer patients at increased
      risk for hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer (HBOC) to genetic counseling by a
      qualified genetics professional. Lack of implementation of this standard of care constitutes
      an error of omission and jeopardizes patient outcomes.

      We propose a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare a "passive intervention" -
      dissemination of professional guidelines - with an "active intervention" - a multi-faceted
      provider education and decision support intervention to improve 1) appropriate referral of
      breast cancer patients at risk for HBOC to genetic counseling in the community cancer center
      setting and 2) pre-surgical referral among newly diagnosed patients. Ultimately, these
      results will lead to decreased breast and ovarian cancer incidence and mortality among breast
      cancer patients and their family members, as well as improved outcomes of and satisfaction
      with surgical decision-making.
