      interim results from a survey by the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) in this area have
      suggested that practice is variable across the UK. NICE recognize that the earlier persistent
      synovitis is identified and treated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs DMARDs, the
      better the long term outcome and have welcomed the need to determine the role of imaging in
      assisting with this early diagnosis, and whether the added cost is justified by better
      disease outcomes.

      This is a multi-site prospective observational study which investigates the use of ultrasound
      imaging in the context of patients with early arthritis presenting to secondary care. The
      time to commencement of DMARD therapy and diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis are therein
      outcome measures. Patients are followed up for 12 months after their first presentation and
      time to diagnosis or DMARD commencement recorded.
