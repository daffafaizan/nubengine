      occurring in approximately 25-60% of patients. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)
      carries the lowest risk of AF development, with an incidence of approximately 25-30%,
      followed by cardiac valve and combined CABG/cardiac valve surgeries, with incidences up to
      60%. AF development in patients undergoing cardiac procedures has been linked to increases in
      postoperative morbidity and mortality, including an increase in readmission to the ICU,
      stroke, reintubation, and 30-day and 6-month mortality. Patients who develop AF have also
      been shown to experience longer hospital stays, both in the ICU and overall.

      While some other medications have been shown to decrease the risk of AF development, the use
      of beta-blockers peri- and postoperatively have shown the most promise, and are the standard
      of care for patients undergoing CABG surgery. However, patients experiencing AF have been
      shown to experience cardiac production of peroxynitrite, corresponding to a hypothesis that
      AF occurs through oxidative stress. Due to this correlation, supplementation of ascorbate has
      been proposed as a treatment to reduce the risk of AF development following cardiac surgery.
      Ascorbate is a potent peroxynitrite antagonist, and may therefore reduce oxidative stress and
      AF development following cardiac surgery. This trial aims to assess the efficacy of ascorbic
      acid in reducing the incidence of postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective or urgent
      CABG surgery, cardiac valve surgery, or a combination of the two. Our hypothesis is that
      ascorbic acid will decrease the incidence of postoperative AF development.
