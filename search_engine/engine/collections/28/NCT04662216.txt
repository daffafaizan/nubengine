        1. To evaluate if additional subgingival delivery of chloramine and hyaluronic acid gels
           would enhance clinical outcomes of scaling and root planing in periodontitis patients.

        2. To assess if additional subgingival delivery of chloramine and hyaluronic acid gels
           would reduce total counts of periodontopathogenic bacteria compared to scaling and root
           planing alone.

      The treatment will consist of two treatment modalities: (1) Control group - full mouth
      scaling and root planing (SRP) (2) Test group - full mouth SRP + "Perisolv"+ Hyadent BG gels.

      The periodontal treatment will be performed in one session without time restrictions. Under
      local anesthesia, an experienced operator, will perform a full mouth subgingival scaling and
      root planing with an ultrasonic device and Gracey curettes. Afterwards, all teeth will be
      polished using a low-abrasive paste.

      Teeth in the test group (all teeth with PD â‰¥ 5 mm) will adjunctively be treated with
      chloramine gel (Perisolv), which will be inserted into periodontal pockets before and during
      SRP (2 times). The nozzle will be placed in the pocket mesially, lingually, distally and
      bucally. Teeth will be polished and all treated pockets will be filled with hyaluronic acid
      gel.

      Teeth in control group will receive SRP + polishing
