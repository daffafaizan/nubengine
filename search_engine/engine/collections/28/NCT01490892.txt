      Breast Imaging Centers at Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) Hospital and University of
      California, San Diego (UCSD) Hospital). All 450 subjects will receive at most two IV bolus
      injections of Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica, MA), will undergo an unenhanced
      (baseline) and Definity contrast-enhanced US imaging study for evaluation of a breast mass or
      breast abnormality without mass, and will be scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated
      biopsy of the breast lesion under investigation.
