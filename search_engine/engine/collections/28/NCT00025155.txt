      I. Determine the antitumor activity of ixabepilone in patients with recurrent or persistent
      platinum and paclitaxel-refractory ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR)
      receive 2 additional courses after achieving CR.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
