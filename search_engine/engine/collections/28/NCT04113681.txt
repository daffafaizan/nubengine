      embolization for pain control in knee osteoarthrosis.

      Secondary Objective Evaluate the effectiveness of geniculate artery embolization for pain
      control in specific population: young patients between 18 and 50 years old with advanced
      osteoarthritis (KL grade 3 or 4) for whom an orthopedic surgeon has deemed a total knee
      arthroplasty is not an appropriate therapy, and whom have failed conservative management for
      at least 6 months.

      Investigators propose a prospective pilot study on 40 patients with osteoarthrosis.
