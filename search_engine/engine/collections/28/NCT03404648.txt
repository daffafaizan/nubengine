      pelvic mpMRI for accurate staging. The PET/MR imaging findings, including the primary lesion
      with the prostate bed and pelvic lymph nodes, will be correlated with the histopathologic
      result. Researchers aim to provide accurate one-stop shopping opportunity in diagnosis and
      staging of high risk prostate cancer using the C11-choline PET/MR scan.
