    
      OBJECTIVES

      Primary To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) (complete response (CR) + very good
      partial response (VGPR) + partial response (PR)) of patients with multiple myeloma who have
      relapsed or are refractory after bortezomib treatment and will now receive a combination
      therapy of simvastatin, zoledronic acid, bortezomib, bendamustine and methylprednisolone.

      To evaluate safety and tolerability of studied therapy.

      Secondary

        1. To estimate the progression-free Survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), overall
           survival (OS) and duration of response (DOR).

        2. To describe toxicities (frequency and severity) during the treatment. 3 To estimate
           clinical benefit response (CBR) (ORR + minor response (MR)) and stable disease (SD).

      4 Explore factors associated with ORR, PFS, OS, toxicity.
