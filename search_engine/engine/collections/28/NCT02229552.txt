      habituation is slower for overweight/obese compared to leaner youth, but it is not known
      whether this is a result of being overweight, or whether slower habituation is a risk factor
      for weight gain. The goal of this application is to study individual differences in
      behavioral (responding for food) habituation as risk factors for alterations in zBMI and body
      fat over a two year period in 200, 8 to 12 year-old non-overweight children. This project
      will provide the first test of the hypothesis that slow habituation to food is a risk factor
      for increases in zBMI in non-overweight youth.
