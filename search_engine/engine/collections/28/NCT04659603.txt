      date and the cohort; median expected duration of study per participant is estimated at 8
      months for the mBC cohorts and 6 months for the mPAC cohort (up to 1 month for screening, a
      median of 4 or 2 months for treatment in the mBC and mPAC cohorts respectively, a median of 1
      month for EOT, and follow-up visit 90 days after the last IMP administration).
