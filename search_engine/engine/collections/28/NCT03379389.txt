    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, double-dummy, comparative study in parallel groups of
      subjects presenting with recurrent cystitis (â‰¥2 episodes within the past 6 months). After
      initial evaluations including urine culture and antibiogram, a total of 284 subjects will be
      randomized and treated with one of two presentations of urinary antiseptics containing
      methenamine and methylthioninium for six days. After three days of treatment, subjects will
      return to the study center and antibiotic therapy based on the results of the urine culture
      and antibiogram will be initiated for each subject, to be continued for the remaining three
      days of the treatment period. Efficacy assessments will include the UTISA (Urinary Tract
      Infection Symptoms Assessment Questionnaire) together with a global assessment by the
      investigator. Safety assessments will include monitoring of adverse events and laboratory
      tests carried out at each of the three study visits.
