      and function of right atrium haven't shown clearly before and after radiofrequency ablation
      (RFCA).The purpose of the study is to investigate whether RFCA can lead to inverse
      reconstruction of right atrium for atrial fibrillation patients, which diagnosing by speckle
      tracking echocardiography combined with real-time three dimensional echocardiography. All
      patients will be followed up for 12 months.
