      activity and prevents nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as NF-AT that are
      involved in IL-2 gene transcription. As a result, T-cell activation is inhibited with a
      subsequent reduction in the production of cytokines that include IL-2, TNF-α, IL-3, IL-4,
      IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-10; B-cell activation, class-switching and immunoglobulin production are
      also attenuated. Reports on the use of tarcrolimus in the treatment of autoimmune cytopenia
      are anecdotal and describe therapy with a variety of drug dosages.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of tacrolimus on patients with refractory
      autoimmune cytopenia, the side-effects will be documented and plasma concentration of
      tacrolimus will be monitor.
