      morbidity and mortality in China. Rural NCDs patients are more likely to suffer from poverty.
      Nantong city has established a reimbursement plan covering 50% of hypertension and diabetes
      medication costs, however, various barriers prevent patients from taking advantage of this
      policy. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on saving medical costs
      and promoting health in rural populations. Study design: a cluster-randomized controlled
      trial. Study population: village doctors and health insurance officials at township hospitals
      are implementors of the intervention. Patients in the basic public health service system are
      the target populations of the intervention. Randomization: 31 villages are included in the
      study. 1 village is randomly dropped, and the rest of the villages will be randomly assigned
      to the intervention and control group stratified by township with an allocation ratio of 1:1.
      Intervention and follow-up: village doctors will promote policy awareness and support
      patients registration. They will follow-up patients on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th month and
      receive financial incentives based on their performance of supporting patients registration
      and encouraging patients to buy medications in designated medical institutions to be
      reimbursed. Control: The control group would serve as a natural baseline and do not receive
      any intervention. Outcomes: Patients' registration rate, medical costs saved, medication
      compliance rate, and improvements on health indicators will be evaluated based on real-world
      medical examination, prescription, and insurance data. Sample size: an estimated sample of
      5000 patients from 30 clusters will be registered in the policy.
