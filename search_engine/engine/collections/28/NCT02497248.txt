      identification of the mechanisms responsible for maintenance of AF by body surface electrical
      mapping. To achieve this goal, noninvasive mapping of the atrial activity will be correlated
      with simultaneous endocardial mapping (high density contact catheters) using advanced signal
      analyses techniques (Dominant frequency, phase and causality mapping, inverse solution
      problem). These analyses will be performed in patients with different mechanisms of
      maintenance of AF (e.g. paroxysmal, persistent, valvular) undergoing AF ablation for clinical
      indication. Both endocardial and body surface mapping results will be correlated with
      biomarkers levels, MRI scans and AF outcomes of AF ablation at 6 months and 1 year after the
      procedure.

      Wide antrum circumferential pulmonary vein isolation with demonstration of bidirectional
      block will be performed using standard cooled-tip radiofrequency catheters. In patients with
      mitral stenosis, PBMV will be performed according to InoueÂ´s technique followed by wide
      antrum circumferential pulmonary vein isolation. In all patients, MRI/CT scans and fibrosis
      biomarkers will be obtained at baseline, 6 months and 1 year post ablation.
