    
      This is a multisite randomized trial of a parenting intervention in Liberia for caregivers of
      young children. The "Parents Make the Difference" program is designed to teach parents (a)
      skills for decreasing harsh punishments and replacing those with positive ways to manage
      children's behavior and (b) skills for having more positive interactions with their children.
      As a result of positive changes in parenting, the investigators expect that, over time,
      children's behavioral and cognitive well-being will improve and that the intervention will
      prevent future abuse and poor developmental outcomes in the long-term. This study will
      randomize 816 caregivers of children ages 3 or 4 years to 1 of 3 study arms: standard group
      program, group program plus home visits, waitlist control.
