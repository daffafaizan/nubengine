        -  To examine the incidence rate of influenza infection over two flu seasons in patients
           who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the City of Hope National
           Medical Center.

        -  To correlate influenza infection with graft-vs-host disease, age, and transplant type in
           these patients.

        -  To examine and compare the incidence rate of influenza in healthy volunteers to the
           incidence rate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Beginning approximately 2 weeks after vaccination or the onset of flu season,
      patients and healthy participants undergo nasopharyngeal washes every 14-17 days (2-10
      washes) during the months of November-March of the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 flu seasons.
      Samples are analyzed by direct fluorescent antibodies.

      Patients and participants complete case report forms detailing flu-like symptoms experienced
      in the 2 weeks before sample collection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients and 75 healthy volunteers will be accrued for this
      study.
