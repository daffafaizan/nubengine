    
      For each preoperative requested test, we will determine whether the test is indicated based
      on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and whether it
      was effective for adverse effects management or unnecessarily requested.

      An adherent test was defined as a test that followed NICE, while a non-adherent test was
      defined as a test that included an over or under test. Normal test results are based on the
      laboratory reference range of normal values.
