      patient. Copper nickel titanium (CuNiTi) was modified from conventional nickel titanium
      (NiTi) to stabilize the super elasticity properties of the initial nickel titanium (NiTi)
      arch wire against cyclic deformation. The addition of copper to traditional nickel titanium
      enhances thermal reactive properties and consistency of forces.so the aim of the study is to
      Evaluate the efficiency of using copper nickel titanium (CuNiTi) arch wire on the initial
      stage of leveling and alignment regarding their rate of alignment.
