      current antidepressants are based upon the monoamine hypothesis which cannot fully explain
      the etiology of depression. Many patients have significant side effects after treatment with
      antidepressants which hamper the motivation for treatment and medication adherence. NMDA
      hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. MDD is often
      associated with cognitive deficits which are not necessarily recovered by current
      antidepressants. The NMDA receptor regulates synaptic plasticity, memory, and cognition. In
      our previous studies, cognitive improvement has been observed with treatment of NMDA
      enhancers. Therefore, this study will examine the efficacy and safety as well as cognitive
      function improvement of NMDAE in the treatment of MDD in the general adults by comparing with
      sertraline (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]) and placebo. The investigators
      will enroll non-elderly adult patients with MDD for an 8-week treatment. All patients will be
      randomly assigned into three groups: NMDAE, sertraline, or placebo. The investigators will
      biweekly measure clinical performances and side effects. Cognitive functions will be assessed
      at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. The efficacy of three groups
      will be compared.
