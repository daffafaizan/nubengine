        -  Determine the success rate of radical prostatectomy in patients with locally advanced
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Determine the serious toxic event rate of this surgery in these patients.

        -  Determine the pN status of patients treated with this surgery.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients found to have organ-confined tumors (pT2) after
           undergoing this surgery.

        -  Determine the 2-year prostate-specific antigen-free survival rate of patients treated
           with this surgery.

        -  Determine the surgical morbidity rates of patients treated with this surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo limited pelvic lymphadenectomy and then radical retropubic prostatectomy.

      Patients who are found to have pN-positive disease receive further treatment according to the
      investigator's discretion. Patients with pN0 disease are followed every 3 months for 1 year
      and then every 4 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-74 patients will be accrued for this study.
