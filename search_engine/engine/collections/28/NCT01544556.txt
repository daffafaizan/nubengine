      appearance of the scar is a major factor contributing to the aesthetic outcome of the
      procedure and depends largely on the technique of wound closure. The new PrineoTM wound
      closure system was introduced to combine the effectiveness of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate
      (Dermabond TM) together with a self-adhering mesh.Fifty-two women and 8 men aged between 21
      and 65 years scheduled for abdominoplasty were included in the study. Two weeks
      postoperatively, the wounds were examined and graded according to the Hollander Cosmesis
      Scale. At 3- and 6-month follow-up, the aesthetic outcome of the abdominal scar was evaluated
      with the Vancouver Scar Scale. Six months postoperatively, the patients were further asked to
      score their part of the Patient Scar Assessment Scale.The Hollander Cosmesis Scale indicated
      a significantly more favourable overall result with PrineoTM at 2 weeks after surgery. The
      Vancouver Scar Scale demonstrated a better cosmetic outcome in favour of PrineoTM 3 and 6
      months after surgery The Patient Scar Assessment Scale scores 6 months after surgery
      indicated that the patients noted significantly less pain, thickness and irregularity with
      PrineoTM.Based on the investigators results, the investigators conclude that PrineoTM is a
      safe and effective substitute for superficial skin closure, with good cosmetic results and no
      increase in wound complications. The use of PrineoTM decreases operative times and enhances
      patients' postoperative comfort
