    
      This study will utilize a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental approach
      to determine the effects of 8-wk treatment with Suvorexant (BelsomraÂ®) on sympathetic nerve
      activity and baroreflex function in male and female subjects with chronic insomnia. The study
      will utilize established techniques for assessing sleep (polysomnography), blood pressure
      (sphygmomanometer and beat-to-beat finger plethysmography), and peripheral sympathetic nerve
      activity (microneurography). The study will stratify enrollment based upon both age and sex
      (i.e., male vs. female) because these two covariates are known to influence sympathetic nerve
      activity and baroreflex function.
