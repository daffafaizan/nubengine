      doses of radiation received by the tumor and the normal tissues in anal cancer patients
      treated with IMRT, and in those treated with conventional radiotherapy. Second, we wish to
      compare the acute effects of radiation treatment in both groups of patients. Our third
      objective is to evaluate the late effects of radiation treatment in both groups of patients.
      The first two objectives will be studied using a retrospective analysis of patients with anal
      cancer treated at Stanford University Medical Center. The third objective will require these
      patients to complete and return three quality of life questionnaires.
