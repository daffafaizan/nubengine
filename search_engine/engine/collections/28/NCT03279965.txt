    
      In this small single site pilot / feasibility study we aim to recruit approximately 50
      patients over the age of 6 years with known cystic fibrosis (CF) or primary ciliary
      dyskinesia (PCD).

      Patients will be recruited from routine clinic appointments or at admission for inpatient
      investigation and/or treatment at the point of referral for computed tomography (CT)
      examination. If they consent to participation they will undergo MRI examination in addition
      to their standard clinical CT (within 7 days of the CT scan - on the same day if
      practicable).

      The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be anonymised and reported by radiologists,
      blinded to the CT findings. The reports and scores (Eichinger and Brody2) will then be
      compared those of the standard CT to assess concordance between the modalities and inter and
      intra observer variability.

      Potential novel biomarkers (pulmonary ventilation and perfusion (non-contrast) and sinus
      mucus and liver tissue characteristics) will be compared with established markers (including
      lung clearance index) and known CF mutation / PCD type.

      Patients or their carers will also be asked to fill in a short questionnaire comparing the
      differential patient acceptability of CT and MRI examinations. The cost (time, resources etc)
      of each examination will be calculated and compared.
