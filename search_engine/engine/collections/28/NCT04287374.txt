      participants will randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In each condition, participants
      will be asked to complete an initial survey of mental health and well-being measures.
      Following this survey, participants will complete either a well-being skills single-session
      intervention or control single-session intervention (study skills) depending on which
      condition they were assigned to. These single-session interventions educate the participant
      on their focal concept and teach them exercises to improve that skill. Completing the
      single-session intervention will take approximately 20-30 minutes.

      After completing their single-session intervention, all participants will retake the measures
      of mental health and well-being presented to them at the beginning of the program.
      Participants will also be asked to complete measures of intervention feasibility,
      acceptability and appropriateness at this time.

      Following this initial intervention, participants will retake the measures of well-being and
      mental health at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after they completed the intervention. This
      will allow us to fulfill our first objective by determining how long single-session
      interventions improve undergraduate mental health and well-being.
