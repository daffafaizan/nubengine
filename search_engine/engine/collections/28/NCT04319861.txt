      represent a challenge for surgeons. Surgery has been the mainstay of treatment, and the ideal
      goal of anal fistula treatment is to obliterate the fistulous tract, while preserving the
      anal sphincter and avoiding fecal incontinence. The anal fistula plug is a sphincter-sparing
      procedure that uses biological substances to close an anorectal fistula. Several studies have
      preliminarily shown that the anal fistula plug had advantages of simple and repeatable
      application, preservation of sphincter integrity, minimal patient discomfort, and subsequent
      surgical options if needed. The healing rate of anal fistula plug varied widely, which range
      from 14% to 88%, and no significant effect on anal function in the short term. Therefore,
      long-term observation and a large sample size are needed to evaluate the long-term healing
      rate of an anal fistula plug, and the effect on anal function. The aim of this study is to
      assess the long-term therapeutic effect of an anal fistula plug in patients with
      trans-sphincteric fistula-in-ano, as well as the impact on anal function.
