      treatment. These factors taken together with high sputum viscosity and slow motility of the
      gastrointestinal tract-may change the pathogenicity and consistency of the intestinal
      pathogens. Part of the pulmonary infections in CF patients are due to intestinal pathogens. A
      pilot study performed by the researchers using probiotics in CF patients showed a decrease in
      the rate of pulmonary infections. Therefore,we planned a double-blind placebo-controlled
      trial to examine the effect of probiotics on pulmonary infections, sputum bacteria and sputum
      inflammatory markers in CF patients. The study will be a cross-over study of probiotic and
      placebo arms.
