      gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Given the incurable nature of MM it is vital
      to study the development of MM from MGUS to help in identifying early diagnostic and
      treatment opportunities. This project aims to determine if glutamine metabolism in plasma
      cells is vital for their survival and whether it is associated with the progression of MGUS
      to MM. It will involve the utilization of stable isotope resolved metabolomics methods to
      evaluate the utilization of glutamine by the bone marrow plasma cells in MGUS compared to MM.
      Patients with MGUS and MM will undergo bone marrow aspirations after being infused with
      13-carbon labelled glutamine. The subsequent bone marrow plasma cells obtained from these
      aspirates will undergo GC-MS assessments of the TCA cycle isotopomers. This will help
      determine the differences in the utilization of glutamine by the bone marrow plasma cells
      between MGUS and MM.
