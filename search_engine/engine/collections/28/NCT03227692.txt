    
      Objective： To compare the accuracy of knee component alignment between patients operated with
      iASSIST Knee (Investigational group) versus patients operated without iASSIST Knee (Control
      group) using the same implant system.

      Endpoint： Primary： The alignment accuracy of the knee femoral and tibial components at 6
      months for the investigational group compared to the control group.

      Secondary：Health Status after TKA, Operating Room efficiency and Complication rate after TKA
      for the investigational group compared to the control group.
