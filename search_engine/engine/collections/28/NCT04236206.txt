      in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014 (Mathers & Loncar, 2006; WHO, 2018b). The World Health Organization
      (WHO) estimates that diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in 2016 (WHO, 2016; WHO,
      2018a). Current national statistics show that around 17% of all Egyptian adults have
      diabetes, and over 60% of diabetics receive no treatment (Eastern Mediterranean Regional
      Office (EMRO), 2016). According to the WHO, there will be 6,726,000 cases of diabetes in
      Egypt by 2030 (WHO, 2000).

      Almost 45% of patients with T2D cannot achieve adequate glycemic control (HbA1c <7%). Poor
      medication adherence in T2D is a common public health problem and is associated with poor
      glycemic control, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased costs of outpatient care,
      emergency room visits, hospitalization, and managing complications of diabetes (Polonsky &
      Henry, 2016).

      Pharmacists involved in DSMES can help patients achieve therapeutic and lifestyle goals. This
      active participation requires that the pharmacist's practice extend beyond the traditional
      role (Shane-McWhorter et al., 2009). Patients and care providers should work together to
      optimize lifestyle aspects through the entire care process (Abaza & Marschollek, 2017).

      In Egypt, the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) is partially implementing diabetes
      education, mostly in outpatient clinics via educational meetings or counselling with
      physicians/ nurses. Patients often report difficulty sticking to healthy lifestyles. They are
      also liable to forget or ignore their physician's advice after leaving the clinic. Therefore,
      they need an educational method that can easily reach them to make knowledgeable patients and
      save the physician's critical time (Abaza & Marschollek, 2017).

      According to the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) in Egypt, up to
      October 2019, there were 95.25 million mobile subscriptions as opposed to 8.72 million
      fixed-line subscriptions (Ministry of Communication and Information Technology [MCIT], 2019).
      Moreover, there were 38.67 million mobile internet users versus 7.17 million Asymmetric
      Digital Subscriber Line subscriptions in the same month; the mobile internet users could
      reflect the proportion of smartphone owners in the country (MCIT, 2019). In contrary to
      mobile internet or smartphone applications, short message service (SMS) can provide a simple
      way of communication reaching a larger population since almost all types of mobile phones
      support them (Abaza & Marschollek, 2017).
