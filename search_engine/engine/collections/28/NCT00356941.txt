      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin when given with docetaxel and
           thoracic radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB or recurrent
           non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy once a day on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19,
           22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. Patients also receive docetaxel intravenous (IV) over 1
           hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 and oxaliplatin IV over 2-4 hours on days 2,
           9, 16, 23, 30, 37, and 44. Patients with stable or responding disease proceed to
           consolidation therapy.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin during induction therapy until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of induction therapy,
           patients receive consolidation therapy comprising docetaxel IV over 1 hour immediately
           followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2-4 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
           2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      for up to 2 years.
