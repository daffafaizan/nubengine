      order and complete a standardized 10-puff bout (5 minutes) followed by a 60-minute ad libitum
      session with each product (usual brand cigarette, e-cigarette, heat-not-burn). Throughout
      each visit, blood will be collected for nicotine analysis via an IV catheter placed in the
      patient's arm. Blood samples will be aliquoted into two separate vials. One will be analyzed
      for the current study and one will be placed in a biospecimen repository if participant
      provides consent for biorepository. Puff topography will be collected passively throughout
      the session to measure puffing patterns. Participants will complete self-report measures of
      nicotine withdrawal and craving. Finally, breath samples will be collected to measure changes
      in exhaled carbon monoxide, a potent lung toxicant, pre- and post-product use. At the final
      visit, participants will complete a behavioral economics concurrent choice task (see below
      for description) to behaviorally measure their decisions regarding use of e-cigarettes or HNB
      products in place of cigarettes. Finally, participants will be contacted by phone 6 months
      following the conclusion of visit 3 (or study discontinuation) to complete a phone survey.
      The objective of this survey is to assess for ongoing use of study products and is part of
      safety monitoring. We have no hypotheses related to the follow-up.
