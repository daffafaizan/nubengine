    
      The primary objective of the study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      escalating doses of GRT9906 after multiple oral dose administration of prolonged-release (PR)
      tablets to healthy male and female participants

      Secondary objectives were:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (serum and urine) of escalating doses of GRT9906 after
           multiple oral dose administration of PR tablets and

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of escalating doses of GRT9906 by means of
           pupillometry and Cold Pressor Test after multiple oral dose administration of PR
           tablets.

      The doses of GRT9906 in this study were 80, 120, 160, and 200 milligrams (mg) twice daily in
      dose groups 1-4.

      Participants were screened within 28 days prior to the first dosing. Treatment periods
      consisted of 5.6 (first dose group) or 6.6 (second and subsequent dose groups) days:

        -  Day 0 was the day prior to first dosing

        -  Day T was the titration day (day before Day M1; not applicable for the 80 mg dose group)

        -  Days M1 to M4 were the days with repeated dosing

        -  Days F1 and F2 were the follow-up days (24 hours and 48 hours after the last drug
           administration)

        -  A final examination was performed within 4 to 14 days after last dosing.
