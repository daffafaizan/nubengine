      control group received no intravenous fluids, while donors in the two intervention arms
      wither received two liters normal saline or lactated ringers. Chemistries and blood gases
      were obtained before donation, after donation and after resuscitation. Donors hemoglobin
      levels were then compared over time and between study arms. Additionally, lactate and base
      deficit, which are markers of shock, will be collected at the time points as well to measure
      their response to resuscitation. Standard statistical tests were used to compare the
      laboratory values between groups.
