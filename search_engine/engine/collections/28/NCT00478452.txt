      remission or patients with stage I-IV advanced ovarian cancer or primary serous peritoneal
      cancer in clinical remission post treatment for disease recurrence occurring after a
      progression-free interval of at least two years will be eligible. Patients will be evaluated
      by standard imaging techniques. Patients will be randomized to cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2
      (arm 2) or no cyclophosphamide (arm 1). All subjects will receive intradermal injections of
      DC on day 2 and on week 3, 6, and 9 (+ 3 days). All subjects will undergo leukocyte apheresis
      at study enrollment and at week 10, which is the end of active study intervention. All study
      arm 1 and 2 patients (without prior vaccination with the current season's vaccine) will
      receive a single dose of trivalent killed influenza vaccine, and a single dose of Prevnar
      pneumococcal vaccine on the day they receive their first intradermal injections of DC on day
      2.
