      frequent laboratory abnormality is elevation of serum bile acid levels in ICP.

      Bile acids increases both maternal and fetal circulation in ICP. The bile acids has been
      demonstrated to cause arrhythmia and abnormal calcium dynamics in cultured neonatal rat
      cardiomyocytes. Raised maternal bile acid levels have been associated with fetal distress and
      arrhytmia in fetus.

      P-wave dispersion (PWD) is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum
      P-wave durations measured on a 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Increased P-wave
      duration and PWD have been reported in various clinical settings, including atrial flutter,
      coronary artery disease, hypertension, rheumatic mitral stenosis, mitral annular
      calcification, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity.

      So the investigators think that bile acids may alter maternal cardiomyocyte function as
      fetus. The investigators hypothesized that PWD and p wave duration may affect in pregnancy
      with ICP.

      The aim of this study is to investigate maternal P-wave duration and dispersion changes in
      pregnant women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy .
