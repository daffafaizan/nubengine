      proteins) are superior to soy protein in the stimulation of protein anabolism before, during
      and after cycle exercise in COPD and healthy elderly and young subjects, and whether adding
      BCAA to soy protein will increase protein anabolism in these subjects.

      To investigate Leucine, Isoleucine and Valine metabolism during and after exercise in COPD
      and healthy subjects
