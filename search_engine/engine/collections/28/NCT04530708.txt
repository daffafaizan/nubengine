      tumor burden following standard medical treatment results in a superior quality of life
      measured with lung cancer symptom scale (LCSS) in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung
      cancer. The comparison will be made at three months after randomization.

      Secondary objectives: Overall survival, progression-free survival, toxicity and longitudinal
      quality of life measurements.

      Design: Multicentre, randomized, phase III trial. Patients will be registered for the study
      up-front but randomization will be performed after evaluation of response, three months after
      initiating medical treatment with chemotherapy/ chemo-immunotherapy or immunotherapy.
      Randomization will be to thoracic radiotherapy or follow-up (1:1).
