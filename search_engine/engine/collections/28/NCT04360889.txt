    
      Research methods:

        1. Physical examination;

        2. peripheral blood sampling (assessment of the concentration of the markers of endothelial
           dysfunction, including malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SD), catalase( CAT),
           glutathione peroxidase (GP). MDA concentration will be determined with a competitive
           enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), which will be performed using a General MDA assessment kit
           (manufacturer: USCN Life Science Inc. US-CEA597GE). CAT concentration will be determined
           using a competitive enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), which will be performed with a kit for
           quantitative in vitro assessment of catalase (manufacturer: USCN Life Science Inc.
           US-SEC418Hu). GP concentration will be determined with a competitive enzyme immunoassay
           (ELISA), which will be performed using a glutathione peroxidase quantification set
           (abfrontier supplier, Republic of Korea - LF- EK0110). SOD concentration will be
           determined using a competitive enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), which will be performed using
           a total superoxide dismutase detection kit (supplier Cayman Chemical Company, US -
           706002).

        3. Lower limb venous sonography with a linear 5-13 MHz probe;

        4. Patient questionnaire using a Russian-language version of the Quality of life
           questionnaire "SF-36 Health Status Survey"
