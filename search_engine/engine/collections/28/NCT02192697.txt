    
      This study consists of Phase I and Phase II.

      The objectives of Phase I are to determine the following in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations.

        -  safety and tolerability of ASP8273.

        -  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ASP8273
           based on the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) profile.

        -  pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8273.

        -  antitumor activity of ASP8273.

      The objectives of Phase II are to determine the following at the RP2D of ASP8273 in patients
      with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation.

        -  efficacy of ASP8273

        -  safety of ASP8273

        -  PK of ASP8273
