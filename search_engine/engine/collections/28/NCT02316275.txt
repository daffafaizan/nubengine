      management of stress urinary incontinence because of its high success rate and minimally
      invasive nature. However, postoperative management has not kept pace with the modernization
      of sling surgery. Although formal guidelines regarding the resumption of normal activity
      levels have not been established, it is general practice to restrict exercise for a minimum
      of six weeks after surgery.

      For the study, if immediate resumption of normal activity has no impact on intermediate- and
      long-term continence outcomes, it may result in improved quality of life and cost savings
      from a societal perspective.
