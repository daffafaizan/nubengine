      learn control over bodily reactions through feedback visualised on a screen. Typical bodily
      reactions that are displayed is heart rate and muscle tension. Biofeedback has for decades
      been considered as effective preventive treatment of migraine among children and adolescents.
      In spite of that, it is not available to most patients in need. This is most likely because
      it requires specialised stationary equipment and a trained therapist.

      In this project, the researchers have developed a new smartphone biofeedback app connected to
      wearable, wireless sensors measuring muscle tension, finger temperature and heart rate. The
      app and sensors will be used to deliver biofeedback treatment to adolescents suffering for
      migraine. The goal of the study is to investigate the effect of the biofeedback treatment and
      the sham-biofeedback treatment on migraine headaches.
