      associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. There is currently no vaccine to prevent
      COVID-19 or infection with SARS-CoV-2 or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19.

      Many patients with moderate and severe COVID-19, develop a "cytokine storm" that leads to
      severe pulmonary inflammation and various thrombotic events associated with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and potentially death. The combination of masitinib and isoquercetin
      may prevent the development of these two complications. Masitinib is a potent blocker of mast
      cells and macrophages that are contributors to the cytokine storm. Isoquercetin inhibits
      disulfide isomerase (PDI), an enzyme directly involved in the formation of clots, and also
      decreases D-Dimer, a predictor of COVID-19 thrombosis severity.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of the masitinib and isoquercetin
      combination in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint is subject
      clinical status at day 15, using a 7-point ordinal scale that is defined as follows: 1. Not
      hospitalized, no limitations on activities; 2.Not hospitalized, limitation on activities; 3.
      Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4. Hospitalized, requiring supplemental
      oxygen; 5. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 6.
      Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 7. Death.
