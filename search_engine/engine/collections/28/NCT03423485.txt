    
      Colospan is initiating a pivotal clinical prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label
      study designed to evaluate safety and performance profile of the CG-100 Intraluminal Bypass
      Device in patients undergoing colorectal surgery study.

      Up to 137 patients (in total) will be enrolled in up to 12 sites in Europe, Israel and USA.

      Study objectives Primary Objective: To evaluate the performance of the CG-100 Intraluminal
      Bypass Device, in reducing contact of fecal content with an anastomotic site in patients
      undergoing colorectal surgery (open, robotic, or laparoscopic) Secondary Objectives: To
      evaluate Performance in terms of clinical and radiological anastomotic leakage Successful
      positioning and maintenance of device position To assess the ease of the device's application
      and removal Safety: To assess the safety profile of the CG-100 Intraluminal Bypass Device.
