    
      This randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study evaluates
      the safety and efficacy of a weekly subcutaneously injected dose of albiglutide in
      combination with insulin glargine as compared with the combination of insulin glargine and
      preprandial lispro insulin in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Subjects with a historical
      diagnosis of type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled despite the use of insulin
      glargine or other intermediate- or long-acting insulins for >/= 6 months but < 5 years, with
      or without oral antidiabetic medications, who are unable to achieve a glycosylated hemoglobin
      value of < 7% will be recruited into the study. Subjects must also be willing and capable of
      pursuing an intensive regimen of both basal and preprandial insulin.
