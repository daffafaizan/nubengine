      intravenous anesthesia. After intravenous injection of rocuronium 0.6 mg/ kg for muscle
      relaxation, endotracheal intubation would be performed. Then, anesthesiologist attaches the
      sensors of BIS and PLEM 100 on the forehead of the patient, and adheres the neuromuscular
      monitoring device on the medial side of the wrist and the ipsilateral thumb to continuously
      monitor the state of consciousness and muscle relaxation before, during and after surgery.
      Before the end of surgery, the degree of neuromuscular relaxation should be within deep block
      (TOF count <2) and the concentration of 2% propofol should be adjusted for maintaining BIS
      between 50 and 60. Reversal of muscle relaxant could be performed by intravenous injection of
      sugammadex 4 mg/ kg in the case of deep neuromuscular relaxation, and 2 mg / kg in the case
      of shallow muscle relaxation degree under neuromuscular monitoring. After then, monitor and
      record the values of BIS, phase lag entropy monitor (PLEM) 100, and neuromuscular monitoring
      in 1 minute increments for 5 minutes.
