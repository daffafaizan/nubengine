        -  Population 1: pancreatic cancer

        -  Population 2: virus-associated tumors

        -  Population 3: anti-PD-1/L1 refractory non-small lung cancer

        -  Population 4: soft-tissue sarcoma

        -  Population 5: anti-PD-1/L1 refractory bladder cancer

        -  Population 6: anti-PD-1/L1 refractory triple negative breast cancer
