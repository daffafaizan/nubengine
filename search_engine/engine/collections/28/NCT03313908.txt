    
      The study is prospectively conducted during six months of 2017-2018 in the department of
      gynaecology of Montpellier .

      This study includes ten women. Patients will receive both techniques: indocyanine green
      fluorescence (experimental technique) and radiocolloid (reference technique).

      Inclusion will be during the preoperative consultation after checking the inclusion / non
      inclusion criteria and signing a written consent.

      Radioactive localization with technetium will be done on surgery eve like usual. Fluorescence
      localization with ICG will be done in the operating room under general anesthesia by the
      radiologist under ultrasound.

      By a probe (Euromedical instruments), surgeon identified and marked the site of the skin by
      observing the area of the ICG fluorescence. Then, in the same way, the surgeon marked the
      tumor by the radioactive probe detecting the radioactive signal.

      An picture will be made of these two markers and it will be noted the distance between them.
      Dissection and excision of the tumor using the radiocolloid probe (no modification of
      surgical management). At the end of the surgical procedure, verification of no residual
      radioactivity and no residual fluorescence. Again, surgeon identified and marked in the
      excised sample the area of fluorescence and radioactive. The pathological examination of the
      resected specimen will describe positions of mark compared tumor.

      The following data were recorded prospectively: demographics, medical history, localization
      of tumor, surgery, pathology results.
