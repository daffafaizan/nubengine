      administered with carboplatin with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors. II. Determine a safe dose level and schedule for this regimen for phase II
      study in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel and gemcitabine. Patients receive
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes, docetaxel IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes
      on day 1. Patients also receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for approximately 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and
      docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT). If the DLT is grade 4 neutropenia, filgrastim (G-CSF) is added to the regimen
      (administered subcutaneously on days 2-7 and 8-14 or until blood counts recover). A new MTD
      is then determined. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
