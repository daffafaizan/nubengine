      Cat-eye syndrome. Male >female (60:40).It is classified into many types according to the
      degree of descent of the rectal pouch in the pelvis, the fistula between the rectum and the
      urinary system in males and genital system in females. The most common type in males is high
      anorectal malformation with rectourethral fistula

      There are many historical operations for the management of the high type, but the most
      popular operation now is the posterior sagittal anorectoplasty which was published for the
      first time in 1982. Children undergoing posterior sagittal anorectoplasty may have lifelong
      bowel management problems of constipation, incontinence, and encopresis.

      After the introduction of laparoscopy in pediatric surgery, many surgeons hope that the use
      of laparoscopy instead of posterior sagittal anorectoplasty may reduce the complications of
      the complications of the big incision and disturbance of sphincter mechanism which occur in
      posterior sagittal anorectoplasty operation. In addition to its role in diagnosis in complex
      anomalies like cloaca which is well established now. So the question is to what extent can
      the laparoscopy replace usual surgery for anorectal malformation.
