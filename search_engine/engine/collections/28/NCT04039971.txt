      result, ACL reconstruction is at the forefront both in terms of research and development and
      advancements in technique. One focus of research is graft choice and the risks and benefits
      associated with each. There are multiple valid graft choices including bone-patellar
      tendon-bone, hamstring tendon, quadriceps tendon, quadriceps tendon-patellar bone, and
      allograft. Graft choice is often patient centered and based on both patient and surgeon
      considerations such as age, sex, activity level, surgeon preference and graft associated
      complications.

      The present study seeks to compare the intraoperative, immediate perioperative, intermediate
      and long-term outcomes between tendon-bone and all-soft-tissue quadriceps tendon autograft in
      ACL reconstruction in adolescent patients. The investigators will analyze data on operative
      time, cost, complications, recovery of strength and range of motion, return to sports rates,
      patient reported outcomes, and failure rates. With this proposal the investigators hope to
      determine if there is a superior graft technique in this population. Both graft types are
      validated in the literature separately as options for ACL reconstruction in this age group.
      There has been no clinical research comparing the two graft types, and therefore no consensus
      is made among surgeons on whether to use tendon-bone or all-soft-tissue when it comes to the
      QT autograft. A secondary aim of this study is to obtain patient reported outcomes throughout
      the post-operative period to determine if the patient experience is different between the two
      graft types. This data may be used in guiding a surgeon's decision on which type to use with
      their patients.
