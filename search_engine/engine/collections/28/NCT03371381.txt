    
      This study evaluates safety and efficacy of JNJ-64041757 with nivolumab. The total study
      duration will be up to 3 years. It will consist of safety run-in and randomized phase which
      will comprise of Screening phase(Day(D) -28 to D -1),Treatment Phase,End of Adverse Event
      Evaluation Period (100 D after last dose of nivolumab)and Post-treatment Follow-up
      Phase(Every 3 Months). The primary hypothesis is that addition of JNJ-640417577 to nivolumab
      will result in higher objective response rate compared with nivolumab monotherapy in at least
      one of programmed death receptor ligand 1 subgroups in participants with relapsed or
      refractory StageIIIB or StageIV adenocarcinoma of lung. The study procedures include blood
      culture bacterial shedding assessments, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and biomarkers.
      Safety will be monitored throughout study.
