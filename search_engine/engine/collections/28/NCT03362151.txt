      response to three different meal types rich in carbohydrates, that is, white pasta, high
      protein pasta and white rice consumed by individuals with T1DM and to demonstrate that:

        1. The choice of carbohydrates consumed significantly affects the postprandial glycemic
           profile in people with type 1 diabetes and

        2. The consumption of high protein pasta will present a tighter postprandial glycemic
           response.

      Previous studies have evaluated the effect of white pasta and rice on postprandial glycemic
      response in people with type 1 diabetes. With this study, we aim to expand upon these
      findings by ensuring that the results can still be applied to more recent commercial food
      products (pasta, rice), but especially to evaluate the effect of high-protein pasta when
      compared to regularly consumed carbohydrates (white pasta, white rice).

      After consuming the study meal, subjects will participate in an education session (a 2 hour
      class per each meal challenge session). Classes will be taught by a registered dietician and
      diabetes & exercise expert and, as appropriate, a culinary instructor.
