    
      This is a single center, open label study that will assess the efficacy and safety of 52
      weeks of tocilizumab (TCZ) in combination with 8-weeks of prednisone in 30 patients with
      active giant cell arteritis (GCA). Active disease is defined as signs and/or symptoms of GCA
      plus increased inflammatory markers (e.g., erythrosedimentation rate [ESR] and/or C-reactive
      protein [CRP]).

      The study will enroll subjects with new onset and with relapsing/refractory GCA, and consist
      of a screening phase (up to 6 weeks), a treatment phase (52 weeks) and a safety follow up
      phase (4 weeks).

      The primary endpoint of the study, sustained remission, will be assessed at week 52.

      The definition of sustained remission contains 3 elements:

        1. Absence of clinical signs and symptoms of active GCA along with the normalization of the
           ESR (< 40 mm/hour) and CRP (< 10 mg/L).

        2. Completion of the pre-specified prednisone taper protocol

        3. Absence of disease flare (relapse) since the induction of remission by week 8.

      Disease flare is defined as the re-appearance of unequivocal signs or symptoms of active GCA
      (with or without elevation of ESR and/or CRP) or the elevation of the ESR and/or CRP that is
      thought to be due to active GCA and that requires escape therapy.
