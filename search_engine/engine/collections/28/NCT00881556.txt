      and orphan disease and affects approximately 1 in 20,000 people in the United States for a
      cumulative total of close to 20,000[1-4]. There are three major subtypes of inherited EB,
      including EB simplex (EBS), junctional EB (JEB), and dystrophic EB[1-4]. RDEB is among the
      most severe and represents approximately 10% of all forms of EB[1-4]. A rough estimate would
      then project that there are several thousand patients with RDEB in the U.S. at the current
      time. Up to 30 different clinical phenotypes and mutations in at least 10 structural genes in
      different sub-types of EB have been reported[4-8]. In addition to heritable subtypes of EB,
      there is an acquired autoimmune form in which the patients develop auto-antibodies directed
      against similar proteins of the inherited dystrophic forms of EB, including EB acquisita
      (EBA).

      We have previously reported our experience with RIC with BFA [48] in pediatric AlloSCT
      recipients (mean age 9.5 yrs [1.4-21], 11/4 M/F, 10 non-malignant, 5 malignant disease, [6
      sibling, 5 UCB, 5 matched unrelated donor]); median time to ANC ≥ 500/mm3 and platelet count
      ≥20K/mm3 was 22 and 30 days, respectively. Probability of day +180 and 365 donor chimerism
      was 90% (Figure 7), and OS was 95% (Figure 8). This conditioning regimen therefore results in
      a high degree of donor chimerism and survival with minimal regimen related mortality.
