      chronic diseases that provides powerful means to improve therapeutic outcomes and quality of
      patient's life. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) concerns 5 to 10% of the estimated 415 million cases of
      diabetes worldwide in 2016, expected to rise to 642 million by 2040(1). Continuous glucose
      monitoring systems (CGMS) linked to insulin delivery has provided a major advance(2). T1D is
      a serious, currently chronic and costly disease in children or young adults. Indeed, the
      destruction of pancreatic beta-cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency in T1D.
