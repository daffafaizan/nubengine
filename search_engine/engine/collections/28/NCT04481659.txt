      approach laparoscopic partial ISR surgery. Patients with cT3 low rectal cancer are firstly
      treated with standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy until down staged to ycT1 to ycT2. The
      postoperatively functional outcomes and oncologic outcomes between the two groups are
      compared, including anal and sexual function, QOL and local recurrence rate. The operation
      difficulty between the above two groups is also investigated, including operation time, the
      intraoperative and postoperative complications, mesorectum integrity, time for mobilizing the
      intersphincteric plane, the intactness of the fascia of the levator ani muscle, pubis
      coccygeus, puborectalis, and external sphincter.
