      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of itraconazole sequential therapy in
      participants with IPFI. The study duration will be 4 to 6 weeks. The treatment will be
      divided into the intravenous (into a vein) injection period and the oral solution
      administration (giving) period. During the intravenous injection period 200 milligram (mg)
      twice daily loading dose (large initial dose) will be given for first 2 days, 200 mg once
      daily for the subsequent 12 days. Then sequential itraconazole oral solution 200 mg twice
      daily will be given as maintenance therapy (treatment designed to help the original primary
      treatment to succeed) for 2-4 weeks. Participant's clinical, mycological and comprehensive
      efficacy will be assessed at Week 6. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
