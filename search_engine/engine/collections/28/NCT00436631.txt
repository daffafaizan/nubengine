      self-referral.

      Inclusion: over 18 years of age, at least weekly seizures (or 4 per month), tried at least 2
      medications for your seizures, have email and fax access, are not very underweight or have
      high cholesterol, have not had status epilepticus (seizure lasting over 30 minutes) in the
      past 6 months, and have not tried the Atkins diet before or the ketogenic diet within the
      past year. All patients will need to have a local primary care doctor or neurologist willing
      to be available in case of emergencies. You and your local physician both need to speak and
      write in English and patients MUST be in the United States to participate. The patient (NOT a
      caregiver) must be the person to email the investigators - a family member cannot be the
      contact person.

      If the patient agrees, we will send and they will fax back within 2 weeks:

        1. Signed consent

        2. Signed note from their neurologist/primary care provider (attached)

        3. 6 months of medical records to confirm their qualification

        4. 3-day food record (can be emailed by the patient)

        5. Labs (CBC, CMP, fasting lipid profile, urine calcium, urine creatinine, urine hcG (if
           female) (form attached)

      After that, we will send information on how to do the diet via email, they will maintain
      monthly calendars, and after 3 months we will decide if the diet is helpful. After that time
      point, they can continue it on their own with periodic followup with either us or their local
      neurologist.
