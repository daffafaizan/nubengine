      carcinoma are always suffering from synchronous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Previous
      studies illustrated that many patients with multiple esophageal lesions of early stage. In
      clinical practice, those patients are treated by extensive surgical resection of total
      pharyngo-laryngo-esophagectomy plus free jejunum interposition or gastric tube, then followed
      by chemoradiotherapy as standard treatment, resulting in a low quality of life for the
      patients, and due to the above mentioned disadvantages, many patients with synchronous
      superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and head and neck carcinoma refused the
      surgery treatment. Our aims is to summarize the the outcomes of endoscopic treatment for the
      superficial esophageal carcinoma plus surgery of head and neck carcinoma.
