      treatments:

      Day 1: Duodopa in individually optimised dose Day 2: 80% of optimised Duodopa dose + two
      tablets of entacapone at t=0 hours and at t= 6 hours Day 3: 80% of optimised Duodopa dose +
      two tablets of tolcapone at t=0 hours and at t= 6 hours Plasma samples for determination of
      levodopa concentrations will be taken every 30 minutes during 8 hours. Video recordings will
      be performed every 30 min during 8 hours, for later blinded assessments by 2-3 experts.
      Sequences will be in randomised order. Patient self-scores regarding mobility will be
      recorded, every 30 min during 8 hours.
