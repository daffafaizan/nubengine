      now survive. As survival has improved however, growing numbers suffer not only from
      subsequent physical disability, but also persistent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Few interventions address ICU survivors' psychological
      distress. Fewer still address the physical, geographical, and logistical barriers to
      receiving post-discharge support that medically ill populations encounter. Consequently, this
      population suffers with an unmet need of great public health importance.

      Mindfulness is an adaptable self-regulation practice that alleviates psychological distress
      symptoms using a variety of meditative techniques, typically taught face-to face over months.
      As an extension of standard mindfulness practices, the investigators developed a
      telephone-/web-delivered mobile mindfulness-based training (mMBT) system informed by ICU
      survivors' input that could address medically ill patients' delivery barriers. The
      investigators' recent pilot study demonstrated early support for mMBT's feasibility and
      acceptability, now with enhanced content and electronic patient-reported outcomes capability.

      The investigators' early work on mMBT, while promising, identified key knowledge gaps in
      population targeting, plausible ranges of psychological distress estimates relevant to study
      design, and assurance of acceptability that must be addressed before a definitive clinical
      trial is conducted. Therefore, the study team proposes a 2-year pilot study in which 90 ICU
      survivors are randomized to an education control, 'standard' telephone sessions of mMBT, or
      self-directed / app-based mMBT. A mixed methods approach will be used to determine treatment
      effect.
