    
      Women with gestational diabete (GD) who do not meet glycemic control objectives with diet
      will be assigned to two treatment groups randomly. One: metformin at a dose of 850-2550mg
      every 24h; two: insulin detemir associated or not with rapid insulin analogue (aspart)
      according to your glycemic controls. The Metformin group may additionally receive insulin in
      a second time in case the glycemic control is not appropriate with monotherapy.

      The objectives are: Demonstrate that treatment with metformin in women with GD (not
      controlled with diet) can get no lower obstetric and perinatal outcomes than those with
      standard treatment with insulin.

      Demonstrate that glycemic control with metformin in properly selected women, can be
      equivalent to that obtained with insulin.
