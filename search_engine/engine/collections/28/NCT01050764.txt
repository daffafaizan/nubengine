      15-positive (CD15+), CD4+, CD127dim, and FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (T-reg cells) supplemented
      by conventional T-cells (T-con cells), to enhance the efficacy of allogeneic (CliniMACS CD34+
      selected) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), in the setting of leukemia,
      lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This study investigates amelioration of the
      impaired immune recovery and address the significant relapse incidence in the haploidentical
      HSCT setting.

      Pre-transplant myeloablative conditioning will be melphalan; thiotepa; fludarabine and rabbit
      antithymocyte globulin (rATG).

      Stem cell rescue will be with CD34+ selected cells. The rescue infusion will be supplemented
      with infusions of regulatory T-cells (T-reg) and conventional T-cells (T-con) from the same
      donor collection, on Treatment Days 14 and 16 respectively. CD34+ cell infusion day is
      Treatment Day 0.

      T-reg cells are those cells enriched by immunomagnetic selection of CD25+ cells, and further
      purified by flow cytometric cell sorting for the CD15+, CD4+, CD127dim, FoxP3+ cell
      population. These cells are an enriched but naturally-occurring T-cell population.

      T-con cells are unseparated/unfractionated cells, ie, as collected by the peripheral blood
      stem cells apheresis procedure.

      Post-transplant follow-up is for 5 years.
