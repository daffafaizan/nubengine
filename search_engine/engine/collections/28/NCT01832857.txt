    
      Open-Label Single-Arm Design: This is an open-label study, and investigators and subjects are
      not blinded to the treatment. Also, the assignment of patients will not be randomized, since
      this is a single-arm study.

      Treatment with CPI-613: A treatment cycle is 4 weeks, with CPI-613 given on Days 1 and 4 of
      the first 3 weeks.

      Dose and Sample Size: The dose of CPI-613 is 3,000 mg/m2. This is Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) determined from the Phase I dose-escalated trial, Study# CL-CPI-613-009 (conducted in
      patients with hematologic malignancies under IND 107,800). This dose has also been found to
      be well tolerated in another Phase I dose-escalated trial, Study# CL-CPI-613-002 (conducted
      in patients with solid tumor under IND 74,530). There will be 20 evaluable patients with each
      tumor type. Once there are 20 evaluable patients with a particular tumor type has been
      treated with at least 1 cycle, no patients of the same tumor type will be accrued. Dosing
      Delay and Dose Modification of CPI-613 in the Event of Adverse Events: For adverse events
      unrelated to serum creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function but are possibly
      related to CPI-613, the occurrence of Grade 1 toxicity does not generally require dose
      modification for subsequent doses for that patient. However, if Grade 2 toxicity (other than
      alopecia and nausea) probably related to CPI-613 develops, treatment is to be withheld and
      can resume only after the Grade 2 toxicity has been reduced to Grade 1 or below, and the dose
      level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 25% of the dose at which such
      Grade 2 toxicity occurs. Grade 2 alopecia and nausea do not require withholding treatment or
      dose reduction. If Grade 3 or 4 toxicity probably related to CPI-613 develops, dosing of
      CPI-613 of that patient will be withheld and the patient shall be monitored for recovery
      from, and reversibility of, such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity. To resume treatment with CPI-613 for
      a patient who has had CPI-613-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, the Grade 3 or 4 toxicity must
      be reduced to Grade 1 or below, and the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will
      be reduced to 50% of the dose at which such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurs.

      For adverse events related to creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function that are
      possibly related to CPI-613, dosing of the patient will be withheld even if the severity
      level is Grade 1 or above. Treatment can resume only after the toxicity has been reduced to
      Grade 0. The dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 15% if the
      severity level is of Grade 1, by 25% for Grade 2 toxicity, and by 50% for Grade 3 or 4
      toxicity.

      Furthermore, if the toxicity possibly related to CPI-613 is acute renal failure and the
      severity level is Grade 3 or 4, further patient enrollment will be temporarily suspended in
      order to enable assessment of the following aspects of the trial and implementation of
      corrective measures or protocol amendment, and if necessary:

        -  compliance of the study sites and investigators to the study protocol

        -  evaluation of the appropriateness of the procedures for monitoring renal function
