      significant impairment in social, adaptive, and school functioning. Co-occurring conditions,
      such as anxiety, are common and may cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that
      caused by the autism diagnosis. Many children with anxiety disorders, especially those on the
      autism spectrum, do not receive evidence based treatment, which has fueled the development
      and evaluation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Accordingly, we are proposing a
      randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of exposure based CBT that heavily
      incorporates parents (EF-CBT) relative to a TAU condition (TAU) in 50 youth ages 6-12 years
      with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s).
