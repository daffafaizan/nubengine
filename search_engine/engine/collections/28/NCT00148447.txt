      treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients receiving either typical or the
      newer atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine and risperidone) in a double-blind
      placebo-controlled study. As there is no drug treatment that is considered as first-line
      treatment in the treatment of negative symptoms, we thought that the comparison with placebo
      is plausible. However, it is important to note that the patients will receive the commonly
      used treatment for their disorder (i.e. antipsychotic medication).
