      C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) who are na√Øve to anti-HCV therapy.
      Subjects will receive PEG interferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN) 1.5 mcg/kg/week administered once
      weekly plus ribavirin (RBV) 13 + 2 mg/kg/day. The goal of this study is to evaluate two
      different treatment options for anemia and neutropenia associated with the initiation of
      pegylated interferon and ribavirin. This will result in completion of therapy, and possibly a
      better viral sustained response.
