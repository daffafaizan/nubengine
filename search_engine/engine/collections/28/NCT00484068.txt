      (UAER) and improves lipid profile in type 2 diabetic patients with micro- and
      macroalbuminuria in short term studies. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term
      effect of a chicken-based diet (CD) versus enalapril treatment on renal function and lipid
      profile in microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients. In this 12-month controlled clinical
      trial 28 patients were randomized to an experimental diet (CD plus active placebo) or
      enalapril treatment (enalapril 10 mg/day plus patient's usual diet). UAER
      (immunoturbidimetry), blood pressure levels, anthropometric indices, and compliance with the
      diet were evaluated monthly. Glomerular filtration rate (51Cr-EDTA), lipid, glycemic, and
      nutritional indices were measured at baseline, and quarterly. UAER was reduced after CD
      [n=13; 62.8 (38.4-125.1) to 49.1 (6.2-146.5) mcg/min; P<0.001] and after enalapril treatment
      [n=15; 55.8 (22.6-194.3) to 23.1 (4.0-104.9) mcg/min; P<0.001]. The reduction of UAER was
      already significant at 4th month, and there was no difference between the UAER reduction
      after CD [32% (95% CI: 6.7-57.6) and after enalapril treatment [44.7% (95% CI: 28.3-61.1);
      P=0.366]. In conclusion, CD and the ACE inhibitor enalapril promoted similar UAER reduction
      in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. A chicken-based diet might represent
      an additional therapeutic approach to management of diabetic nephropathy.
