      EMG recordings will be performed as well as kinematic data assessments through a gait
      analysis system. Three different slopes will be assessed, using a treadmill. The primary
      outcome measure will be the minimal knee extension value in the stance phase. The changes in
      kinematics will be overall assessed through the Gait Profile Score (Baker et al.). The
      details in changes will be assessed through statistical parametric mapping (SPM). The changes
      in muscle activity induced by the slope will be investigated by statistical parametric
      mapping of the EMG or kinematic data.
