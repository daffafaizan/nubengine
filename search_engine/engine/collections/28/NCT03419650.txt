    
      The study is an investigator initiated study (IIS) single arm treatment, single center where
      patients will receive active treatment with ActharTM 80 units twice weekly for 4 weeks
      followed by 40 units twice weekly until week 12.

      2-End points:

      1.Primary Clinical Endpoint

      1. To demonstrate the efficacy of Acthar for the treatment of patients with active psoriatic
      arthritis and who have not had an adequate response to non-biological DMARDs based on the
      proportion of subjects achieving a 20% improvement in the number of tender and number of
      swollen joints, and a 20% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient global
      assessment, physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), visual analog
      pain scale, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP) as described by
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 at week 12.

      [Time Frame: 12 weeks]

      2.Primary Imaging Endpoints

        1. The improvement of the total DEMRIQ*-Volume score of synovial inflammation measured in
           the Metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and the distal
           interphalangeal (DIP) joints. [Time Frame: baseline to week 24]

           [Time Frame: baseline to week 24]

        2. Secondary Outcome Measures:

      Secondary Imaging Endpoints

      1. The improvement in PSAMRIS* Synovitis score in the Metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal
      interphalangeal (PIP) and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. [Time Frame: baseline to
      week 24]
