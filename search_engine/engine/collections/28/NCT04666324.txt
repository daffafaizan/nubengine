    
      Babies aged 3 to 6 weeks will be diagnosed for infantile colic using the Wessel's criteria.
      Study design will be open label with two parallel arms (Simethicone and Multilac Baby).
      Multilac Baby is a synbiotic product containing probiotic bacteria (six lactobacilli and 3
      bifidobacteria). Effects of treatments on crying behavior will be assessed by using parental
      24h paper diaries. Fecal calprotectin values at the beginning and at the end of the study
      will be evaluated using BÜHLMANN Quantum Blue® Calprotectin High Range (Schönenbuch,
      Switzerland), a quantitative immunoassay.
