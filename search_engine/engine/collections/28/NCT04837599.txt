    
      From August 2021 through August 2022 all patients undergoing a colonoscopy in a
      gastroenterologist's private practice are assigned using randomization tables to one or the
      other above mentioned groups. Time of the endoscopy (ascent, descent and intervention time),
      polyps detected and their histology are written down real time with a tablet computer
      anonymized with the patient number. Furthermore dosage of sedatives and over all satisfaction
      is traced.

        1. endpoint is time gain in the different phase of the colonoscopy

        2. endpoint is adenoma detection rate (ADR)
