      urticaria, recurrent idiopathic angioedema and hereditary angioedema. This study aim to
      compare groups with isolated wheals, isolated angioedema, combination of both and hereditary
      angioedema in terms of coagulation pathways. the main objective is to highlight a difference
      between the rates of different coagulation factors in the 3 groups presenting different
      categories of angiodemes patients with a group of patients with isolated superficial chronic
      urticaria
