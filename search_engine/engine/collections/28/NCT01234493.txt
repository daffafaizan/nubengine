      Weber B-type ankle fractures was designed. To show a clinically significant difference
      (Olerud-Molander ankle score 20%, standard deviation (SD) 24 points, from our previous study)
      between the groups, the sample size was estimated (α=0.05, β=0.2, 20% drop out) to be 30
      patients per group.

      All skeletally mature patients (≥16 years old) with a unilateral Lauge-Hansen
      supination-external rotation type 4 ankle fractures treated within one week after injury at
      our hospital were considered eligible for the present study. Exclusion criteria were
      bilateral ankle fractures, pathologic fractures, concomitant tibial shaft fractures, previous
      significant injury or a fracture of either ankle, significant peripheral neuropathy, soft
      tissue infection in the region on either injured ankle, or inability to complete the study
      protocol.

      After bony fixation, the 7.5-Nm standardized external rotation (ER) stress test for both
      ankles was performed under fluoroscopy. A positive stress examination was defined as a
      difference of more than 2 mm side-to-side in the tibiotalar or tibiofibular clear spaces on
      mortise radiographs. If the stress test was positive, the patient was randomized to either
      syndesmotic transfixation with 3.5-mm tricortical screws or no syndesmotic fixation.

      Clinical outcome was assessed using the Olerud-Molander scoring system, RAND 36-Item Health
      Survey, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure pain and function after a minimum 1-year
      of follow-up.
