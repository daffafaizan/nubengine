      of Langerhans in the pancreas. Symptoms of diabetes present when the mass of
      insulin-producing cells reaches a point where insulin concentration does not suffice to
      maintain proper glycaemia. In many patients β cells regenerate shortly after the diagnosis of
      diabetes and initiation of insulin therapy. This phenomenon is called a remission.

      The aim of this study is to asses influence of occurrence and duration of remission on
      development of chronic complications of diabetes and patients outcome.

      Clinical remission was defined as time in which all of the following criteria were met: HbA1c
      below 6.5 % , dose of exogenous insulin below 0.3 U / kg body weight and serum C-peptide
      concentration above 0.5 ng / ml. Patients were divided into those who were in remission at
      any time during follow-up (remitters) and non-remitters.

      At follow-up occurrence of chronic microvascular complications of diabetes (retinopathy,
      diabetic kidney disease and neuropathy) was evaluated.
