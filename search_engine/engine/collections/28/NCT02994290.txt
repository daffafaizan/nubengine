    
      Administration of the HPV vaccine during the inpatient postpartum hospital stay has the
      potential to be an innovative intervention to improve HPV immunization rates. Following onset
      of pregnancy, the postpartum period becomes the next available opportunity to immunize with
      the HPV vaccine, which is safe in breastfeeding women. The benefits of such an intervention
      include a focus on women engaged with the health care system who are often highly motivated
      to invest in their personal health.

      Specific Aims Aim 1: To evaluate receptivity and concerns of postpartum women with receiving
      the HPV vaccine during the inpatient postpartum admission as part of the Inpatient Postpartum
      HPV Immunization Quality Improvement Program (IPP-HPV).

      Aim 2: To evaluate receptivity and concerns of healthcare providers with inpatient postpartum
      HPV immunization as part of IPP-HPV and to identify facilitators of and barriers to its
      implementation.

      Aim 3: To assess the uptake and effectiveness of a Pilot Quality Improvement Program to
      increase HPV vaccine uptake (IPP-HPV) for Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) Women's Center and
      Center for Women's Health and Midwifery (CWHM) postpartum patients â‰¤ 26 years of age who
      deliver at YNHH York Street Campus (YSC) or Saint Raphael Campus (SRC).
