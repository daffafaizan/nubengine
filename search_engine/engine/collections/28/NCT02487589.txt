      program delivered by a multidisciplinary team through available ICT on recurrent falls in
      elderly discharged from hospital. This objective results in the following research questions:

      Is the program more effective than usual care in preventing new falls after hospital
      discharge?

      Is the program cost-effective compared to usual care when assessed from a community
      perspective?

      Besides the effect and economic evaluations, a process evaluation will be carried out to
      assess the feasibility and the applicability of the program for those receiving and
      implementing the intervention.

      The investigators expect that an intervention program can be effective to reduce falls in
      elderly patients discharged from hospital. The feasibility of the program for the
      participants and the cost-effectiveness analysis will confirm whether or a larger national
      trial is warranted.
