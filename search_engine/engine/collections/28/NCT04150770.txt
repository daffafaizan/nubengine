      and methodology followed the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were provided
      with written informed consent and received a thorough explanation of the study design, aims,
      and the off-label use of infliximab, its potential risks and benefits. This is a prospective
      non-comparative interventional study.

      Participants will receive intravitreal injections of suggested dose of infliximab (5
      mg/kg/dose) and data will be collected prospectively with regard to ophthalmologic outcomes.
      Study participants will be followed for up to 10 months to determine efficacy and side
      effects, and an additional 30 days for safety reports. Descriptive statistics will be
      gathered on participant demographics, uveitis characteristics, change in immunosuppressive
      medications, number of responders, ophthalmologic measures and change in corticosteroid dose
      during the study period.
