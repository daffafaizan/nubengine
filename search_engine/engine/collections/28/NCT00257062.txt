      adults. This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study to determine
      the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin (500 mg once daily for 7 days) compared with
      ciprofloxacin (500 mg once every 12 hours for 10 days) in adults with uncomplicated
      infections of the skin and the supportive layers beneath the skin. The study consists of 3
      visits: one visit for screening and enrollment, and 2 visits for assessment of safety and
      effectiveness (one visit on Days 3 - 5 of the study and one visit [post-therapy] 2 - 7 days
      after the last dose of the study drug). The total duration of patient participation in the
      study is approximately 2 weeks. The primary assessments of effectiveness include the clinical
      response to treatment (categorized at post-therapy as cured, improved, or failed) and the
      microbiological response at post-therapy (the elimination of the disease-causing bacteria,
      categorized as eradicated, partially eradication, or persisted, determined by patient and by
      type of bacteria). Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical examination, and
      laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that treatment
      with levofloxacin is at least as effective and as well tolerated as treatment with
      ciprofloxacin in patients with uncomplicated infections of the skin and the supportive layers
      beneath the skin. One levofloxacin 500 mg tablet by mouth, once daily (and a placebo tablet
      once daily, 12 hours later) for 7 days, followed by one placebo tablet every 12 hours for 3
      days; or one ciprofloxacin 500 mg tablet by mouth once every 12 hours for 10 days.
