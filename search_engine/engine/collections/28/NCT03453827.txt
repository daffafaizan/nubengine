      did not show PES. A standard phacoemulsification procedure followed by IOL implantation was
      performed and patients were followed 4-6 years after surgery (mean=69 months). Best corrected
      visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and capsulorhexis size were measured. IOL
      tilt and IOL decentration were evaluated using Visante Omni anterior segment OCT (Carl Zeiss
      Jena GmBH, Germany). The iTrace VFA (Visual Function Analyzer, Topcon Medical Systems, Inc.)
      was used to measure internal, corneal and total optical aberrations.
