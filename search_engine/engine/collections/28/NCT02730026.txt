      cyclooxigenases (COX) 1 and 2, which determines the inhibition of prostaglandins production
      whose effects potentiate the action of many inflammatory mediators. The protocol for the
      administration of these formulations will involve the administration of a tablet of the
      immediate release product (100 mg) every 12 hours, and one capsule of the modified release
      product (200 mg ketoprofen with omeprazole) every 24 hours, during 4 days.

      The following parameters will be analyzed:

        1. subjective postoperative pain evaluation, with the aid of a visual analogue scale,

        2. mouth opening before the surgery, on the 2nd and 7th postoperative days (moment of
           suture removal),

        3. beginning and duration of the surgery after anesthetic administration,

        4. incidence, type and severity of adverse reactions,

        5. total amount of rescue analgesic medication (paracetamol),

        6. facial swelling measured on the 2nd and 7th postoperative days (in comparison with the
           measurements before the surgery).
