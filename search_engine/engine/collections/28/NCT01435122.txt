    
      This is a bi-institutional, prospective phase II, open-label study. The target population is
      comprised of adult patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic
      carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors are defined as well to moderately differentiated
      neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive tract and lungs. Patients with metastatic carcinoid
      tumors of unknown primary as well as rare primaries (renal, ovarian, thymic, hepatic) will
      also be eligible. Patients will be drawn from two institutions Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC)
      and The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).
