      who were in line with this scheme were detected by fluorimetry and staining, and the primary
      effectiveness evaluation index, secondary effectiveness evaluation index and safety
      evaluation index were established during the operation. Record evaluation. At present, in the
      clinic for sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer, routine medical treatment is a blue
      staining method. A large number of clinical data show that the number of blue staining
      methods was 1-2.4, and the number of fluorescence detection is 2-3.7. Therefore, choosing a
      self controlled clinical trial can increase the number of sentinel lymph node detection.
