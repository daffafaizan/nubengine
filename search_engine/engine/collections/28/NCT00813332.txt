      response rate and survival in patients (pts) with advanced NSCLC and is sFDA-approved for
      this indication. However, there are limited data on the safety and efficacy of Endostar in
      combination with other widely used chemotherapy doublets for NSCLC. Clinical data proved that
      Endostar was a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which could suppress almost 65
      kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent human genome. In this
      clinical trial, there will be 160 patients enrollment, giving Docetaxel (75mg/m2,iv, d1,
      every 3 weeks) plus Endostar(7.5mg/m2/day, iv, d1-d14, every 3 weeks) or Docetaxel with
      placebo. We'll evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Docetaxel plus Endostar treatment to
      NSCLC and hope to provide a promising regimen to advanced lung cancer patients.
