        1. Explore the predictive ability of the VeriStrat signature, by testing for interaction
           between treatment arms (Arm A: erlotinib vs Arm B: docetaxel) and VeriStrat status (VSG
           vs VSP) using as outcome progression free survival.

        2. Explore whether treatment with erlotinib provides progression free survival benefit as
           compared to docetaxel in the VSG group.

        3. Compare progression free survival in the two treatment arms (Arm A: erlotinib vs Arm B:
           docetaxel) in the VSP group.

        4. Explore the prognostic ability of the VeriStrat signature by testing for an overall
           difference in progression free survival between the two VeriStrat groups (in case of no
           significant interaction).

        5. Explore the predictive ability of the VeriStrat signature using the secondary measures
           of clinical efficacy including overall survival, objective response rate, and disease
           control rate.

        6. Compare overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate between
           treatment groups separately in the VSG and VSP groups.

        7. Explore the prognostic ability of the VeriStrat signature by testing for an overall
           difference in overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate between
           the two VeriStrat groups (in case of no significant interaction).

        8. Assess the safety and the tolerability of the two treatments separately in each
           VeriStrat group and overall.
