      must be on one of the following therapies:

        -  Long acting morphine

        -  Oxycodone Participants will be asked to complete a pain diary for approximately 10 days
           and to stop taking their current pain medications the night before they are admitted o
           the GCRC. Once the patients present at the GCRC, they will be started on the IV PCA
           (Patient Controlled Analgesia) Oxymorphone to control their pain. Titration will take
           approximately a total of 8 hrs. At the end of the titration period, patients will be
           discharged home on OPANA ER. The oral dose will be calculated based on the IV PCA use.
           During the titration, patients' pain, vital and side effects will be assessed hourly
           until the 8th hour of the IV PCA titration.

      Patients will be contacted daily by a member of the study team to assess pain and side
      effects. The OPANA ER dose will be adjusted as needed to adequately manage both.

      If patients do not feel as though they are getting adequate pain relief, they can return to
      their previous medication, at which point they are considered withdrawn from the study.

      Patients will undergo an exit examination 2 weeks after they were admitted to the GCRC in
      order to assess pain relief. In addition, a final follow-up telephone interview will take
      place 6 weeks after the initial 1-day stay at the GCRC. Our research staff or physicians will
      ask about your pain treatment and ask which Opioid medication you are currently taking.
