      to decide whether the patch alone is likely to help smokers to quit or whether alternative
      prescription medications may be needed to achieve smoking abstinence. This study applies the
      knowledge gained from this previous research to adapt the smoking cessation treatment
      provided to participants, based on their degree of smoking reduction during the first four
      weeks of nicotine patch treatment. By demonstrating effectiveness of this algorithm, this
      study may lead to further dissemination of the adaptive treatment strategy to other health
      care settings. Additionally, by gathering further information relating genomic markers to
      outcome, the foundation will be laid for potential practical application of this index in
      other settings.
