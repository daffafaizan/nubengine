      proposed. The investigator hypothesize that the data obtained by the Plates are comparable to
      the measurements made by the reference tool, the AMTI platforms during a static
      posturographic examination in MNM, hemiparetic and healthy subjects. The investigator also
      assume that there is good inter-judge reliability of the measurements made on Plates by 2
      assessors for the same patient.
