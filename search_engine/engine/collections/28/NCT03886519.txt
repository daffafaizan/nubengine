      basis to receive either the Bevel/rotate/advance procedure (BRAP) or the Trabut procedure.
      The participants will be followed at 1 day, 2 weeks, 3-6 months, and then 12 months following
      the surgery. The primary study endpoint is recurrence of post-operative trichiasis within 12
      months of surgery. The investigators will conduct logistic regression analysis comparing
      post-operative trichiasis recurrent rates in participants receiving BRAP versus participants
      receiving Trabut. Adjusted analyses will account for demographic characteristics as well as
      trichiasis severity prior to surgery.
