      ferromagnetic. Consequently, it may be possible to use a magnet to remove most corneal
      foreign bodies. There are commercially available products for removing corneal foreign
      bodies, but there are no published studies assessing these devices.

      This will be a prospective interventional study to assess the use of an eye magnet for the
      removal of metallic corneal foreign bodies in the emergency department.

      After the patient signs written, informed consent, the physician will attempt to remove the
      corneal foreign body with the North by Honeywell 326734G Eye Magnet with Loop. If the
      physician is unable to remove the corneal foreign body with the magnet, he or she may proceed
      with standard care.

      The treating physician will fill out a brief data collection form for each patient to track
      various outcomes as discussed below.
