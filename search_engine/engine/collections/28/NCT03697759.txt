      with an individually tailored weekly plan of suggested activities to use in their
      self-management of low back pain.

      The SELFBACK system constitutes a data-driven predictive decision support system that uses
      Case-Based Reasoning methodology to capture and reuse participant cases in order to suggest
      the most suitable self-management plan for participants. The selfBACK system is an
      intelligent system that will adjust the suggested self-management plan to the individual
      participants by using the information available on the participant (baseline questionnaires),
      weekly self-reported of changes in health status through the app, and data on physical
      activity via the step-detecting wristband.

      The weekly plan includes three categories of content; 1) information/education, 2) physical
      activity monitoring through wearing a step-detecting wristband, and 3) strength and
      flexibility exercises.
