      A total of 12 subjects fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited and
      randomly assigned into two treatment group. Group A (early-treatment group) will receive
      transplant of UCBMC isolated from HLA-matched umbilical cord blood at Day 0. Group B
      (delayed-treatment group) will participate in 6 months observation before the UCBMC
      transplantation at Month 6. All subjects will be followed up for 18 months from enrollment at
      Day 0. Long-term follow-up will be carried up to 36 months if applicable.

      The adverse events and safety parameters will be collected and recorded. In addition, the
      stroke scores , gait and brain MRI will be obtained before and after the treatment to assess
      the safety and potential treatment effect of UCBMC in chronic ischemic stroke.
