      under antiretroviral therapy and a Control Group (CG) with 10 individuals without the
      infection; all which were under medical release and insufficiently active. The body
      composition was evaluated through the DXA, as well as the cardiorespiratory aptitude through
      the ergometer and the strength of the upper and lower limbs through dynamometry. Both groups
      conducted interventions with concurrent training for 15 weeks and the interruption of
      exercise was evaluated after a period of 5 weeks.
