    
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single center, nonrandomized study. This continuation protocol
      will consist of eligible subjects who have previously received cholic acid through the
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) Compassionate Use (91-10-10),
      CAC-001-01 study protocols and newly diagnosed subjects.

      New subjects will be infants, children, adolescents identified from urine samples obtained
      from the clinical services of programs across the U.S., Canada, South America, Europe, and
      Asia. Subject or their legal representative will receive information regarding the study, and
      the principle investigator (PI) or designee will obtain informed consent. Serum and urine
      samples will be collected and sent to CCHMC to measure complete bile acid profile analysis.
      Clinical records including medical history, physical exams, vital signs, and laboratory
      assessments performed as standard of care will be reviewed to ensure subject eligibility and
      determine baseline values.

      Subjects who have participated in Protocols conducted under IND 45,470 will be consented to
      continue to receive cholic acid capsules under this continuation protocol. Subjects will
      serve as their own controls and no placebo will be utilized.
