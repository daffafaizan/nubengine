      hip capsule is seen in patients with DDH. The maternal hormone relaxin may also be a factor.
      Extreme hip flexion with knee extension, as in the breech position, tends to promote femoral
      head dislocation and leads to the shortening and contracture of the iliopsoas muscle.

      It was previously reported that DDH was the underlying aetiology in about 25 % of the
      performed hip replacements under the age of 40 years and the initial diagnosis age ranged
      from 0 to 39 years, with a mean of 8 years in these patients.

      The main purpose of a newborn hip screening program is to detect DDH as early as possible, so
      that early treatment can be given and the need for surgical treatment as well as the
      development of residual hip dysplasia can be avoided.

      Ultrasonography offers distinct advantages compared with other imaging techniques: unlike
      plain radiography, it can distinguish the cartilaginous components of the acetabulum and the
      femoral head from other soft tissue structures, real-time US permits multiplanar examinations
      that can early determine the position of the femoral head in respect to the acetabulum; thus
      it provides the same type of information that can be obtained with arthrography, computerized
      tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, but at lower cost, although ultrasonography is
      more expensive than plain radiography, it doesn't require sedation and doesn't involve
      ionizing radiation, unlike other techniques and it allows observation of changes in hip
      position with movement.
