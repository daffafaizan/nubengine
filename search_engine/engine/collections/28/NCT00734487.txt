    
      The primary objective of this study is to identify whether SDOCT patterns such as: drusen
      size, OCT reflectivity within drusen, photoreceptor (PR)change over drusen, microfoci of
      subretinal fluid (SRF), or retinal thickening are predictive of vision loss, progression of
      drusen, progression of photoreceptor loss over drusen, development of choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV), or development of geographic atrophy (GA).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        1. To define the relationship between SDOCT imaging, autofluorescence (AF)imaging, and
           color photographic or other fundus imaging of AREDS 2 patients in both a cross-sectional
           study of baseline data and a longitudinal study in data collected over the 5 year AREDS
           2 study.

        2. To compare the extent of geographic atrophy on SDOCT versus color photographs and
           autofluorescence.

        3. To evaluate whether the SDOCT outcome measures differ significantly between AREDS 2
           patients randomized to different oral supplements in the AREDS2.
