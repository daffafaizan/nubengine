      has been performed on at least 200 million girls and women in 31 countries. According to the
      2015 Egypt Health Issues Survey (EHIS), 87% of all women aged 15-49 years in Egypt had
      undergone FGM. Social norms, religion, ensuring premarital virginity and marital fidelity,
      increasing marriageability, and cultural ideals of femininity and modesty were among the most
      commonly cited reasons for performing FGM. A survey conducted among Egyptians aged 10-29
      years in 2014 indicated that the reasons given for practicing FGM were customs and traditions
      (56.7%) and religion (35%).

      FGM has many types ranging from excision of the prepuce with/out clitoris (Type I or
      Clitoridectomy) and excision of the clitoris and labia minora (Type II or Excision) to
      profound excision of the external genitalia with stitching and tightening the vaginal opening
      (Type III or Infibulation). Type IV describes pricking, piercing, scraping, and cauterization
      of the external genitalia without flesh removal. In societies with Muslim majorities, type I:
      is known as "Sunna Circumcision"; a religious term linking the practice to the commands of
      the Prophet of Islam or "Khifad" the Arabic synonym of "reduction"; a term claiming that the
      Prophet of Islam endorsed partial rather than complete excision of the external genitalia. In
      Egypt, types I and II are also called "Ta-hara"; the Arabic synonym of "purification" which
      points to the hygienic drive of the practice.
