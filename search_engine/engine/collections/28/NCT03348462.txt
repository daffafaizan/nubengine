      scaled plaques. Anthralin (1,8-dihydroxy-9-anthrone) which was introduced over 80 years ago
      has shown excellent efficacy in the management of psoriasis.Anthralin mechanism of action
      involves inhibition of the proliferation of keratinocytes. Further, accumulation of anthralin
      inside the mitochondria impairs energy supply to the cell, probably due to the free radicals
      resulting from oxidation of the drug. Anthralin also interferes with the replication of DNA
      and slows down the extreme cell division that occurs in psoriatic plaques. Although anthralin
      is remarkably effective in the management of psoriasis, its side effects are equally
      disturbing. Its use is messy as it stains the skin, clothing, and any furniture that it may
      come in contact with. Further, anthralin has irritating, burning, brown discoloration and
      necrotizing effect on the normal and the diseased skin. This troublesome profile has
      discouraged wide-spread use of the drug.

      Ethosomes are attractive vesicular carriers mainly composed of phospholipids, ethanol and
      water. The intriguing features of ethosomes are due to their high ethanol content which
      facilitate their penetration through stratum corneum and target deep skin layers. This is
      advantageous over conventional liposomes which have limited penetration through the skin and
      remain confined in the upper layer of the stratum corneum. Compared to liposomes, ethosomes
      had greater retention of methotrexate into the skin for a longer period of time, suggesting
      better therapeutic outcome.
