      computer program to either no counseling or FMRI during the baseline visit in the second
      session for this visit.

      Each time point (baseline, 3 months and 9 months) consists of 2 participant sessions. Session
      1) at baseline is for the purposes of recruiting and determining if participants meet study
      criteria; during all visits, study criteria are reviewed to ensure that enrolled participants
      are still eligible. After determining eligibility, study information is explained by the
      research assistant and consent is then obtained. Additional psychiatric and substance use
      assessment and neurological and will be performed. Blood and urine specimens will be obtained
      and sent to lab for measurement of immunological, virologic, and hepatic status and other
      biomarkers. The remainder of the blood specimens will be frozen and banked for future
      analyses. All blood specimens banks for future analyses will be deidentified. A
      neurocognitive assessment performed by a research assistant. The duration will be
      approximately 120 minutes. Session 2) will occur within one week of visit one. It will
      consist of an MRI scan lasting approximately 50 minutes. Functional imaging will be conducted
      during this MRI time. All participants will undergo all procedures at baseline, and three and
      nine months.
