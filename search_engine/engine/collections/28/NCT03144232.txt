      results in reduced cannabis cue-induced craving in treatment seeking individuals with CUD
      (Aim1). Additionally, the investigators seek to explore the mechanistic underpinnings of any
      observed effect, by collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging data during cannabis
      cue-administration before and after the treatment course (Aim 2). These aims will be
      addressed through a seven week, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study in which 72
      treatment seeking cannabis use disordered participants (36/group) will be given 20 sessions
      of either Active or Sham excitatory rTMS applied to the DLPFC. TMS will be delivered in an
      accelerated fashion over two weeks (2 sessions each day, five days each week). TMS will be
      applied in conjunction with a validated two-session Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)
      behavioral intervention.
