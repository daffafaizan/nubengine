      health effects of dairy foods with regard to obesity related disorders. Low-fat dairy foods
      have shown to be protective, but also high-fat products have been linked to reduced risk in
      some studies. It is well known that dairy products increase LDL-cholesterol in blood, but
      effects on glucose metabolism are unclear. Intervention trials are needed to clarify the
      health effects of dairy foods. Some data have indicated that cheese and milk may have less
      hypercholesterolemic effect compared with butter. Our hypothesis is that milk fat globule
      membranes (MFGM), present in all dairy products except butter, can affect blood lipid
      profile, vascular function, insulin sensitivity, inflammation and gene expression. Such idea
      might explain why different dairy products could have different effects on cholesterol
      levels. The investigators aim to conduct a controlled study to investigate this. Overweight
      subjects will be randomized to one of 2 groups with different types of dairy products:
      1)butter oil; 2) cream (milk fat with MFGM).
