      They will dial the sub-code and enter a unique PIN to access the system. They are asked to do
      this every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning for six months, as well as anytime that they
      experience concerning symptoms. If a participant has not initiated a session by 11:00am on
      the designated days, the application will generate an SMS reminder. Each interactive session
      will present a series of symptom-based questions to the participant. These questions will be
      followed by a tailored SMS message. While session content will not remain on the
      participant's phone, the SMS messages will. This allows participants to retain and review
      messages, thereby reinforcing educational content. There are four status categories: Stable,
      Fluid Overload, Urgent, and Critical. If Stable, participants will be sent one of six
      encouraging and educational messages. If Fluid Overload, Urgent or Critical, patient
      participants will be sent a message that identifies the symptom and recommends an action and
      the on-duty nurse will be sent an accompanying alert. Urgent and Critical alerts will also be
      sent to the on-duty doctor. The nurse is expected to call the patient for Urgent and Critical
      alerts within 60 and 15 minutes, respectively. Nurse phone call interactions will be guided
      by a standard operating manual. One nurse and one doctor will be designated rotating
      'on-duty' responsibility to monitor clinician alerts and the dashboard seven days a week. The
      doctor will be available to provide clinical supervision to the nurse as needed and they will
      have a daily in-person or by-phone.
