      serious consequences for the patient, such as injury, increased pain, hemorrhage,
      self-extubation, and removal of catheters. Emergence agitation is common in ENT surgery. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on the emergence agitation and
      postoperative quality of recovery in adult patients undergoing nasal surgery.
