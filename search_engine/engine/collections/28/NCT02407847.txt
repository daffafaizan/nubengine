      care is high and there are concerns about maintaining the quality of care. Since 80% of the
      complaints shown in out-of-hours care is neither complex nor urgent not all patients
      necessarily have to be seen by a GP.

      A previous study (ID: 80-82800-98-227) indicated that shifting care from GPs to NPs is
      possible in terms of safety and quality of care and resulted in cost savings due to less
      treatment. In that study 4 GPs and 1 NP provided care in the experimental condition and 5 GPs
      provided care in the control condition. Based on the results it is hypothesized that NPs are
      competent to diagnose and treat at least 75% of the complaints shown in out-of-hours primary
      care. Substituting more GPs by NPs in out-of-hours care will probably lead to more cost
      savings.

      In the current study care delivered and direct healthcare costs are compared between
      different team compositions. In the experimental condition care is provided by a team of NPs
      and GPs. The intervention starts with a team of 4 professionals in both the experimental (3
      GPs and 1 NP) and the control (4 GPs) condition; in consecutive stages an extra GP is
      substituted by an NP aiming at replacing 3 out of 4 GPs with by NPs.

      Control: 4 GPs

      Stage 1: experimental: 3 GPs & 1 NP

      Stage 2: experimental: 2 GPs & 2 NPs

      Stage 3: experimental: 1 GP & 3 NPs

      Both feasibility and cost-efficiency will lead to recommendations on the optimal balance in a
      team between GPs and NPs.
