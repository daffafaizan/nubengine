      adoptive cellular therapy in HLA-A*0201 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and
      chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)

      In this study, patient T cells will be gene-modified using a GMP grade retroviral vector
      containing the genes for a WT1-specific, HLA-A2-restricted T cell receptor. This ex vivo gene
      therapy will generate T cells expressing the WT1-specific TCR and thus able to recognise
      WT1-expressing target cells.

      The autologous Cys1 WT1 TCR-transduced T cells will be re-infused back into adult leukaemia
      patients following lymphodepleting conditioning.
