      in moderate and severe obesity. Due to morbid obesity, jejunoileal bypass has been applied
      since 1970. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and jejunoileal anastomosis are among the rare
      techniques described in 2012. There are few studies on this technique.

      Between 2015 and 2018, jejunoileal bypass operations with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for
      morbid obesity will be evaluated in Inonu University gastroenterology surgery clinic. The
      patients' age, gender, body mass index, weight loss in follow-up periods, whether there is
      back weight gain, the effects on metabolic diseases, early and late complications will be
      evaluated.
