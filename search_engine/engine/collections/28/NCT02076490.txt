      that still is perceived in the missing limb, leading to limitations in daily activities and
      quality of life. The treatment of phantom limb pain is still challenging. Despite many
      different pharmacological interventions, the outcomes on the longer-term are in many cases
      not satisfying. Alternative, non-pharmacological interventions, such as mirror therapy, are
      gaining increased recognition in the treatment of phantom limb pain. In this context,
      telerehabilitation plays an important role to support long-term self-management and autonomy
      of these patients.

      In the developmental phase of the project, a user-centred design is applied. Patients as well
      as physical and occupational therapists are interviewed concerning their preferences and
      needs with respect to the design and content of the telerehabilitation. Additionally, two
      focus groups with each five participants will be conducted. Subsequently, a prototype of the
      telerehabilitation will be developed based on user preferences, available evidence, expert
      opinion and already existing systems. This prototype will be tested on its usability and
      technical performance in phase three using the thinking-aloud-method and data logging.
      Accordingly, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of the telerehabilitation.
