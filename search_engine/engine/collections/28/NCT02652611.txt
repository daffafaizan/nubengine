      complaints of pain resolved quickly after a hardware-removal procedure. However, implant
      removal requires a second surgical procedure in scarred tissue, poses a risk for nerve
      damage, infection and re-fractures, and is not a guarantee of pain relief.

      Rates of implant removal vary based on anatomic location and implant selection. Many studies
      have introduced and assessed the outcomes of hardware removal in the ankle, tibia and femur.
      But, there is currently no controlled trial that assesses the benefits and harms of
      sacroiliac (SI) screw removal in pelvic fracture patients.

      Reports in literature are not consistent concerning the incidence of painful hardware and the
      outcome and pain relief after hardware removal. There is conflicting evidence that removing
      hardware decreases acute pain in ankle, tibia, and femur fractures but there is a need to
      explore the effect of SI screw removal in pelvic fracture patients. The investigators propose
      to prospectively randomize patients with a pelvic fracture requiring the use of SI screws for
      stabilization to removal versus non-removal of SI screws and track which group has less pain
      and need for narcotic pain medications.
