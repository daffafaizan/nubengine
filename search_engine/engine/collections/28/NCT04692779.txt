      (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and non-COVID-19 ARDS who are
      intubated, in the prone position and receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care
      units at Rush University Medical Center. In this study design, we will prospectively enroll
      subjects, who fulfill eligibility criteria, to investigate the mechanism of their responses
      to the first three prone positioning sessions, utilizing lung ultrasound (LUS). Inclusion
      criteria include: adult subjects 18 years and older with a diagnosis of ARDS, endotracheally
      intubated and receiving assisted mechanical ventilation, meet criteria for prone positioning
      (ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) of ≤ 150 mm
      Hg with ventilator parameters of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≥ 10 cm H2O and FiO2
      of .60, and order for prone positioning. Patients will be excluded from the study if they
      meet the following criteria: pregnant, tracheostomy, receiving extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO), palliative care, received prone positioning more than once during
      intubation in an outside hospital, or receive invasive ventilation in an outside hospital for
      more than 72 hours. Enrolled subjects will undergo LUS 1 hour before and 1 hour after prone
      positioning by a trained clinician and will be assessed using a LUS score based on LUS
      pattern. LUS will then be performed again 1 hour before supination (16 hours) and assessed by
      a LUS score. This process will be repeated on the first 3 prone sessions. Patients will be
      enrolled in the study for 4 weeks in order to observe patient outcomes.
