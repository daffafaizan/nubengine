      adolescents ages 14-23 and greater 3 months post solid organ transplant will receive either a
      peer mentor or usual care. The investigators will assess changes in quality of life from
      baseline to one year post-study entry. The investigators will also examine adherence changes
      over the same time frame using pharmacy refill data and a questionnaire. Peer mentors will
      provide social support and promote subject self-efficacy primarily via e-communication.
      Changes in social support and self-efficacy will be measured over a one-year period.
