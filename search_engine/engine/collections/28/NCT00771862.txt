    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current and customary analgesia, the addition
      of multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks decrease the incidence and
      severity of post-amputation phantom limb and stump pain.

      Hypothesis 1: Following upper or lower extremity amputation, the incidence of phantom limb
      and/or stump pain will be significantly decreased four weeks following multiple-day
      ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks as compared with patients receiving
      standard-of-care treatment.

      Hypothesis 2: Following upper or lower extremity amputation, the severity of phantom limb
      and/or stump pain will be significantly decreased four weeks following multiple-day
      ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve blocks as compared with patients receiving
      standard-of-care treatment (as measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale).
