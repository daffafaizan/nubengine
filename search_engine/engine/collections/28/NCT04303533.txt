      measures in TASMC. In addition, they will receive a WatchPAT (wearable technology) for
      tracking sleep for 2 nights.

      Participants will receive 10 sessions of NF-EFP once a week for ten weeks. NF-EFP sessions:
      For the duration of each NF-EFP session the participant will be seated comfortably in front
      of a computer screen. A staff member will explain the goal of the meeting to the participant,
      present the equipment to be used and describe the course of the meeting. The EEG-NF practice
      will consist of four-minute segments repeated for up to 30 minutes. During each practice

      degree of successful brain training. The duration of one session is approximately 45 minutes.
