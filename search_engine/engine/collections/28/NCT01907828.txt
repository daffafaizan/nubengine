      Denervation System in conjunction with atrial fibrillation ablation. Up to one hundred
      subjects with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation and uncontrolled hypertension will
      be enrolled in the study. All subjects will undergo cardiac ablation for the treatment of
      atrial fibrillation. Per the 2:1 randomization, a minimum of 50 or 2/3 of the total patient
      cohort will also undergo renal artery ablation. Subjects will be followed up to years (2)
