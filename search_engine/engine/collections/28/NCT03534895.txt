      suggesting antinociceptive and hyperalgesic effects. Anxiety might be a confounder in this
      association. In order to investigate the effect of midazolam on postoperative pain, a
      clinical trial will be conducted in Portuguese ambulatory surgery units. A convenience sample
      with consecutive design will include patients admitted for open inguinal hernia repair,
      varicose vein stripping, knee arthroscopy or hallux valgus surgery under spinal anesthesia.
      Patients will be randomized into 3 premedication groups, and this randomization will be
      stratified for each centre and each type of surgery. Postoperative pain will be blindly
      assessed by telephone interviews at 24h, 7 days, and 3 months.

      The investigators will use multiple regression models to explore the interaction of midazolam
      dose with preoperative anxiety, gender and chronic benzodiazepine use, as they hypothesize
      there might be a differential effect of midazolam on postoperative pain amongst these
      subgroups.
