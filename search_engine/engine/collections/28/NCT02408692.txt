    
      To determine if differences exist in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of levonorgestrel-based
      emergency contraception (LNG-EC) in obese and normal body mass index (BMI) users and test
      whether doubling the dose of LNG-EC in obese women increases total and free LNG serum
      concentrations.

      We enrolled healthy, reproductive-age women with obese and normal BMIs received 1.5 mg LNG
      orally and then in a subsequent menstrual cycle, the obese group also received 3 mg LNG.
      Total and free LNG PK parameters were obtained via serum samples through an indwelling
      catheter at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 h. The primary outcome was the difference in total and
      free LNG concentration maximum (Cmax) between ECx1 and ECx2 in the obese group.
