      designed to collect real-world safety and clinical outcomes in approximately 4,200 patients
      receiving one or more TAXUS Liberté Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents and prasugrel as part of a dual
      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) drug regimen. This is a consecutively-enrolled study with patient
      follow-up through 3 years post index procedure. This study also will contribute patient data
      to an FDA-requested and industry-sponsored research study that will evaluate the optimal
      duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT Study). To facilitate this patient data
      contribution, patients will be assigned to patient groups based upon their co-morbidities and
      stented lesions identified post index procedure.

      All enrolled patients who have been treated with the TAXUS Liberté Stent will be assigned to
      12 months of open-label prasugrel treatment and aspirin. Upon completion of the open-label
      period, patients who are clear of events at 12 months post index procedure will be randomized
      1:1 to either a placebo or prasugrel for an additional 18 months of treatment. All patients
      will receive aspirin therapy throughout the course of the study.
