      under bioinformatics approaches and analyses could help to characterize metabolomic status of
      CSF in aging process. In this prospective study, the investigators plan to enroll 200 health
      volunteers and 40 neurodegenerative diseases patients with received operation under spinal
      anesthesia. Blood and CSF samples will be analyzed using hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic
      resonance (1H-NMR) and lipid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
