        -  Persons who had organic disorders were excluded.

        -  Who had been treated by psychoactive drugs for at least 2 months prior to the study were

      Design

        -  Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups (EEG biofeedback /psychotherapy placebo)
           by block randomization.

        -  EEG biofeedback training was provided for 5 weeks(10 sessions, twice per week). Each
           training session was composed of 6 four minute trials followed by 5 thirty second rest
           periods

           additional assessment, interpretation of the test results and providing information on
           course and treatment of mood disorder.

        -  After subjects completed the training, they participated in a month-long (twice per
           week) self-training session to maintain a similar mental state during neurofeedback
           training sessions without feedback system's assistance.

        -  Subjects who had finished the psychotherapy placebo were referred to other therapists as
