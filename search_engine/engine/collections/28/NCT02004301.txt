    
      The tablets being tested will contain the drug, diclofenac potassium. Diclofenac potassium is
      a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) taken to reduce inflammation and as an
      analgesic, reducing pain in certain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and
      post-operative pain.

      The 2 treatments are as follows:

      Tablet T4: Radiolabelled delayed release diclofenac potassium tablet with time delay of 4 h

      Tablet T6: Radiolabelled delayed release diclofenac potassium tablet with time delay of 6 h

      In this study we will be using a type of radioactive material (known as technetium-99m) which
      is routinely used in investigations of this type. A small amount of technetium-99m will be
      put into each tablet.

      Primary Objective A)To assess the site and time of onset and complete release of radiolabel
      from two delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulations

      Secondary Objectives B)To determine gastrointestinal transit parameters of two
      delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulations C)To determine the plasma concentrations of
      diclofenac at each PK sampling point post-administration of two delayed-release diclofenac
      potassium formulations D)To assess and compare between the two delayed-release diclofenac
      potassium formulations, as a minimum, the following PK parameters: tlag, tmax, Cmax and
      AUC0-15h
