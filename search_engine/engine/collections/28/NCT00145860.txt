           permission to contact their patient to discuss his or her understanding of familial risk
           before patient is contacted.

        2. A letter will be sent to all patients prior to being contacted, notifying them that all
           identifying information will be kept confidential and they may decline to participate at
           any time.

        3. Patients will be called and asked a series of questions about their understanding of
           familial risk of colon cancer, the need for early screening and where they learned what
           they know. If the patient has lacking knowledge they will be educated.

        4. Each patient will be sent informational brochures about colon cancer after the phone
           survey.

        5. Six months later, the patients will be contacted again and asked a series of questions
           about their understanding of familial risk of colon cancer and the need for early
           screening to access how much impact the informational brochures had on their knowledge
           of cancer risk. Patients will be asked one additional demographic question about the
           highest level of education that they have completed.
