      have developed and validated a Brief Tobacco Intervention (BTI) that is currently being
      implemented as part of Technical Training. We found that a motivational interviewing based,
      40 minute BTI was efficacious in increasing perceived harm and decreasing intentions to use
      tobacco in a sample of 1055 Air Force trainees. Although we obtained significant positive
      changes that are predictive of future tobacco use in self-reported intent to use (decreased)
      and self-reported perceived harm (increased), we did not obtain measures of actual tobacco
      resumption following the tobacco use ban in Air Force training. This study will obtain and
      analyze data on these measures.

      Airmen will be consented in the presence of an Ombudsman and randomly assigned to either (1)
      BTI + The Airman's Guide to Remaining Tobacco Free at the beginning of Technical Training,
      (2) The Airman's Guide to Remaining Tobacco Free (no BTI), or (3) the standard smoking
      cessation pamphlet (no BTI). All interventions in this study are command-directed
      interventions provided to all Technical Training students in the 37th Training Group. Airmen
      who are willing to participate in the study will be consented before the administration of
      the brief assessment of the BTI. Immediately following the intervention, consented Airmen
      will receive another assessment to evaluate any immediate changes in several important
      cognitive constructs (e.g., perceived harm, self-efficacy, perceived behavioral control,
      subjective norms, attitudes, intentions). At the end of Technical Training (3 months),
      consented Airmen will complete a final assessment to determine tobacco abstinence.
