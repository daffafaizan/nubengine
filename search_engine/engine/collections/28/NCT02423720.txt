      caregivers. The investigators hypothesize that an audio-based mindfulness intervention will
      be an effective means to reduce distress and improve quality of life among patients with
      advanced cancer and their caregivers. With the Being Present study, conduct an 8-week single
      arm study among UCSF patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy and
      caregivers of these patients (44 participants total). Participants will receive an
      informational booklet containing a practice log and a MP3 player containing an introductory
      lecture and guided meditations. Practice reminders will be sent via text messages. Emails
      will contain practice assignments and links to validated survey instruments. The survey
      instruments (National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer and National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
      adult short forms) will measure global health, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep
      quality before, during, and after the intervention to obtain preliminary estimates of the
      efficacy of the intervention among patients and caregivers on self-reported outcomes.
      Qualitative data will be collected from pre- and post-intervention interviews.
