      preparations and the comparator will be tested observer-blind. Treatments will be randomly
      assigned to the test fields. All subjects will receive all treatments, with intraindividual
      comparison of the treatments.

      Altogether six test fields will be examined per subject (four active AN2728 creams of
      different concentrations: 2 %, 1 %, 0.3 %, 0.03 %, the active ingredient-free vehicle, and a
      marketed corticoid preparation). The test fields will be treated occlusively over a study
      period of 12 days. Topical application of approximately 200 uL of each assigned intervention
      is administered per treatment, for a total of 10 treatments over a 12-day treatment period.
