    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo controlled, inpatient,
      single-center, parallel group evaluation of the potential for oral donepezil to attenuate
      cocaine-induced craving. Non-treatment-seeking cocaine-experienced volunteers will receive
      baseline treatment with intravenous cocaine (30Mg). Forty-two subjects that tolerate baseline
      cocaine infusions will then receive two subsequent intravenous doses of cocaine during
      double-blind treatment with oral placebo or 5 mg daily of donepezil. Each dose of cocaine
      will be preceded or followed by administration of intravenous placebo (saline) in a random
      order.
