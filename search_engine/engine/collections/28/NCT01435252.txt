      cetuximab improves efficacy of RT into the clinic. It is a phase II, randomized, open-label,
      single center study in patients with locoregionally advanced stage III-IV and/or total gross
      tumor volume (tGTV) > 70cc head and neck cancer. This study population is at high risk for
      locoregional recurrence after chemoradiation alone. Tumor stages to be included are T3-4 Nx,
      Tx N2b-N3 (N2b only if â‰¥ 3 ipsilateral nodes involved) M0 and/or tGTV >70 cc (any T, any N,
      M0) squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (HNSCC). All patients will receive in, the so
      called 'Induction Phase' standard chemoradiation (RT up to 70 Gy in combination with weekly
      CDDP 40 mg/m2) and add-on concurrent cetuximab (loading Dose 400 mg/m2, concurrent dose 250
      mg/m2 weekly). The patients are randomized to either add-on consolidation cetuximab (500
      mg/m2 biweekly x 6 over 12 weeks) (Arm A) or no further treatment (Arm B). Randomization will
      take place after Induction Phase. The total number of patients to be included into the study
      is 60 (30 patients per arm). Up to 6 patients may be replaced in case of early drop out to
      reach that aim.

      The sample size of 60 patients is considered to be sufficient to collect first information on
      clinical efficacy and the possible impact of various biomarkers on clinical endpoints. If the
      results of this study will demonstrate that the novel treatment regimen is safe and
      efficacious, a randomized multicenter phase III study will follow.
