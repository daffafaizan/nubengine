      as 7-day ventilator circuit change and no change group by computerization with allocated of
      concealment. The investigation team opened the next sequentially numbered study pack, which
      was stored in the neonatal unit. The assignment sequence was generated with balance within
      random block sizes of 4. Stratification according to birthweight was done before
      randomization to control for differences in patient populations. Patient characteristics were
      recorded as gestational age, sex, birthweight, underlying disease, date of intubation, date
      of extubation, duration of mechanical ventilator, reintubation, length of hospital stay,
      parenteral nutrition, medication (H2-blocker, PPI, narcotic drugs), transfusion and oral
      immune therapy. Laboratory data and radiographic data were recorded. Both groups received
      similarly care as the nurse was assigned to take care of patient in ratio 1-2 patients: 1
      nurse, new disposable circuits were use in both groups and the VAP prevention protocol and
      the endotracheal suctioning protocol which followed by an American Academy of Respiratory
      Care (AARC) clinical practice guidelines were performed in both groups.

      When the VAP was suspected the radiographic data were reviewed by two pediatric radiologists
      on the day of diagnosis, 3 days prior to the diagnosis and/or 2 and 7 days after diagnosis to
      confirm diagnosis of VAP if there is different in the results, the consensus must be made.
