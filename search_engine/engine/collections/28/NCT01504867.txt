      characterized by alveolar-capillary membrane injury and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The
      median time to onset of ARDS is 2 days after hospital presentation. Therefore, the period
      between hospital presentation and the development of ARDS presents a brief window of
      opportunity for ARDS prevention.

      This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2b,
      randomized clinical trial. Development of ARDS was defined by Berlin criteria (modified to
      require invasive mechanical ventilation) within 7 days of hospital admission. The first dose
      of study drug or placebo was administered within 24 hours after presentation to the hospital.
      Important co-interventions were standardized across sites using a web-based tool, Checklist
      for Lung Injury Prevention. Study participants were screened daily for receipt of mechanical
      ventilation and determination of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) or oxygen
      saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2:FIO2). If the participant's SpO2:FIO2
      ratio was consistently below 315, hypoxemia was confirmed with measurement of arterial blood
      gas. Chest radiographs for all intubated patients with a SpO2:FIO2 of 300 or less were
      independently reviewed by both site investigator and a member of the trial's executive
      committee. Study participants who died or were discharged from the hospital before day 7
      without meeting criteria for ARDS were adjudicated as not having ARDS.
