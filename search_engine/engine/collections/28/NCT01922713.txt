      for 3 wk either 1) provitamin A biofortified orange maize and a corn oil capsule, 2) white
      maize and a vitamin A capsule, or 3) white maize and a corn oil capsule. The 'orange maize'
      and 'vitamin A' groups received ~600 ug RAE/d as provitamin A biofortified maize or retinyl
      palmitate, respectively. The 'white maize' group was a negative control group that did not
      receive any supplemental vitamin A.
