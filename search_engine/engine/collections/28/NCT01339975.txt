      into clinical practice leads to conclusive results and makes RCC a particularly well-suited
      tumor type to study factors involved in the angiogenic process. Furthermore the intensive use
      of targeted therapies in clinical practice raised new questions about their management.

      Therefore the identification of new molecular biomarkers is important:

        -  to improve the precision of prognostic models currently based on clinical, biological or
           histopathological variables

        -  to identify high risk patients that could benefit from an adjuvant treatment or a closer
           postoperative follow-up

        -  to predict the response to antiangiogenic therapies and therefore identify the drug
           which is likely to be the most effective within an ever increasing pharmacopeia

        -  to follow the therapy as precisely as possible, predict or attest the disease
           progression justifying a therapeutic modification

      Low CXCL4, CXCL4L1 and CXCR3 tumor expression levels are associated with bad prognosis
      factors in RCC. Consequently their interest in RCC is worth being evaluated, in two subgroups
      : Localized / locally advanced renal cell carcinoma and Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
