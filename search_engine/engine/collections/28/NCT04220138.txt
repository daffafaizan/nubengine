      fixed a chandelier illuminator on the sclera, turned off the microscope light source, and
      visualized the lens by illuminating the vitreous cavity. Furino improved anterior lens
      capsule visibility by staining it with triamcinolone acetonide. Although both techniques were
      effective, both had limitations. Vitreous chamber illumination reduces the visibility of the
      cornea and iris because of the need to turn off the microscope light. Staining the anterior
      lens capsule with triamcinolone acetonide allows for better anterior chamber visualization
      but the lenticular nucleus and cortex remain difficult to see.

      This will be a prospective interventional case series, patients with cataract and poor red
      reflex will undergo phacoemulsification assisted by anterior chamber illumination to overcome
      the problem of poor red reflex.
