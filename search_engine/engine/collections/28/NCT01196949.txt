        1. Inversion ankle sprains are the most frequently encountered injury to the ankle (Ferran
           and Maffulli, 2006) especially in the realm of the sporting arena (Balint et al, 2003;
           Delahunt, 2007; Bozzelle and Kishner, 2008). Up to 40 % of these acutely injured
           participants will progress to a state of chronic ankle instability (CAI) (Verhagen et
           al, 1995; Balint et al, 2003; Ajis and Maffulli, 2006; Ajis et al, 2006). Therefore the
           lateral ankle as well as the management of CAI requires further investigation with
           regard to treatment options.

        2. Peroneal muscle weaknesses as well as proprioceptive deficits have been universally
           encountered in cases of CAI (Reid, 1992; Delahunt, 2007). Studies have indicated that
           coupled peroneal muscle strengthening and proprioception training of the ankle are seen
           as the most efficient means of rehabilitation for CAI (Reid, 1992; Ajis et al, 2006;
           Ajis and Maffulli, 2006; McBride and Ramamurthy, 2006; Caulfield, 2007; Lee and Lin,
           2008). Pellow and Brantingham, (2001) and Gillman, (2004) have reported that
           manipulation is also a successful intervention tool for the treatment of CAI,
           documenting a statistically significant reduction in pain (p=0.007), improved range of
           motion (p=0.199) in the ankle joint as well as improved general functioning of the ankle
           (p=0.004). It has been identified that there are three components (Richie, 2001; Sefton
           et al, 2008) that contribute to the persistence of CAI namely joint fixations (in the
           mortise and subtalar joint) as well as muscular (Richie, 2001) and proprioceptive
           alterations (Richie, 2001; Delahunt, 2007).

        3. It is hypothesised that a combination approach would produce increased clinically and
           statistically significant outcomes as opposed to standard single intervention, inclusive
           of comparatively greater reduction in pain, improvement in range of motion,
           proprioception and function with an associated quicker recovery time (Green et al, 2001;
           Eisenhart et al, 2003; Collins,2004; Vicenzino et al, 2006). There are insufficient
           studies, particularly high quality studies, with the required methodology, to make a
           definitive decision regarding whether this is supported (Van der Wees et al, 2006;
           Whitman et al, 2009). Additionally chiropractors will typically manage a participant
           with CAI with a combination of manipulation and rehabilitation, at present no research
           using such combined therapy by chiropractors has yet been published (Brantingham et al,
           2009).

      3. Research Problem and Aims The aim of the study is to investigate the relative
      effectiveness of a combination of manipulation and rehabilitation as compared to
      rehabilitation only in the treatment for CAI, in terms of participantive and objective
      clinical assessments.

      The specific objectives of the study are:

        1. To determine the relative effectiveness of manipulation and rehabilitation versus
           rehabilitation only, to the ankle joint in terms of objective assessments (algometer,
           berg balance scale, weight bearing ankle dorsiflexion test and foot and ankle disability
           index in participants experiencing CAI syndrome).

        2. To determine the relative effectiveness of manipulation and rehabilitation versus
           rehabilitation only, to the ankle joint in terms of participantive assessments (visual
           analogue scale and motion palpation) in participants experiencing CAI syndrome.
