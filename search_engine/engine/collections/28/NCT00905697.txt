      for brain-dead lung transplantation, as the number of organs for transplantation is
      absolutely short. However, how patient reported measurements including health status,
      dyspnea, psychological status and sleep would change after lung transplantation has not been
      well evaluated. Therefore, in the present study, we aim (1) to compare them before and after
      transplant operations and (2) to analyze how they will change for 5 years.
