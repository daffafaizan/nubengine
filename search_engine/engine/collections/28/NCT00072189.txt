      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity of UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) in metastatic
      melanoma, as determined by the response rate.

      II. To assess the clinical and laboratory toxicities of UCN-01. III. To study the effects of
      UCN-01 administration on potential markers of specific G1-phase cell cycle regulators.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
