      radiotherapy treatment due to cachexia and dysphagia. This negatively affects muscle strength
      and functional capacity.

      Studies on healthy individuals and various groups of patients show that resistance training
      in combination with protein and creatine ingestion is an effective means of increasing muscle
      mass, strength and functional capacity.

      Thus the aim is to investigate the following:

        -  is resistance training and dietary supplements tolerable among head and neck cancer
           patients

        -  the effect of the intervention on muscle mass, strength and functional capacity
