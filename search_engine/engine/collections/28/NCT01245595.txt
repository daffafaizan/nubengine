      fashion. Serum theophylline levels monitor for safety of aminophylline dose. Goal
      theophylline levels is 5-7 mcg/ml. Laboratory results will be faxed directly to the pharmacy
      who will adjust subsequent aminophylline dosing to maintain appropriate theophylline levels.
      Urine output and serum creatinine levels will be monitored to assess acute kidney injury.
      Serum Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) levels will also be monitored.
