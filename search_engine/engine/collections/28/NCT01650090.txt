      anticipated pulmonary benefits of ILC over systemic cisplatin therapy are threefold:

        -  Increased local cisplatin concentrations

        -  Sustained release of cisplatin in the lungs

        -  Minimal systemic exposure to cisplatin

      In this study, patients currently in surgical complete remission (CR) following one or two
      prior relapses of osteosarcoma involving pulmonary disease will be treated with ILC every two
      weeks for up to one year. ILC will be administered via nebulization.
