      Administration (FDA) to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body such
      as the lymph nodes or bone. These drugs are approved individually for use when the cancer has
      become resistant to other treatments, including chemotherapy with docetaxel. The combination
      of these two drugs has not been evaluated, so the research team will study the safety and
      effectiveness of the combination.
