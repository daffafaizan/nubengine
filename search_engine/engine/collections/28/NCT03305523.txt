      Urology Clinics at Yuksekova State Hospital were retrospectively analyzed through the
      hospital registry system. Patients who underwent circumcision with thermocautery technique
      were examined in terms of age, duration of circumcision and complication rates. Complications
      were classified as perioperative (bleeding during the circumcision or under observation at
      the hospital after circumcision that required knotting or cauterization, scrotum or penile
      injury), early postoperative (first 10 days after being discharged) and long-term (late
      postoperative = after 10 days) (skin-mucosal bridge, delayed wound healing, secondary
      phimosis, meatitis).

      Patients were discharged after being kept under observation for 1 hour after circumcision.
      Patients were suggested to apply routine warm sitting bath, daily dressing and the patients
      with phimosis opening were suggested to apply epithelizing cream. On the 10th postoperative
      day, all patients were called for control. Patients who developed complications were included
      in long-term follow-up. Complications were treated.

      Statistical analysis: The data obtained from the study were transferred to a computer
      environment and evaluated with the help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version
      19.0. Chi-square test was used to evaluate categorical data and Mann-Whitney U test was used
      to evaluate quantitative variables. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
