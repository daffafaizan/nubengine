      stimulation on improving the visual acuity in subjects with vision loss from Dry Macular
      Degeneration. The BioCurrent electrical stimulation will be applied by a device with the
      intended use of treating Dry Macular Degeneration. The device delivers a micro-current, an
      electrical current in the one millionth of an ampere range, to the retina in frequencies
      changing in a pre-defined pattern from 5Hz to 80Hz during each spot (40 sec). The device also
      incorporates a voltage limiter (a maximum of 245 micro A is possible) and a current level
      indicator. 200 micro A will be used. Very low electrical micro-current is delivered to the
      subject through the goggle probe.
