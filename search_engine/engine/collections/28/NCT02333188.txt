    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate in cycle #1 in each of three uridine
      diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) genotype groups
      (*1/*1, *1/*28, *28/*28) using genotype-guided dosing of irinotecan (irinotecan
      hydrochloride) as part of the FOLFIRABRAX regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the cumulative dose of each chemotherapy drug (nab-paclitaxel [paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation], irinotecan, 5-FU [fluorouracil]) administered
      in each genotype group.

      II. To determine the response rates (in patients with measurable disease) by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1) for each different disease
      (pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, esophageal/gastric cancer, adenocarcinoma of
      unknown primary) treated in the study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive FOLFIRABRAX comprising paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation intravenously (IV) over 0.5 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 1.5 hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
