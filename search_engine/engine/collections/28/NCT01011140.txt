      Rehabilitation Medicine, Health Disparities Research, the Latin American Association for
      Palliative Care (ALCP) and the Spanish Society for Palliative Care (SECPAL). The proposed
      study involves a 10-15 minute online survey of palliative care physicians from Latin America
      and Spain to assess their attitudes, beliefs and practice patterns related to parenteral
      hydration at the end of life.
