      rates and the achievement of clinical and endoscopic remission. Therapeutic monitoring by
      dosing the residual levels of these biotherapies and specific antibodies, particularly in the
      event of loss of response in order to adapt the treatment, has become common for luminal
      damage. Among these biotherapies, infliximab is the first-line treatment, particularly for
      ano-perineal disease. Effective therapeutic levels are known for luminal damage and must be
      between 3 and 7 mcg/ml but these levels have not yet been determined for ano-perineal damage.
      There are only two recently published studies available that suggest levels probably
      significantly higher than those required for luminal damage â‰¥ 10 mcg/l
