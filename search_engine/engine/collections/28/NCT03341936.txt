      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether it
      works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug/s is being
      studied.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness (how well the drug/s work) of
      nivolumab in combination with lirilumab in participants with SCCHN.

      Nivolumab and lirilumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the
      body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. Both nivolumab and lirilumab have been
      demonstrated to activate the immune system to attack cancer cells in participants with
      different types of cancers.

      In November, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved nivolumab for the
      treatment of participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck (SCCHN). Lirilumab is not FDA approved as of now.
