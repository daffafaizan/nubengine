    
      This is a randomized pilot study to examine the potential use of galantamine as an adjunct to
      the standard buprenorphine or methadone taper in the context of behavioral support. Early
      abstinence from opioids is associated with high relapse rates and there is a great need to
      develop interventions that will prevent relapse to opioid use.

      In this randomized pilot, 30 adults enrolled in the methadone or buprenorphine maintenance
      programs at the APT Foundation and who have sought a medically supervised, voluntary taper
      from these medications will be offered participation in a double-blind, placebo controlled,
      randomized trial of galantamine as an adjunct to standard tapering procedures at this clinic
      along with the combined approach utilizing concurrent behavior therapy. Primary outcomes will
      be: (1) successful completion of taper (achieving a methadone/buprenorphine dose of 0), (2)
      opioid withdrawal symptoms, and (3) opioid use, assessed by self-report and urine samples
      during and up to 3 months after the end of opioid taper. The investigators will also closely
      monitor patient comfort and safety (assessed by opioid withdrawal symptoms, adverse events,
      with measures of stress, sleep and pain) as well as cognitive function (assessed by the
      CANTAB).
