    
      To evaluate the visual and anatomical response to therapy in patients with diabetic macular
      edema (DME) in relation to their glycemic control.

      Patients with DME with central foveal thickness (CFT) > 250µm with no proliferative disease
      had their glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured at baseline and 3 months. CFT by optical
      coherence tomography, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in logMARs were measured at
      baseline, 1, and 3 months. Exclusion criteria: laser or intravitreal injections within 6
      months, hard exudates within 500um of the foveal center, or macular traction. Therapy
      included laser and intravitreal anti VEGFs. HbA1c graded as: G1=<7%, G2= 7-7.9%, G3= 8-8.9%,
      G4 = >9%; and as: low <8%, high ≥ 8%.
