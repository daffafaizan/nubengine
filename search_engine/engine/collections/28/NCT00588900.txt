      Primary

        -  To determine the proportion of patients who are free from progression at 12 weeks from
           the start of second-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine objective response rate.

        -  To determine overall survival.

        -  To further define the dosing and safety profile of irinotecan hydrochloride and
           cediranib.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and oral
      cediranib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years
      from study entry.
