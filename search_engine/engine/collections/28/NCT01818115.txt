    
      This is a post-market, prospective, single-masked, randomized, controlled, multicenter
      clinical trial comparing Cataract Extraction (CE) surgery + Hydrus Implant vs CE surgery
      alone for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with a positive diagnosis
      for open angle glaucoma (POAG) or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma. Eligible patients will be
      scheduled for cataract surgery. At the time of the procedure, qualified subjects will be
      randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups: Hydrus Implant with cataract surgery or cataract
      surgery alone. Post-operative follow up will be conducted at regular intervals.
