      USL261 (intranasal midazolam) versus placebo to acutely treat a seizure cluster episode, were
      eligible to to enroll in this open-label extension study (P261-402). The participant's
      caregiver administered a USL261 5 milligram (mg) dose for a seizure episode meeting study
      criteria. A second USL261 5 mg dose could be administered after 10 minutes and up to 6 hours
      after the first dose for persistent or recurrent seizures, unless the participant met
      exclusions to administration of the second dose. A participant could have more than 1 seizure
      cluster episode treated during his/her study participation.
