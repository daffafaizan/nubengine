    
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the integration of a smoke-free homes
      intervention into the clinical guidelines for tobacco cessation can encourage sustained
      smoking cessation in low-income primary care patients. The intervention consists of five
      components, three interactive mailings and two coaching calls, focused on creating home and
      vehicle(s) smoking bans among smokers.
