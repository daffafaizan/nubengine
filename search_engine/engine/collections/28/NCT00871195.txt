      the blood type of the mother (ABO and RhD). An antibody screen for anti-red cell antibodies
      in the mother's serum is also performed.

      Postpartum prophylactic treatment of RhD negative women with anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent
      "RhD Disease", or hemolytic disease of the fetus/newborn, was initiated in the 1960's. In the
      mid 1980's, the routine administration of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin became the standard
      of care as well. Although these treatments have dramatically reduced the incidence of RhD
      Disease, approximately 40% of all RhD negative pregnancies continue to receive unnecessary
      injections of antenatal anti-D immunoglobulin.

      Genotyping platforms such as MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry allow for precise and sensitive
      detection of fetal-specific (paternally derived) alleles in maternal plasma. In this study,
      Sequenom's MassARRAY technology will be used to assess a noninvasive test for fetal RHD
      genotyping in a clinical setting.
