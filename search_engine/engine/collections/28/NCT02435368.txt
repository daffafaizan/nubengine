      to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and
      lupus nephritis (LN). We are the first to show that mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active
      metabolite of MMF, in association with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is able to promote the
      secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, which contradicts the traditional conception that
      immunosuppressants inhibit the secretion of inflammatory factors.

      In this study, we first determined the effects of MPA in association with LPS on IL-1β
      production. Then, we explored whether the synergized effect on IL-1β production was mediated
      through the nuclear factor （NF）-κB pathway that produces more pro-IL-1β, or through the
      triggering of NLRP3 inflammasome that leads to enhanced activation of caspase-1 and
      accelerated degradation of pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β.

      This study is not only conducive to clarify the mechanisms, signal transduction pathways and
      potential clinical significances of IL-1β production in LPS and MPA combined treatment, but
      also to provide experimental data as well as theoretical rationales for more effective and
      more logical immunosuppressive protocols.
