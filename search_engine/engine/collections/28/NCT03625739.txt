    
      1.Establish population pharmacokinetic (PPK) models of each anti-tuberculsis drug in children
      by nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM).

        1. At different timepoint after anti-tuberculsis drug administration, plasma samples of 100
           children will be collected from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and pneumology
           department for each drug. The clinical information includes demography, medication,
           concentration data, blood biochemical parameters and so on .

        2. Plasma samples will be tested by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

        3. PPK models of anti-tuberculsis drug will be established by NONMEM program.

        4. The reliability and stability of the PPK model will be evaluated by 1000 times of
           Bootstrap procedure and normalized predictive distribution error (NPDE).

      2.Evaluation of the clinical feasibility and safety of individualized dosing.

        1. According the results of PPK models, the investigators will use dosages recommended in
           models to cure TB children in prospective studies. For anti-tuberculsis drug, 50
           children will be collected.

        2. The investigators will compare the therapeutic effects and safety between children with
           conventional therapies and children with individualized therapies, including proportions
           of children with effective drug concentration, improvement speed of of children, liver
           and kidney functions of of children, adverse reactions of drugs and so on.
