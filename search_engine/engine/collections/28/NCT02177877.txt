      will document the feasibility of accurately recording and logging seizures into a cloud-based
      diary, under circumstances of controlled video-EEG monitoring to serve as a comparison "gold
      standard." More explicitly, we are testing the efficacy of the wristwatch in capturing
      movement parameters correlated with seizure activity and whether these parameters can be
      accurately uploaded into an online epilepsy diary. In the future, biosensor data could be
      valuable to more precisely obtain seizure data for clinical decision making as well as use in
      clinical trials.
