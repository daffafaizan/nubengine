      surgeons use varying rod sizes not based on scientific evidence, but because of personal
      preference, availability and company loyalty. To date there has been no literature evaluating
      the benefit or harm of one rod size versus the other. Our dual-arm prospective study will
      evaluate the amount of radiographic correction obtained using the 5.5mm versus the 6.35mm
      stainless steel instrumentation rods. These are both standard rods used in the community for
      this particular procedure, thus no additional risk exists for the patient. The results of
      this study will help guide surgeons in their decision making process when faced with the
      multitude of options offered by implant manufactures.

      Comparison(s): 5.5mm stainless steel spinal rod versus 6.35mm stainless steel spinal rod for
      correction of juvenile and idiopathic scoliosis curves.
