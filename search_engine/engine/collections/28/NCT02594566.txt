      trial. A total of 3 injections of the vaccine will be given at Days 0, 28 (+4 days), and 56
      (+4 days). There are follow-up visits 7 days after each vaccination, one follow-up visit 28
      days after the 3rd (last) vaccination, and a final visit 3 months later. Blood and urine
      samples will be collected at each vaccination and follow-up visit. The participant will be
      asked to complete a telephone call follow-up at 1 year after receiving the last vaccination.

      Participants will be required to complete subject diary cards throughout the study until the
      telephone call follow-up at approximately Day 420 (i.e., 12 months following the 3rd and
      final dose scheduled for Day 56). Diary cards will be reviewed with the study staff at each
      visit and during the Day 420 telephone call.
