      which will allow the conduct of patient-centered observational studies on AF across the
      multiple institutions of the PaTH network. Creating the AF Clinician-Patient Partnership
      Cohort will involve:

        1. Recruiting patients with AF to participate in the PaTH Network AF Clinician-Patient
           Partnership Cohort

        2. Administering surveys to the AF Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort approximately every
           6 months to collect patient reported outcomes (PROs)

        3. Collecting individual patient health record data into the AF Clinician-Patient
           Partnership Cohort database

        4. Tracking whether the patient participant has biospecimens in a PaTH site biorepository
           and prepare for possible sharing of biospecimens in future studies.

        5. Identifying potential participants for future research studies.

      The secondary objectives are to use the PaTH Network AF Clinician-Patient Partnership Cohort
      to answer patient-centered research questions including:

        1. What is the incidence of complications requiring re-hospitalization after an ablation
           procedure for AF?

        2. What are the predictors of major bleeding and stroke among patients that receive each
           anticoagulant class (vit K antagonist, direct factor X inhibitor, direct thrombin
           inhibitor)?

        3. Is the longitudinal change in applied cognition-executive function score in AF patients
           associated with the choice of rate versus rhythm control and anticoagulation strategy?
