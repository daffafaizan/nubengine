      it is helpful to break them down into component processes and examine how each of these
      component processes is supported by brain. One way to do this is to safely and reversibly
      impair the function of a brain region that are believed to support some of these component
      processes and observe changes in behavior.

      A high-resolution three-dimensional image of a participant's brain will be created using
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning (about 10 minutes in the scanner). Either the same
      day or on a following day, participants will return and will be exposed to emotional and/or
      neutral stimuli. Either before or after being exposed to the stimuli, the participants will
      have their brain mildly stimulated using rTMS. This stimulation will be at or below the
      levels which the FDA has deemed safe for treatment of depression, and will temporarily reduce
      brain activity in the targeted area. The behavior of the participant's memory, emotional
      processing, or related cognitive functions will be tested by asking them questions about
      emotional and/or neutral stimuli. Depending on which condition the participant is part of,
      the researchers may then bring the participant back, and repeat this procedure on a different
      day stimulating another brain region.

      Up to 80 participants will be identified via word of mouth, the psychology department
      research pool, and via flyers posted on Emory campus. Participants will give informed consent
      to participate and will be compensated for their time.
