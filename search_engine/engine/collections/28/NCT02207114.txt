      Phase I of the study is to identify the biomarker, or combination of biomarkers, that
      provides optimal test characteristics in identifying adults and children/neonates with
      presumed sepsis who have a very low likelihood of bacterial infection. Results of Phase I
      will result in development of a biomarker-based algorithm to inform need for antibiotic use
      in ICU patients. In Phase II, the impact of this biomarker-based algorithm on reducing
      antibiotic use in the ICU will be determined. Costs or savings associated with the algorithm
      will also be assessed.
