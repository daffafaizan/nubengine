    
      A Randomized, Double-Masked Trial of Caspofungin (50 mg/day) Versus Placebo as Prophylaxis of
      Invasive Candidiasis in HighRisk Adults in the Critical Care Setting for up to 28 days with
      observation of primary outcome through 7 days after study therapy. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of caspofungin as prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis
      in high-risk ICU patients as opposed to those receiving placebo whereas the secondary
      objectives are as follows: To evaluate the utility of surrogate markers for the diagnosis of
      invasive candidiasis, to assess the effect of colonization as a risk factor in developing the
      disease, evaluate the safety of prophylactic caspofungin in subjects who discontinue the
      study due to drug-related adverse events versus subjects with 1 or more drug-related adverse
      events and to evaluate the all-cause mortality.
