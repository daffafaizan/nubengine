    
      This was a Phase III, randomized, open-label, multi-center, three arm study of lapatinib plus
      trastuzumab plus an aromatase inhibitor (AI), trastuzumab plus an AI, or lapatinib plus an AI
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these regimens as first- or second-line therapy in
      postmenopausal subjects with hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2-positive metastatic breast
      cancer (MBC) who have received prior trastuzumab and endocrine therapies. Eligible subjects
      was postmenopausal; had tumors that are ER and/or PgR positive and HER2-positive; had Stage
      IV metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of
      lapatinib/trastuzumab/AI combination versus (vs.) trastuzumab/AI combination for progression
      free survival. The secondary objectives were to evaluate progression free survival in
      trastuzumab/AI vs. lapatinib/AI and trastuzumab/lapatinib/AI vs. lapatinib/AI, overall
      survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit rate, the safety and tolerability of all
      three treatment groups (lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus an AI, trastuzumab plus an AI, or
      lapatinib plus an AI), and quality of life status relative to baseline.
