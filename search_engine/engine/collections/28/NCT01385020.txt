      periods was 4 days. In first period, 600 mg red yeast rice capsule (LipoCol) was administered
      orally with 240 mL water at 8 AM. In second period, subjects took 600 mg gemfibrozil (two
      Lopid 300-mg capsule) at 7 AM and 7 PM for 2 days. On day 3, subjects took 600 mg gemfibrozil
      at 7 AM then 600 mg red yeast rice capsule was administered orally with 240 mL water at 8 AM.
      The volunteers had fasted overnight, a breakfast and dinner was severed 0.5 hour after the
      administration of gemfibrozil. In addition, a high fat breakfast was served 0.5 hour before
      and standard meal was served 4 and 10 hours after the administration of red yeast rice
      (LipoCol).

      The blood samples will be drawn prior to the dosing, and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8 and
      12 hours after the administration of red yeast rice(LipoCol)for detecting the plasma
      concentration of lovastatin and lovastatin acid. In addition, the blood samples will be drawn
      prior to the dosing, and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 hours after the administration of red yeast rice
      (LipoCol) for detecting the plasma concentration of creatine kinase (CK) and co-enzyme Q10.
