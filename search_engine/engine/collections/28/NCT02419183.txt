      research study), randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by a chance), crossover
      (participants may receive different treatments sequentially during the trial) study. The
      study consists of a Screening Phase (Day -3 up to and including Day 1), Test Phase (Test Day
      1 and Test Day 2 [within 7 to 14 days following Test Day 1]) and an optional follow-up visit
      within 7 days after the last study-related activity for participants who experienced an
      adverse event that had not resolved by the end of the last test visit.The NC and MCI
      participants will initially either undergo a standard version of the RAVLT test or the
      SAMSTAR version of the RAVLT test on Test Day 1 or on the same day as screening, with
      follow-up testing using the other test using a crossover design to be conducted within 1 to 2
      weeks at the same venue (Test Day 2). There will be a 7-to 14-day memory washout period
      between the test periods. No investigational medicinal product will be administered. The
      maximum study duration for a participant will not exceed 3 weeks.
