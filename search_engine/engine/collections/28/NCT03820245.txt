      study participation. First, the health status of volunteers was analysed by questioner
      application (to evaluate lifestyle, family history, individual characteristics),
      anthropometric (height, weight, waist circumference) and biochemical parameters (glucose,
      lipid profile, transaminases, urea, creatinine) measurements. According to inclusion
      criteria, 18 volunteers were able to study participation, but just 16 people remained until
      the end of the study.

      Each treatment was composed by 7 capsules (containing 0.05 mg carotenoid or placebo/kg b.w.)
      which should be consumed once a day (preferably in the morning), during 7 days. It was
      conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial, where 16
      participants received 4 proposed treatments (bixin, norbixin, lycopene and placebo) in
      different periods. To plasma, serum and red blood cells (RBC) obtainment, 2 fasting blood
      collections were made, in the beginning (Day 0) and the end (Day 7) of each treatment. These
      samples were used for evaluating the ex vivo oxidation of LDL induced by copper sulphate and
      biochemical and oxidative biomarkers measurements.
