      with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). DAPHNE scientific staff have therefore developed a
      quantification and follow-up scale specifically dedicated to patients with FTD in current
      clinical practice. This scale is called DAPHNE to Disinhibition, Apathy, Perseveration,
      Hyperorality, Negligence and loss of Empathy. This study aims to validate this scale. This
      validation will include methodological steps required to develop a new clinical tool, by
      studying internal consistency, loyalty, and concurrent validity in comparison with validated
      existing tools. Complementarily, sensitivity and specificity will be assessed via a control
      population including patients with Alzheimer's disease, , progressive supranuclear palsy and
      bipolar disorder with cognitive disorders.
