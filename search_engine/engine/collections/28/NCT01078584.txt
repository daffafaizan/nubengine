      Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines and as per standard practice of care. Data
      collection is recorded on the appropriate case report forms. The data collected consist of:
      patient demographics (gender, race, age, weight), blood pressure readings, heart rate,
      coexisting comorbidities, concomitant chronic medications (generic name and dosage),
      indication and dose for trandolapril (Mavik®) and patient compliance. Laboratory values
      (microalbuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate) are only collected if the data are
      available for each patient. For baseline values (study Day 0), any laboratory value recorded
      within the past year prior to the baseline visit (Visit 1) is recorded, if the value is
      available. As per Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommendations and as a support
      and educational measure, patients are provided with (1) educational tools (nutrition
      guidebooks) and (2) home blood pressure monitoring devices. As per research and development
      guidelines, blood pressure devices were retrieved at the end of the study. Approximately
      8,000 hypertensive participants were enrolled in the study at up to 700 sites across Canada.
      Sample size estimations were based on the assumption that 67.2% of non-diabetic hypertensive
      participants (assumed to make up to 69% of the eligible participant population) would reach a
      blood pressure target of <140/90mm Hg, while 22% of diabetes participants (31% of the
      eligible population) would meet a blood pressure target of <130/80 mm Hg with trandolapril
      (Mavik®) therapy.
