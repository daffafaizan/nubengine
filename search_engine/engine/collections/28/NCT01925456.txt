    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the validity and responsiveness of pragmatic patient reported
      outcome instruments to measure clinical effectiveness, adherence and utility preference
      scores in adults undergoing treatment with anti-cholinergic medications for overactive
      bladder. We will perform a prospective cohort study of adults with OAB undergoing treatment
      with anti-cholinergic medication. We will compare improvement in urinary symptoms (clinical
      effectiveness), adherence, and change in utility preference scores from baseline to 3 months
      of treatment using new and existing 'gold standard' instruments. The results will be
      informative as to which, if any of these pragmatic instruments, is useful for measuring
      effectiveness, adherence, and utility preference scores in the 'real world' clinical setting.

      Specific Aim 2: To use the newly validated pragmatic instruments to measure the impact of
      adherence on clinical effectiveness and health related quality of life in a real world
      clinical setting in adults undergoing treatment with anti-cholinergic medications for
      overactive bladder. The impact of adherence on clinical effectiveness and health related
      quality of life will be measured through comparisons in adults with high and low adherence to
      anti-cholinergic medication. This aim will corroborate the findings of aim 1 and establish if
      pragmatic instruments are useful in measuring outcomes of effectiveness, adherence and
      utility preference scores. These results will also provide preliminary data on the
      effectiveness of anti-cholinergic medication and the impact of adherence on clinical
      effectiveness and quality of life in the clinical setting.
