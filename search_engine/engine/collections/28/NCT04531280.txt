      publications mostly in urban environments, home hospital care delivered cost-effective,
      high-quality, excellent experience care with similar quality and safety as traditional
      hospital care. Most home hospital models deliver care in urban environments, not in rural
      environments.

      To further improve the model, the investigators propose to determine the feasibility of home
      hospital care in a rural home setting through a proof-of-concept approach.
