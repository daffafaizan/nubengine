      mortality. To date a cure for SSc is not available. In this trial, patients are treated very
      early in the disease which could change the long term outcome of SSc in these patients.

      In daily practice, patients so early in the disease course are not treated although they
      might be at risk for early escalation and internal organ involvement, reducing their
      prognosis. A trial to investigate the efficacy of a relative save, inexpensive and easy
      accessible treatment will provide us with the opportunity to change the disease course and
      reducing the disease burden of a portion of the SSc patients
