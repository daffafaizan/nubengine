      two breast radiologists to ensure a high sensitivity. Double reading is, however, resource
      demanding and still results in missed cancers. Computer-aided detection based on AI has been
      shown to have similar accuracy as an average breast radiologist. AI can be used as decision
      support by highlighting suspicious findings in the image as well as a means to triage screen
      exams according to risk of malignancy.

      Eligible women will be randomized (1:1) to the intervention (AI-integrated mammography
      screening) or control arm (conventional mammography screening). In the intervention arm,
      exams will be analysed with AI and triaged into two groups based on risk of malignancy. Low
      risk exams will be single read and high risk exams will be double read. The high risk group
      will contain appx. 10% of the screening population. Within the high-risk group, exams with
      the highest 1% risk will by default be recalled by the readers with the exception of obvious
      false positives. AI risk scores and Computer-Aided Detection (CAD)-marks of suspicious
      calcifications and masses are provided to the reader(s). In the control arm, screen exams are
      double read without AI (standard of care). Considering the interplay of number of interval
      cancers and workload, the study will be considered successful if the interval-cancer rate in
      the intervention arm is not more than 20% larger than in the control arm. If the
      interval-cancer rate is statistically and clinically significantly lower in the intervention
      arm than in the control arm, AI-integrated mammography screening will be considered superior
      to conventional mammography screening.
