      Primary

        -  Correlate plasma and urine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels with
           survival duration in patients with advanced hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma of the
           prostate previously enrolled on CALGB-9480.

        -  Determine whether plasma chromogranin A (CgA) and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels
           predict survival duration in these patients.

        -  Determine whether plasma human Kallikrein 2 (hK2) levels are prognostic for overall
           survival of these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of plasma and urine VEGF levels, plasma CgA
           levels, plasma IL-6 levels, and plasma hK2 levels in relation to overall survival of
           these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma VEGF levels with urine VEGF levels in these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma CgA levels with previously measured serum prostate-specific antigen
           (PSA) and plasma VEGF levels in these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma hK2 levels with PSA changes after treatment with suramin to determine
           if hK2 may have predictive value, independent or additive to measures of disease
           response in these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma hK2 levels with PSA levels in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Plasma from patients is collected for measurement of the following biomarkers:
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), chromogranin A, interleukin-6, and human
      Kallikrein 2. Urine is collected for VEGF measurement.
