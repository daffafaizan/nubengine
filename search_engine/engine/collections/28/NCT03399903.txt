      safe and effective for inflammatory bowel disease would offer benefit in reducing the
      residual immune activation associated with treated HIV-1 infection. Specifically, the two
      immediate goals are to examine the safety of PentasaÂ® in reducing markers of immune
      activation believed to be important reflectors of risk for cardiovascular disease and ongoing
      immune damage in people with chronic treated HIV-1 infection.
