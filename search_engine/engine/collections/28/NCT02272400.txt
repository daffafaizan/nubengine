      delivery through an external-beam has many advantages. First of all, it is likely to be more
      acceptable to the patient since it is non-invasive and it does not require a surgical
      procedure or anesthesia. Moreover, since it is delivered after surgery, the pathological
      analysis of the segmental mastectomy specimen is available to inform the selection of the
      best candidates. In addition, EB-PBI is likely to become more widely reproducible, since it
      does not rely on the experience and skills of the radiation oncologist performing the
      brachytherapy implant. Besides, once the technique is established, it can be widely applied
      at any facility provided with a linear accelerator, without the risk presented by some
      brachytherapy approaches that can not be completed because of the unfavorable interplay of
      patient's anatomy with the technical limitations of the applicator. Finally, in terms of
      health care economics, an external beam approach spares the costs of an extra surgical
      procedure and that of several days of hospitalization (in the case of LDR brachytherapy).
