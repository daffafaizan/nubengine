      Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines for the management of patients with anticipated difficult
      airways. Hemodynamic stability, optimal intubating conditions, patients' comfort, amnesia and
      preservation of patents' spontaneous respiration are critical for awake intubation. Sedation
      is one of the key elements for this technique. Intravenous midazolam, propofol,
      dexmedetomidine and remifentanil are commonly used as sedatives during awake intubation.
      These agents are not preferred to be used alone but in combination with each other for the
      purpose of minimizing their respective side effects. The aim of this randomized controlled
      trial is to compare the safety and effectiveness of dexmedetomidine versus propofol for
      sedation during awake endotracheal intubation when they are both combined with midazolam and
      remifentanil.
