      strokes are already attributed to AF. Unfortunately, half of patients with AF do not receive
      prescriptions for anticoagulation to prevent stroke due to a variety of system, provider, and
      patient-level barriers. The investigators will conduct a pragmatic, cluster-randomized
      controlled trial to test a 'toolkit' of quality improvement interventions in primary care. In
      keeping with the recommendations of the chronic care model to simultaneously facilitate
      proactive care by providers and activate patients, the toolkit includes provider- focused
      strategies (education, audit and feedback, electronic medical record-based tools including
      decision support and reminders) plus patient-directed strategies (educational letters and
      reminders). Thirty three primary care clinics will be randomized to the intervention or usual
      care. The trial will last 12 months and will be powered to show a difference of 10% in the
      primary outcome of proportion of patients receiving guideline-concordant care for stroke
      prevention. Analysis will be blind to allocation.
