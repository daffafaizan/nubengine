      of developping into depression or bipolar disorder. Preliminary evidence shows that aerobic
      exercise might have positive effects in enhancing cognition and improving clinical symptoms
      in non-clinical and preclinical population and patients with mood disorders. This randomized
      controlled trial will investigate short-term (3 months) effects of aerobic exercise on
      cognition and clinical symptoms as well as the long-term (18 months) effects on the clinical
      outcomes of high-risk states.
