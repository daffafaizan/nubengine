      the society. If conservative treatment options fail, surgical interventions are the last
      treatment option.

      Symptomatic disc degeneration leads to neck pain, which can radiate to the scapula and arm,
      with dumbness and tingling, and sometimes grasping and walking difficulties. At an advanced
      stage, muscle weakness can be observed in the nerve territory.

      The quality of life and functionality of patients with therapy-resistant (conservatively
      treated) severe degeneration of the disc is greatly impaired, as they suffer from intense
      pain and thus disability. Patients of working age were significantly more impacted by their
      symptoms than older patients. They are no longer able to fully participate in everyday
      activities.

      Cervical neck pain resulting from degenerative disc disease is associated with a major
      economic burden for payers.

      Traditional cervical surgical decompressions and fusions are currently the most common
      treatment option. Despite good treatment success rates, fusions are associated with a
      negative impact on the normal kinematics of the spine, long recuperation times and long
      absence from work. Prestige artificial disc replacement is an alternative treatment option.

      The PRESTIGE Observational Study is intended to collect information on Quality of Life (QoL)
      prior and after PRESTIGEÂ® Cervical Disc surgery; data on pain prior of participation to the
      study, drug regiment and X-ray evaluation throughout the course of the study will be
      obtained. In addition adverse events and economic data will be documented.
