    
      The study will consist of 4 parallel groups of participants, one for each of the following
      primary brain tumor types: high-grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma and DIPG. A Simon's
      Optimal two-stage study design will be applied to each group and enrollment will occur as
      follows:

        -  Stage 1: Nine participants will be enrolled in each brain tumor type group

        -  Stage 2: If during Stage 1, â‰¥ 2 participants achieves either an objective response
           (either complete response or partial response) within the first 6 cycles of treatment
           (or within the first 3 cycles for DIPG participants), or a long-term stable disease, an
           additional 11 participants shall be enrolled; otherwise no additional participants will
           be enrolled into that group.

        -  If a total of 5 or more participants across all 20 participants in a given group (Stage
           1 and 2) evaluable for the primary endpoint are observed as having either an objective
           response (either complete response or partial response) within the first 6 cycles of
           treatment (or within the first 3 cycles for DIPG participants) or a long-term stable
           disease, pomalidomide will be considered effective in that disease indication.

      Once treatment has been discontinued, participants will be followed up for up to 5 years from
      enrollment of the last participant.

      Participants who withdraw from either stage for reasons other than disease progression prior
      to completing Cycle 1 of study treatment will be replaced.
