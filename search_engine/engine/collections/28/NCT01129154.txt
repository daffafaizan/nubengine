    
      This is an open-label, multicentric study of 17 patients with skin squamous cancer cell.

      Eligible patients should not be suitable for immediate surgery. If they have only one tumor,
      it should be greater than 3 cm2 in order to allow multiple biopsies.

      Patients will receive six infusions of Panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks or until progression
      if earlier.

      Patients will be assessed at baseline, at week 6 and then every 12 weeks till progression. In
      addition to clinical examination, evaluation tools will include photography and CT-scan, MRI
      or PET-scan.

      Skin and tumor biopsies will be performed during first cycle at baseline and at days 2, 4, 8,
      43, 85. Blood collections for translational research will be done during first cycle at
      baseline and at days 2, 4, 8,15, 43, 85. Blood collection for hematology and chemistry
      assessment will be done each 4weeks.

      Patients presenting with a stable disease or a tumor response at week 12 will be eligible for
      maintenance cycles consisting in an infusion of panitumumab every 2 weeks till progression.
