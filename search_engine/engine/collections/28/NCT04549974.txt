      heat waves are associated with a higher risk of hospitalization and mortality in vulnerable
      populations such as people with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors. It has
      been hypothesized that this observation may be explained by the cardiovascular demands
      imposed by heat exposure.

      Heat exposure requires increased cardiac work that may place individuals with cardiovascular
      disease at risk of ischemic events if the metabolic demand is not compensated by adequate
      blood supply. However, the extent to which cardiac work increases during heat exposure
      remains unknown. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that heat exposure increases
      myocardial blood flow and that this increase is affected by age and coronary artery disease.
