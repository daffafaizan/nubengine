      improves patients safety and postoperative outcome. Therefore invasive procedures as
      Picco2-system, FloTrac and transesophageal echocardiography (tee) have the advantage to
      measure or calculate stroke volume. Disadvantage of this treatments is the need for a
      vascular access with all its complications.

      In this study the stroke volume measured by a new noninvasive finger cuff system (NexFin)
      should be validated in comparison to invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems as
      Picco2-system, FloTrac and tee.
