      substitution of the striatal neurons degenerated among a large cohort of Huntington's patient
      at early stage by homologous neurons coming from human foetuses, This effect will be
      estimated, compared with a group of patients not treated at first, on the results of the
      motor scale of the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS, Huntington study group, on
      1996).

      Transplants will be realized in two surgical times to avoid the risk of hurts per-operating,
      BI-CAUDES, if transplants were realized at single time. The minimal interval between both
      transplants will be of 2 weeks, so as to let the patient recover of the first general
      anaesthesia It's a multicentric study of phase II randomised and controlled, with direct
      individual benefit.
