      for three weeks had improved blood pressure control and lower levels of blood chemicals that
      may damage the heart and blood vessels. The eating plan in the study was based on the DASH
      diet, also known as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet. This plan is rich in
      fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and is recommended to decrease blood pressure in
      patients with hypertension. Current medical guidelines also recommend that both patients with
      hypertension and those with heart failure should decrease their dietary salt intake.

      The diets that patients will eat in this study are the DASH/sodium-restricted (DASH/SRD) diet
      as well as a control diet based on the average reported diet collected using Food Frequency
      Questionnaires during our pilot study. Patients will be randomized to one diet for three
      weeks and then crossover to the other diet for three weeks. Patients will then be asked to
      eat the DASH/sodium-restricted diet on their own at home with dietary support for an
      additional eight weeks.

      In this study, the main goal is to confirm the findings of our earlier study. The
      investigators would also like to understand how the DASH/SRD changes the function of the
      heart and blood vessels during exercise and the activity of genes that could be involved in
      HFPEF.
