      muscle protein catabolism which is associated with a number of co-morbid conditions including
      declines in muscle mass and strength, significantly increased fall risk, and reduced quality
      of life (QOL. Therefore, interventions to prevent muscle loss in hemodialysis are needed.
      Pharmacological agents have been investigated to treat muscle loss in dialysis patients;
      however, many of these treatments are expensive and have undesirable side effects. As a
      result, low-cost interventions designed to attenuate losses in muscle mass and strength in
      hemodialysis patients are needed.

      Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) represents a potential low-cost nutritional
      intervention to attenuate muscle loss in hemodialysis patients. HMB is a metabolite of the
      amino acid leucine that has been shown to safely increase muscle mass in other clinical
      populations with prevalent muscle loss, such as the elderly, cancer, and AIDS patients
      primarily through reductions in skeletal muscle protein catabolism. The primary purpose of
      the trial is to determine if oral supplementation with HMB attenuates muscle loss, improves
      muscle strength, physical function, fall risk and QOL in hemodialysis patients. Alterations
      in protein and gene expression associated with skeletal muscle protein turnover will be
      measured to investigate the mechanism for changes in our primary outcomes. We hypothesize
      that HMB supplementation will attenuate declines in muscle size and strength in hemodialysis
      patients.
