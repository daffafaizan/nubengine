      The principal objective of the study is to find biomarkers that quantify the natural
      progression of the disease and to know if they are useful to determine the improvement or
      lack of impairment of the disease in response to Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT).

      Study design:

      A single center observational prospective study.

      Patients:

      Patients with adult onset POMPE disease (onset of symptoms after two years old) and molecular
      diagnosis confirming the disease are eligible

      Methods:

      Clinical information will be obtained according to a pre-defined protocol including six
      visits: screening visit, baseline, 6 month, 12 month, 24 month and 36 month.

      In each visit we will perform the following tests: clinical assessment (including interview
      with patients, quality of live questionnaires, timed tests and assessment of muscle balance
      using a myometer), analytical tests (blood and urine tests), cardiac test (Electrocardiogram
      (ECG) and cardiac echography), respiratory assessment (using spirometer) and skeletal muscle
      imaging (Muscle MRI).

      All data collect will be introduced in a database and afterwards statistically analyzed.

      Expected results:

      We expect to find a biomarker useful to follow-up the progression of Pompe disease. This
      biomarker has to be sensitive to the changes that muscle function may have after treatment
      with ERT.
