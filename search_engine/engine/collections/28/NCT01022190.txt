    
      Rationale: Heterotopic ossification is a frequent complication after total hip replacement.
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to effectively prevent heterotopic
      ossification, but gastrointestinal complaints are reported frequently. Selective
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibiting NSAID produce less gastrointestinal side effects.

      Objective: Preventing heterotopic ossification. Study design: A prospective two-stage study
      design for phase-2 clinical trials with 42 patients to determine if Arcoxia (a COX-2
      inhibitor) 90-mg oral prevents heterotopic ossification. In the first stage, 19-patients are
      included. Another 23-patients are included when at least 90-percent of patients in first
      stage have Brooker classification 0, 1 or 2 at 6-months follow-up.

      Study population: 42-patients with cemented total hip arthroplasty age 18 - 75 yr old.

      Intervention: All subjects receive 90-mg Arcoxia oral for 7-days. Main study
      parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the degree of heterotopic ossification
      assessed on AP radiographs using the Brooker classification.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: No risks are associated with participating into the research. Besides the oral
      intake of Arcoxia, no extra burden is associated with participating in the study. The
      postoperative care does not change. Radiographic examinations will be routinely performed the
      day before surgery, immediately after operation, at 6-weeks and 6-months after surgery. The
      degree of heterotopic ossification will be determined by x-ray assessment.
