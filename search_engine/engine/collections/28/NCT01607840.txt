    
      Participants enrolled into this study may be asked to do the following:

      Grant permission for the researchers to view medical records associated with their
      language/cognitive difficulties

      Complete a questionnaire, provide a health history, and take some pencil-and-paper tests of
      problem-solving and memory in order to verify eligibility to participate and to able to
      safely undergo the experimental procedures.

      Complete several tasks (e.g., saying words out loud, naming objects, drawing designs,
      remembering lists of words, searching for images or letters, and/or completing puzzles) based
      upon a number of cognitive functions such as language, memory, vision, processing, and
      perception.

      Wear electrodes that will be placed on the scalp with a large rubberized band. These
      electrodes will administer very weak electrical current (tDCS) from a 9 volt battery for 20
      to 60 minutes.

      Participation in several study conditions. The exact conditions and their order will be
      randomized. Under some conditions, participants may receive active stimulation (tDCS) and
      under other conditions, they may receive sham stimulation.

      The experimental sessions will last approximately 2 hours and participants may be asked to
      have more than one testing session in a day or to return for additional sessions.

      Have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scan.
