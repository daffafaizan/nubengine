    
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the impact of providing "Just-in-Time"
      information, or physician educational material at the time of discharge, to primary care
      pediatricians caring for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) graduates. The material provided
      will be tailored to the needs of each infant. The educational material will be sent to the
      physicians via email and facsimile on the day of discharge, and a hard copy will be sent with
      the parents to bring to their first clinic appointment. Outcomes, including emergency room
      visits, hospital readmissions, deaths, missed appointments, and improvements in care in the
      areas of intervention will be assessed. Levels of physician comfort in caring for various
      disorders specific to NICU graduates will be assessed, and satisfaction with the discharge
      process will also be evaluated pre- and post- intervention.
