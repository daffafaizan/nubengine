      innervated by trigeminal nerve. Patients who have failed to achieve benefits from drug
      treatment could try to undergo nerve block, a traditional conservative treatment. Pulsed
      radiofrequency (PRF) is a noninvasive pain intervention technique for the treatment of TN.
      However, its treatment effectiveness has rarely been reported and remains controversial among
      scholars. A recent single-center preliminary clinical study showed that high-voltage PRF had
      significant effectiveness in the treatment of TN. However, whether high-voltage PRF treatment
      can become an optional treatment for TN patients who have failed to achieve benefits from
      drug treatment still needs to be confirmed with standardized clinical studies by utilizing
      conservative nerve block treatment as a control. The study is designed to compare the
      effectiveness and safety of high-voltage PRF and nerve block for the treatment of primary TN
      patients with ineffective conservative treatment and explore better non-surgical treatment
      methods for TN patients.
