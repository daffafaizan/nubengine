    
      A total of 60 patients (32 male and 28 female) aged between 4 and 7 years (Mean age 4.8
      years, SD +/- 1.09 years) who met the inclusion criteria were recruited after obtaining
      informed consent from the parent. No financial incentives were offered for participation in
      the study. A total of 51 (29 male and 22 female) patients completed the six month follow up
      requirement (Fig 2).

      Evaluation Crowns and the Procedure All patients were evaluated at 24 hours, one week, three
      months and six months post-operatively. Clinical criteria evaluated included the reporting of
      pain, discomfort, difficulty in mastication or high points reported by the patient.
      Tenderness on percussion, presence of premature mobility and clinical evidence of an abscess
      or fistula were checked by one of the investigators (SCP). Periapical digital radiographs
      were taken using a digital sensor (Schick Elite, Sirona Dental Inc. Long Island NY. USA) and
      were evaluated by the same examiner for radiographic evidence of failure. In order to ensure
      blinding the investigator (SCP) recording the findings was not made aware of which group the
      patient belonged to. The time taken for each procedure was calculated from the time of
      placement of the throat pack to the time of removal of the throat pack and was obtained from
      the intra-operative anesthesiologist notes. If failure of the crown occurred at 3 months,
      these teeth were excluded from the 6 month evaluation.

      Statistical Analyses The parametric values of the control and case groups were compared using
      the student's t test. The non-parametric values of the control and case groups were compared
      using the Mann Whitney U test. All tests were conducted at p value of 0.05
