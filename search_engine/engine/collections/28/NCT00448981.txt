      influenza, they share common transmission pathways and the community level interventions
      needed to reduce both seasonal flu, common viral upper respiratory infections and pandemic
      influenza are likely to be similar.

      Aims of this project are to compare the impact of two household level interventions (an
      alcohol based hand sanitizer with or without face masks) on six outcomes: incidence and
      strains of virologically confirmed influenza in study households; rates of symptoms; number
      of secondary cases in households; antibiotic use practices for symptoms of influenza and
      other viral upper respiratory infections; household member knowledge of prevention and
      treatment strategies for pandemic influenza and viral upper respiratory infections; and rates
      of influenza vaccination among household members.

      450 households in northern Manhattan (primarily recently immigrated Hispanics) will be
      randomized to three groups: control (receiving only a pamphlet on influenza prevention),
      alcohol hand sanitizer, and sanitizer plus face masks. Symptoms of influenza will be
      monitored daily for 15 months using ecological momentary assessment technology. Virologic
      cultures will be obtained from persons with flu symptoms (fever >100 degrees F., sore throat
      and/or cough). Antibiotic use practices, knowledge, and vaccination rates will be assessed by
      survey using piloted, psychometrically sound instruments. For this cluster randomization
      design with randomized intervention on the household level, outcomes will be measured at the
      individual and household level using generalized linear mixed model for counts response with
      a Poisson distribution and other appropriate multivariate techniques to control for
      confounding.

      Comparison(s): The purpose of this study is to try to reduce the transmission of colds and
      flu among household members with one of three interventions: comparison of transmission in
      groups receiving educational material only to a group receiving educational material and
      instructed to use alcohol hand sanitizers to a group receiving educational material and
      instructed to use alcohol hand sanitizers as well as face masks when somebody has symptoms of
      the flu
