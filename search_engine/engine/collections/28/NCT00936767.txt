      artemisone with oral artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in
      Western Cambodia. A detailed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation and in vitro
      sensitivity for the study drugs will be part of the assessments. The overall design and
      proposed conduct is very similar to the recently completed studies of high dose
      artesunate.Fever patients in the villages surrounding Pailin (or equivalent study site) in
      Western Cambodia will be screened with a PfHRP2-based malaria rapid test (Paracheck) by the
      village malaria workers. In case of a positive test result, the patient will be transported
      by the study team to the hospital, full consent (as described above) and enrolment procedures
      will be conducted. It will be made clear from the outset that refusal to participate will in
      no way jeopardize subsequent antimalarial treatment.Eligibility can only be confirmed by a
      medically qualified investigator. Subjects who fulfil all the inclusion criteria and have
      none of the exclusion criteria will be randomised to one of the three treatment arms
      according to the randomisation schedule. Subject numbers will be will be assigned when the
      subject is enrolled after screening and prior to randomisation.Patients will be randomized in
      blocks of 15 to receive either artemisone 4 mg/kg/day for 3 days plus mefloquine 15mg/kg on
      day 3 and 10mg/kg on day 4 (N=50) or artesunate 4mg/kg/day for 3 days plus mefloquine 15mg/kg
      on day 3 and 10mg/kg on day 4 (N=25.
