      one or more of three additional weight-loss strategies: (1) a diet on top of
      calorie-restriction with preference for carbohydrates having a low glycemic index (dual
      diet), (2) financial incentive, and (3) continuous telemetric control of weight and physical
      activity (telemonitoring). The design made it possible to determine the effect of each single
      measure: financial incentive vs. no financial incentive (54 vs.56 families),
      calorie-restriction vs. dual diet (53 vs. 57 fami-lies) and telemonitoring vs. no
      telemonitoring (19 vs. 91 families). The design also allowed an assessment of the effects of
      combinations of the additional measures, each adapted for possible effects of the other
      factors.

      Main Outcome In the parents the outcome variable at 6 months was the relative weight loss. In
      children, be-cause of their body growth, the outcome variable was the age-adjusted BMI
      standard deviation score (BMI-SDS). Analysis was done by three-factorial ANOVA and by a
      one-factorial ANOVA with the included Dunnett test as a post-hoc comparison, to distinguish
      between the effects of the different combinations of the additional strategies.
