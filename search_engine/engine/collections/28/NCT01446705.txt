      concurrent control group, among Veterans seen at the Indianapolis VA. Data on care received
      by Veterans will be obtained for one year before, and one year after, VA-IHIE enrollment.
      Patients will be recruited into the VA-IHIE program in a rolling manner over the course of a
      year, and thus will have different calendar intervals of follow-up. For purposes of
      evaluation, investigators will approach the VA-IHIE implementation as a patient-directed
      intervention given that additional information available from the exchange is available only
      on a patient-by-patient basis, i.e., a provider cannot use exchange information available for
      one patient in the care of another. Although the VA-IHIE program will be implemented at the
      site level, patients will be enrolled individually.
