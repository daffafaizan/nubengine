      intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), radiotherapy (RT) has shown important role in the
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Meta-analysis has demonstrated that
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined RT was more therapeutically
      beneficial than TACE alone. Especially for advanced disease with portal vein tumor thrombosis
      (PVTT), or hepatic vein tumor thrombosis, or lymph node involved, RT was more effective than
      other treatment methods. Previous studies had showed that RT could receive response rate of
      50% to 60% for HCC with PVTT. But for those patients, high accidence of out RT field failure
      of liver and distance metastasis was found. Effective systemic therapy was necessary to
      advanced HCC. Based on two phase III trials, sorafenib was recommended as systemic therapy to
      advanced HCC. But tumor response rate of sorafenib alone was only 2.3-3% by RICIST criteria.
      More than half of patients was received survival benefit by maintaining in stable disease. It
      is feasible to improve survival by combining IMRT and sorafenib for advanced HCC with portal
      vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), or hepatic vein tumor thrombosis, or lymph node involved. In
      addition, it was demonstrated that sorafenib could potentiate irradiation in HCC cell lines
      through inhibiting radiation-induced proliferation and DNA repair and promoting
      radiation-induced apoptosis.
