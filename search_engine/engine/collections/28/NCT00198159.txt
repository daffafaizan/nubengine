      germ cell tumors expressing EGFR. The secondary objectives are to determine the duration of
      response, time to progression and overall survival in patients with refractory germ cell
      tumors expressing EGFR and treated with ZD1839; to evaluate the tolerability of ZD1839 in
      patients with refractory germ cell tumors and to correlate tumor response to degree of EGFR
      expression by immunohistochemistry.
