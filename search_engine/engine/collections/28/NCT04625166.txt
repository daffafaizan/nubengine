      strain imaging technology to make full use of these two imaging modalities and make full use
      of different physical characteristics for imaging and quantitative analysis.

      In the study, not only the F index which is related to the stage of liver fibrosis can be
      obtained, but also the A index which is related to the stage of hepatitis can be obtained,
      which can not be obtained by other ultrasound devices.

      This technology is non-invasive, painless, simple and reliable, therefore it is bound to
      contribute to the early diagnosis of chronic liver disease and the real-time evaluation in
      the treatment process, which will play an important role in the clinical application.
