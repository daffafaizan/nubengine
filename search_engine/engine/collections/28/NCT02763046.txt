      parallel-group, multicenter study to examine the clinical response of secukinumab treatment
      in patients with ankylosing spondylitis as measured by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis
      international Society (ASAS) 20 response and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      (NSAID)-sparing effect. This study evaluated to which extent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug (NSAID) treatment can be reduced between Week 4 and Week 12 in patients randomized to
      secukinumab 150 mg or placebo following an initial run-in phase of 4 weeks on stable NSAID
      therapy. Two NSAID tapering approaches were evaluated in this study:

        1. an early tapering approach in which NSAID were tapered at the start of secukinumab
           treatment,

        2. a delayed tapering approach in which NSAID were tapered following 4 weeks of secukinumab
           treatment.

      Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment groups:

        -  Secukinumab - delayed NSAID tapering: Induction with secukinumab 150 mg s.c. once per
           week (Week 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4) followed by maintenance with secukinumab 150 mg s.c. every
           4 weeks (Week 8, 12, 16 and 20), with intermittent placebo injections at Week 5, 6, 7,
           17, 18 and 19 to maintain the blind. NSAID tapering allowed from Week 4 (delayed
           tapering).

        -  Secukinumab - early NSAID tapering: Placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 to maintain the blind;
           followed by induction with secukinumab 150 mg s.c. once per week (Week 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
           and maintenance with secukinumab 150 mg s.c. every 4 weeks (Week 12, 16 and 20), with
           intermittent placebo injections at Week 17, 18 and 19 to maintain the blind. NSAID
           tapering allowed from Week 4 (early tapering).

        -  Placebo: Placebo s.c. at Week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12. After the Week 16
           assessments of the secondary endpoint had been performed, these patients received weekly
           doses of secukinumab 150 mg s.c. (Week 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20). NSAID tapering allowed
           from Week 4.

      The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that the efficacy of secukinumab 150 mg
      subcutaneous (s.c.) injection (with NSAID tapering) is superior to placebo based on the
      proportion of patients achieving an ASAS20 response at Week 12. To show superiority, both
      secukinumab treatment arms were pooled and compared against placebo.
