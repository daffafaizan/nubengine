      spectrum disorder (ASD) due to a variety of factors, including considerations related to ASD
      symptoms and associated anxiety and behavioral difficulties. Lack of routine, effective
      dental care has contributed to a substantial unmet healthcare need for children with ASD, who
      are at increased risk for excessive plaque, caries, and oral infections.

      The purpose of this study is to test a parent-training intervention designed to improve home
      dental hygiene, compliance with dental office visits, and oral health outcomes in children
      with autism spectrum disorder. Families of children with an existing diagnosis of ASD will be
      recruited for participation. All families will receive the Autism Intervention Research
      Network on Physical Health (AIR-P) Dental Toolkit, which is designed to provide parents with
      guidance and information about dental care and support strategies for children with ASD. Some
      families will also participate in a 10-week behavioral parent-training intervention focused
      on improving home dental care and dental office visit experiences.
