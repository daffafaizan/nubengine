      lupus erythematosus (SLE) with the risk of myocardial infarction increased up to 50-fold. In
      addition to defining the mechanisms for accelerated atherosclerosis it is important to define
      the effects of drugs used to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients. Low dose
      aspirin, by inhibiting thromboxane A2 biosynthesis, has profound antiplatelet effects, but
      some patients have impaired thromboxane suppression - a phenomenon termed aspirin resistance.
      An explanation is that aspirin-independent thromboxane synthesis may occur through enhanced
      COX-2 activity, as would occur in an inflammatory condition such as lupus. However, little is
      known about the effects of low-dose aspirin in SLE. Thus, we propose to test the following
      hypothesis: 1) that aspirin insensitive thromboxane biosynthesis is increased in patients
      with lupus and is mediated by increased COX-2 activity.
