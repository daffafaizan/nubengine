      lifestyle and diet of Chinese people have undergone significant changes, leading to a
      significant increase in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and lipid metabolism
      disorders. Prevention and control work is also increasingly valued. At present, there is no
      research on the awareness rates and control rates of blood glucose, blood pressure and blood
      lipids in diabetic patients in Jiangxi Province. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the
      country has vigorously promoted the grading system of chronic non-communicable diseases, but
      there is a big gap between the levels of disease management in different levels of hospitals.
