      postprandial beta-cell function and hepatic insulin sensitivity and the factors that
      influence these metabolic functions, including insulin signaling, adipose tissue and systemic
      inflammation, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide(NAD) biosynthesis, and sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2
      homolog 1 (SIRT1)) in overweight human subjects.
