      The trial including two stages. The first is an exploration stage to decide delivery
      frequency and dose of study drug. It is single-blinded, subjects will be randomly divided
      into 4 groups with a 2:2:2:1 ratio. Study drug given twice per week or 3 times per, dose of
      the drug are from 20μg to 40μg. The sample size is 105, duration is 12 to 18 months. Based on
      preliminary efficacy and safety, the better dosage regimen will decided for the second
      stage.The second stage is double-blinded,subject will be randomly divided into treatment
      group or placebo group with 2:1 ratio and sample size is 600.

      Primary purpose

      To compare overall survival between study drug and placebo groups .

      Secondary purpose

        1. Progression free survival were compared in both groups.

        2. Disease control rate were compared in both groups.

        3. Quality of life scores were compared in both groups.

        4. Determine the safety and tolerance of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for
           injection

        5. Supplementary pharmacodynamics of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for
           injection

      Exploratory purpose Evaluate effects of recombinant anti-tumor and anti-virus protein for
      injection on the anti-tumor immunity, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, immune
      cells and cytokines levels.
