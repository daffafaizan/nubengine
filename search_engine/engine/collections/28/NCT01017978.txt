      if a sarcoma is responding to the type of chemotherapy being used or if it is ineffective
      early on in the treatment; instead of finding this out 2-3 months later. If it is determined
      that MRI can accurately diagnose tumor response, medications can be switched early on
      potentially improv8ing the patients'chances of recovery.
