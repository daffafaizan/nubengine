      and function in the community. With this toolkit, clinicians will be able best determine an
      individual's K-Level designation, resulting in increased prosthesis use.

      Aim 1: Determine whether a participant's prosthesis use matches the assigned K-level and/or
      self-reported goals and, if not, determine the reason(s) using an expert panel to evaluate
      data from performance-related measures, participant-reported measures, and smartphone and
      prosthesis sensors (clinical toolbox).

      Aim 2: Quantify the effects of targeted physical intervention (prosthesis repair/refit,
      physical rehabilitation) or psychological intervention (motivational interviewing) or both on
      activity levels and patient goals.

      Aim 3: Identify measure(s) that sensitively predict prosthesis use to create a clinically
      deployable toolkit to evaluate and optimize prosthesis use in the community.
