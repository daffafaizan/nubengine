      week for 6 months. At baseline and 6 months after the intervention, we will measure kyphosis,
      physical function, spine muscle strength and density, and quality of life. We will assess the
      effect of the intervention on the co-primary outcomes of kyphosis, modified Physical
      Performance Test (PPT) and gait speed measured as change over 6 months. We will also assess
      the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes of physical function and health-related
      quality of life, measured as change in Timed Up and Go, Timed Loaded Standing, Six-Minute
      Timed Walk, the Scoliosis Research Society SRS-30, PROMISe Global Health and physical
      function and PACE questionnaires. Furthermore, we will investigate whether changes in
      kyphosis, spinal muscle strength and/or density mediate the effect of the intervention on
      change in physical function. After the 6-month intervention, both groups will continue their
      usual activity and we will assess the durability of the effects of the intervention at 1-year
      follow-up.
