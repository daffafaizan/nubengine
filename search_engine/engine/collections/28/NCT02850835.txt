    
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a highly prevalent condition among women that impairs quality
      of life, daily activities and sexual function. Latina women are disproportionally affected,
      with significantly higher rates of POP compared to women of other ethnicities. Counseling
      Latina women suffering from POP is often complex due to a variety of factors, including
      language barriers, limited patient understanding of anatomy and disease etiology and
      confusion regarding surgical versus nonsurgical treatment options. Decision aids have been
      used to increase patient knowledge prior to physician intervention and to facilitate informed
      patient participation on treatment selection. The investigators hypothesize that the use of a
      video decision aid prior to initial Urogynecology specialist evaluation of Latina women with
      POP will increase patient knowledge regarding the condition, decrease decisional conflict
      regarding selection among different treatment options and increase patient satisfaction with
      selected treatment, empowering these women as active participants in their healthcare instead
      of relying on provider input alone.
