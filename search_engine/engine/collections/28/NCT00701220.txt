      count the number of EPC's in your blood. These tests are routinely performed to gain
      knowledge about a person's health. If any incidental findings are identified as a result of
      your participation in this research study, you will be notified and referred to your doctor
      or appropriate health care professional.

      You are being asked to provide a blood sample that will be used to determine the usual
      numbers of EPC's circulating in the blood of healthy people who have no risk factors for
      heart disease. Your results will be compared with those of patients who have heart failure.

      Flow cytometry is a special laboratory test that can count, separate, and detect
      characteristics of cells in blood. Your blood sample will be analyzed using flow cytometry.
      Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC's) are immature cells that are necessary for new blood
      vessel formation. EPC's will be separated by flow cytometry and counted. You will not be
      given the results of your flow cytometry study.
