      severely compromised.Plasma insulin levels have been used as a surrogate marker of beta cell
      mass (BCM) but insulin levels often do not correlate well. A "gold standard of measurement"
      to obtain BCM would be of great value. The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate an islet
      imaging technique using PET scanning to directly measure BCM and thus provide valuable
      information for monitoring disease progress and response to therapy in people with diabetes
      and in people at high risk for diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) occurs when the beta cells
      are selectively destroyed by a T cell mediated autoimmune process. People at high risk for
      developing T1DM, such as first degree relatives of patients with T1DM, can sometimes be
      identified before the disease develops by measuring autoantibodies to beta cells, however
      this test is neither sensitive nor specific. Little is known about the natural history of
      BCM, turnover and cell lifetime, or the course of inflammation in diabetes. This is
      principally because the pancreas is a highly heterogeneous organ that is difficult to biopsy
      without significant complications, and BCM only comprises 1 to 2% of the total volume.
      Accurate assessment of BCM in human diabetes is limited to autopsy studies, which usually
      suffer from inadequate clinical information; thus, the development of non-invasive means of
      BCM measurement could be important for interventional therapies of T1DM, islet
      regeneration/stem cell therapy and islet transplantation.
