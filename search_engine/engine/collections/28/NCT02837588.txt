      myofascial trigger points assets presents the patient with medical treatment compared to
      treatment with radiofrequency endocavitary electrode MJS. The initial evaluator analyzed by
      the NIH-CPSI Scale questionnaire and symptoms of chronic pelvic pain Stanford Protocol for
      female or male quality of life of the patient before the doctor or radio frequency and a
      month since treatment. the patient to the Principal Investigator, specialist physiotherapist,
      who appreciates tenderness the presence of a taut band with a map of pain in endopelvic and
      exopelvic muscles, determining the activation of myofascial trigger points in each is
      derived. The Principal Investigator proceeds to address each active myofascial trigger points
      with the MJS electrode four 20-minute sessions twice a week. The MJS has a curved end
      pressure which favors the compression point plus the location and accurate approach
      Radiofrequency pathological point as outstanding feature. The high specificity of myofascial
      treatment offered by the MJS electrode involves no danger, besides having the computer screen
      conductivity meter and a temperature sensor on the head to control both parameters in real
      time during the treatment session
