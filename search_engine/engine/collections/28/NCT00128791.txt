      restoration of epicardial coronary flow for ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) results in poor outcome. The investigators hypothesized that nitroprusside (NTP)
      injected intracoronary immediately before angioplasty might prevent no-reflow and improve
      vessel flow and myocardial perfusion.
