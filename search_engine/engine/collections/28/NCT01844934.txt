      study of 379 patients who had hip or knee replacement surgery, it was reported that at 6
      months post-surgery patients with better baseline function had superior functional ability
      and less pain than patients with lower function at baseline. Another study of 276 patients
      undergoing TKA reported that pre-operative joint function was a predictor of joint function
      and overall function at 6 months post-surgery. These findings suggest that prehabilitation to
      increase functional ability prior to TKA may have a positive effect in recovering
      post-surgery. In a randomized control trial of patients receiving TKA, the group receiving an
      Exercise Program (prehabilitation) made significant improvements in performance from baseline
      to before surgery, and at 1 and 3 months post surgery. For the group that did not receive the
      Exercise Program pre-surgery, significant improvement did not occur until 3 months post
      surgery. The overall objective of the proposed single-blinded randomized controlled trial is
      to demonstrate that a well designed prehabilitation program for patients receiving TKA
      surgery will significantly improve outcomes related to pain and function and may reduce
      utilization of health care services post surgery.

      In this randomized control trial we hypothesize that the group of participants who receive a
      prehabilitation Exercise Program will recover quicker than patients who do not receive the
      Exercise Program based on several measures of performance including pain, quadriceps
      strength, range of motion and quality of life.
