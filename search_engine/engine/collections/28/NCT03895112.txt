      there is no therapy for MF evaluated in the clinic that clearly demonstrates the ability to
      target the malignant HSC and result in effective and reproducible bone marrow morphologic,
      cytogenetic and molecular responses. Medicinal therapies that result in disease course
      modification are urgently needed in this chronic and progressive myeloid malignancy. TGF-β
      likely plays a dual role in promoting myelofibrosis and myeloproliferation, both of which are
      the bone marrow morphologic hallmark of MF. The study team proposes that inhibiting the TGF-β
      signaling pathway in MF will decrease the fibrogenic stimuli leading to myelofibrosis and
      concomitantly interrupt myeloproliferation and restore normal hematopoiesis. AVID200 is a
      fusion protein containing TGF-β receptor ectodomains fused to a human Fc IgG domain. AVID200
      is a potent TGFβ trap with antibody-like properties which has pM potency against two of the
      three TGFβ ligands, TGFβ1 and β3.
