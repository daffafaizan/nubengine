    
      To assess the maximum tolerated doses and overall safety and tolerability of Sunitinib
      administered in combination with RAD001 for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma.

      To assess antitumor activity of the combination of Sunitinib and RAD001.

      This study is designed to confirm that the 2 agents can be administered safely in
      combination. Patients will begin treatment with Sunitinib and RAD001 on Day 1. RAD001 will be
      administered orally on a weekly schedule. Sunitinib will be given orally on a 4 weeks on, 2
      weeks off schedule. DLT determination will be based on toxicities observed in Cycle 1 - a
      cycle is defined by Sunitinib dosing ( 6 weeks). Once the MTD for the combination has been
      identified, a total of 10 patients will be enrolled at the highest dose level that allows for
      administration of multiple cycles and provides potentially therapeutic drug levels of both
      drugs to further assess safety and tolerability and to obtain a preliminary assessment of
      efficacy. Patients will be treated with RAD001 and Sunitinib until there is disease
      progression, significant toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. Patients judged to derive
      benefit from treatment would be offered participation in a continuation protocol at the
      conclusion of this study.
