      determined by an increasing incidence of transplant vasculopathy and by
      immunosuppression-related side effects. Calcineurin inhibitors are associated with chronic
      nephrotoxicity, while long-term administration of steroids results in an increased incidence
      of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension, lipometabolic disorders, steroid induced
      diabetes, adipositas)and therefore, carries the potential of graft disfunction.
