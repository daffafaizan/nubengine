      cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness during exercise and subject them to complete
      pulmonary function testing in conjunction with exercise and pH testing. We will assess
      whether such athletes experience an increase in reflux duration and episodes during exercise.
      The athletes will be randomized (in a cross over fashion) to acid suppression (BID Nexium 40
      mg) or placebo for 10-12 weeks. Both the athletes and investigators will be blinded. After
      10-12 weeks, exercise testing (ramp protocol with VO2 and anaerobic threshold) with
      concurrent respiratory function testing will be repeated along with symptom assessment. After
      a brief washout period of 1-2 weeks, the athletes will then cross-over to the other study
      medication for 10-12 weeks. Again, at the end of the study period, symptomatic relief as well
      as respiratory function improvement will be assessed by repeating the initial exercise
      regimen. The exercise regimens during these medication regimens will not be held stable as
      indirectly, as a results of "feeling better or worse" from the medication/placebo, these
      patients may increase/ decrease their exercise routine, resulting in changes in their overall
      endurance, anaerobic threshold, etc (our endpoints). By keeping the regimen stable, we do not
      allow for the changes to occur which are large enough to detect.
