    
      Participants will be recruited from the UOHI Smoking Cessation Clinic and via media
      advertisements. Following the baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of three groups:

        1. 10-week standard regimen of transdermal NRT (NRT);

        2. Long duration of transdermal NRT in combination with other NRT products (NRT+); or

        3. Varenicline (VR).

      Participants assigned to the "NRT" standard regimen group will follow a 10-week treatment of
      nicotine patches alone.

      Participants assigned to the "NRT+" long-duration group will follow the same regimen as the
      NRT group, but will not be limited to a fixed declining dose strategy, nor limited to a
      10-week duration (potential maximum dosage of 35mg/day and maximum treatment duration of up
      to 22 weeks). Participants will also be provided with other NRT products (i.e., gum or
      inhaler).

      Participants assigned to the "VR" group will start the medication on the day of the baseline
      assessment and set a target quit date any time within the 8 to 14 day period after baseline.
      Participants will receive a 12-week supply of varenicline with a possible extension of up to
      24 weeks.

      All participants will receive six 15-minute counselling sessions from a nurse-counsellor
      specializing in smoking cessation in accordance with nursing best-practice guidelines. These
      sessions occur at 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 weeks post target quit date. Counselling sessions will
      focus on practical counselling (problem solving and skills training) and social support.

      During the treatment phase, participants will complete questionnaires measuring withdrawal
      and neuropsychiatric symptoms at 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 weeks. These questionnaires will also be
      completed at 22 and 52 weeks after the target quit date.
