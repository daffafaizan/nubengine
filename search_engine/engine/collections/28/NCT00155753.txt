      involves the ora-equatorial area and the posterior pole. Peripheral fundus changes and
      posterior staphyloma formation are ophthalmoscopic evidences of this process. Pathological
      myopia often accompanied by glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal
      detachment, leading to blindness when the damage to the retina is extremely severe.
      Population and family studies in Chinese have provided evidence for a genetic component to
      pathologic myopia. Children of myopic parents are more likely to have myopia than are
      children of nonmyopic parents. The ocular components (axial length, anterior chamber depth,
      and corneal curvature) and refractive errors of MZ twins are more closely aligned than are
      those of DZ twins.

      Therefore, it is possible to search a potential candidate gene for myopia through the genomic
      study of pathological myopia.
