      common practice was used to decrease thyroid function and prevent thyroid storm during the
      thyroidectomy. However, in modern practice, nearly all patients presenting for surgical
      management have been made euthyroid through the use of medications such as propylthiouracil.
      Despite this potassium iodine continues to be administered with the presumption that it
      decreases the friability of the gland making surgery easier, with less blood loss.

      The outcomes to be measured in this surgery are operative time, operative complications and
      blood loss.
