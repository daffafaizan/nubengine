      with unresolving CSC and subfoveal fluid. Patients will be evaluated at baseline with
      ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and color
      photography. Subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab
      administered every 28 days (Â± 2 days) for 3 injections. Thereafter they are to be evaluated
      every month until month 12. Treatment will be administered to patients if there is presence
      of active leakage as determined by fluorescein angiography or persistence presence of sub
      retinal fluid upon OCT examination at that monthly visit.
