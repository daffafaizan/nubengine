      he/she will receive will be randomly decided. The patient's response to chemotherapy will be
      used to test the usefulness of the COXEN program, which is the main goal of this trial. Other
      potential tests to predict a patient's response to chemotherapy will also be evaluated. In
      this study, the patient may receive the treatment in Arm 1 (gemcitabine and cisplatin) or the
      treatment in Arm 2 [methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and filgrastim (or
      pegfilgrastim)]. There will be about 230 people taking part in this study (115 in each arm).
