      patients between the ages of 3 to 5 years and less than 22, with 'standard risk'
      medulloblastoma with a low-risk biological profile. Patients eligible for the study will be
      those with non-metastatic medulloblastoma (by CSF cytology and centrally reviewed MRI
      imaging) at diagnosis and low-risk biological profile, defined as ß-catenin nuclear
      immuno-positivity by immuno-histochemistry (IHC). Patients will have undergone total or
      near-total tumour resection and will receive conventionally fractionated (once a day)
      radiotherapy with a dose of 54 Gy to the primary tumor and 18.0 Gy to the craniospinal axis.
      Following radiotherapy, patients will receive a reduced-intensity chemotherapy with a total
      of 6 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of 3 courses of cisplatin, CCNU and vincristine
      alternating with 3 courses of cyclophosphamide and vincristine.

      The aim of the SR-arm is to test whether concurrent carboplatin during radiotherapy followed
      by 8 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy in patients with 'standard risk' medulloblastoma with
      an average-risk biological profile may improve outcome. Patients eligible for the study will
      be those with non-metastatic medulloblastoma (by CSF cytology and centrally reviewed MRI
      imaging) at diagnosis and average-risk biological profile, defined as ß-catenin nuclear
      immuno-negativity by IHC. Patients will have undergone total or near-total tumour resection
      and will receive conventionally fractionated (once a day) radiotherapy with a dose of 54 Gy
      to the primary tumor and 23.4 Gy to the craniospinal axis. Following radiotherapy, patients
      will receive a modified-intensity chemotherapy with a total of 8 cycles of chemotherapy
      consisting of 4 courses of cisplatin, CCNU and vincristine alternating with 4 courses of
      cyclophosphamide and vincristine.
