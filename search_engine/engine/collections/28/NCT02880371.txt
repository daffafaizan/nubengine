    
      ARRY-382 is an inhibitor of CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor).

      Each phase of the study consists of a 28-day screening period; 21-day treatment cycles with
      the combination of ARRY-382 and pembrolizumab until disease progression as determined by the
      Investigator, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (or other
      discontinuation criteria are met), and a 30-day safety follow-up period. Patients in all
      cohorts/phases will be monitored for overall survival (OS) until 1 year after the date of the
      last patient's first visit.
