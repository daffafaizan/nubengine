      amphetamines for the treatment of narcolepsy. This may be particularly important in the case
      of narcolepsy type 2, for which randomized, controlled trial data show that other treatments
      are less beneficial than they are for participants with narcolepsy type 1. For the closely
      related disorder of idiopathic hypersomnia, clinical trial data to guide treatment
      decision-making are even more limited, with only three published controlled trials ever
      performed.

      To address these evidence gaps, the researchers propose a randomized, active-treatment
      controlled trial comparing modafinil and amphetamine salts for the treatment of narcolepsy
      type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia. The primary outcome will be reduction in excessive daytime
      sleepiness, as measured by change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores from baseline to week 12
      on treatment. Other important patient-reported outcomes will be considered as secondary
      outcomes, including Patient Global Impression of Change for sleep inertia, cognitive
      dysfunction, and sleepiness.

      In addition to directly comparing the efficacy of these two medications for hypersomnolent
      patients, this study will also evaluate for relatively safety in this population. Further,
      this study will assess clinical predictors of treatment response. All three of these aims
      will be complementary in informing shared decision-making about whether to treat with
      modafinil or amphetamine salts.

      Forty-four treatment-na√Øve adult patients seeking evaluation at the Emory Sleep Center for
      narcolepsy type 2 or idiopathic hypersomnia will be invited to participate and will be
      randomized to one of the treatment arms upon consent. Participants will receive study
      treatment for 12 weeks.
