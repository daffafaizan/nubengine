      intervention research design in order to evaluate the effects of education applied to family
      members who provide care for patients with colorectal cancer on their healthy lifestyle
      behaviors and reactions towards caregiving. The study population consisted of 100 caregiver
      who provide primary care to patients with colorectal cancer. The study data were collected
      using the "Socio-Demographic Characteristics Data Collection Form", "Healthy Lifestyle
      Behaviors Scale II (HPLP-II)" and the "Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA)". The pre-test was
      applied to the experimental and control groups at the first interview. The preferred
      interview format was a booklet. Three times face to-face individual educational sessions were
      provided to the experimental group, accompanied by a education booklet. After the third
      educational session the post-test was applied to the caregivers in the experimental and
      control groups.
