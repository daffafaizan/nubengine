      SPECT reconstruction software and a low dose (LD) of 99mTC-tetrofosmin will provide equal
      quality and prognostic value as a full dose (FD) of 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion
      SPECT imaging methodology.

      The images of clinical patients from the Diagnostic Imaging Department will be assessed and
      compared for image quality and myocardial perfusion. The outcomes of participants that have
      had FD studies will be compared to those who have had LD studies. Consented participants will
      be contacted and will be asked to provide information on their cardiovascular health since
      the date of their LD or FD scan, such as non fatal myocardial infarction, death, congestive
      heart failure, admission to hospital with chest pain, further cardiac diagnostic testing,
      including angiography and early and late revascularization. The event information will be
      tabulated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for the LD and FD studies.

      The study hypothesizes that there will be no difference in the quality and prognostic value
      between the LD and FD 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT MPI imaging protocols. The study hypothesizes
      that there will be no increase in repeat diagnostic testing and angiography with using the LD
      imaging protocol.
