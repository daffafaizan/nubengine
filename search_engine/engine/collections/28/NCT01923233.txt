      boosting. The priming step involves intradermal injections of AlloStim(TM). This is designed
      to increase the circulating titer of allo-specific Th1 memory cells; the vaccination step
      involves percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of a single liver lesion followed immediately
      with an intratumoral injection of AlloStim(TM) into the ablated lesion, followed 3 days later
      by an additional intratumoral injection into the previously ablated lesion with AlloStim(TM).
      This step is designed to elicit tumor-specific Th1 immunity. The activation step involves
      intravenous infusions of AlloStim(TM). This step is designed to cause the activation and
      extravasation of circulating memory cells and the activation of innate immune cells. The
      booster step includes two monthly IV infusions of AlloStim(TM). This step is designed to
      maintain an inflammatory cytokine storm designed to counteract immune suppressor mechanisms
      and tumor immunoavoidance mechanisms.
