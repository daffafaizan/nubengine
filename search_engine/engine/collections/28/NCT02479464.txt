      report in an outpatient behavioral health clinic in St. Paul, Minnesota. While the ultimate
      goal of this project is to show an improvement in patient outcomes, this pilot study will be
      used to evaluate the feasibility of introducing the pharmacogenomic algorithm to a new
      setting that does not routinely use the algorithm. Secondary outcome data will be collected
      to generate meaningful estimates of the magnitude of potential treatment effects. The study
      will consist of two phases, each enrolling 2530 subjects. In Phase 1, consecutive patients
      will be prospectively monitored to observe standard practice. Patients will be given the
      option to receive genotyping and those that agree will have blood drawn. However, the results
      of the genotyping and algorithm will not be released until all phase 1 patients have
      completed study visits.. Subsequently, in Phase 2, also enrolling 3025 subjects, the results
      of the genotyping and algorithm will be made available immediately for additional consecutive
      prospectively monitored patients. Patients will be prospectively monitored in the same
      fashion as Phase 1. The results of the study will be used to perform preliminary analyses and
      subsequent fully powered multi-site trials will be planned based on the results of this
      study.
