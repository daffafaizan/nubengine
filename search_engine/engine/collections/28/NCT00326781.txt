      the greatest need and likelihood of benefit. The investigators hypothesize that the nicotine
      nasal spray (NS) will result in significantly higher abstinence rates than transdermal
      nicotine (TN) for the following subgroups of smokers: those with genotypes associated with
      less transmission of dopamine or serotonin, or greater metabolism of nicotine; and those with
      higher levels of novelty-seeking, depression, and attention deficit symptoms.
