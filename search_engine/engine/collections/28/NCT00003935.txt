      radiotherapy on one year survival in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic brain
      stem glioma. II. Assess the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Induction: Patients receive oral etoposide daily on days 1-21 and vincristine IV on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. Patients receive
      radiotherapy daily for 6 weeks concurrently with induction chemotherapy. Maintenance: One
      week after induction therapy, patients receive vincristine IV on days 1 and 8 and oral
      etoposide daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 10 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2
      years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
