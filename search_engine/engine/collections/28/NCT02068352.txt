      disease experience repeated exacerbations and remissions. . Therapeutic guidelines for the
      disease, currently being developed in many countries, all recognize AD as chronic eczema that
      is accompanied by the physiological dysfunction of the skin and in which inflammation is
      caused by various nonspecific stimuli or specific allergens. OPA 15406 is a type-4
      phosphodiesterase (PDE4) inhibitor. PDE4 inhibitors are thought to be useful for allergic
      inflammatory diseases. This is a Phase 2 dose ranging study to evaluate the efficacy of two
      concentrations of OPA 15406 ointment compared to vehicle, when administered topically twice
      daily in subjects with mild to moderate AD.
