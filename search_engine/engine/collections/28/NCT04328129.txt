    
      This study is a interventional study that present minimal risks and constraints to evaluate
      the presence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or antibodies among individuals living in
      households where there is a confirmed coronavirus case in order to provide useful information
      on the proportion of symptomatic forms and the extent of the virus transmission in tropical
      regions such as French Guiana, Guadeloupe and New-Caledonia.

      Subjects will be assessed (questionnaires and sampling) in their homes. Subjects will be
      asked to attend study visits at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, 90, 180 and 360.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the rate of intra-household secondary
      transmission of the virus.
