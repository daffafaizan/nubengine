      incidence of moderate visual loss. Selective photocoagulation for focal macular edema
      statistically reduces macular thickening, measured with optical coherence tomography, as
      early as two weeks after treatment, without significant changes over center point thickness.
      Although anatomic improvement has been demonstrated with OCT, clinical improvement takes
      longer to be evident: the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study describe that clinical
      differences in visual function are after the eight month, and all the treatment strategies
      for macular edema used in this study were associated with an increased rate of moderate
      visual loss, during the first six weeks. Differences in research can achieve statistical
      significance, without clinical significance. A study was conducted to identify changes of
      visual function three weeks after photocoagulation for focal macular edema, and to correlate
      them with changes of CPT and macular volume, in order to compare the behavior of anatomical
      changes with visual changes.
