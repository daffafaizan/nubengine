      Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HSBC) surveys, with data available on height and weight.
      The GSHS is a World Health Organisation (WHO) initiative, designed to assess health
      behaviours of adolescents through cross-sectional school-based surveys, across several
      countries using similar standardised procedures. The HSBC study are WHO sponsored
      cross-sectional school-based surveys that uses similar standardised procedures to the GSHS to
      examine the physical and mental health of adolescents in the WHO European Region and North
      America.
