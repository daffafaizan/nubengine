      atorvastatin 40 mg treatment in patients with stable COPD. The whole study duration will
      include three phases: pre-study screening and enrollment procedures (4 weeks), clinical
      assessment at dosing (52 weeks), and post study follow up (4 weeks). During the participation
      in the study subjects will attend Visit 1 (V1, -4 weeks), visit 2 (V2, day 0), visit 3 (V3,
      week6), visit 4 (V4, week 12), visit 5 (V5, week 26), visit 6 (V6, week 38), visit 7 (V7,
      week 52), and follow-up end of study visit (EOS, 56 weeks). The study will begin with a
      4-weeks screening phase where patients who fulfill preliminary inclusion/exclusion criteria
      (prior to entry into study), will be given informed consent and screened. The baseline
      laboratory tests, clinical and medical evaluation including concomitant medication and drug
      of abuse will be completed to determine patient continuing eligibility to participate in the
      study.

      Upon confirmation of eligibility, the patients will be randomized into two treatment groups
      receiving one of two medications tested in the study. Each patient enrolled into the clinical
      study will have to report to the clinic 7 times in order to complete procedures. Blood will
      be drawn before and during the statin or placebo treatment from patients according to study
      protocol. This part of the project aims to develop statin response biomarkers for
      personalized treatment of COPD, based on RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) information derived from,
      leukocytes and blood plasma of COPD patients with characterized clinical Atorvastatin
      response phenotypes.
