      cross-over trial. Patients with active left sided ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or
      active extensive disease with proven IDA will be enrolled. Study patients will receive the
      treatment following informed consent and will be followed up regularly by the study
      coordinator for side effects, compliance and adherence. A blood test for hemoglobin and
      hematocrit and other biomarkers of iron stores and repletion will be done on all patients at
      baseline and then after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of therapy. In case patients did not tolerate
      either treatment, they will be switched to the other treatment after a washout period of 2
      weeks.

      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Captafer which is an
      iron-free (one fixed non disclosed dose) food supplement given twice daily, to oral iron
      therapy given at a dose of 195 mg twice daily for the same period of time in an open label
      cross-over trial in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
      disease patients.

      Primary endpoint:

      Tolerability

      Secondary endpoints

      Response to iron repletion as using hemoglobin and hematocrit as surrogates Compliance and
      adherence (monthly pill count)

      The study sample size was calculated based on the primary end points of tolerability with a
      significance level (α) of 0.05, a Power (1-β) of 0.8 with an expected 90% tolerability and
      adherence for Captafer vs. 50% for oral iron. At these parameters, and taking a
      non-inferiority limit of 5%, the sample size was calculated to be 20.
