      drinking in individuals with AUD comorbid with PTSD. CBD is currently a medical research
      focus because it shows promise for treating anxiety and other brain disorders, but does not
      produce a 'high' like other parts of cannabis, has not been shown to be addictive, and is
      safe, with few or no side effects. AUD, which is one of the most common and most debilitating
      psychiatric conditions, is often associated with other comorbid psychiatric disorders - in
      particular, PTSD: depending on the population studied, 30-60% of individuals with AUD also
      have PTSD, with high comorbidity rates in military veterans. Evidence from animal models and
      clinical studies suggests that the negative emotion caused by PTSD symptoms intensifies
      craving for alcohol during alcohol withdrawal, perpetuating the addictive cycle; further,
      evidence shows that the brain circuits underlying negative emotion and addiction are linked
      in a forebrain area called the extended amygdala, which provides a neuropharmacological
      target to simultaneously treat both negative emotion and alcohol addiction in individuals
      with AUD and PTSD. CBD is known to inhibit brain activity in the extended amygdala, leading
      to reduced anxiety in both animal models and humans. CBD also reduces addictive alcohol
      seeking in animal models.
