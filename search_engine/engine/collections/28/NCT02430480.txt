    
      Background:

        -  Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will present with intermediate or high-risk
           disease

        -  Many develop castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as curative strategies are often
           unsuccessful

        -  Treatment options typically involve radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT)
           in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)

        -  Even when cancers are initially sensitive to ADT, resistance ultimately emerges either
           through clonal selection or through a variety of adaptive mechanisms (secondary
           resistance).

        -  The recent introduction of novel androgen pathway inhibitors offers an opportunity to
           potentially improve the cure rate of men with intermediate and high risk localized
           prostate cancer

        -  There remains a great need for improved techniques to determine mechanisms of treatment
           response and resistance.

      Objectives:

      -To test the feasibility of multi parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for the
      localization and detection of focal prostate cancer both before and after pre-operative
      treatment with ADT and enzalutamide.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with nonmetastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer with intermediate or
           high-risk features

        -  Patients with testosterone levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/dL.

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1.

      Design:

        -  Patients will be treated with ADT and enzalutamide for 6 months

        -  Two 3T mpMRI endorectal examinations (One at screening and after 6 month of treatment)

        -  Screening biopsy (magnetic resonance (MR)/ultrasound (US) guided) samples

        -  Standard of care prostatectomy (RP) following post treatment mpMRI

        -  All tumor specimens will undergo genomic analysis
