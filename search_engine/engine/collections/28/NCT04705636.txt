      according to the WHO report, and the adherence rate for regular intake of preventive
      therapies decreases to 28%.

      For cystic fibrosis, rates are not much higher. Optimistic articles report an average
      compliance rate of 60%. Other articles report a rate of 50% which varies according to the age
      of the patient, the intake treatment complexity and burdensome drug treatment (physiotherapy
      achieves the lowest adherence with 38%), the disease understanding and the interest of
      treatment persuasion. Low adherence can also be the result of incorrect use of administration
      devices, for example for inhaled treatments. Technical errors are very frequent and affect
      around 30% of patients.

      Families with children suffering from cystic fibrosis need daily support. Health
      professionals need to relay their recommendations at home. This is why new and funny tools
      dedicated to children with chronic illnesses are needed.
