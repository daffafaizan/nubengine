      stages II, IIIA, IIIB and IV. Tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium (TS-1) is used as the
      first line treatment for advanced and recurrent gastric cancer. But TS-1 is accompanied by an
      adverse drug reaction of bone marrow suppression that is not readily seen in conventional
      oral fluoropyrimidines. Among randomized controlled trials on postoperative adjuvant
      chemotherapy for gastric cancer, the beneficial results of survival rates using Krestin (PSK)
      in combination with chemotherapy have been reported. With the objective to enhance the
      antitumor effect of TS-1 and to improve the QOL of patients, we have planned to validate the
      clinical significance of combined PSK and TS-1 therapy as postoperative adjuvant therapy for
      gastric cancer, using in principle the TS-1 regimen of 2-week dosing 1-week off for 6 months
      followed by 2-week dosing 2-week off for 6 months.
