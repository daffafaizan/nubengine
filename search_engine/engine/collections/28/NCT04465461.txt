    
      The study will be a prospective, multi-centre, pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of
      VATS fissure completion on the efficacy of endobronchial valve insertion (Zephyr Valve) in
      the treatment of subjects with severe COPD who exhibit collateral ventilation.

      Study patients who provide informed consent and meet the initial inclusion/exclusion criteria
      following baseline screening assessments and multidisciplinary review to determine
      eligibility will undergo two procedures, not less than 28 days apart. The first procedure
      will involve an initial bronchoscopy and Chartis® assessment of collateral ventilation under
      general anaesthesia followed by a VATS fissure completion between targeted lobes in subjects
      that have collateral ventilation. The second procedure undertaken following fissure
      completion surgery will involve bronchoscopic insertion of Zephyr® Valve(s) in the targeted
      lobe, under sedation or general anaesthesia.

      Subjects will be followed up over a 6-month period following VATS fissure completion and
      Zephyr® Endobronchial Valve (Zephyr Valve) insertion.
