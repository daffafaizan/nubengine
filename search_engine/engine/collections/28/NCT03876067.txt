      Our procedures for O3T application in CBP surgery conform to international guidelines of the
      ''Madrid Declaration on Ozone Therapy'' 32 . M-O3T will be carried out as follows:

      50mL of blood drawn by vacuum from the patient central catheter into a sterile blood
      transfusion bag in which 10 mL of 3.8% Na citrate solution (Galenica Senese Industries,
      Siena, Italy) as an anticoagulant will be previously added so that the blood/citrate volume
      ratio was 9:1. After blood withdrawal, the bag will momentarily disconnected leaving the
      venous access open by a saline infusion 33 . A corresponding volume (50 mL) of gas was
      immediately added with an O3 concentration of 20-50 micrograms/mL gas. Ozone was produced by
      Medozon compact generator (Herrmann Apparatebau GmbH, Germany).

      The gas is immediately and continuously mixed with the blood in the bag for at least 5 min
      and with gentle rotating movement to avoid foaming. Due to the blood viscosity, the gas
      mixture does not instantaneously come into contact with the whole blood mass, thus this
      mixing time is necessary. During these 5 min of mixing, the ozone totally reacted with both
      the potent antioxidants of plasma and the unsaturated lipids bound to albumin, generating
      asmall amount of hydrogen peroxide and alkenals. These two messengers were responsible for
      eliciting crucial biochemical reactions on both erythrocytes and within cells. At this point,
      the hyper-oxygenated ozonated blood will be mixed with the cold cardioplegia (Thomsons
      cardioplegia) this amount of ozonated blood will be added to each 500 ml of cardioplegic
      solution

      Exclusion Criteria:

      The patient will be excluded from the study if he has any of the following:

        -  left ventricular ejection fraction< 40%

        -  diabetic or other metabolic disorders,

        -  use of left ventricular assist devices,

        -  Renal failure or on hemodialysis

        -  Hepatic dysfunction

        -  Hypothyroidism

        -  implanted pacemaker
