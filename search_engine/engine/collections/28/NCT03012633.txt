      Lysis Timer as a rapid diagnostic device for hyperfibrinolysis during liver transplantation.
      Lysis times provided by this device will be compared to the euglobulin lysis times and to the
      others parameters of fibrinolysis at the different stages of liver transplantation and more
      specifically at the anhepatic stage and after graft revascularization.

      The secondary aims are to compare the results of the Lysis Timer, the thromboelastogram, the
      thrombin generation test and the standard laboratory tests in the context of
      hyperfibrinolysis during liver transplantation.
