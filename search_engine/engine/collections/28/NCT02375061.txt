      adjustment. Specially, optimism has been linked to lower pain sensitivity, better physical
      functioning, less psychological distress and pain catastrophizing. Until recently, the
      beneficial effects of optimism on pain have been studied mostly in correlational studies or
      in experimental interventions in laboratory settings. To address the gap between research and
      clinical practice, the aim of this study is to test the efficacy of the Best Possible Self
      intervention (BPS) using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with fibromyalgia
      patients.

      BPS is a guided imagery exercise that requires participants to envision themselves in the
      future, achieving desired goals in different areas of their lives. This exercise has shown
      efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect compared to a control
      condition, in general population (Meevissen, Peters & Alberts, 2011; Sheldon &Lyubomirsky,
      2012; Peters, Flink, Boersma & Linton, 2010). Taking into account the prior literature, the
      aim of the present study is to carry out a randomized controlled study in order to replicate
      the findings about the effects of BPS on optimism, mood and affect in a chronic pain
      population. The exercise will be applied through a Positive Technology system and the effects
      will be analyzed during four months. The design employed in this study is similar to the used
      in other studies (Meevissen et al, 2011; Renner, Schwarz, Peters & Huibers, 2014; Sheldon &
      Lyubomirsky, 2006).
