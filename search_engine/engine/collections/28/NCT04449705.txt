      At the start of each case, the technician will obtain an OR PathTrac kit and will fill out
      required card indicating the OR number, the surgery date, and the type of surgery. The cards
      will be placed back into the kit. Sample collection will be directed via use of the kit. The
      first sample is the adjustable pressure-limiting valve and agent dial of the machine before
      patient entry (measures terminal cleaning), then provider (attending and assistant) hands
      after they enter but before patient interaction, then the provider nose and mouth after
      induction of anesthesia and patient stabilization, then provider hands, then same
      environmental sites, then provider sites again, then stopcock.

      A transmission event will be defined as detection of S. aureus pathogens among 2 distinct,
      epidemiologically-related reservoirs within a surveillance unit. The software platform will
      process transmission dynamics in order to continually summarize the epidemiology of S. aureus
      transmission, with results updated daily as case-pair data is continually entered into the
      program. This information will be continually displayed to identify the most common reservoir
      of origin, the most common transmission locations (vectors), and involvement of key portals
      of entry (stopcocks). These will become improvement targets with feedback provided via
      automated failure mode analysis reports. The research assistant will use the reports to
      continually optimize the interventions during the observational period.
