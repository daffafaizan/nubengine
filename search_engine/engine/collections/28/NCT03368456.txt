      disproportionately affected. Youth between the ages of 15 - 24 constitute 25% of the sexually
      experienced population, yet account for 46% and 50% of HIV infections and new STIs,
      respectively. National surveillance data indicate that youth disproportionately engage in
      HIV/STI risk behaviors, including condomless sex and licit and illicit drug use, which
      increase their risk for HIV/STI infection. Despite the disproportionately high rates of
      HIV/STI infection and risk behaviors in youth, fewer than 14% report having ever been tested
      for HIV and many are not routinely screened for asymptomatic STIs as recommended by the
      Center for Disease Control. In Southeast Michigan, HIV/STI are disproportionately high. To
      address these significant public health concerns, a mobile-health (mHealth) intervention was
      developed for health clinic settings. The proposed research aims to develop a cross-platform
      and universal version of S4E. The cross-platform and universal version of S4E will be
      compatible with both IOS and Android operating systems, and multiple mobile devices, aimed at
      providing adolescents with ongoing access to the intervention once they leave the clinic. The
      proposed research will also evaluate the preliminary efficacy of S4E to improve HIV/STI
      testing and reduce HIV/STI risk behaviors in a clinic sample (n=100) of at-risk youth ages
      14-21 living in Southeast Michigan by conducting a Stage I RCT to examine the preliminary
      efficacy of S4E, relative to Usual Care, among a sample of 100 at-risk youth over six months.
