    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study

      Patients will be enrolled into one of two parallel cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: impaired renal function AND poor performance status (cycle length = 28 days).
           Everolimus 10 mg orally daily

        -  Cohort 2: impaired renal function OR poor performance status (cycle length = 28 days).
           Everolimus 10 mg orally daily + IV Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, 8, 15

      Restaging evaluations will be performed after every 2 cycles.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Karnofsky performance status 60-70%

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

        -  Aminotransferases (AST and ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (unless liver metastases, then ≤ 5 x ULN)

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of < 60 using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or IV.

        -  No unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction
           within 6 months of start of study drug, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any
           other clinically significant cardiac disease.
