      behaviour, resulting in more efficient treatments and higher prevalence of cancer
      survivors.Due to aggressive therapy, rectal cancer survivors can exhibit late sequelae of
      treatment, most common being impaired bowel, voiding, sexual malfunctioning and quality of
      life impairment. In order to determine the impact of rectal cancer and its treatment on
      patients' quality of life over time, this study will prospectively follow a cohort of
      patients at specified intervals evaluating their physical symptoms, physical and social
      functioning and overall quality of life.Medical and sociodemographic factors that might be
      predictive will be tested.
