        -  Determine the response rate and time to progression in patients with relapsed or
           refractory intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with doxorubicin
           and topotecan.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-10 minutes on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30
      minutes on days 3-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and annually for the next 3 years.
