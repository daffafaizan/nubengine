      capacity and quality-of-life, largely related to shortness of breath. Many of the therapies
      currently available for COPD are aimed at improving these factors. Exercise capacity is
      limited in part by high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs. Sildenafil, also
      known as Viagra, is an FDA-approved therapy for male erectile dysfunction. One of its effects
      is to relax (or open) the lung vessels, thereby lowering the blood pressure in the lungs. We
      hypothesize that sildenafil will result in an improvement in exercise capacity,
      quality-of-life, and shortness of breath.

      Enrolled subjects will receive sildenafil or placebo for 4 weeks followed by exercise tests,
      breathing tests, and administration of quality-of-life questionnaires. Subjects will then
      receive placebo or sildenafil (whichever one they did not receive for the first 4 weeks) for
      another 4 weeks, followed by the same testing.
