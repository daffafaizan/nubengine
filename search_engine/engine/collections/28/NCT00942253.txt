    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the acute and long term (6 months)
      effect of exercise training in combination with dopamine agonists in quality of life, muscle
      function, sleep quality and metabolism in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS)
      receiving dialysis therapy.

      Objectives - Aims:

        1. To investigate whether a single bout of intradialytic exercise session could have an
           effect in motor restlessness often seen during hemodialysis session in patients with RLS

        2. To investigate whether a 24 weeks therapy with dopamine agonist or placebo will have an
           effect in sleep quality, functional capacity and metabolic profile of the hemodialysis
           patients with RLS

        3. To examine whether dopamine agonists or placebo and aerobic intradialytic exercise act
           synergistically for the improvement of physical functioning and muscle performance as
           well as it could reduce the signs of augmentation in hemodialysis patients with RLS
