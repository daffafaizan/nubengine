      limb could augment the effects of task-oriented exercise therapy on lower limb motor function
      in people with stroke, possibly through increased excitability of sensorimotor cortex.

      In mirror therapy (MT), the intact limb performs motor tasks while its mirror reflection is
      superimposed over the covered paretic limb, creating a visual illusion of enhanced function
      over the paretic limb. The visual input during MT could substitute for reduced proprioceptive
      inputs and increase spatial attention of the paretic limb, which could improve motor function
      of the paretic limb, possibly through increased cortical activity in the lesioned hemisphere
      and mirror neurone system.

      The next question concerns whether MT could be combined with TENS and whether their
      synergetic effects could maximise the motor output of paretic limbs in people with stroke.
