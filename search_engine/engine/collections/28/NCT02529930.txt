      During the dosing phase the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 2 different
      vaccination schedules of 3 mg VB10.16 immunotherapy will be established in a minimum of 12
      patients with histology confirmed CIN 2.

      During the expansion phase the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the selected
      vaccination schedule will be evaluated in approximately 15 to 20 patients with histology
      confirmed HPV16+ CIN 2/3.
