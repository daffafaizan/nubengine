      data collection sessions for each participant. The three data sessions will occur before,
      after, and at 3-month follow-up of an 14-day, online stress-reduction training, in which
      participants will be asked to complete about 25 to 30 minutes of practice each day in one of
      two stress-reduction techniques. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a
      mindfulness training program or a reappraisal training program. The mindfulness training
      emphasizes mindfulness-based techniques to reduce stress and promote well-being, whereas the
      reappraisal training emphasizes cognitive strategies to change one's perception of the
      stressor as a way to reduce stress and promote well-being.
