      anaemia as important risk factors for adverse outcomes following surgery. Recent heart
      attacks are associated with greater risks than older ones. While recent data suggests that
      newer strokes impart significantly greater risk than older strokes, there is a lack of
      concordance on the literature on this, despite the plausibility of the finding. Despite
      knowledge that prior pneumonia has long-term health risks, there is a lack of data on whether
      prior pneumonia influences perioperative risk or whether the time interval from pneumonia to
      surgery affects this relationship. Furthermore while diabetes mellitus and anaemia are known
      to be important perioperative risk factors, the relationship between haemoglobin
      concentration or HbA1c levels and perioperative outcomes is unclear. The aim of this
      epidemiological study is to explore these associations with perioperative risk in the United
      Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (with linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics data
      and Office of National Statistics mortality data).

      The research aims are:

        1. To investigate the association between three recent acute medical events (stroke,
           pneumonia and MI) and adverse perioperative outcomes following non-cardiac and cardiac
           surgery.

        2. To investigate the association between time-elapsed between acute medical events
           (stroke, pneumonia and MI) and adverse perioperative outcomes following non-cardiac and
           cardiac surgery.

        3. To investigate numerical risk thresholds for haemoglobin and HbA1c that could predict
           adverse perioperative outcomes following non-cardiac and cardiac surgery.
