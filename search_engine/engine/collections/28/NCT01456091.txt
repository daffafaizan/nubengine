      Identity Mentoring) 4 Teen Moms in reducing the incidence of rapid repeat pregnancies and
      associated sexual risk behavior. The AIM 4 Teen Moms program is a combination of individual
      and small group sessions intervention that encourages parenting young women ages 15-19 years
      old to delay rapid repeat pregnancies for 24 months or later. It consists of seven individual
      1-hour long sessions (generally conducted in the participant's home) and two 90-minute group
      sessions delivered over a 12 week period. Study participants will be adolescent mothers
      receiving services from California's Adolescent Family Life or Cal-Learn programs in the Los
      Angeles County area. There will be no intervention delivered to members of the control group.
      This study is being conducted as part of the national Evaluation of Adolescent Pregnancy
      Prevention Approaches funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of
      Adolescent Health.
