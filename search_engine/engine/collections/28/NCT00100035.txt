      particularly high risk for physical and mental illness. Although stress and illness are
      serious problems among American Indian caregivers in the Northwest, few studies have
      concentrated on this population. PT is a treatment that involves awareness of one's energy
      field and touch therapy; it has been shown to provide several physiological, biological, and
      psychological benefits. This study will determine whether PT is more effective than respite
      from caregiving in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression and improving health function and
      overall quality of life in American Indian caregivers.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either eight weekly sessions of PT or 3
      hours of weekly respite from caregiving for 8 weeks. At the beginning of the study and at
      Weeks 4 and 8, participants will complete questionnaires and self-report scales on stress,
      anxiety, depression, and quality of life. In addition, heart rate variability and levels of
      cortisol will be measured at study entry and Weeks 4 and 8.
