      educational counseling regarding lifestyle modification methods to reduce cardiovascular
      risk. Study patients will be randomized to receive a home monitoring device and will be
      instructed on its use. Generic simvastatin will be given to reduce LDL levels in all groups.
      It is the hypothesis that those study patients receiving a home device will reach target LDL
      (goal LDL) more frequently than those randomized to usual care( no device).
