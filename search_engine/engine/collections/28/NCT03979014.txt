      women, a condition where there are abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix (the opening
      to the vagina from the womb). High grade CIN can develop into cervical cancer, and standard
      treatment is a surgical procedure called conisation, where a scalpel or laser is used to
      remove a cone-shaped piece of the cervix containing the abnormal cells. HPV vaccines are
      routinely used in adolescent girls as part screening programmes to prevent cervical cancer
      (12-18 years of age in the UK).

      The NOVEL study will compare the vaccine approach with standard treatment in a randomised
      controlled trial, where eligible women will be randomly allocated to one of the following:

      Arm 1: Local Cervical treatment and vaccination with Gardasil 9, followed by additional
      vaccinations 2 and 6 months after conisation Arm 2: Local Cervical Treatment and Observation

      This study is for women aged 18-55 years of age with biopsy confirmed high-grade CIN. 1000
      women will be recruited at colposcopy clinics in the UK, Finland and Sweden. Women will be
      followed up for a maximum of two and a half years.
