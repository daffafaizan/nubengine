      I. To evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant degarelix (degarelix acetate) on prostate
      dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone levels.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of degarelix acetate on androgen-regulated gene expression and
      apoptosis as assessed by immunohistochemistry, complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA)
      microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      II. To determine the effect of degarelix acetate on follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and
      FSH receptor expression in prostate cancer and surrounding microenvironment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive degarelix acetate subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for up to 6 courses. Beginning at week 15, patients also undergo standard external beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT) for 8.5 weeks.
