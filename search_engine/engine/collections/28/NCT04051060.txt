      various stimuli and reversible airway obstruction. Asthma is a disease with high morbidity
      and mortality despite all advances in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment in the world. It
      is estimated that there are approximately 300 million asthmatic patients in the world. In our
      country, approximately one out of every 12-13 adults and one in 7-8 children have asthma.
      Clinical symptoms of asthma include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing. Increased
      symptoms in asthmatic patients lead to impaired respiratory function. In chronic respiratory
      problems, participants restrict their activity to avoid shortness of breath. As a result,
      physical fitness levels are reduced, shortness of breath occurs at earlier workloads, and
      participants do less activity. In chronic disorders, managing the disease alone may not be
      enough to optimize normal functioning in daily life. In literature, it is seen that daily
      life activities, quality of life, school performance and work performance are affected in
      asthmatic patients. it is thought to be useful in determining the course of treatment to be
      given to the patient in the course of the disease.
