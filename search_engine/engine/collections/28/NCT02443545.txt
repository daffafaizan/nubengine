    
      Deferiprone (brand name FerriproxÂ®) is an iron chelator that is approved in the United States
      and over 60 other countries for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassemia,
      when other treatments are inadequate. This study has been designed to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of deferiprone to treat iron overload in patients who have
      sickle cell disease or other anemias.

      Only patients who have completed an earlier study, LA38-0411, are eligible to enroll in this
      one.
