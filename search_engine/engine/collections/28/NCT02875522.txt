      only partially reversible. The primary cause of COPD is smoking which leads to airway
      inflammation and oxidative damage to the lungs, which has been linked to the development and
      progression of the disease. The inflammation is not isolated to the lungs as patients with
      COPD also have systemic inflammation that has been linked to a number of cardiovascular
      comorbidities such as endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Evidence
      demonstrates that COPD patients have a greater incidence of vascular dysfunction and adverse
      vascular remodeling, which worsens with disease severity. In fact, patients with COPD are at
      35 times greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease and stroke than healthy aged
      matched individuals. In healthy individuals and a number of chronic conditions, aerobic
      exercise training is well established to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular disease. The benefits of exercise are likely through improvements in
      endothelial function, systemic inflammation, and cardiac and cerebral vascular function.
      However, whether exercise training can have the same effects in a chronic inflammatory
      condition like COPD has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of an 8 week aerobic exercise training program in patient's chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease as determined by improvements in endothelial function, systemic
      inflammation and cardiac and cerebral vascular function.
