        -  Determine the overall response rate in patients with chemotherapy-refractory diffuse
           large B-cell lymphoma treated with bortezomib.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the possible mechanism of resistance to this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 20 days and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
