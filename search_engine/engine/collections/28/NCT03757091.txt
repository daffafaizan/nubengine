    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rates of difficult endotracheal tube (ETT) placement using a flexible
      intubation scope (FIS) versus a combination of flexible intubation and video laryngoscopy in
      difficult airway management.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the ease of using a flexible intubation scope (FIS) with and without the use of
      the video laryngoscope (VL).

      II. Total time for securing the airway. III. Number of attempts required for intubation. IV.
      Rate of failure at intubation. V. Incidence of desaturation. VI. Assessment for hoarseness,
      sore mouth, neck, or jaw, dysphonia, dysphagia, lip injury, tongue injury, or tooth damage.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo flexible scope intubation up to 2 attempts following induction of
      general anesthesia and adequate manual ventilation. In case of failed 2 attempts, patients
      undergo a third attempt utilizing another technique or device.

      ARM B: Patients undergo flexible scope intubation and video laryngoscopy up to 2 attempts
      following induction of general anesthesia and adequate manual ventilation. In case of failed
      2 attempts, patients undergo a third attempt utilizing another technique or device.
