      Primary

        -  To determine whether reflexology is as effective as aromatherapy massage for alleviation
           of self-selected symptoms in patients with cancer in an outpatient setting.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the difference between the two therapies with respect to Visual Analogue
           Scale (VAS) relaxation scores before and after each treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to gender (male vs female), treatment
      (chemotherapy vs other) and their first concern choice (pain vs other). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (Reflexology): Patients undergo 45-60 minutes of reflexology for 4 sessions.

        -  Arm II (Aromatherapy massage): Patients undergo 45-60 minutes of of aromatherapy massage
           for 4 sessions.

      Patients complete questionnaires (Measure Yourself Concerns and Well-being [MYCAW]
      questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) at baseline, before and after each session,
      and after completion of all four sessions.
