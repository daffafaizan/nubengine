      obesity. There are no known existing treatments for pediatric obesity that focus on improving
      parental behaviors and the home food and activity environment. The objective of this study
      will be to address this limitation by developing and testing a novel treatment for low-income
      minority families. The objective will be attained by testing the following hypothesis: A
      parent-focused, home-based treatment aimed at improving parental feeding behaviors, child
      exposure to fruits and vegetables, and the home food and activity environment will result in
      significantly greater decrease in percent overweight / obesity compared to recommended
      practice. The hypothesis will be tested by using the approach of a pilot randomized control
      trial (RCT). The rationale for this aim is that success of the planned research will derive a
      treatment package that will provide the basis for the RCT. The planned research is expected
      to show the level of impact of changing parental feeding behaviors and the home environment
      on childhood overweight / obesity.
