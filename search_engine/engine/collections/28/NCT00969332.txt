      nutrition associated cholestasis will universally face mortality unless they receive a timely
      liver and/or small bowel transplant. Although transplant survival has improved in recent
      years, survival is not guaranteed, and transplant care remains costly. Alternative
      nutritional and pharmacological strategies are imperative to improve the clinical outcomes of
      infants with intestinal failure and parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis. In both
      animal and human studies, intravenous fish oil, a lipid emulsion rich in omega-3 fatty acids
      and Vitamin E, and lacking phytosterols, has been shown to ameliorate parenteral nutrition
      associated cholestasis and improve morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this pilot study
      is to investigate if Omegaven, a commercially available intravenous fish oil, at 1 g/kg/d,
      will safely reverse liver disease in 80 subjects with parenteral nutrition associated
      cholestasis. Subjects can initially receive a maximum of 6 months (24 weeks) of intravenous
      fish oil. If the subject re-develops liver disease and still satisfies inclusion/exclusion
      criteria, the intervention can be restarted. Study subjects will be compared to a historical
      cohort of children with Short Bowel Syndrome and parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis
      who have been receiving standard intravenous soybean oil for > 60 days. The fish oil cohort
      will be followed for a total of 5 years to determine if transplant-free mortality is reduced.
