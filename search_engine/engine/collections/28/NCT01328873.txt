      setting, but is often difficult and frequently results in inappropriate or late therapy. Low
      yields may be linked with empiric antibody therapy begun prior to the procedure, delayed time
      to procedure, procedure technique, the presence of graft versus host disease (GVHD),
      neutropenia, and diffuse infiltrates (as opposed to localized infiltrates or focal masses and
      nodules). One recent study found that early FOBs (less than or equal to 4 days between
      detection of pulmonary infiltrates and FOB) were 2.5 times more likely to establish a
      diagnosis of pneumonia compared to late examinations. Delaying this procedure(greater than 5
      days between detection of pulmonary infiltrates and FOB) was associated with drug resistant
      organisms, polymicrobial infections, and worsened patient prognosis.
