    
      GSK1120212 is an orally administered, potent and highly selective small molecule inhibitor of
      MEK1(mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1)/MEK2 (mitogen-activated
      extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2) activation and kinase activity. As monotherapy,
      GSK1120212 has shown an acceptable risk-benefit profile with encouraging efficacy in various
      oncologic settings. This Phase I, single-sequence, placebo-controlled, singleblind,
      multicenter study is designed to evaluate the effects of repeat oral dosing of GSK1120212 on
      electrocardiographic parameters with a particular focus on its effect on cardiac
      repolarization (Corrected QT interval [QTc] duration) as compared to placebo in subjects with
      solid tumor cancers. A single dose of placebo will be administered on Study Day 1 followed by
      administration of a once-daily 2 mg dose of GSK1120212 for 13 days (Study Days 2 through 14)
      and on Study Day 15 a dose of 3 mg of GSK1120212 will be given. Digital 12-lead
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be extracted from continuous ECG recordings obtained via
      Holter monitor on Study Days 1 and 2 after the administration of placebo and on Study Days 15
      and 16 after the administration of GSK1120212. Pharmacokinetic samples will be time-matched
      with the Holter ECGs. This study will also assess the exposure-QTc relationship between
      plasma concentrations of GSK1120212 and its effect, if any, on cardiac repolarization,
      specifically on the QTc interval. Continuous 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
      will be conducted to assess the effect of GSK1120212 on blood pressure parameters on Study
      Days 1 and 15. Safety assessments, including assessment of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) and vital signs, will be performed
      throughout the study. Following completion of study treatment, eligible subjects may
      transition to the open-label, rollover study MEK114375 to continue treatment with GSK1120212.
