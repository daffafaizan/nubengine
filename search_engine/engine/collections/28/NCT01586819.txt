      poor hydration, and various other factors. There are two major types of wrinkles-dynamic and
      static. Dynamic wrinkles, which are due to excessive muscle activity, usually of the face,
      tend to disappear when you relax your facial muscles. The most common of these dynamic
      wrinkles are frown lines, forehead wrinkles, and eye wrinkles (or crow's feet). However, if
      the excessive muscle activity is carried on for too long, these do not disappear completely
      on relaxation, and are thus called static wrinkles. Static wrinkles are formed either by
      chronic excessive muscle activity or are due to the effects of age and gravity, with a loss
      of subcutaneous fat. Examples of static wrinkles are the nasolabial folds, which are the deep
      grooves running from the sides of the nose to the corners of the mouth.
