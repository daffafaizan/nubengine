      arrest remains a challenge. Previous studies have shown that the cardiac output varies widely
      even under normal ambient conditions. Especially the mean frequenices of cardiac compression
      varies from 60 to 160/min, as well as the now-flow-time. Aim of this study is to investigate
      how narrowness and movement during a transport affect the CPR-performance.

      For this, we examine the impact of the common transport options (air and ground) on the
      outcome-varity on a manikin. The subjects for this study are professional rescuers (emergency
      physicians / paramedics) who perform a 10 minute ALS-CPR in either normal circumstances
      (resuscitation-room) or during transportation.
