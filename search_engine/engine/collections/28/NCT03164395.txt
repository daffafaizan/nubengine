      cardioversion of atrial fibrillation as compared with cardioversion by external
      defibrillation pads. It is known that dual coil leads are effective for atrial cardioversion,
      but the presence of the SVC defibrillation coil allows for selection of shock vector that
      more reliably incorporates the majority of atrial tissue compared to a single right
      ventricular lead. For a variety of reasons single coil defibrillation leads are now implanted
      in the majority of patients requiring placement of implantable cardiac defibrillators, and
      many of these patient's will later develop atrial fibrillation and potentially require
      cardioversion. Currently, there is no clear consensus on how to approach cardioversion in
      these patient's and both external and internal methods are used. Internal cardioversion may
      be ineffective exposing patient's unnecessarily to repeated shocks and battery depletion.
      External cardioversion may carry a small risk of damaged to the CIED.

      The investigator's goal is to identify patient's referred for cardioversion for atrial
      fibrillation who also have an implanted cardiac defibrillator with a single coil
      defibrillation lead and randomize them to either external or internal cardioversion.
