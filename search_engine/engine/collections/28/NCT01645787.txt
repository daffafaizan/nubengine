      in muscle weakness and impaired functional mobility. Fatigue is a common symptom in SMA with
      a resultant impact on physical function and quality of life however the precise mechanisms
      are unknown. At present there is no treatment for SMA. There is evidence that 4-AP improves
      function in SMA animal models. In patients with multiple sclerosis, 4-AP was found to improve
      walking ability and diminish fatigue. The purpose of the study is to determine whether
      treatment with 4-AP is associated with an increase in walking speed and endurance compared to
      placebo and whether the duration of treatment affects outcome. The study comprises a short
      term treatment trial in which participants are treated for 2 weeks with 4-AP and placebo in
      random sequence followed by a long treatment trial of 6 weeks in which patients are also
      treated with placebo and 4 AP. The primary outcome measure of the clinical study will be the
      six minute walk test (6MWT), which has been documented to be a valid and sensitive instrument
      to identify fatigue among ambulatory SMA patients. We will also assess the effect of 4-AP on
      muscle and nerve electrical function via electromyography (EMG) during the short term trial.
      Results of this study may provide support for larger clinical trials.
