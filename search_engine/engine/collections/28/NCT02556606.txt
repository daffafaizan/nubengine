    
      Primary Aim: To identify and evaluate the durability of benefit of the best performing of 3
      sub-anesthetic doses of a single ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, and 0.50 mg/kg) and
      midazolam (MID) (0.03 mg/kg) infusion in up to 72 Veterans with Late-Life Treatment Resistant
      Depression (LL-TRD).

      Hypothesis 1: the durability of benefit of a single KET 0.5 mg/kg infusion is superior to
      (0.1 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, and MID 0.03 mg/kg) time to relapse as measured by repeated
      measurements using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during a four-week,
      post-infusion follow-up.

      Secondary Aim: To evaluate and compare the antidepressant efficacy of the best performing of
      3 sub-anesthetic doses of a single KET (0.1 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, and 0.50 mg/kg) and MID (0.03
      mg/kg) infusion in vets with LL-TRD, using a triple blind (patient, rater, anesthesiologist)
      Bayesian adaptive randomization design.

      Hypothesis 2: a single KET 0.5 mg/kg infusion will be superior to a single infusion of KET
      (0.1 mg/kg), KET (0.25 mg/kg), and MID 0.03 mg/kg) as measured by the proportion of
      participants demonstrating > 50% reduction on MADRS scores at 72-hour post-infusion.

      Tertiary Aim: To evaluate the immediate and longer-term safety and tolerability of the most
      effective KET infusion (0.5 mg/kg) relative to MID (0.03 mg/kg) in vets with LL-TRD.

      Hypothesis 3: KET infusion at the most effective dose (0.5 mg/kg) will be safe and well
      tolerated compared to MID, as assessed by psychoactive and general side effect rating scales
      during and up to 4 weeks post study infusion.

      Exploratory Aims:

        1. To measure the effects of the most effective dose of KET (0.50 mg/kg) relative to MID
           (0.03 mg/kg) on neurocognitive performance.

        2. To measure the effects the most effective dose of KET (0.50 mg/kg) relative to MID (0.03
           mg/kg) on peripheral biomarkers of cellular plasticity and inflammation.

        3. To measure the effects the most effective dose of KET (0.50 mg/kg) relative to MID (0.03
           mg/kg) on resting-state quantitative electroencephalography.
