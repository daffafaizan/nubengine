      proposed project is that the elasticity modulus of a cervix is a more sensitive parameter
      characterizing the stage of cervical ripening. The main component of the cervical tissue is
      collagen. Cervical ripening is the result of realignment of collagen, degradation of collagen
      cross-linking due to proteolytic enzymes. These processes affect the elasticity modulus of
      the cervical tissue. Therefore, assessment of cervix by a device (CM) measuring cervical
      elasticity (stiffness) and cervical length (effacement) appears to be an adequate approach
      for identifying pregnant women at high risk of SPTD. The CM is based on measuring applied
      pressure to the cervix by a tactile sensor array (stress data) and ultrasound measurement of
      cervix length (strain data). Tactile and ultrasound sensors are allocated on the tip of the
      measuring part of vaginal probe. The discovery of novel bio markers that could reliably
      identify women who will subsequently deliver preterm, may allow for timely medical
      intervention and targeted therapeutic treatments aimed at improving maternal and fetal
      outcomes.
