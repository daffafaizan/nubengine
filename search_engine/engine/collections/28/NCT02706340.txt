      device (ParaGardÂ®) when placed immediately after childbirth. Many women in the United States
      have unintended pregnancies. Long-acting reversible birth control methods, like the copper
      intrauterine device (IUD), help prevent unintended pregnancy. This is because, once in place,
      the copper IUD provides excellent pregnancy prevention, and women using it do not have to do
      anything extra to make sure it works (like taking a birth control pill every day, for
      example). The copper IUD is safe and well liked among women who use it. Around the world,
      women have been getting their IUD fitted right after childbirth for the past 20 years, and
      this practice has been shown to be safe. This service has been offered at HUP since early
      2014. When the IUD is placed after birth, there is a chance that it could fall out, as the
      uterus shrinks back to its pre-pregnancy size. Women who get their IUD fitted right after
      childbirth will be observed, and describe the rate of IUD expulsion at 6 months postpartum.
      Factors associated with IUD expulsion will be noted. Adult pregnant women delivering at the
      Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, desiring an immediate IUD, and willing to follow
      up 6 months after birth, will be eligible to participate.
