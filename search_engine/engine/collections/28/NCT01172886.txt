      operated for breast cancer (cases) and 484 healthy women (controls) have been recruited
      between 2008 and 2009 to take part to our study for evaluating the association between MS and
      breast cancer. Liver or renal disease, thyroid pathology and coronary artery disease were
      considered exclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent, signing the authorization to
      be enrolled in the study, for each woman anthropometric features were measured, including
      weight in kilograms, height in meters, waist and hip circumference, arterial blood pressure
      was taken and venous blood was collected [15]. BMI (kg/m²) was calculated from weight and
      height values according to World Health Organization classification (< 25 kg/m²=
      underweight/normal, ≥ 25 kg/m²= overweight/obese), waist and hip ratio (WHR) was obtained
      from waist and hip circumference, measuring the smallest circumference of both to
      discriminate between android and gynoid fat distribution [22]. From blood samples fasting
      plasma glucose, HDL-C, triglyceride, uric acid, insulin and testosterone levels were
      assessed. Fasting plasma glucose, HDL-C and triglyceride were measured according to NCEP ATP
      III criteria. The normal range for uricemia was 2.6-6.0 mg/dl. Insulin levels were defined in
      normal range when between 5 and 25 mcU/ml, whereas ≥ 25 mcU/ml were considered
      hyperinsulinemia. Testosterone levels were considered in the normal range when 0.20-1.20
      ng/ml. Levels > 1.20 ng/ml were considered indicative of hyperandrogenic status. Women were
      asked to answer a questionnaire about chronic diseases, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, food
      intake, physical activity grade, parity, age of menarche, menopausal status, oral
      contraceptive use, hormonal therapy use, personal and familial history of cancer. According
      to the NCEP ATP III [10], women presenting three disorders were diagnosed with low grade MS
      [5], whereas women presenting more than three disorders (four or five) were diagnosed with
      high grade MS. Chi-squared test and logistic regression analyses (OR and 95% CI) were used to
      confirm the association between MS and breast cancer and to calculate the risk. Statistical
      significance was considered at P < 0.05.
