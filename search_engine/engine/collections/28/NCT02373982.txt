    
      Validation of the predictive value of the Left Atrial Sphericity for AF recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation after a pulmonary vein ablation procedure in an external, multicenter cohort.

      In total, 9 centers will include consecutive patients who underwent AF ablation from january
      to december 2013 in whom a 3D-imaging of the left atrium (Cardiac CT or MRA) was acquired
      prior to the procedure and when procedural/follow-up data was prospectively collected.
