      been implemented in animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with promising results.
      The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how applying auricular VNS in patients
      presenting with spontaneous SAH impacts their expression of inflammatory markers in their
      blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and how it impacts their clinical course and outcomes.

      This study will involve randomizing patients to stimulation with VNS, or sham stimulation.
      Blood and CSF will be collected on admission, and serially throughout the patient's
      admission. Clinical events tracked during the hospital stay include development of cerebral
      vasospasm, need for CSF diversion via a shunt, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and development
      of stroke or global cerebral ischemia. Outcomes following admission will include functional
      scores at discharge, and at follow-up visits for up to 2 years after discharge.
