      an understanding of the dose response characteristics of plasma in bleeding patients with
      liver disease. Epidemiologic studies show that INR is infrequently corrected to target INR
      values after clinician chosen plasma transfusion doses in patients with liver disease. Plasma
      transfusion is frequently given to patients prior to procedures and during active bleeding in
      this patient population though there are no dosing guidelines to aid clinicians in reaching
      INR targets in patients with liver disease. Previous studies suggest that patients with liver
      disease may need more plasma then patients without liver disease to correct any given
      pre-transfusion INR (INR value measured before plasma transfusion) to the same
      post-transfusion INR target (INR value measured after plasma transfusion).

      Current physician dosing of plasma is variable and rarely successful at reaching stated INR
      targets. The INR thresholds, commonly used triggers for plasma transfusion by
      Gastro-Intestinal (GI), Hepatology and critical care physicians at our institution range from
      1.5-3.0 in bleeding or pre-procedural patients with liver disease representing tremendous
      variability. When we evaluated plasma transfusion dosing practices in bleeding patients with
      liver disease over 8 years, we demonstrated that these same physicians rarely met stated
      theoretical targets.

      Over or under dosing plasma in these patients may lead to serious clinical complications.The
      target INR goal was to be within Â±0.1 after the first round of FFP transfusion, and was
      selected because underdosing can result in prolonged bleeding, delayed procedure times, and
      more rounds of FFP transfusion. Furthermore, overdosing can result in excess cost, increased
      portal pressures, bleeding, transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), and
      transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI).
