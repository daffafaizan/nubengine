    
      A total of 80 (13 Class 1 and 67 Class 2) lesions in 40 patients (21 females, 19 males) with
      ages ranging between 18-38 years (23.15Â±5.15) were either restored with Charisma or Charisma
      Classic (Heraeus Kulzer) in combination with an etch and rinse adhesive system (Gluma 2 Bond)
      under rubber dam isolation by two experienced operators according to the manufacturer's
      instructions. Two independent examiners, who were blinded to the composites used evaluated
      the restorations according to the FDI (World Dental Federation) criteria. Bite-wing
      radiographs and intraoral digital photographs were taken before and after treatment and at 6
      months. The statistical analyses were carried out with McNemar, Pearson Chi-square and
      Cochran Q tests (p<0.05).
