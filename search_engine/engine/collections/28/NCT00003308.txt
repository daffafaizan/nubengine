        -  Evaluate whether the delivery of stereotactic radiosurgery without conventional whole
           brain radiotherapy is feasible in patients with 1-3 newly diagnosed brain metastases
           from renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, or sarcoma.

        -  Determine the 3-, 6-, and 12-month radiographic and neurologic intracranial patterns of
           progression (i.e., original lesions vs new lesions) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to maximum tumor
      diameter (2 cm vs greater than 2 cm to 3 cm vs greater than 3 cm to 4 cm).

      Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery at an assigned dose according to tumor diameter.
      Patients undergo MRI or CT scan at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment or until disease
      progression.

      All other therapies are allowed after stereotactic radiosurgery except external beam whole
      brain radiotherapy or resection of brain metastases, unless there is documented progression
      or unrelenting mass effect that necessitates craniotomy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.2 months.
