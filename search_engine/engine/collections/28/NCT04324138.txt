      is a common refractory gastrointestinal disease. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the first
      choice drug, have the following problems in clinical use: about 50 % of patients have no
      response to PPIs; the efficacy of simple acid suppression is poor; long-term use of PPIs can
      lead to indigestion, gastric polyps, atrophic gastritis, intestinal dysbacteriosis. Spleen
      Deficiency and Damp-heat Syndrome is one of the common clinical syndrome of NERD.TCM syndrome
      differentiation and treatment has the advantages of overall regulation and individualized
      treatment, but lack of high-level evidence. NERD is the result of multifactorial
      pathogenicity. The reflux symptoms not only related to acid reflux, but also related to
      alkali, gas, mixed reflux, etc. The theory of Tongjiang put forward by Academician Dong
      Jianhua.Under the guidance of Academician Dong Jianhua, the research team create a
      prescription Jianpi Qinghua granule for treating NERD with spleen deficiency and damp-heat
      syndrome. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jianpi Qinghua
      Granules for treating NERD with spleen deficiency and damp heat syndrome based on a a
      multicenter,randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      On the basis of previous work, the project plans to establish sub centers in 3 Chinese
      hospitals, including78 patients with NERD and spleen deficiency and damp-heat syndrome. The
      therapeutic effects were evaluated from the following aspects: the VAS score of reflow and
      heartburn, the rate of discontinuation of antacids, the rate of recurrence of NERD symptoms,
      the score of TCM syndromes and the improvement of gastrointestinal function.
