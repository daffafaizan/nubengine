      mass index over 30 kg/m2. These mothers were invited to SKOT II while participating in a
      randomised study at Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen. The families were invited to three
      examinations, when the children were 9, 18 and 36 months of age. A total of 184 children were
      included in 2010. The examinations and the collecting of data are designed in the same way as
      SKOT I, a study of healthy children born by non-obese mother. The examinations takes place at
      Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Frederiksberg, Denmark. Following data were
      collected during the examinations: Anthropometry (weight, height, age- and sex specific Z
      scores for body composition, triceps- and subscapularis skinfolds), background interview
      (e.g. infant feeding, household income, the parent's educational level, allergy and chronic
      diseases), blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure), faeces- and urine
      samples, blood samples (at 9 and 36 months of age), bio impedance (at 36 months of age), 4
      day diet registration, general questionnaire (e.g. sleep, daycare, attendance and use of
      screen devices), psychomotor questionnaire (motoric development) and 7 day physical activity
      monitoring (at 36 months of age).
