      placement, or simple biopsies can be required for patients who are difficult to move, in
      particular COVID-19 patients, patients in the ICU, or on the floor. Portable ultrasounds have
      demonstrated a convenient ability to provide a point of care ultrasound diagnostic testing
      with expanding use in standard clinical care. A number of portable ultrasound systems are in
      routine clinical use at MGH and have been used for diagnostic procedures (e.g. Butterfly,
      Hologic, others). Most of the systems are still tethered (transducer is connected via cables
      to a computer or power) which may represent challenges for contamination, especially in
      interventional procedures. The Healcerion system is the first FDA approved wireless and
      battery-operated portable ultrasound system of its kind and is in routine use for diagnostic
      ultrasounds throughout the world.

      The goal of the current study is to compare the utility and practical operations of the
      advanced Healcerion SONON ultrasound system to a standard wheeled and bulky ultrasound
      systems in current use (Hitachi, GE). While the Healcerion device has been used at other
      institutions, it has not been used for interventional procedures at MGH. A comparative
      efficacy study will allow the investigators to examine the safety and efficacy of the device
      to complete procedures in a portable setting as well as explore whether images can be
      improved to reach the more robust imaging capability of wired devices.
