    
      This is a two-part study. Part I is a randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study in
      24 healthy, elderly, male or female subjects. Subjects will be allocated to one of three
      treatment sequences according to a randomization schedule prepared prior to the start of the
      study. Each subject will receive a single, oral dose of three 100 mg capsules of droxidopa
      with 240 mL of water either in the fasted state (Treatment A) or immediately following the
      consumption of a standardized high-fat meal (Treatment B) and a single, oral dose of one 300
      mg capsule of droxidopa with 240 mL of water in the fasted state (Treatment C) on Days 1, 4,
      and 7. Subjects will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 8 after completing all
      posttreatment follow-up assessments and will return to the research clinic approximately 1
      week later for Part II of the study. Part II of the study is an open-label design where all
      subjects will receive three doses of 300 mg droxidopa (three 100 mg capsules/dose) at 4 hour
      intervals and will be followed for a concurrent 24 h period.
