      B-cells, that occur in the setting of ineffective T-cell function because of pharmacological
      immunosuppression. Because the vast majority of PTLDs are associated with Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV) infection, surveillance of EBV infection may have the potential to prevent the
      development of PTLD by early intervention. However, the cut-off values of "high" EBV viral
      load remain badly defined due to a lack of prospective studies and assay standardization. The
      aim of this ongoing multicenter prospective study is the serial detection of primary EBV
      infection or reactivation in a homogeneous patient population of pediatric renal transplant
      recipients during the first 2 years posttransplant by the combined analysis of quantitative
      EBV viral load by a standardized quantitative PCR technique, EBV serology and EBV-specific
      T-lymphocytes for the identification of high-risk patients.
