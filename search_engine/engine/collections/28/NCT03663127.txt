      blood pressure among people with mild hypertension. Fifty subjects with systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) between 120 and 159 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 80 and
      99 mm Hg were randomized to ingest 2 bottles "Beauty Drink" or placebo perday for 8 weeks of
      a stage. Anthropometric measurements (blood pressure, body weight, body fat) and blood
      biochemical markers including fasting blood glucose (FBG), albumin, total cholesterol (TC),
      triglyceride (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), AST, ALT were
      examined every four weeks.
