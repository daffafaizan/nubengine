      treatment strategies for stroke that is in desperate need of scientific scrutiny. Stroke is
      one of the major medical conditions that lead to long-term disability and causes heavy health
      care and financial burden. Advances in clinical and translational neurosciences have led to
      the new development of stroke rehabilitation. Current stroke rehabilitation programs such as
      robotic therapy, mirror therapy, and bilateral arm training are bilateral approaches to
      intensive practice based on the tenet of practice-dependent neuroplasticity. Bilateral
      robotic therapy can potentially be a movement-based priming technique to promote rebalancing
      of cortical excitability and create an enriched neuroplastic environment by priming the brain
      to facilitate motor and functional recovery. This proposed research project will: (1) examine
      the effects of bilateral robotic priming combined with bilateral arm training approach versus
      bilateral robotic priming combined with mirror therapy, relative to the control intervention
      approach (bilateral robotic priming combined with impairment-oriented training) on
      sensorimotor function, daily function, self-efficacy, quality of life, and motor control
      strategy in patients with stroke, (2) investigate the 3-month retention effects of robotic
      priming combined with contemporary rehabilitation approaches (i.e., bilateral arm training
      and mirror therapy) and the control intervention, and (3) identify the potential predictors
      of functionally relevant changes after therapy.
