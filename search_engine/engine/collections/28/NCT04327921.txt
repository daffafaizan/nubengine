    
      Aims - The specific aims are to examine: (1) the feasibility, acceptability, and initial
      efficacy of Peer Navigation for Social Support - Smoking in a 24-week randomized pilot study;
      (2) to compare the effect of Peer Navigation for Social Support, relative to standard care,
      on mechanisms thought to underlie smoking abstinence in HIV-positive smokers.

      Methodology - The investigators will adapt an existing, highly effective peer navigation
      training program to increase engagement in care within the HIV clinic. The peer navigator for
      smoking cessation will be a former daily smoker who quit smoking 1-2 years ago and has
      remained smoke-free. The investigators will train the peer navigator, enroll 6 HIV-positive
      smokers to test the intervention, and finalize the protocol. The investigators will refine
      the protocol based on feedback from the peer navigator, the 6 participants, and the study
      nurses. Next, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized trial (N = 72) to test the
      feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of peer navigation in a randomized, 2-group,
      repeated measures design. The investigators will randomize 36 HIV-positive smokers to each
      condition: Peer Navigation or standard care. Assessments will be collected at baseline, and
      at 4-, 12-, and 24-weeks.

      Participant Population - Participants for this study will include 78 participants recruited
      from Providence, Rhode Island.
