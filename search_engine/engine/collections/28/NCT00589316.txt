    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered via 131 I-BC8 antibody
      (iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8) when combined with pre- and post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine phosphate (FLU), 2 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI),
      tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and a haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic marrow
      transplant in patients who have advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL), or high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      II. To estimate rates of immune reconstitution, engraftment, and donor chimerism resulting
      from this combined preparative regimen.

      III. To determine rates of disease relapse, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and day
      100 disease-free survival in patients receiving 131 I-BC8 antibody (Ab) combined with CY,
      FLU, 2 Gy TBI, tacrolimus, MMF, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8.

      RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive therapeutic iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 via
      central line on day -14.

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING: Patients receive FLU intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days -6 to -2 and CY IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo TBI on day -1.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

      POST-TRANSPLATATION IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive CY IV over 1-2 hours on day 3, MMF IV
      or orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) on days 4 to 35, and tacrolimus IV over 1-2 hours or PO on
      days 4 to 180 with taper on day 84.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months,
      and then annually thereafter.
