    
      This is a three-part, multi-center, open-label, Phase 1, first-in-patient study of COTI-2 in
      patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, endometrial, or cervical
      cancer (collectively gynecological malignancies), and in patients with head and neck squamous
      cell carcinoma (HNSCC), colorectal, lung, or pancreatic cancer. Other tumor types may be
      allowed with Sponsor approval.

      COTI-2 will be self-administered as a single agent, orally, once daily for 5 days followed by
      2 treatment-free days each week.

      Part 1 of the study will be dose finding in patients with gynecological malignancies using a
      3 + 3 design to establish the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) over 6 planned cohorts.

      Part 2 of the study will be dose finding in patients with HNSCC using a 3 + 3 design to
      establish the MTD over 6 planned cohorts.

      Part 3 of the study will be dose finding for COTI-2 in combination with cisplatin in patients
      with gynecological malignancies, HNSCC, colorectal, lung, pancreatic cancer, or other tumor
      types with Sponsor approval.
