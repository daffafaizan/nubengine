    
      The objectives of this study in rosacea patients (type I&II) are:

        -  to demonstrate objectively that CD07805/47 0.5% gel is able to prevent a flush induced
           by a specific trigger (hot water) in controlled condition;

        -  to demonstrate that CD07805/47 0.5% gel is able to prevent a flush whatever the trigger
           in everyday life condition;

        -  to investigate if reduction in redness is associated with a decrease in skin sensations
           such as heat, stinging/burning, skin tension and sweating;

        -  to demonstrate that such efficacy on transient redness and sensations takes place in
           both populations (rosacea type I and rosacea type II).

      This is a single-centre, randomized, Investigator masked, placebo controlled study comprising
      the following periods:

      A screening period of maximum 4 weeks

      A one-week treatment phase (Period 1) with 3 sessions using the flush model, every other day.

      This Period 1 includes a cross-over design (first and third sessions) and a split face design
      (second session). During this period, thirty six (36) subjects will receive on site the study
      drugs as follows (the order of each session being randomized):

        -  CD07805/47 placebo gel on both sides of the face,

        -  one side of the face treated with CD07805/47 0.5% gel, the other side treated with the
           CD07805/47 placebo gel (the allocation of treatment on each half-face will be determined
           according to a randomization list),

        -  CD07805/47 0.5% gel on both sides of the face;

      A 2-days wash-out period (between Period 1 and Period 2) with no treatment on either side of
      the face

      A 4-week treatment phase (Period 2) corresponding to a cross-over design during which the
      subjects will apply themselves the study drugs at home on the whole face, once daily 7 days
      per week.

      The subjects will be divided in 2 groups of eighteen (18) subjects and will receive either
      the CD07805/47 0.5% gel the first 2 weeks and then the CD07805/47 placebo gel or the
      CD07805/47 placebo gel the first 2 weeks and then the CD07805/47 0.5% gel, according to
      randomization.

      All the subjects taking part into the study will not be randomized separately in the two
      periods but to the full sequence at the beginning of the clinical trial (same randomization
      number during all the study), explaining the arms/groups detailed in the section "Arms and
      Interventions".

      Only primary efficacy endpoint: total number of flushes for each 2-week period will be
      detailed in the outcome measures section.

      The other endpoints are secondary or exploratory.

      The purpose of Period 1 is to assess whether simpler and shorter designs based on flush
      induced by a trigger could be as efficient to detect prevention of flush than the more
      classical and longer design of Period 2.
