    
      Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Auto-HSCT) is an effective therapy for
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).BuCY conditioning regimen is a conventional scheme for
      DLBCL patients undergoing auto-HSCT, but it has a high relapse rate. Etoposide (VP-16) is
      extensively used in chemotherapy regimen for refractory/relapsed lymphoma. Whether addition
      of VP-16 could reduce the relapse rate remains unclear.In this study, the safety and efficacy
      of BUCY+VP-16 and BUCY myeloablative conditioning regimens in DLBCL undergoing auto-HSCT are
      evaluated.
