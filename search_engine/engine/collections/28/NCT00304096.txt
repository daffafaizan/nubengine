      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of a vaccine comprising multiple synthetic breast cancer-associated
           peptides and a tetanus toxoid helper peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 in patients
           with stage III or IV adenocarcinoma of the breast.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the frequency of immune responses against the 9 class I
           MHC-restricted peptides in patients treated with the vaccine.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the cytotoxic responses of T-cells to allogeneic breast cancer
           cells and autologous breast cancer cells (when available).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive peptide vaccine comprising 9 synthetic breast cancer peptides and tetanus
      toxoid helper peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously and intradermally once
      daily on days 1, 8, 15, 36, 57, and 78 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study.
