    
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LIM-0705
      administered for 28 days in adult males and females with impaired glucose tolerance or
      abnormal HOMA-IR.

      Secondary Objectives include:

        -  examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LIM-0705

        -  explore the pharmacodynamics (PD) of LIM-0705 in obese adult males and females with
           impaired glucose tolerance (defined as two-hour plasma glucose levels of ≥140 to ≤199 mg
           per dL [7.8 to 11.06 mmol/L] on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) or abnormal
           HOMA-IR (HOMA-IR value ≥ 2.5) as measured by change in response to hyperinsulinemic
           clamp, mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) between Days -2 and 27

        -  explore the effect of LIM-0705 on fasting lipid, insulin and glucose profiles compared
           to baseline levels
