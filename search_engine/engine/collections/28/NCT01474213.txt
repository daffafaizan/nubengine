      patients with difficult airways undergoing oral maxillofacial surgery. Both optimal
      intubating conditions and patient comfort are paramount while preparing the patient for
      fibreoptic intubation. One challenge associated with procedure is to provide adequate
      sedation while maintaining patients' airway ventilation. Dexmedetomidine, because of its
      sedative,analgesic properties and minimal influence on patients' ventilation, might be a
      useful management for it. While with the development of target controlled infusion (TCI)
      technology, remifentanil sedation becomes a potential sedation in clinical practice.
