      ischemic heart disease or heart failure with tools and services to optimally monitor and
      manage their real-time health condition and disease. The innovative approach of the Do CHANGE
      project also involves the patients' surrounding health ecosystem in the process. The
      traditional difficulties of therapy adherence in a physician-centred care system are
      radically abandoned and replaced by a patient-centred approach. The approach advocated by Do
      CHANGE project focuses on the needs of the patient by not only providing them with innovative
      tools that assess the patient's real-time health condition, but also offer a variety of
      behavioural alternatives. The main hypothesis of the Do CHANGE project is that patients'
      disease self-management and lifestyle will improve as compared to self-management of patients
      who receive the care as usual.
