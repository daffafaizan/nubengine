    
      This study, which will be completed over three months, involves replacing two meals a day
      with meal replacement beverages for two months, with a one month follow-up visit. These
      beverages will be made up by subjects using either a complete protein powder or BCAD2, a
      BCAA-free medical food. Participants will complete food diaries at baseline and at one month
      intervals during the study, and compliance will be assessed via food diaries, weekly
      telephone contact, and measuring returned food powder.
