      electronic databases of National Taiwan University Hospital to identify patients who
      underwent liver transplantation, received tacrolimus and were still followed up at the
      outpatient clinic. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied to screen appropriate
      participants, and find their donors. And analyze the effect of genetic polymorphism
      (ABCB1、CYP3A4、CYP3A5、POR) of donors, including other factors of recipients, on the dose
      normalized trough concentration of tacrolimus.
