      individuals in the general population acquire mutations in their bone marrow stem cells as
      they age that give that population of cells a survival or 'clonal' advantage for growth. The
      frequency of CHIP may be higher in patients with other cancers. CHIP increases with age, and
      has been shown to be a risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease and a tendency to
      the development of bone marrow cancers at a rate of 1% per year (1,2,5). CHIP is also
      associated with the development of bone marrow cancers that occur after chemotherapy. The
      investigators want to investigate whether CHIP is also a risk factor for chemotherapy-related
      complications like low blood counts, infections, cardiac events, hospitalizations, dose
      delays and dose reductions. They are also interested in determining if CHIP may explain why
      some patients do not recover normal blood counts after chemotherapy finishes.

      The results from this study may help physicians better understand why some people have
      difficulty with chemotherapy (in the short and long-term) while others do not. Screening for
      CHIP in older patients may become a recommended standard that allows physicians to tailor
      anti-cancer treatment to the patient.
