      Volunteers will be asked to come to the research facility in Newcastle University, before
      they have had any breakfast, on four separate occasions. The volunteers must not eat or drink
      anything (except water) after 8 pm the evening before they come in. This includes not
      drinking any alcohol, tea or coffee.

      Each time the volunteers come in, their height (first assessment only), weight, waist
      circumference and body composition will be measured. Body composition is measured using
      scales which can determine the percentage of their body is fat or bone or muscle. This is
      done using a small harmless electrical current passing through their body, they will not
      detect or feel this at all. Their height will also be measured at the first visit.
      Cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose levels in the blood will also be measured at each
      visit. This will be done through a single finger prick blood sample.

      Enough capsules will be given to the volunteers to last you four weeks at the first three
      visits. The capsules will be filled with either alginate or another dietary fibre believed to
      have no effect on weight management.

      Volunteers will be asked to take four of these capsules with their three main meals per day
      over the 12 week study.
