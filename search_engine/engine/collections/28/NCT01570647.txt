      health care costs. A major obstacle to the treatment of these conditions is the lack of
      methods to objectively assess connective tissues and measure the effect of treatments. Needle
      torque test technology under development in this project will potentially enable objective
      measurement of connective tissue abnormalities associated with musculoskeletal pain and
      dysfunction. This could help evaluate the efficacy of various treatments and enhance the
      objective monitoring of patient progress in clinical practice.
