      production by shifting substrate utilisation from free fatty acids towards glucose. We showed
      that perhexiline therapy was highly effective in improving exercise capacity, symptoms and
      cardiac function in patients with systolic heart failure of both ischaemic and non ischaemic
      aetiology. Perhexiline acts by inhibiting both carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) and
      CPT-2, which are key enzymes in mitochondrial free fatty acid uptake. This leads to increased
      myocardial glucose substrate utilization. Further we wish to ascertain whether or not this
      drug improves cardiac energetics and efficiency by altering substrate utilization. In this
      proposal we will assess the cardiac function (by cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI),
      cardiac energetic status (by cardiac Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy MRS), cardiac efficiency
      (via pressure-volume loops) and substrate utilization (via left and right heart
      catheterization), following one month of perhexiline therapy or placebo in patients with
      symptomatic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy on optimal conventional heart failure
      medications. An interim analysis is planned after 20 patients.
