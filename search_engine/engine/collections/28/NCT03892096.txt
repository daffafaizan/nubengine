      understanding of tumor biology does not allow us to predict accurately which patient will
      benefit from a specific therapeutic regimen. The definitive proof of the effectiveness of a
      therapy is improvement in clinical symptoms and survival. Imaging is generally used to assess
      therapeutic effects earlier and more objectively. Current response assessment is based
      primarily on changes in tumor size as measured by CT or other anatomic imaging modalities.

      Cadex Genomics has developed an analytically validated cell-free DNA (cfDNA) quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay that utilizes standard qPCR platforms for
      processing, this test can reliably obtain results from small blood volumes and possesses
      exceptionally high analytical sensitivity of circulating cfDNA.

      The purpose of this study is to accrue samples for the further development and clinical
      validation of a blood-based cell-free cfDNA qPCR assay as a potential biomarker for early
      non-response to therapy in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer
      (CRC) and breast cancer (BC).
