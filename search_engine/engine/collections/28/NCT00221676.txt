      as advocated by many guidelines. Besides the personal protection the vaccine especially needs
      to prevent transmission of influenza between GPs and their patients. In long-term elderly
      hospitals a possible benefit of influenza vaccination of the healthcare workers was noticed
      in reducing mortality among the elderly. But this specific situation is not fully
      transmissible to the general practice.

      GPs, having yearly close contact with several influenza cases, built up a high basic immunity
      and probably only suffer from minor symptoms. The question remains if the vaccine is adding
      substantial benefit to this natural acquired immunity. In addition doubts are raised in the
      literature if an inactivated vaccine, which elicit especially humoral immune response, can
      give enough protection against virus replication and subclinical influenza infections. Until
      now no effectiveness studies of influenza vaccination were performed among GPs. High time to
      look more closer to these issues.

      Comparisons: the effectiveness of an inactivated influenza vaccine compared with no vaccine
      in GPs against clinical respiratory tract infections and more particular against influenza
      cases with influenza positive nose and throat swabs (diagnosed by RT-PCR), besides
      serological defined influenza cases and taking important independent variables into account
