      postoperative complication. Anastomotic leakage severely compromises the recovery after
      surgery. It increases the overall burden of patients and hospital resources. Postoperative
      mortality is higher in patients with anastomotic leakage.

      Human albumin is routinely administered after surgery with a unproven hypothesis that the
      human albumin is beneficial to prevent anastomotic leakage. We investigate whether the
      intravenously administered human albumin is beneficial to prevent anastomotic leakage after
      gastric cancer surgery.
