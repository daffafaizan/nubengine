      indication of liver transplantation in the United States. HCV is primarily a blood-borne
      infection, and heterosexual transmission is rare. However, acute HCV infection is
      increasingly being reported among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) with no risk
      factors for parenteral HCV transmission, suggestive of a possible mucosal route of infection
      in these individuals. While it is possible that HCV may be transmitted into the bloodstream
      via mucosal tears induced by sexual activity, is also possible that a mucosal immune defect
      predisposes HIV+ persons to mucosal HCV transmission. Our pilot study aims to study gut B
      cells in HCV+HIV+, HCV+HIV-, HCV-HIV+, and HCV-HIV- volunteers. Volunteers will undergo a
      screening blood draw and flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. We will isolate peripheral and
      mucosal mononuclear cells and we will perform HCV-specific ELISPOT and single B cell
      immunoglobulin (Ig) RT-PCR to assess volunteers' gut B cell repertoire. If successful, we
      would like to expand the study so as to better assess Ig repertoire differences among
      HCV+HIV+ and HCV+HIV- individuals.
