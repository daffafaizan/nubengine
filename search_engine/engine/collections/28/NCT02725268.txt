    
      The drugs being evaluated in this study are sapanisertib and MLN1117. Sapanisertib is being
      evaluated as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel or MLN1117 to treat women with
      advanced, recurrent, or persistent endometrial cancer. This study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of each drug or drug combination.

      The study will enroll approximately 241 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of 4 treatment groups:

        -  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2

        -  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 + Sapanisertib 4 mg

        -  Sapanisertib 30 mg

        -  Sapanisertib 4 mg + MLN1117 200 mg

      Participants will receive either paclitaxel intravenous (IV) weekly, Paclitaxel IV along with
      sapanisertib orally, sapanisertib orally, or sapanisertib and MLN1117 orally.

      This is a multicenter, multinational trial. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, with an end of treatment visit (EOT) which will occur 30 to 40 days after receiving
      their last dose of study drug or before the start of any subsequent anticancer therapy. After
      EOT, participants will be followed for PFS and overall survival (OS).
