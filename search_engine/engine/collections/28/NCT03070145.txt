      improves prostate cancer outcomes, ADT also has a variety of short- and long-term adverse
      effects, including increased body weight, loss of lean muscle mass, reductions in quality of
      life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that among men with
      prostate cancer, physical activity is associated with improved outcomes, including a reduced
      risk of mortality, from prostate cancer and other causes. Our hypothesis is that physical
      activity will improve some of the physical and emotional side effects associated with ADT.
      Physical activity, such as brisk walking and moderate strength training, offers a lifestyle
      factor that may improve some of the side effects, and is low-cost and easy to do.

      The investigators are conducting this study to evaluate the impact and feasibility of a
      12-week moderate-intensity aerobic and strength training exercise intervention, including a
      virtual component. The intervention includes brisk walking and moderate strength training,
      and involves home-based exercises, in-person sessions with an oncology-trained exercise
      physiologist, optional group training sessions, and weekly training goals. Participants will
      have access to a personalized web-based platform called Postwire, which will include videos
      of training sessions, and will allow participants to easily communicate with the study staff
      and with other study participants.
