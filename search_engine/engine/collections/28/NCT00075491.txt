    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant and adjuvant fenretinide vs adjuvant fenretinide
      alone, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme undergoing surgical resection II. Correlate the serum and glioma tissue
      pharmacology of this drug with clinical response in patients treated with these regimens.

      III. Determine whether this drug induces apoptosis in glioma tissue in patients treated with
      these regimens.

      IV. Correlate the apoptotic index with tissue and serum concentration and clinical response
      in patients treated with these regimens.

      V. Compare radiological response, overall survival, and unexpected toxicity in patients
      treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral fenretinide twice daily for 1 week and then undergo
      surgical resection.

      Arm II: Patients undergo surgical resection.

      Beginning two weeks after surgery, all patients receive adjuvant oral fenretinide twice daily
      on weeks 1 and 4. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-46 patients (10-23 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 7-46 months.
