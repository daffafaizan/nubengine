      oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of erosive oral lichen planus
      (EOLP). Glutamine is a source of energy for fibroblasts, immunocompetent cells, and
      intestinal epithelial cells involved in collagen production. It promotes protein and collagen
      synthesis, imparts immunity, and maintains the alimentary canal mucosa structure.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Glutamine combined with topical
      corticosteroid in the treatment of oral erosive LP.

      Thirty patients with a confirmed clinical and histopathologic diagnosis of OLP recruited in
      this study and divided into 2 equal groups, each consisting of 15 subjects. Group 1 consists
      of patients treated with topical steroids plus antifungal (conventional therapy); Group 2
      consists of patients treated with Glutamine combined with topical steroids plus antifungal.
