      excessive resection of healthy tissue of the gastric wall resulting in deformity or stenosis.
      Attaining a positive surgical margin is also possible. Endoscopic full-thickness resection
      (EFTR) can be used for tumor resection by direct visualization of the tumor from inside the
      stomach lumen leading to a free surgical margin with little resection of healthy tissue. In
      order to overcome current endoscopic technical limitations, we will combine the conventional
      laparoscopic approach with EFTR.
