      women can reduce labor time and increase the ease of labor and delivery as compared to the
      labor times reported by Kilpatrick and Laros in the obstetric literature. It is proposed that
      women who have regular chiropractic care throughout pregnancy or at least for the third
      trimester will have an easier labor and delivery as well as a shorter labor time than is
      reported in the literature.
