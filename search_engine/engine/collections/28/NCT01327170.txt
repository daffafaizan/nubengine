      months of disease. After 3 months without resolution of acute CSC or in chronic CSC,
      continuous wave laser photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy should be considered. Direct
      threshold continuous photocoagulation treatment can shorten the duration of the serous
      detachment, but it is not appropriate for juxtafoveal or subfoveal leakage point.Subvisible
      photocoagulation potentially localizes and decreases chorioretinal thermic burn. Subthreshold
      diode micropulse (SDM) laser using a 810nm diode laser may spare the damage to the neural
      retina by raising the temperature of the RPE to just below the protein-denaturation threshold
      so that the thermal wave that reaches the neural retina is insufficient to cause neither
      damage nor clinically visible end-point. This therapeutic laser modality offers the
      possibility to minimize the iatrogenic retinal lesion.
