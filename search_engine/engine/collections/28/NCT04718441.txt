    
      This is an interventional study which proposes to evaluate the accuracy of contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) in diagnosing abdominal solid organ injuries in pediatric trauma patients.
      Up to 130 subjects will be enrolled across approximately 5 to 10 sites in the US. Each site,
      including the coordinating center, will undergo the training phase; each site will enroll 3
      participants in this phase successfully prior to entering the treatment phase. All subjects
      will have had a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan as part of standard of care, confirming at
      least one solid organ abdominal injury. All subjects will have an abdominal ultrasound
      without contrast, followed by a contrast-enhanced ultrasound using the contrast agent
      Lumason. Ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound results will be compared to the CT scan
      results. The study procedures will take place within 48 hours of injury. At conclusion of
      enrollment of all subjects a centralized review of CT vs. CEUS will occur to compare to
      real-time readings.
