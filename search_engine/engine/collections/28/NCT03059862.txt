      a range of key cellular events. In the gut, AHR is crucial for maintaining intestinal barrier
      immune homeostasis. The physiology of the AHR, however, is not completely understood; its
      precise gut luminal activators and functional consequences are unknown.

      Some AHR ligands originate from the diet. Commensals play crucial roles in metabolizing
      tryptophan and other amino acids such as tyrosine, with the subsequent production of
      tryptophan metabolites. Previous studies show that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients
      have impaired production of AHR agonists by the microbiota. Furthermore, dietary
      supplementation with tryptophan ameliorates clinical parameters of colitis in rodent models.
      Whether these findings translate into human pathophysiology has not been explored.

      In the present study, the investigators will evaluate the effect of high- versus
      low-tryptophan diet on AHR activation in healthy participants. Briefly, participants will be
      instructed to follow a standardized low-tryptophan diet and will be randomized to a 3-week
      L-tryptophan supplement or placebo. Later, after a 2-week washout period, participants will
      crossover to the other arm. In addition, the effect of tryptophan and microbiota-derived
      metabolites on AHR activation will be analyzed.
