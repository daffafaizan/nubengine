    
      The overall objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of transitioning the care
      of adult patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) who receive office-based buprenorphine
      treatment (OBBT) from physicians to pharmacists. Physicians will induce buprenorphine
      treatment and complete the stabilization phase before referring patients to pharmacists for
      the management of monthly maintenance visits. This study will assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of a collaborative care model between physician and pharmacist by measuring
      recruitment rate, treatment retention rate, treatment compliance rate, and participants'
      substance use. Other assessments measured will include treatment fidelity, participant,
      physician, and pharmacist satisfaction with OUD care, participant safety, and the
      pharmacists' use of electronic health records and the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.
