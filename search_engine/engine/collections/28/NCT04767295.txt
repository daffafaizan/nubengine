    
      Primary outcome:

      1. Analysis of prognosis efficacy of patients: pathologic complete response (pCR)

      Secondary outcome:

      Overall survival(OS), Progressive-free survival(PFS), Disease control rate(DCR), Objective
      response rate(ORR), and the proportion of subjects who completed all treatments and radical
      resection (R0);

      Explorative outcome:

      To explore the efficacy of ultrasound gastroscopy, PET/CT, peripheral circulating blood tumor
      cell (CTC) detection and CTC-based immunofluorescence detection of PD-L1 antibody for the
      treatment of locally advanced ESCC with camrelizumab combined with albumin paclitaxel and
      platinum and potential biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of camrelizumab, including but
      not limited to immunohistochemical detection of PD-L1 expression in tumor specimens, T cell
      receptor (TCR) sequencing analysis in peripheral blood, and esophageal microbiome Analysis,
      etc.; patients' quality of life
