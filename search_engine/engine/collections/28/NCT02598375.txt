    
      Stage 1 - Evaluation of Status of Early Reached Target Enteral Nutrition in critically ill
      children in the PICU (ERTEN in PICU) In critically ill children, there is no data on the
      factors influenced the enteral nutrition and feeding intolerance.We aim to reach these goals
      in our study

        -  To initiate the enteral feeding in pediatric intensive care units or not

        -  To demonstrate the reasons whether early enteral feeding is initiated or not

        -  To determine the incidence of feeding intolerance

        -  To identify the situations such as analgesia ,sedation, catecholamines or individual
           preferences of the medical staff which lead to delay or interruption in enteral feeding
           in pediatric intensive care units

        -  To investigate the relation between the successful enteral feeding and mortality ,
           morbidity du to the sepsis , septic shock and multiorgan failure

      Stage 2 - IFABP as biomarker of feeding intolerance in critically ill children in the PICU
      (IFABP in PICU) Critically ill children are at increased risk for intestinal injury,
      gastrointestinal dysfunction and feeding intolerance, which are associated with delayed
      recovery and increased morbidity and mortality during their course in the pediatric intensive
      care unit. In critically ill children, there is little data on the factors influenced the
      enteral nutrition. Feeding intolerance in the critically ill children may be due to in part
      to alterations in gastrointestinal motility secondary to the underlying disease process or
      administrations of medication.It is also known the role of hyperglycemia, caloric density of
      enteral nutrition and gastrointestinal feedback mechanism, and routine intensive care
      management such as sedation, analgesia and catecholamines on the feeding intolerance in
      critically ill children. We hypothesise that IFABP might be used as a biomarker which shows
      that the early intestinal damage due to these medications.

      Aim There is no information which shows that the role of the intestinal microcirculation
      problems and mucosal integrity on feeding intolerance in pediatric intensive care unit.We aim
      to reach these goals in our study

        -  To show the value of IFABP regarding the identifying feeding intolerance and early
           detection of enteral feeding intolerance

        -  To show the relation between the IFABP concentration and enteral feeding intolerance

        -  To show the relation between the mechanical ventilation settings , sedation , inotrope
           medications doses and IFABP concentration and feeding intolerance

        -  To show the relation between IFABP concentrations and mortality and morbidity due to the
           sepsis , septic shock and multi system organ failure We aim to reach theses goals in
           near future

        -  To find the common definitions regarding enteral feeding intolerance in order to
           identify and recognize the clinical problems in advance for the medical staff in Turkey

        -  To recognize the patients who have the possibility the enteral feeding problems with the
           help of the clinical and biochemical biomarkers (IFABP)

        -  To establish the early enteral feeding protocols in order to provide widespread using in
           pediatric intensive care units.

        -  With the help of these acquirement in the pediatrics intensive care unit to achieve the
           reduce the length of hospital stay , morbidity and mortality

      The critically ill children who are hospitalized at least for 24 hours in PICU are eligible
      for the Stage 1ERTEN IN PICU

      The critically ill children who are hospitalized at least for 4 days in PICU are eligible for
      the Stage2 IFABP IN PICU
