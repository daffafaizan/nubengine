    
      The Phase 1 portion of the study will cover the dose escalation portion of the study. This
      will then be followed by the Phase 2 portion of the study, which will treat participants with
      the dose of loncastuximab tesirine determined in the Phase 1 portion of the study. The
      ibrutinib dose of 560 mg daily, will remain the same throughout both phases of the study.

      A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used for the Phase 1 portion of the study. The
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period will be the 21 days following the first dose of
      ibrutinib. The dose escalation cohort will receive loncastuximab tesirine for 2 cycles with
      concurrent ibrutinib (concomitant therapy) and may then continue ibrutinib therapy up to one
      year.

      The Phase 2 portion of the study will involve 3 cohorts:

        -  Non-germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Non-GCB DLBCL) cohort

        -  Germinal center B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB DLBCL) cohort

        -  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cohort

      Each of the cohorts will be treated with the recommended dose of loncastuximab tesirine
      determined in the Phase 1 portion of the study.

      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of 3
      to 4 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up to 2 years
      after treatment discontinuation).
