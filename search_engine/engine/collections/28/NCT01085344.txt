      bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A treated (for primary prophylaxis) with
      Escalating Dose Prophylactic factor replacement. The second objective is to obtain accurate
      estimates of the direct and indirect costs associated with this protocol for use in a
      cost-effectiveness model (comparing Escalating Dose with standard prophylaxis and with
      intermittent therapy).
