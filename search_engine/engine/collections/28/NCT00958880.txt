      when conducted with adjunctive acute (prior to four of five sessions) administration of
      either Yohimbine hydrochloride (10.8 mg) or placebo during core exposure sessions. Based on
      the available evidence, the investigators hypothesize that acute treatment with Yohimbine
      hydrochloride prior to exposure-based CBT would facilitate the extinction of fear that occurs
      with this treatment and would enhance treatment outcome.
