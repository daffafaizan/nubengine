      disease and the metabolic syndrome. Nutrients that can contribute to the risk of developing
      such diseases are fatty acids (FAs). It is known that fatty acids mediate their metabolic
      effects via changes in gene expression, through binding and subsequent activation of the
      transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). In addition, it is
      known that unsaturated fatty acids are better ligands for PPAR than saturated fatty acids.
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) express PPARalpha and are relatively easy to
      isolate from whole blood. We previously showed that the gene expression profiles of these
      cells can reflect free fatty acid increases during fasting. The question still remains
      whether dietary FA can influence gene expression in a similar way and, if so, whether
      different dietary FA result in different gene expression changes and subsequent activation of
      other pathways.
