      (AD), children, age 2 to 11 years, with AD will be recruited. The subjects will complete
      specific questionnaires related to itch, sleeping habits and AD and continuously wear two
      wrist worn accelerometry devices. The EarlySense Sleep Monitor will also be placed underneath
      the mattress to measure additional sleep related activities.

      The study will be comprised of two overnight sleep laboratory site visits. The clinic visits
      will be followed by a continuous ~48 hour in-home environment assessment period (defined as
      the subject's daily routine environment). During the sleep lab site visit, the subject and
      accompanying parent(s)/guardian(s) will sleep overnight at the facility. The subject will be
      video-recorded during the in-sleep lab visit, wear the wrist accelerometry devices, use the
      sleep sensor and complete assessments (Depending on age, parent/guardian may complete some
      assessments). Upon the completion of sleep lab activities the subjects will then continue to
      wear the wrist accelerometry devices, utilize the sleep sensor and complete Patient Reported
      Outcome/Clinical Outcome Assessments (PRO/COA) assessments during the 48 hour in-home
      assessment. At the conclusion of the in-home portion of the assessment, the subject will
      return the device/s and assessments to the facility and undergo brief assessments/interview.
