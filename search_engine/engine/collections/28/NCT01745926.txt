      pressure); etCO2 (end-tidal expiratory pCO2); ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation); PaO2
      (arterial pO2); PaCO2 (arterial pCO2); endpoints to assess feasibility: time from arrival to
      start of mechanical compressions, problems during transfer into the helicopter and in-field
      manoeuvers, problems with application of device, problems with patient transfer to hospital
      premises, hands-off time, personnel requirements.
