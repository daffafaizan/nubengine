      pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) and 9-Fr advanced venous access (AVA) catheter for the LT
      recipient at anesthetic induction. PAC and AVA catheter are usually removed on the second
      postoperative day, and instead the PICC is used for the postoperative infusion of
      prostaglandin E1 which is very irritable to small peripheral vein. So we fortunately had
      chance to measure the CVPs from both CICC and PICC simultaneously in the same patients.

      Methods: We measured the CVPs from the CICC and the PICC simultaneously during each main
      surgical period of adult liver transplantation (preanhepatic, anhepatic, reperfusion, and
      neo-hepatic period). Data are presented as means Â± standard deviation. Statistical analysis
      was performed using simple linear regression analysis to observe whether changes in the PICCP
      were paralleled by simultaneous changes in the CICCP. Bland-Altman analysis was used to
      determine the degree of agreement between the two devices. Analysis of variance was performed
      to study whether there were changes in the CVP agreement profiles in regard to the different
      time periods of LT. Differences were regarded as being statistically significant when p
      values were less than 0.05.
