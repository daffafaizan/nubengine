      multidisciplinary and translational research program that previously initiated the DECAMP-1
      and DECAMP-2 studies for lung cancer early detection. Now, with the support of Johnson and
      Johnson, 3 Veterans Administration Hospitals (VAH), 3 Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and
      12 academic hospitals as clinical study sites, several molecular biomarker laboratories,
      along with Biostatics, Bioinformatics, Pathology and Biorepository cores, we are expanding
      our work in lung cancer early detection.
