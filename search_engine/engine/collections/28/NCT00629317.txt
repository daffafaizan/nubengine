      lentigines, telangiectasias, and textural changes, but more importantly, it can also lead to
      pre-cancerous conditions with the development of actinic keratosis (AK). The majority of
      photorejuvenation or photodamaged published studies have used 5-Amino-Levulinic acid (5-ALA)
      as a photosensitizer, and either a blue light or an Intense Pulsed Light source with a
      70%-95% global facial skin improvement. The molecular mechanism of such improvement is
      unknown, but activation of a non-specific immune response in addition to increased fibrosis
      and new collagen formation, have both been suggested.

      Methyl Aminolevulinate ( MAL) is another marketed photosensitizer mainly utilized in Europe.
      Lipophilicity, higher penetration depth and tumor selectivity has been advocated for MAL
      compared to 5-ALA. However, its effect in photodamaged skin has not been well documented.

      The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of MAL + Aktilite (PDT) in facial
      photodamage.

      Study Type: Interventional

      Study Design: Randomized, double-Blind, placebo-controlled trial. Official Title: A
      randomized, double-Blind, placebo-controlled trial of Methyl Aminolevulinate + Aktilite in
      patients with facial photodamage.
