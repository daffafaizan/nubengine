      of a patient s pre-existing TB while receiving anti-TB medications. This phenomenon has been
      clinically well described for many years and is thought to occur in 10%-25% of HIV-negative
      patients starting treatment for TB. Paradoxical reactions are diagnosed by excluding other
      possible causes for worsening of TB signs and symptoms, such as a second infection or
      treatment failure. However, challenges in culturing TB can complicate early diagnosis of
      paradoxical reactions.

      This is an observational study intended to improve understanding of the pathogenesis of
      paradoxical response to treatment in TB-infected patients who do not have HIV. We plan to
      follow up to 20 patients with TB who have already initiated treatment and are suspected to
      have paradoxical reactions, as well as about 40 patients taking TB treatment without signs of
      paradoxical reactions (controls). All participants will have regular study visits for
      clinical assessments, blood and sputum collections, positron emission tomography-computed
      tomography (PET/CT) scans, and optional leukapheresis. Radiography and laboratory evaluations
      will be performed to identify biomarkers, clinical signs, and molecular explanations for
      paradoxical reactions. Better understanding of characteristics of paradoxical reactions will
      assist in earlier diagnosis or even prediction.
