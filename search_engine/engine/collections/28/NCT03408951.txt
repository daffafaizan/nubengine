      approximate positions of the ISSD sense electrodes, are used to record patients undergoing
      Defibrillation Threshold (DFT) studies or Electrophysiology (EP) studies of different types.
      Two separate copies of the recordings undergo parallel and separate analysis: one is sent to
      an expert Electrophysiologist for determination and classification of arrhythmia events of at
      least 5 seconds and at least 170 beats per minute. the other is fed to the ISSD detection
      algorithm, with a low cutoff rate of 170 beats per minute. the results are compared to
      establish the accuracy of the detection algorithm and the rate of false detection /
      classification of arrhythmia events.
