      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in China. Macrolide is the first choice for MPP. However,
      progression to severe pneumonia might occur despite antibiotics therapy. And some patients
      have sequelae of bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiectasis and atelectasis, et al. Based on
      inflammatory and immunological mechanism, there is some clinical evidence that adjuvant of
      corticosteroid reduced morbidity and improved the outcome in the children with severe MPP.
      However, the dosage of corticosteroid varied greatly in studies. Therefore, a large
      prospective study is needed to define the benefits of high-dose corticosteroid therapy in
      MPP.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups: the low dose group and the high dose group. The
      low dose group will receive methylprednisolone 2 or 4 mg/kg/d for 3 days followed by tapering
      in 9 days, combined with sequential treatment with azithromycin. The high dose group will
      receive methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg/d for 3 days followed by tapering in 9 days, combined
      with sequential treatment with azithromycin. After discharge, patients of both groups will be
      followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.

      The number of pulmonary lesions, including atelectasis, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis
      obliterans, or consolidations, in 6 months after discharge will be compared in two groups.
      The number of adverse events, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, increased intraocular
      pressure, will be compared between the two groups.

      The trial will be completed in 36 months, with 424 subjects recruited from 5 hospitals in
      partnership with clinical research collaboration of National Clinical Research Center for
      Respiratory Diseases.
