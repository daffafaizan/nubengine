      function (sarcopenia), presumably due to an imbalance of protein synthesis versus protein
      breakdown. In addition, studies have shown that men who start on ADT experience increased
      muscle protein breakdown and decreased synthesis. β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), a leucine
      metabolite, has been shown to slow protein breakdown. When HMB is given with arginine and
      lysine (which support protein synthesis) in randomized trials, researchers have shown that
      elderly men and women who receive this nutritional supplementation experience improvement in
      fat-free mass, strength, functionality and protein synthesis when compared with controls. In
      addition, patients with advanced cancer who experienced weight loss of at least 5% have also
      been shown to benefit from HMB, with supplementation resulting in a significant increase of
      fat-free mass when compared to controls. Thus, it seems reasonable that older men with
      prostate cancer starting on ADT who experience lean muscle loss as a result of aging and ADT,
      may achieve some benefit from supplementation with HMB as well. Use of HMB in men with
      prostate cancer has not been reported.
