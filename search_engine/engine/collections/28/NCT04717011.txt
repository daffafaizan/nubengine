      2019 (COVID19). Since then, COVID19 has become a global pandemic outbreak being declared a
      "public health emergency of international concern" by the International Health Regulations
      Emergency Committee of the WHO on January 30, 2020. The pandemic concerns to public worldwide
      but also to couples aiming to conceive through natural means or undergoing assisted
      reproductive technologies (ART). Different organizations including the American Society of
      Reproductive Medicine have recommended a precautionary approach. Therefore, new cycles for
      infertility patients as well as non-medically urgent gamete preservation treatments, such as
      social egg freezing, have been suspended in many countries. The decision to resume the In
      vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment make us to question if virus could be in gametes
      affecting couples and reproductive outcomes. The presence of the virus in sperm have
      contradictory results.

      The present study aims to describe if there could be presence of virus in sperm samples of
      patients with positive diagnosis for COVID-19, and if so, if the virus turns negative on the
      sperm after the patient recovers and have a negative result for COVID-19. Also it aims to
      assess the presence of the virus in the seminal plasma and discern if it possible to
      disseminate it by sexual transmission.

      An interim analysis is expected to be carried out once the 50% of the expected recruitment is
      achieved.
