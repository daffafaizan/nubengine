        1. We make the questionnaire using Google Forms.

        2. The link of the online questionnaire is sent to three public groups via the social media
           website Facebook.

        3. By clicking on the sent link, all participants are able to read information about the
           project and about the consent to participate in it. Then the participant will be able to
           give consent to participate in the project. After giving consent, the participant will
           be able to start filling out the questionnaire. If the participant indicates that he/she
           does not want to give consent to the study, the website will indicate that the
           participation of him/her has ended in the project.

        4. Anonymous answers will be automatically saved.

        5. The participants will be given code numbers based on the order in which they filled out
           the questionnaire.

        6. The data will be analysed by the researchers. For a participant, completing the online
           questionnaire takes approximately 10-15 minutes.
