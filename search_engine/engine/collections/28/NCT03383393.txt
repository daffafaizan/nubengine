      stable or unstable angina, without elevated hs-TnT. PCI will be performed and monitoring of
      intracoronary ST elevation. Any dissection or acute vessel closure will be promptly treated
      with balloon or stenting.

      Although there could be good angiographic result sometimes ischemia could be detected in the
      treated region by means of intracoronary ECG ST elevation above 1mm.

      This study aims to tackle this issue with randomization of the patients into three possible
      treatments - intracoronary adenosine, IIb/IIIa inhibitors or nitroglycerine alone -
      intracoronary ST segment will be searched for reverse or residual ischemia after the
      pharmacologic bolus.

      The intracoronary electrocardiography (i.c. ECG) is a very sensitive method for ischemia
      detection. The i.c. ECG reacts earlier on ischemia; the changes are much more prominent and
      easy to register. The wire tip could be positioned directly in different regions and thus to
      "map" regional ischemia. In most of the studies and from our own observations became evident
      that when surface ECG do not react the i.c. ECG demonstrates significant changes in
      ST-segment and QRS complex. Moreover, the registration of i.c. ECG is very cheap and needs
      only an adapter connecting coronary wire end and ECG. An i.c. ECG also can differentiate
      residual ischemic changes in distal main vessel and side branch as sources of prolonged
      ischemia, respectively - source of periprocedural myonecrosis.

      Once good angiographic result is obtained after stenting there could be different reasons for
      ischemia in the treated region - microembolic debris or coronary microvascular spasm.
