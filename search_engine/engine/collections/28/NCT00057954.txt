        -  Determine the rate of stable engraftment of donor cells in patients with relapsed
           non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with a reduced toxicity conditioning regimen
           followed by allogeneic (sibling or unrelated) bone marrow transplantation.

        -  Determine the extent and duration of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the 100-day overall survival and long-term progression-free survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the feasibility of collection of molecular chimerism studies at baseline, days
           30, 100, 6 months and one and two years and at relapse.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients undergo extracorporeal photopheresis using methoxsalen
           and UV light on 2 consecutive days between days -7 to -4. Patients receive pentostatin
           intravenously (IV) continuously on days -3 to -2 and undergo total body irradiation on
           day -1.

        -  Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: Patients undergo infusion of allogeneic bone
           marrow or stem cells on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive oral or IV cyclosporine
           beginning on day -1 and continuing until 6 months after transplantation, oral
           mycofenolate mofetil beginning on day 100 and continuing for 1 year, and methotrexate IV
           on days 1 and 3.

      Patients are followed at day 100, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.8 years.
