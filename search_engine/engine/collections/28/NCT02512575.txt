    
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human (FIH), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single
      ascending dose sequential group study in healthy male subjects. The objectives are to study
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effects on glucose homeostasis
      (pharmacodynamics) of AZD9567. Additional exploratory variables (Inflammation biomarkers, ECG
      modelling and taste assessment) will also be evaluated. The study will also assess the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of prednisolone 60 mg
      in comparison with high doses of AZD9567 and placebo. The study will be conducted at a single
      study centre with a planned number of subjects of up to 72 healthy males, aged 18 to 55
      years.
