      the coming decades. Treatment options are available to improve women's health and quality of
      life. However, inadequate communication between physicians and patients leads to decreased
      diagnosis and treatment. Past studies evaluating the use of screening by primary care
      providers, who act as gatekeepers in our healthcare system, clearly demonstrate that
      improvements must be made in the screening system. We propose a survey of local primary care
      providers to quantify screening rates for UI and identify barriers to successful screening.
      The information collected in this survey will allow us to identify methods such as targeted
      education opportunities and patient literature or questionnaires that will assist providers
      and their patients in initiating discussion and evaluation of UI.
