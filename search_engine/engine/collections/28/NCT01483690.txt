      demethylating agents and HDAC inhibitors in combination have been previously shown to have
      synergistic effects in altering neoplastic pathways of cancer cells and be well tolerated in
      human clinical studies. With the ability of decitabine and vorinostat to alter the abnormal
      cellular pathways of leukemic blasts and essentially turn off anti-apoptotic proteins, the
      leukemia cells have become primed for cytotoxic cell kill via chemotherapeutic agents. This
      study will ask the question as to whether or not the combination of decitabine and vorinostat
      followed by chemotherapy is feasible and whether it can positively impact outcome in patients
      with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
