    
      Children and youth, 11-18 years of age, that receive treatment for obesity or Irritable Bowel
      Disease (IBD), will be asked to fill out three questionnaires on an iPad during a regular
      visit at their clinic. Information about the study will be sent home before the visit, and
      will be repeated again at the clinic.

      The questionnaires takes about 10-15 minutes in total to answer, and the Child will be able
      to sit in a separate room while answering. The questionnaires are well validated screening
      tools for various forms of mental illness; General anxiety disorder 7 item scale (GAD-7)
      (anxiety), Psycic Health questionnaire 8 items (PHQ-8) (depression), The Child Eating
      Disorder Examination 8 items (ChEDE-Q8) (eating habits), and Pediatric quality of Life
      inventory (PedsQL).

      Patients that receive high scores will be offered a psychologist appointment for further
      evaluation and treatment (e. g. individual- or family centered therapy).
