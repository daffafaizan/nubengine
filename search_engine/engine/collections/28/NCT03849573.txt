      to 80% of breast cancer survivors are prescribed HT (hormone therapy) medication for 5 to 10
      years following primary treatment. Five years of adjuvant HT among women with non-metastatic
      cancer reduces the risk of recurrences by 50%. Adherence to HT is also an independent
      predictor of breast cancer mortality, reducing the risk by up to 28%. HT-side effects,
      however, are not only a major source of distress but also among the most robust predictors of
      non-adherence to HT. Therefore, effective management and ability to reduce the burden of
      these side effects are critically important to achieve optimal HT adherence. Because HT side
      effects may persist for years and are not easily managed, MBSR's mind-body approach and
      emphasis on non-judgmental attitudes, acceptance, and uncertainty tolerance may be an
      especially beneficial approach to helping cancer survivors cope with the burdensome
      medication-related side effects, thus improving adherence to medication. The investigators
      propose that a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention that has been
      efficacious in reducing HT side effects and improving HRQoL in cancer patients may also prove
      beneficial in improving HT adherence. After developing a web-based MBSR intervention and
      refining it via a usability trial, this study will establish the feasibility of a
      web-delivered, group based MBSR intervention to improve HT medication adherence and HRQoL in
      patients being treated for breast cancer. It is hypothesized that participants assigned to
      the MBSR intervention will have better primary outcomes than participants in the control
      group, which receives standard health information.
