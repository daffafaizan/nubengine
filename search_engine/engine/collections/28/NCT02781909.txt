      mortality, and the duration of TB treatment) and to treat XDR-TB cases. Host-Directed
      therapies (especially repurposed drugs such as Non-Steroid AntiInflammatory Drugs NSAIDS)
      could be useful in this context, and therefore the appropriateness and potential effect of
      this approach needs to be evaluated in humans. Investigators do propose a prospective,
      randomized, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of using
      adjunctive ibuprofen during two months for the treatment of XDR tuberculosis.
