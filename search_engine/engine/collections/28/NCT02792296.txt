      measurements over repeat play cycles. The study has three arms: adults playing multiple times
      per day, adults playing once daily, and adults playing once weekly. The investigators plan to
      evaluate 76 participants (N = 30 in the daily and weekly arms, and N=16 in the multiple times
      per day arm) in two sites over a 4 to 8 week study period. The study period includes 2
      in-clinic sessions and scheduled, at-home game play of the short (less than 7 minutes)
      Project: EVO Monitor.
