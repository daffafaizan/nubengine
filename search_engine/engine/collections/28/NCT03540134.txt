      infusion-enhanced, MRI-guided DBS electrode placement. The investigators intend to enroll
      patients with Parkinson's disease and medically-refractory motor symptoms, who are already
      planned for MRI-guided DBS electrodes under general anesthesia. The hypothesis of the study
      is that a convective micro-infusion of autologous CSF will enhance the T2-weighted MRI
      visualization of the targeted nucleus during image-guided DBS surgery for Parkinson's
      disease. The investigators will record standard clinical measures of PD at baseline and 6
      months following DBS surgery. The study will recruit patients at a rate of approximately one
      a month and will take less than two years to complete.
