    
      In this Randomized-Controlled-Trial, 60 adults (20/condition) will take part in 20, 45-minute
      sessions (ballroom dance, ukulele/guitar playing, or control- i.e. social conversation), 2
      times/week for 10 weeks.

      While the investigators know that arts participation improves function in older adults, exact
      effects of different arts programs on health outcomes remains unclear.

      The investigators plan to fill this gap by studying how different arts participation affect
      health outcomes.

      The overall aim is to study how arts engagement helps older adults remain active and
      influences physical, psychological, and emotional functioning.
