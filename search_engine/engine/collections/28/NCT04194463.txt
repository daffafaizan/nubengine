      'prehabilitation' exercise regimen in oesophago-gastric patients during preoperative
      chemotherapy and the period leading up to surgical resection. The investigators also hope to
      explore secondary outcomes of such a regimen, such as maintenance of fitness, the incidence
      of sarcopenia, muscle function and the outcomes of therapy. The investigators will explore
      the added value of blood-borne frailty biomarkers to objectively measure changes in
      physiology during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). This will be tested using CPET, CT
      measured sarcopenia, grip strength and a small panel of biomarkers as secondary outcome and
      exploratory measures. Thus the main question is: 'Will patients participate in a home-based
      exercise programme during and after NAC for oesophago-gastric cancer?'
