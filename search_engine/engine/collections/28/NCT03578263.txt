      received carbetocin 100 Âµg diluted in 10 ml normal saline and administered slowly (over 30-60
      seconds) intravenously by anesthetist after the birth of the baby. Group (B): included
      patients who received a combination of intraoperative oxytocin 5 I.U which was diluted in 10
      ml normal saline and administered slowly over (30-60 seconds) intravenously by anesthetist
      and intramuscular ergometrine 0.2 mg. The slow administration has been shown to reduce the
      potentially harmful hemodynamic effects of oxytocin (and presumably carbetocin). Also,
      intramuscular injection of ergometrine did the same. All women were subjected to full history
      taking, general and obstetric examination and investigations in the form of preoperative
      routine labs and obstetric ultrasound, and postoperative serum hemoglobin %.
