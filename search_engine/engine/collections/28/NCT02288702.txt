      fixed for all patients, then a patient with an intellectual disability such as a patient with
      DS would require less anesthetic drugs compared to a control patient without any neurological
      disability. However, if one is only using a clinical sedation scale, the DS patient may
      receive more anesthetic drugs in order to achieve the same level of clinical unconsciousness
      as a patient without DS.

      This project seeks to elucidate the effect of anesthetic techniques and agents on patients
      with DS compared to those without DS and any intellectual disability. The goal of this
      project is to compare BIS values in patients with DS to those without DS undergoing a
      standardized general anesthetic technique. The investigators hypothesize that patients with
      DS would have lower (>25%) BIS values compared to those without DS.

      Known potential sources of artifact signals that could change BIS values include
      electromyographic activity, electric devices, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and the timing and
      type of anesthetics used (Duarte 2009, Dahaba 2005). These potential sources will be
      identified and reported during the study, and those patients will be excluded from the study
