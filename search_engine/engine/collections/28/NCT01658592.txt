      internal capsule(VC) is proved a effective target to obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD). Like
      other addiction behaviors most alcohol addicts contain obsessive compulsive symptom. We
      explored an operation method, that is, in the Leksell stereotactic positioning system take VC
      as the point of entry, take NAc as the point of target, then make sure that the distance
      between entry and target points are included in the four contacts of electrode of DBS. When
      stimulator is ON the investigators can adjust parameters so that the coverage of electrode
      contains both Vc and NAc. The investigators suppose that bilateral NAc-VC DBS will
      significantly reduce the craving for alcohol and thus enable the patients to decrease their
      alcohol intake substantially.
