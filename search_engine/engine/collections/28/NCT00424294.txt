      efficacy and safety analysis demonstrated an overall poor tolerability profile and high
      discontinuation rate when dual therapy with CP-195543 and Celecoxib was administered. The
      decision to discontinue further enrollment in the trial was not based on any efficacy or
      serious safety concerns. Previously enrolled study participants continued in the study and
      the trial completed on February 27, 2008.
