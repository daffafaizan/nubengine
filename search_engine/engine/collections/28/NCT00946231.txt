    
      This is a multi-center, single-arm double-blinded prospective clinical study to determine the
      optimal frequency of home B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing and the changes in BNP
      concentrations that correlate with clinical heart failure (HF) decompensation and related
      adverse clinical outcomes in at-risk HF patients. Approximately 200 subjects will be
      enrolled.
