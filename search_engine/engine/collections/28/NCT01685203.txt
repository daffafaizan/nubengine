    
      This was a Phase 2, randomized, open-label, combination treatment study of the 2-DAA regimen
      (ABT-450 150 mg QD + ritonavir 100 mg QD + ABT-267 25 mg QD) in adult HCV GT1b-infected
      treatment-naïve and Pegylated-interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) treatment-experienced
      participants without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis, and in adult GT4-infected
      treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced participants without cirrhosis.
      Treatment Group 5 was not open to enrollment, based on a protocol-specified interim review of
      results from the treatment-naïve GT4 Groups 1 and 4 that indicated higher sustained virologic
      response (SVR) rates among participants receiving the 2-DAA regimen with RBV. All other
      groups completed the study.
