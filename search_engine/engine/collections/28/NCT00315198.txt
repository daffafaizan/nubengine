      pediatric eye care providers currently recommend that the child perform near visual tasks
      while wearing a patch over the sound eye, while other pediatric eye care providers do not
      prescribe any specific visual tasks to be performed while the patch is worn.

      In previous randomized studies of patching doses for amblyopia conducted by the Pediatric Eye
      Disease Investigator Group, near visual activities were incorporated into the prescribed
      treatment regimes. Although different doses of patching, combined with near visual
      activities, were successful in improving visual acuity in most children, it is unclear
      whether concurrent near visual activities enhanced the effect of patching.

      This study is designed as an efficacy study, making effort to maximize adherence to treatment
      group assignments.

      The study has been designed as a simple trial that, other than the type of amblyopia therapy
      being determined through the randomization process, approximates standard clinical practice.
      The two treatment regimens for the 17 week treatment period are: 1) 2 hours of daily patching
      combined with near visual activities while patching and 2)2 hours of daily patching combined
      with distance visual activities while patching.
