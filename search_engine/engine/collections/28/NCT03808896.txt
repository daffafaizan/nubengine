      study. The investigators' research results had been accepted and published by the journal
      BioMeidcal Central Anesthesiology. The investigators will be eager to do the further clinical
      trial to investigate the impact of this technique clinically. Besides, bougie assisted
      intubation is a effective, evidenced-proved intervention. The investigators will also like to
      find out the prognosis differences between these two techniques.
