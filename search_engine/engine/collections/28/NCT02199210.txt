        -  Pilot Study: the purpose of this study is to develop measurement tools for forethought,
           performance and a tool for prompting forethought. This study will include 2 attending
           anesthesiologists and 2 anesthesia residents (PGY2, 5).

        -  Study I: the purpose of this study is to validate the measurement tools for forethought,
           performance and the tool for prompting forethought. This will include 6 attending
           anesthesiologists, 6 PGY5 and 6 PGY2 anesthesia residents.

        -  Study II: the purpose of this study is to investigate if prompting forethought in
           anesthesia residents will result in better performance in a simulated massive
           transfusion than no prompting.
