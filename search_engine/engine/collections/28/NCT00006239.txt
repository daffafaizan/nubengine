        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of phenylbutyrate and tretinoin in patients with
           myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic interaction of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any potential therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of tretinoin.

      Patients receive phenylbutyrate IV continuously on days 1-7 of weeks 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15,
      17, and 19. Patients also receive oral tretinoin three times daily on days 1-7 of weeks 3, 5,
      7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tretinoin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      An additional cohort of 6 patients is accrued at the MTD. These patients receive
      phenylbutyrate IV continuously on days 1-3 of weeks 1 and 3-18. These patients also receive
      oral tretinoin three times daily on days 1-3 of weeks 2-18. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
