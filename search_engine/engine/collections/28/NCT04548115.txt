    
      Objective: The core objective is to critically investigate and assess the independent and
      combined efficacy of each key intervention components of ARTISAN's multimodal framework,
      which consist of: 1) full ARTISAN condition; 2) intergenerational participatory arts
      condition; 3) intergenerational art space condition; 4) intergenerational storytelling
      condition; and 5) control condition of physical activity.

      Methods: Utilizing a five-arm, multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, 70
      youths and 70 seniors (N=140) from 10 collaborating sites will be invited to participate in a
      5-weeks intervention programme under one of five conditions (ARTISAN condition, Participatory
      Arts condition, Art-space condition, Storytelling condition, Control condition). Quantitative
      measurements will be taken at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and ten week post
      baseline the interventions.

      Significance: The results generated will serve to illuminate the intricate pathways in which
      arts and heritage can cultivate positive life changes, and address misconceptions and about
      the pivotal roles that arts and heritage play in health promotion.
