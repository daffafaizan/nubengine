      for the treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC, new studies in this patient population will
      have to include this as a reference arm. Addition of a fourth anti-cancer agent has now
      become the new strategy to improve the outcome for advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Since the
      regimen of Vorinostat, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel is already in advanced stage of development
      it is important to study the safety and tolerability of Vorinostat in combination with the
      three-drug regimen of Bevacizumab, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel. Therefore, we will evaluate
      Vorinostat when administered in combination with the regimen of Carboplatin, Paclitaxel and
      Bevacizumab for patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
