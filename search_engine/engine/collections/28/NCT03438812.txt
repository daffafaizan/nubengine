      ovarian responders (NORs) and poor ovarian responders (PORs). PORs were assigned to receive
      DHEA supplementation or not before the IVF cycle. For all patients, cumulus cells (CCs) were
      obtained after oocyte retrieval. In the CCs, mRNA expression of mitochondria-related genes
      was measured. To compare the mRNA expression of mitochondria-related genes in the CCs among
      the three groups.
