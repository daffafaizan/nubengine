      improve physical fitness, which is a major problem in many patients. Furthermore, all of the
      participants will receive lifestyle counselling to further improve glycemic control, and
      blood glucose levels are closely monitored. Thus, patients in all groups will benefit from
      improvement in glucose levels. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance in this study is
      considered favorable.
