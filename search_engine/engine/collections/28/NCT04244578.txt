    
      The study design is randomized stratified, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled.

      Children and adolescents with dyslexia will be selected and randomly assigned to two
      different groups: 1. Active tDCS over parieto-occipital areas + sham tDCS over
      parieto-occipital areas (Active-Sham tDCS); 2. Sham tDCS over parieto-occipital areas +
      active tDCS over parieto-occipital areas (Sham-Active tDCS).

      In this project, the investigators will work to understand whether a brain-based
      intervention, with the use of tDCS without combined training, can enhance reading in
      individuals with dyslexia.

      The protocol will allow the investigators to:

        1. Testing the efficacy of stand-alone tDCS in enhancing reading in individuals with
           dyslexia;

        2. Testing the critical role of brain regions (parieto-occipital areas) usually involved in
           reading and disrupted in dyslexia;

        3. Predicting outcomes based on reading-related skills;

        4. Investigating the safety and tolerability of tDCS;

      The overarching goal is to provide a scientific foundation for devising new rehabilitation
      strategies in dyslexia.
