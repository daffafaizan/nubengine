      The Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC) was created by 12 emergency physicians
      in May 1996 to determine the best management of acute asthma in the emergency department. The
      principal investigator of MARC, Dr. Carlos Camargo, formed the MARC Steering Committee to
      help guide this collaboration. The MARC Coordinating Center is based at the Massachusetts
      General Hospital (Boston, MA). Financial support for MARC has come from a variety of sources,
      including government, foundations, and industry. The NHLBI study used MARC databases.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Five representative aims were to: 1) characterize acute asthma management in urban emergency
      departments (EDs) and then compare current practice with that recommended in the 1997
      national guidelines; 2) examine gender differences in acute asthma; 3) identify reasons why
      minority patients with asthma go to (and possibly prefer) the ED for their asthma care; 4)
      characterize important clinical subgroups, such as acute asthma among pregnant women and
      patients with sudden-onset severe acute asthma; and 5) examine risk factors for asthma
      hospitalization and for relapse after ED discharge.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
