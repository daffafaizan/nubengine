      Patients achieving their last pulmonary rehabilitation session will be approached to
      participate in this study.

      Eligible patients who agree to participate in the study and sign informed consent will
      perform two baseline visit assessments:

      First visit: Incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Second visit: Other baseline
      assessment (see outcome section), including a constant workload exercise testing at 75% of
      the maximal workload achieved during the incremental exercise testing.

      Then, patients will then be randomized to one of the following two arms:

        -  Nasal high flow,

        -  Usual care.

      After 6 months, patients will be invited to perform the same assessment as during the second
      baseline visit.
