    
      This is a multicenter double-blind controlled randomized Phase II study to evaluate the
      activity of folate receptor alpha (FRα) peptide vaccine as a consolidation treatment
      following completion of no less than 4 cycles of a platinum containing regimen in patients
      with platinum-sensitive, non-mucinous ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

      The patients will have demonstrated a tumor response or stable disease upon their last
      regimen (per RECIST v1.1 and/or CA125 GCIG criteria) prior to enrolment in this study.

      Following randomization, patients will be administered TPIV200 with GM-CSF adjuvant or GM-CSF
      control alone. Patients will have booster doses and tumor assessments done every 12 weeks ± 1
      week for up to 1.5 years, until objective disease progression or the patient withdraws
      consent. Tumor responses will be assessed at the study sites by evaluating tumor images/scans
      according to RECIST v1.1.
