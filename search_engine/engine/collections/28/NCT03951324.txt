      Primary Objectives:

        1. Interobserver study for criteria validation and accuracy, Positive predictive value
           (PPV) and Negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity.

        2. Evaluation of VLE diagnostics on clinical management (increased accuracy/faster
           detection)

        3. Determination of learning curve to standardize credentialing for endoscopists to use and
           interpret VLE imaging for biliary/pancreatic treatment management.

      B. Hypotheses / Research Question(s) The new VLE criteria for biliary and pancreatic duct
      strictures increase accuracy, thus leading to substantial impact on clinical management
      (Screening and Treatment)

      Study Design (2 phase):

        -  Phase 1: Primary Objective 1 and 2 part of the study will be completed.

        -  Phase 2: Primary Objective 3 of the study will be conducted within 1 month.

      Study Timeline: 3 months post WIRB approval. Sample size: 40 VLE Clips of at least 20 seconds
      featuring one or more the VLE criteria. All clips will have confirmed diagnosis for accuracy
      analysis. All clips will be de-identified. All clips will be removed from RedCAP and other
      secure cloud storage upon completion of study.

      Clips will be supplied by NinePoint Medical, the company behind VLE OCT. All VLE clips will
      be from a dataset of clips collected from adults > 18 and who underwent Endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with indeterminate biliary stricture indications. The clips
      are chosen based on the quality of the clips, duration, final diagnosis and presence of
      either benign or malignant criteria.

      Investigators: Up to 30 Expert and non-expert endoscopists currently using VLE
