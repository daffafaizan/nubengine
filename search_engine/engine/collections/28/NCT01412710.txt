      Similarly, a negative association between serum vitamin D levels and insulin resistance has
      been reported in a large sample representative of the adult US population and in subjects at
      risk for T2D. In addition, a strong association between hypovitaminosis D and
      hypertriglyceridemia has been demonstrated in studies done in US adult population.

      Literature has indicated that subjects with T2D and insulin resistance (IR) are more likely
      to develop arteriosclerosis and all of the complications related to this condition, such as
      myocardial infarction and stroke.

      These findings have increased the interest about the effect of vitamin D on metabolic
      abnormalities grouped under the term "cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors", which
      includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, glucose intolerance, inflammation and T2D which
      is in itself a risk factor for CVD.

      Therefore, the purpose of the present pilot study will be to determine the effect of
      supplemental vitamin D intake (4000 IU or 6000 IU of Cholecalciferol daily for 6 months) on
      CVD risk markers and glycemic control; primarily lipid panel, insulin resistance, and
      glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), in a sample of Hispanics and African-Americans with T2D and
      vitamin D insufficiency. If repletion of vitamin D level improves insulin resistance,
      glycemic control, inflammation, hypertension, dyslipidaemia or kidney functions, it may
      prevent the development of CVD events and decrease T2D complications.
