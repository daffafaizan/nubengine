      What is the Purpose of this Study? There is currently no effective treatment for IBM and its
      pathogenesis remains uncertain. This study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment
      of patients with IBM with Lithium can improve muscle strength and reduce the markers of
      disease activity believed to be important in the disease pathogenesis.

      Who is Eligible to Participate? Patients diagnosed with Inclusion Body Myositis above the age
      of 30 who have adequate muscle function for quantitative muscle testing and who have a FVC
      >50%. Patients who have uncontrolled diabetes, renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure,
      cancer, hypothyroidism, current use of immunosuppressive medication, currently on warfarin or
      any known bleeding disorder are excluded.

      What is involved in this Study? This is an open label trial looking at the effects of Li on
      muscle strength. Procedures consist of a baseline muscle biopsy, blood work, and other
      screening procedures. After the muscle biopsy patients are started on Li at 300mg/d. Lithium
      doses are dependent on tolerability and target lithium levels. Monthly visits consist of
      EKGs, Li level labs, questionnaires, and muscle strength testing. At month 6, patients will
      receive another muscle biopsy. The muscle biopsies are performed to analyze p-tau levels in
      the muscle.

      How long is the Study? It is approximately 6 months long; however patients have the option to
      stay on the study for an additional 6 months.
