      lumen loss(LLL) at 1 year follow-up.

      vasomotion before and after the complete degradation of the NeoVas Bioresorbable Coronary
      Scaffold with the aid of angiography, OCT and FFR. The subgroup study will be performed in
      two centers and 160 subjects will be enrolled on a 1:1 randomization basis. Subjects will
