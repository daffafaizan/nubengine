    
      This study will obtain daily urine samples from pregnant volunteers, from 36 weeks pregnant
      until birth. It is anticipated 20-40 pregnant women will be recruited to the study.

      Urine samples will be delivered to SPD either via post, or by hand and form part of the SPD
      BioBank. All urine samples will be stored and used for research or product validation
      purposes.

      The study will also gather information from volunteers regarding a woman's health during her
      pregnancy, including any bleeding, discharge, discomfort, contractions/ Braxton Hicks via the
      use of a daily diary.

      Pregnancy outcome details including labour specifics and birth outcomes such as birth date,
      weight, and sex of the baby will be obtained 4-6 weeks after the volunteer has given birth
      via email correspondence between the volunteer and study co-ordinator.
