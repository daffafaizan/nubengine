      pharmacokinetics of a Pgp substrate dabigatran etexilate in healthy participants.

      The hypothesis for this clinical study is that quizartinib, as a P-gp inhibitor, may increase
      the systemic exposure (measured by area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] and maximum
      concentration [Cmax]) of P-gp substrates that may be sensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition.
