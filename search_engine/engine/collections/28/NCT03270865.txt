      by elderly patients in their home setting The study's objective is to explore ergonomic
      solutions that will allow the user to perform imaging on their own. The study will be done in
      a home-simulated environment using a dedicated ergonomic system (termed "PAF" - Positioning
      And Fixation system) that stimulates the retinal imager and enables to record the tested
      subject using standard cameras. The prototype doesn't include the retinal imager and does not
      include any imaging capabilities aside from standard means of photography Subjects will be
      evaluating for positioning accuracy and comfort by comparing different methods. Pupil
      position will be recorded using commercial off the shelf cameras when the subject is
      performing simple ergonomic tasks while looking at a screen presenting images.
