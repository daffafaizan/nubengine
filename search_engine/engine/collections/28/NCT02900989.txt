    
      ASQ-Fr is a prospective, cross-sectional instrument-validation study evaluated 5 candidate
      screening questions assessing suicide risk in adolescents between 10 and 18 years of age
      managed in two urban, pediatric emergency departments associated with tertiary care
      hospitals.

      ASQ-Fr questionnaire is conducted by a psychologist before or after the French version of the
      SIQ/SIQ Junior (Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire), depending on the randomisation in the unit.
      SIQ is composed of 30 items and valid for adolescents aged 15 years or more. SIQ Junior is
      composed of 15 items and valid for children up to 14 years old.

      Questionnaires are followed by an interview in adolescents and parents separately by the
      psychologist to evaluate perceptions, feasibility and acceptability of questionnaires.

      It is planned a convenience sample of 200 patients aged 10 to 18 years who presented with
      either medical or surgical chief concerns to the emergency department.
