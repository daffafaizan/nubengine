      regimen to a switch to the FDC of rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir. Rwanda is a model
      country for implementation of newer approaches to more innovative ART strategies with an
      excellent National HIV Treatment program in place but has limited experience with clinical
      trials and as with most African countries has no clinical experience with Rilpivirine in
      treating HIV infected adults. Done in collaboration with Rwanda Biomedical center.
