      principles and therapeutic techniques could improve outcome in chronic pain patients with
      high levels of self-criticism in comparison to a wait-list control group. The treatment was
      delivered via the internet, guided by trained professional. Internet delivered cognitive
      behavior therapy (CBT) and ACT treatments have shown similar efficacy as compared to
      face-to-face treatments in a variety of problem areas and across a large range of outcomes.
      Participants were recruited from a clinical setting. The treatment program consisted of eight
      sections and was based on a manual based on ACT developed for chronic pain (Buhrman et al.,
      2013) and a CFT-manual for chronic pain.

      Following a screening interview participants deemed eligible were asked to complete an
      assessment battery online. All correspondence concerning treatment was held through a web
      portal including the online questionnaires and a secure e-mail service. The system handled
      security issues with two factor authentication. The participants logged in with electronic
      identification which is a secure service used by banks and in clinical settings.

      Measures were obtained pre- and post- intervention and administered via the internet. A sixth
      month follow-up of the treatment group was administered. Mediation measures were also
      obtained.
