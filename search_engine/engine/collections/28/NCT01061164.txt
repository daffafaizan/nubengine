      However, prolonged use of HAART may have long-term consequences. In addition, people
      participating in clinical trials using experimental therapies to treat HIV infection may
      experience negative health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify the long-term
      effects of HIV infection, HAART, and experimental treatments in infants, children, and
      adolescents.

      This study will enroll children who participated in PACTG 219C or various IMPAACT studies.
      There will be no study visits specifically for this study. Researchers will review
      participants' medical records annually and collect information on illnesses, medications, CD4
      cell count and viral load data, and body measurements.
