      diagnostic mammography) must have been conducted on GE equipment and the images must be
      available (or imaging must be repeated). DBT images will be read on-site by one or more
      qualified radiologists. All subjects who undergo biopsy will be asked to return in
      approximately 1 year for a follow-up mammogram. Images will be processed and evaluated by
      independent readers.
