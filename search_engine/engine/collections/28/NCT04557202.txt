    
      Objective: To assess the efficacy of peri-operative alpha1 blockers on improving the success
      rate and decreasing complications of non-stented ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy for ureteric
      stones.

      Patients and Methods: A randomized control trial was conducted at two high volume urological
      centers from September 2017 to December 2018. We enrolled 120 patients with lower ureteric
      stones. They were randomly divided into two groups. Group A had 58 patients who underwent
      non-stented ureteroscopy using Ho-YAG laser for stone disintegration and received
      alpha1-blockers for one week preoperatively and another two weeks postoperatively, while
      Group B had 62 patients who underwent non-stented ureteroscopy and laser and received
      placebo.
