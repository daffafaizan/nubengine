      that aims to improve the health and well-being of adolescents ages 13-19 in Fresno County,
      California. In particular, it will address the needs of homeless and unstably housed youth,
      youth of color, sexual minority youth, and Native American youth using a trauma-informed
      approach and positive youth development framework.

      DIY combines existing, in-person, group-based, comprehensive sexual health education with an
      app designed in consultation with youth. DIY is built on three strategies: positive youth
      development, youth-centered design, and wraparound technologies. It will focus on four main
      areas: sexual health and contraceptive use, healthy relationships, educational and career
      development, and life skills. The intervention includes six hours of in-person education and
      an app that includes a resource locator, goal setting, text message reminders, and additional
      information and referrals.

      This study is funded through the Personal Responsibility Education Program Innovative
      Strategies (PREIS), which is administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau, part of
      Health and Human Services,

      Fresno EOC is responsible for site and participant recruitment as well as the implementation
      of the intervention. Participants are randomized at the cohort (group) level. All control
      group participants will be invited to participate after completion of the long-term follow up
      period.
