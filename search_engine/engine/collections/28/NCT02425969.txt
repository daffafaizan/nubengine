      method of assessing the physiological significance of angiographically intermediate lesions.
      A grey-zone exists between the originally validated cut-off for ischemia of <0.75 and the
      conventionally adopted cut- off of â‰¤0.80. Pilot data from our centre has suggested that only
      1 in 3 coronary arteries with grey-zone FFR values demonstrate myocardial perfusion defects
      on stress cardiac MRI and others have suggested that the clinical outcomes in patients with
      grey-zone FFR are favorable with medical therapy alone. As such, stenting all lesions with
      grey-zone FFR (as currently recommended) may represent over-treatment and could attenuate the
      overall benefit of an FFR strategy. In addition to this there are flow derived resistance
      indices of stenosis severity that have superior diagnostic accuracy and may be helpful in
      correctly classifying patients with grey-zone FFR. In this study we will a comprehensive
      analysis of lesions with grey-zone FFR values (0.75-0.82 inclusive) using invasive hyperemic
      pressure, flow and resistance derived indices of severity with quantitative and qualitative
      3T perfusion MRI to enable identification of the best invasive predictors of true perfusion
      defects on 3T cardiac MRI. Patients will be randomised to optimal medical therapy alone
      versus optimal medical therapy with PCI and followed up for the primary endpoint of anginal
      control as measured by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire at 3 months.
