      which were checked prior to each training session:

      Criteria:

        -  Cardiorespiratory stability:

        -  Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60 - 110 mmHg

        -  fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) <60%

        -  partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) >200

        -  Respiratory rate <40 bpm

        -  Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) <10 cmH2O

        -  no high inotropic doses (Dopamine >10 mcg/kg/min or Nor/adrenaline <0,1 mcg/kg/min)

        -  Temp. 36 - 38,5°C

        -  Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) -2 - +2

        -  Medical Doctor clearance

        -  Medical research council (MRC) score lower limbs ≥3

      Accordingly, the post burn starting time differs per enrolled subject.

      Exercises are administered as in-bed exercises or out-of-bed exercises, depending on whether
      subjects are able and allowed to engage in out-of-bed mobility.

      Exercise intensity for resistance training is set at 60% peak force based on a weekly peak
      force measurement by hand-held dynamometry, or on a 3 RM in case of out of bed exercises.
      Aerobic exercise intensity is set at 50-75% peak Watts determined by a weekly cycle ergometer
      or treadmill ramp protocol.
