      well-documented among individuals with psychotic disorders. Mitochondrial dysfunction may
      contribute to such pathology, and effective functioning of mitochondrial activity in the
      brain in dependent on a sufficient supply of oxygen. These data suggest that oxygen therapy
      may improve symptoms in individuals with psychosis. This small pilot study will test this
      hypothesis.

      Individuals with first-episode psychosis will be randomized to receive either (i) 4 weeks of
      nightly normobaric oxygen therapy (40% FiO2) or (ii) 4 weeks of a placebo condition utilizing
      room air oxygen levels (21% FiO2). Participants will be blinded to what condition they
      receive. Both conditions will be delivered via nasal cannula connected to oxygen
      concentrators at five liters per minute (lpm), and participants will be instructed to
      complete the intervention overnight while sleeping. At the end of the 4 week period, all
      individuals will receive an additional 4 weeks of unblinded (i.e., "open label") nightly
      normobaric oxygen therapy (40% FiO2). Study assessments will be completed at (i) enrollment;
      (ii) 4 weeks after enrollment, and (iii) 8 weeks after enrollment.
