      adenocarcinoma evaluating combination CPI-613 with modified FOLFIRINOX, with the addition of
      a dose escalation cohort to assess safety. All study participants will get the same study
      intervention, which includes the best available treatment for locally advanced pancreatic
      cancer, plus an experimental therapy. The standard therapy is called mFOLFIRINOX, which is a
      combination of three chemotherapy drugs (Oxaliplatin, Irniotecan and 5-flurouracil) and one
      additional vitamin derivative (Folinic acid). The experimental drug is CPI-613, which
      inhibits energy production in cells, and early studies suggest that pancreatic cancer cells
      may be especially sensitive. Pre-treatment, diagnostic biopsy tissue will be collected when
      available, and clinical data will be evaluated to determine if the combination results in
      improved overall survival compared to historical experience. Based on new data, the study
      team will also attempt to identify a new maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 in a phase 1
      open-label dose-regimen finding study.

      The objectives of the Standard Dose Cohort are to determine the safety and efficacy of
      CPI-613, in combination with mFOLFIRINOX for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      The objectives of the Dose Escalation Cohort is to determine a new maximum-tolerated dose
      (MTD) of CPI-613 when given in combination with mFOLFIRINOX.
