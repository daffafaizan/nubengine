    
      This Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of volociximab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (C/P) as
      first-line treatment in subjects with Stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      Volociximab doses of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg (or 15 mg/kg if 20 mg/kg is not tolerable) with
      carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy will be tested for determining the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). Subjects will be dosed once very 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles.

      Volociximab is a high-affinity, chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to α5β1
      integrin, a cell-surface receptor for fibronectin. Volociximab blocks the binding of α5β1 to
      fibronectin, thereby inhibiting a pivotal interaction required for angiogenesis.

      More than 170 subjects with various solid tumor types have received volociximab in Phase 1
      and Phase 2 single and combination studies. At the doses tested, there has not been a dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) or a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined.
