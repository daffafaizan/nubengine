      preoperative evaluation of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. The Investigator intends
      to demonstrate that preoperative automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) will provide a relatively
      inexpensive and well-tolerated alternative to MRI for detection of occult breast cancer
      missed by mammography and hand-held ultrasound in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.
      The research will take place at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). The research
      study will be open to newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who present to KUMC with a
      recommendation for preoperative MRI and who fit all inclusion criteria and have none of the
      exclusion criteria.
