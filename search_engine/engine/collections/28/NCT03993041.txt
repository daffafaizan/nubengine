      (PD-early) will receive three assessments: baseline, immediately post-treatment (post1), and
      6 weeks after treatment (post2). The other six (PD-waitlist) will have an additional
      assessment (Baseline 2; 12 weeks after Baseline 1) to examine practice effects before
      beginning treatment, and then will have the post1 and post2 assessments (four assessments).
