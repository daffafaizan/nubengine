      particularly those with reduced immunity such as people infected with HIV. This is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether interferon-alpha,
      delivered in low doses via orally dissolving lozenges, can reduce or eliminate these warts in
      HIV+ subjects who are receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). All potential
      subjects will have their warts examined and measured at a screening visit. A small amount of
      one wart (i.e. a biopsy) will be removed for microscopic evaluation to confirm HPV infection
      and a small amount of blood will be collected for testing. Subjects that qualify for entry
      will return for a baseline visit at which they will be randomized to active or placebo
      treatment for 24 weeks. Three out of four subjects will receive active treatment in this
      study. Subjects must return to the clinic every 6 weeks during treatment to have their warts
      re-examined. At these follow-up visits, subjects will be asked to complete a brief
      questionnaire regarding any perceived changes in their warts and their overall mouth
      condition. A small amount of blood will be taken at the final study visit at week 24 to
      assess the safety of the interferon lozenges.
