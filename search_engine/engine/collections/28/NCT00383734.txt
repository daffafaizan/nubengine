    
      The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Eutrophill (polyacrylamid gel),
      a resorbable filler compound versus Newfill( polylactic acid) in a comparative, randomised,
      multicenter trial and patient-blinded study, in the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in
      HIV-infected patients, one year after the first injection (week 48). The efficacy will be
      assessed by measuring the median self-perception index of the patients with a visual analogue
      scale (VAS index).The study will compare between treatments, at week 48, week 72 and week 96
      versus baseline :the median increase of the VAS index, the rate of treatment failure, the
      scores of 2 patients-questionnaires (a-NBC and MOS-HIV),the ordering of digital
      photographs,the median increase of the facial dermal thickness of the cheek and the dermal
      skin fold as assessed by a Skinfold Caliper.

      The study will compare at week 48 and week 96 versus baseline:

      the median increase of dermal thickness as assessed by CT scan of the face. Safety will be
      assessed by the frequency and nature of immediate and delayed side effects.
