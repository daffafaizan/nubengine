      if we consider the aesthetics, the use of metallic implants can lead to complications, namely
      metal translucency through the peri-implant mucosa or the presence of soft tissue recessions
      causing metal exposure. As an alternative to the use of titanium, we have zirconium, that is
      highly biocompatible and whose use in implantology has demonstrated a predictable
      osseointegration. In addition, some studies suggest a different histology that could help
      maintaining the stability of the peri-implant mucosa and, therefore, an improvement in
      long-term aesthetic results.

      The reason for designing this study is that there is not too much data about this type of
      implants, that can be, really, an alternative to those we know.

      To achieve those objectives a single-arm clinical trial is designed, using marginal bone loss
      as a primary response variable. It is estimated with the calculation of the sample size, we
      would need 30 patients to get relevant data.

      An experienced surgeon (M.V) will perform implant surgery. Later, experienced and calibrated
      examiners (R.E and E.RG) will collect the following clinical parameters at baseline, and at
      4, 8 and 12 months: gingival recession, papillary Jemt index, width and height of the
      keratinized gingiva, probing depth, plaque index and bleeding on probing.

      Finally, a blind statistic (X.M) will analyze the data using the SPSS software, having as
      unit of analysis the implant.
