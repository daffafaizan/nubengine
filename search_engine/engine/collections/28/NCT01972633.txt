      saphenous vein) is a standard procedure for years. There are different methods that cause an
      obliteration of the vein using heat. The adventage of these methods are low rates of minor
      and major complications compared to classic open surgery. There are also advantages
      concerning cosmetic and recurrence of varicous veins. Actually there are two different
      methods for the endovenous obliteration of the saphenous vein - lasers with wavelength of
      1470nm or 1320nm and the radiofrequency method. The objective of this study is to compare
      these two different methods concerning postoperative pain, obliteration rate and the rate of
      pleased patients in 140 patients. All patients get an venous ultrasound investigation to
      determine the stadium of venous insufficiency. There are consecutive ultrasound
      investigations 10 days, 3 months and 12 months after surgical treatment.

      In this study there are no additional risk factors for the included study patients except the
      risk of surgery.
