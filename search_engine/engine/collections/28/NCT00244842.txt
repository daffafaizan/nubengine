      physical and mental well being. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis.
      Targeted treatments in psoriasis have been reported recently, yet cyclosporine, a calcineurin
      inhibitor (CNi) remains one of the treatments which has the greatest efficacy. Voclosporin
      represents the possibility of a calcineurin inhibitor which is not only as efficacious as
      cyclosporine A, but also has an improved toxicity profile.

      Comparison(s): Voclosporin at 3 dose levels (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/kg twice a day)compared to
      placebo.
