    
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of duvelisib administered to subjects who have been diagnosed with follicular lymphoma
      that is relapsed or refractory to either chemotherapy or RIT.

      Subjects (n=57) will receive 25 mg duvelisib twice daily (BID) over the course of 28-day
      treatment cycles for up to 12 cycles.

      After completing 12 treatment cycles of duvelisib, subjects may continue to receive
      additional cycles of duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However,
      to receive additional cycles of duvelisib beyond 12 cycles, subjects must have evidence of
      response (CR, PR or SD) by the end of Cycle 12.
