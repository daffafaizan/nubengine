      14.2% in different regions, characterized by hepatocellular and biliary epithelial
      differentiation within the same tumor, is an unique type of primary hepatic carcinoma that is
      distinct from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
      Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma is having attention clinically and
      pathologically, because of its unique biology, histopathology, and clinical behavior, besides
      the difficulties in diagnosis and being rare (comprising 1-5% of primary liver cancer). The
      investigators aimed to present our experience with patients misdiagnosed before LT and found
      to have incidentally ICC or CHC on explant and compare with HCC, and to identify the
      demographic, clinical, pathological and etiological risk factors of recurrence and prognostic
      factors of survival. Liver transplantation has been tried as an effective treatment in
      mixed-type hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, but
      survival and recurrence-free outcomes have not been achieved as well as HCC. In addition,
      survival rates reported in different centers also vary. Prognostic factors that may affect
      disease recurrence and survival include etiology, body mass index, AFP, CEA, CA 19-9, CK7,
      CK19, CD34, CD56, CD117, CD133, HSA, Arginase, HEPPAR, Amacyr, Glypican 3, Synaptophysin,
      CK20, CDX2, p53, Ki67, milan criteria, tumor size, tumor number, maximum tumor diameter,
      total tumor diameter, tumor grade, multicentricity, microvascular invasion, macrovascular
      invasion, vascular invasion, tumor TNM stage. Ä°nvestigating whether there is a difference
      between mixed type hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas compared to HCC in terms of survival,
      recurrence and other prognostic markers mentioned above would be important for mixed type
      tumor relations with liver transplantation.
