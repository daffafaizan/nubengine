      tolerability of Xeno-Skin™ for the treatment of severe and extensive, deep partial and full
      thickness burn wounds as a first-line treatment, and temporary coverage prior to definitive
      wound closure.

      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria and provide informed consent will receive placement of
      Xeno-Skin™ on a single burn wound site.
