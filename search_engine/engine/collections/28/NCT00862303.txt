    
      The purpose of this study is to show if vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed
      with tumor lysate in combination with Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell (CIK) can induce a
      measurable immune response in patients with renal cell carcinoma, and to evaluate the
      clinical effect of the regime.

      Primary

      1. Determine the clinical responses(objective response, progression-free survival, and
      overall survival) in patients with renal cell carcinoma treated with autologous dendritic
      cells (DC) loaded with autologous tumor lysate (DC vaccine) in combination with
      Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell (CIK).

      Secondary

        1. Determine cellular immune response response in terms of immuknow assay, and correlate
           immune response with objective clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        2. Determine safety of multiple administrations of this regimens in these patients.
