        1. To evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of provider-prescribed Teens-Connect
           (TEENCOPE™+Managing Diabetes) in pediatric diabetes practice compared to prescription of
           Planet D™.

           The hypotheses to be studied are:

             1. Youth who participate in Teens-Connect will have better metabolic control (A1c) and
                quality of life (QOL) than those who participate in Planet D.

             2. These effects will be mediated by improvements in stress/coping, self-efficacy,
                diabetes problem-solving, and self-management.

             3. Teens-Connect prescribed by providers in diabetes clinics will be a cost-effective
                approach to reduce A1c and improve quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for youth
                with T1D.

        2. To compare the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of
           the two provider-prescribed psycho-educational internet programs.
