      cause of death in the United States. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has
      been shown to improve the survival of patients with a history of a heart attack and a weak
      heart (functioning at 30% or less) and those with symptomatic congestive heart failure
      symptoms (hearts functioning at 35% or less). Thus, the number of patients who will require
      ICD therapy is expected to rise exponentially over the next several years. To facilitate the
      follow-up of patients with ICDs, device companies have launched systems for remote monitoring
      of these devices. One such system is the Medtronic Carelink Monitor. Although this system has
      been proven in a multicenter, prospective study to be easy to use, it is not known whether
      this monitor results in improved patients' outcomes and satisfaction and in reduced
      healthcare costs.

      Comparison: Patient outcomes, costs, and satisfaction will be evaluated, comparing patients
      assigned to follow-up using the Medtronic Carelink Monitor versus quarterly visits to an
      outpatient clinic.
