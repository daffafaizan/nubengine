    
      At least 200 subjects having undergone pediatric cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB). Enrollment will continue with a maximum of 350 subjects until 30 cases of AKI (stage 2
      and 3) are reached.

      Blood and urines samples will be collected at several time points to measure biomarkers and
      set up a biobank.

      The samples used within the scope of this protocol will be fresh urine samples (1 to 2 ml)
      and blood samples.

      Urine samples for [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] measurements will be taken from each subject included in
      the study during the first 48 hours following cardiopulmonary bypass initiation according to
      the following schedule:

        -  baseline before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB, 0h).

        -  - 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h after initiation of CPB

      Blood samples for serum creatinine and urea concentration measurement will be taken from each
      subject included in the study during the first 48 hours following cardiopulmonary bypass
      initiation according to the following schedule:

        -  baseline before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB, 0h).

        -  12h, 24h, 48h, 60h after initiation of CPB

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the proportion of subjects predicted to be at risk of AKI (stage 2 and 3) using
      at least one measurement of NephroCheck in subjects having undergone pediatric cardiac
      surgery.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the incidence of AKI (stage 2 and 3) according to the KDIGO guideline

        -  To study the kinetic profile of cell cycle arrest biomarkers (TIMP-2*IGFBP-7) during the
           first 48 hours in subjects having undergone pediatric cardiac surgery

        -  To determine the baseline values of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] in the targeted population before
           surgery

        -  To determine profile differences of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] between AKI (stage 2 and 3) and
           non-AKI groups

        -  To evaluate the diagnostic performances of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] to predict AKI after
           pediatric cardiac surgery using a cut-off value of 0.3
