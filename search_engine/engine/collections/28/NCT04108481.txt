    
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out more about the side effects of
      immunotherapy with a form of radiation treatment for the cancer in the liver called
      Yttrium-90 RadioEmbolization (Y90-RE). An immunotherapy drug, durvalumab, will be given
      intravenously every 2 weeks. Investigators are studying what doses of durvalumab are safe for
      people in combination with this form of radiation treatment. Patients in this study will
      receive durvalumab, which is experimental and not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for metastatic colorectal cancer. Microscopic radioactive particles
      (TheraSphereÂ®) will be used for radioembolization to deliver the Y90 drug to the liver.

      The number of doses of the immunotherapy drug (range: 2 to 5) will depend on the cohort
      patients are assigned to. There is no placebo. Everyone on the study is treated with
      immunotherapy alongside Y90-RadioEmbolization.
