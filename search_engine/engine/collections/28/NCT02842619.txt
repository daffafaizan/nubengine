    
      Primary endpoint:

      The transplantation of BonoFill-II to the maxillary or mandible defect/void is safe under the
      following conditions: No chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis); no significant changes in
      complete blood count (CBC) and in general health.

      Secondary endpoint:

      The transplantation of BonoFill-II to the maxillary or mandible void is efficient under the
      following conditions: Following BonoFill-II implantation, the bone regeneration in the
      operated site was significantly accelerated. Also, the bone defects/voids were filled with a
      significant amount of bone tissue.
