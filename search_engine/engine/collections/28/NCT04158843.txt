      treatment versus palliative treatment for breast cancer patients with primary ipsilateral
      humerus or sternum oligometastasis.

      183 subjects will be randomized divided into two groups (experimental group and control
      group) at a ratio of 2 to 1.

      Control group: Palliative treatment. No radical surgical resection or radiotherapy is
      performed in this group. But palliative internal fixation or radiotherapy for pain relief is
      permitted. Moreover, systemic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy are
      allowed.

      Experimental groupï¼šRadical local treatment. Radical resection is performed, and the cutting
      edge is negative, or radical local radiotherapy is feasible (cumulative radiotherapy dose is
      greater than or equal to 50Gy). Systemic endocrine therapy and targeted therapy are allowed
      after radical local therapy. However, whether systemic chemotherapy should be used is
      determined by clinicians according to clinical experience or guidelines.
