      healthy Japanese adults aged 65 years and older to describe the safety profile and immune
      responses (geometric mean titers and seroconversion for the 4 common strains at 28 days
      post-vaccination) of the QIV-HD administered by intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC)
      methods. A local standard-dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV-SD) administered by SC
      method served as a control arm.
