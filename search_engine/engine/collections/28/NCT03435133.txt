      the mainstay of treatment for patients with ST elevation acute myocardial infarction
      undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Prasugrel or ticagrelor have actually
      shown to be superior to clopidogrel improving the prognosis of these patients. However, the
      industrial interest has avoided any direct comparison between these two antiplatelets.
      Comparison is of great interest considering that only ticagrelor has shown to significantly
      reduce mortality. As ticagrelor may exert off-target effects through adenosine-related
      mechanisms, the investigators aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial
      injury to a greater extent than prasugrel in patients with revascularized STEMI.

      Patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary revascularization within 6
      hours of chest pain, will be randomized to (1) prasugrel (a 60 mg oral loading and a 10-mg
      dailiy maintenance dose) or to (2) ticagrelor (a 180 mg loading dose and a 90 mg twice daily
      maintenance dose). The predefined primary end point is infarct sieze on magnetic resonance
      imaging at the end of the study (6 months). Magnetic resonance will be performed at day 1,
      day 7 and moth 6. Platelet reactivity, biomarkers and clinical outcomes will also be assesed.
