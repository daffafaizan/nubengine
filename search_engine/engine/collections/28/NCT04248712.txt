      treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. Antihistamines are frequently used for the treatment
      of gastroesophageal reflux disease and allergic disorders, and we hypothesize they will be
      effective in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis as well. The two antihistamines used
      in this study are loratadine and famotidine.
