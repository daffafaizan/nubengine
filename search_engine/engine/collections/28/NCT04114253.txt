    
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      propoerties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The Quantra QStat Cartridge was
      developed to monitor hemostasis in the trauma and liver transplant populations which may
      experience a range of coagulopathies of various etiologies including fibrinolytic defects.

      This single-center, prospective, observational stuey will evaluate the performance of the
      Quantra System with the QStat Cartridge as compared to corresponding measures determined
      using the TEG 5000.
