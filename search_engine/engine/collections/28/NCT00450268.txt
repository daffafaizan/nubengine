    
      Blood and skin DC reconstitution shall be investigated in patients affected by hematological
      diseases and receiving HLA-matched, mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from related or
      unrelated donors. We plan to simultaneously collect and process double biopsies, i.e. from
      graft versus host disease affected and non-lesional skin of patients at onset of acute graft
      versus host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Emigration
      assay, Chimerism analysis and immunohistochemistry will be performed.
