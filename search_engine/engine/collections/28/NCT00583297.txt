      by a T wave alternans (TWA) test, measured non-invasively during exercise, is equivalent to
      therapy directed by an electrophysiological study (EPS) in predicting spontaneous ventricular
      tachyarrhythmic events (VTEs) in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular
      dysfunction, and asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). In the absence of
      any previous life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (i.e., for primary prevention), ICD
      implantation is currently indicated in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular
      dysfunction, asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and a positive EPS. The
      objective of this study is to demonstrate that a TWA test directed therapy is equivalent to
      EPS directed therapy in guiding ICD implantation for the purpose of primary prevention of
      sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with ischemic heart disease, left ventricular
      dysfunction, and asymptomatic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
