      radical prostatectomy. Nonetheless, approximately 30,000 men annually in the U.S. develop
      recurrence of their prostate cancer after prostatectomy. Radiation therapy is commonly
      utilized as attempted salvage treatment for patients who develop a rising PSA (Prostate
      Specific Antigen) after prostatectomy and have no evidence of metastatic disease. This study
      is designed to determine whether concurrent chemotherapy, weekly docetaxel, and daily
      radiation therapy will result in improved disease control and survival rates over those
      obtained with radiotherapy alone in the treatment of men with biochemical recurrence after
      radical prostatectomy.
