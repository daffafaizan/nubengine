      when biomarker assay validation is complete. In Cohort 1, participants who have received at
      least two prior therapies for their advanced disease will receive monotherapy with
      pembrolizumab. In Cohort 2, participants who have not received any previous therapy for their
      disease will receive pembrolizumab in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU or (Japan only)
      capecitabine. In Cohort 3, participants who have not received any previous therapy and who
      have programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors will receive pembrolizumab
      monotherapy.
