      of acupuncture with or without CHM on the live birth of IVF. The randomization process will
      be coordinated through a central mechanism. A total of 2,728 subjects will be randomized in
      1:1:1:1 ratio in to one of the four treatment arms: 1) acupuncture and CHM, 2) acupuncture
      and placebo CHM, 3) control acupuncture and CHM or 4) control acupuncture and placebo CHM.
      Women will receive acupuncture or control acupuncture three times a week 4 weeks prior to IVF
      during ovarian stimulation, and before and after the embryo transfer. They will also take CHM
      or placebo CHM daily 4 weeks prior to IVF till a negative pregnancy test or till 8 weeks of
      gestation if pregnant.
