    
      The objectives of this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose escalation study
      are a) to determine if adding dexmedetomidine to symptom-triggered, standard therapy of
      severe alcohol withdrawal reduces the dose requirements of conventional sedatives,
      analgesics, and neuroleptics; maintains patient comfort and safety; and prevents and shortens
      tracheal intubation; b) to explore whether dexmedetomidine acts in a dose-dependent manner to
      reduce the dose requirements of conventional sedatives, analgesics, and neuroleptics while
      maintaining patient comfort; and c) determine the association between alcohol withdrawal and
      potential serum biomarkers of alcohol withdrawal and assess whether these are expressed
      differently when dexmedetomidine is used as adjunctive therapy. Dexmedetomidine will be added
      to existing sedative therapies in an effort to decrease the use of these agents while
      maintaining patient comfort. The study will randomize twenty-four patients in a double-blind
      manner to receive placebo or dexmedetomidine at doses of 0.4 or 1.2 Âµg/kg per hour for a
      maximum duration of five days. All patients will be managed using an existing
      institution-specific, symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal protocol.
