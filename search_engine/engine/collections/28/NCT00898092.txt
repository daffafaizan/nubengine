        -  Validate, on the larger number of patients with karyotypically normal acute myeloid
           leukemia (AML) treated uniformly on CALGB-19808, preliminary results from CALGB-9621
           showing that BAALC and ERG overexpression and microarray gene-expression signatures can
           stratify the patients prognostically.

        -  Establish whether microRNAs are differentially expressed in subsets of patients with AML
           and normal cytogenetics, and, if so, attempt to identify a signature that stratifies
           patients prognostically.

        -  Explore the relative contribution in predicting clinical outcome of patients with
           cytogenetically normal AML using genetic markers such as BAALC, ERG, and EVI1
           overexpression, MLL partial tandem duplication, FLT3 internal tandem duplication, NPM1
           and CEBPA mutations, and microarray gene expression microRNA signatures.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are analyzed to assess gene expression using
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcriptase-PCR assays and microarray assays.
      Genes to be studied include BAALC, ERB, EVI1, MLL, FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
