      I. Demonstrate feasibility of obtaining adequate tumor tissue from an intra-prostatic index
      lesion prior to the start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and again at the time of
      high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Use immunohistochemistry to stain cells pre-ADT and post 2 months of ADT for markers of
      non-homologous end joining and DNA double strand breaks using the following markers: Ku70,
      Ku80, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunits (PKCs), gamma-histone family, member X
      (H2AX).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo biopsy at baseline before start of ADT and during brachytherapy.
