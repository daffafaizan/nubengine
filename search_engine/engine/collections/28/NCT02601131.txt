      Hospital (SUS) in Lund, Sweden with a central venous catheter or port-a-cath and should
      receive platelet transfusion due to thrombocytopenia are asked to participate in the study.
      Some patients who are being considered for platelet transfusions on several occasions will be
      able to attend more than one time in this study. After signed informed consent blood samples
      are drawn from the central line before, immediately after and then approximately. 1, 4, 8, 16
      and 24 hours following the platelet transfusion. The platelet count (PLC) will then be taken
      daily following 4 days.

      Sample size. Data from previous studies (Norol-98) shows that the PLC after platelet
      transfusion rises by 33 ± 25 x109/L (mean ± SD) 12 hours post-transfusion in patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia or pre-conditioning prior to bone marrow transplantation. The
      investigators want to show the same rise in the PLC after 12 hours with 80% power and 5%
      alpha risk of error for each group resulting in the sample size 13 per group and a total of
      65 patients.
