      Irinotecan based Fluoropyrimidine containing regimen Â± bevacizumab and had a progression
      subsequently, are eligible for this study. Patients will be randomized to receive
      chemotherapy (FOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) + sorafenib 400 mg bid or chemotherapy + placebo. Patients
      who have received an Oxaliplatin based Fluoropyrimidine containing regimen in first-line will
      obtain FOLFIRI during this study. Patients who have received an Irinotecan based
      Fluoropyrimidine containing regimen in first-line will obtain FOLFOX6.

      Primary objective of the study is to compare the Progression-free-survival (PFS) between
      patients receiving chemotherapy (FOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) + sorafenib with chemotherapy + placebo.
