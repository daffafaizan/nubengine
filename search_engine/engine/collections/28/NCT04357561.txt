    
      30 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients, who had surgery indication and aged between
      10-18 years, will be included. The participants will be randomised into two groups. 15
      patients will be included in the exercise group and 15 patients in the control group. In the
      exercise group, a total of 12 sessions of exercise are planned, 6 weeks before the surgery
      and 2 days per week. In the control group, the exercise protocol will not be performed before
      surgery.

      The outcomes will include the cosmetic deformity, quality of life, pain level, functional
      capacity, spine flexibility. In the exercise group, the evaluations will be made in the first
      interview (before exercise application), at the end of 6 weeks of exercise (when the exercise
      program is completed), in the early postoperative period and 12 weeks after surgery.
      Evaluations in the control group will be carried out at the first interview, at the 6th week,
      in the early postoperative period, and at the 12th week postoperatively.
