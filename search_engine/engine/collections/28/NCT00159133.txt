    
      In case of early signs of a relapse prodrome based early intervention with an antipsychotic
      drug (Haloperidol, Risperidone and other) vs. benzodiazepine (Lorazepam) was applied in
      patients with first episode schizophrenia after one year neuroleptic maintenance treatment.
      Two groups of patients were followed over a period of 1 year: one further on under
      maintenance neuroleptic treatment (Haloperidol, Risperidone and other) , the other one after
      stepwise drug discontinuation.
