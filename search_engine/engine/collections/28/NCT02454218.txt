      Methods: This study deals with a randomized, blind, crossover, controlled tDCS-sham. The
      sample will consist of 40 patients, divided into two groups with sham interventions and
      active crossover. Patients answer the questionnaires in order to verify the Psychological
      Factors and Clinical. Will use the Impact of Fibromyalgia (QIF), Pittsburgh Sleep
      Questionnaire, Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM), Beck Depression Scale II, Catastrophic
      Scale , Go noGo Test, Attention Network Task (ANT) to verify the ability attentional as well
      as to verify the Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) brain oxygenation. They will be used
      before, during and after the intervention with tDCS. Intervention with tDCS or sham will be
      held in a single session. Expected results: It is expected that fibromyalgia patients
      undergoing tDCS present, after the intervention, improved attention capacity .
