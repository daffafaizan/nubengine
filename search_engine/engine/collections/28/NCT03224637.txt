      years. OA decreased health-related quality of life and increased economic costs.
      Radiofrequency (RF), was used for the treatment of chronic pain unresponsive to conservative
      therapies. RF has been used for several painful conditions. There have been a few attempts to
      use RF current for the treatment of painful conditions of joints of the extremities. It was
      also used for the treatment of painful conditions of the hip joint.
