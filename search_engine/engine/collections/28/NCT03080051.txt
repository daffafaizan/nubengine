    
      The overall goal of this imaging trial is to evaluate [18F]MNI-952 (also known as
      [18F]UCB-K), a tau targeted PET radioligand.

        -  To characterize [18F]MNI-952, a PET radioligand for imaging tau.

        -  To visually and quantitatively assess brain uptake and pharmacokinetics of [18F]MNI-952,
           a PET imaging marker for tau pathology in individuals with Progressive Supranuclear
           Palsy (PSP) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and compare with healthy volunteers (HV).

        -  To evaluate the safety of a single injection of [18F]MNI-952.

        -  To compare the distribution of tau (using [18F]MNI-952) and AÃ¢ (using florbetapir) in AD
           subjects.
