    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized study. Women with a singleton, vertex
      gestation between 24-42 weeks gestations presenting for labor induction will be offered
      participation in this study. Patients who receive prenatal care at Christiana Care may be
      approached if an induction of labor is scheduled and consented at their prenatal visit. All
      indications for induction will be included except those specifically mentioned as exclusion
      criteria. Any contraindication for vaginal delivery would exclude the subject. After informed
      consent is obtained, the Foley catheter will be placed and the subject will be randomized to
      receive oxytocin (study group) or not (control group). After Foley catheter removal or
      expulsion, the remainder of the induction course was left to the discretion of the primary
      provider. Prior to randomization, the subject will be placed into the nulliparous or
      multiparous group.
