      will randomize patients with MDS, treatment na√Øve elderly AML, and relapsed/refractory AML
      patients to receive the BED or MTD dose. Relapsed/refractory AML patients may also receive
      SGI-110 on a daily x 10 schedule based on the total dose per cycle evaluated in the Dose
      Escalation Segment using the 5-daily regimen.
