      electronic diary of their migraine episodes. During a migraine episode, as well as the time
      in between headaches, the PDA prompts the participant to answer questions. Each evening, the
      participant will place the PDA into an electronic telephone cradle, and the information will
      be transmitted electronically from the PDA to the data management team to assess the
      frequency of migraine episodes and participant proficiency with the PDA. During this one
      month period, the participant must experience at least one migraine with aura episode to
      enter the Treatment Phase.

      After one month, the participant will return to the clinic with their PDA and will enter the
      Treatment Phase to be randomized to either the TMS only group or the Sham stimulation only
      group. Participant will enter information into the PDA for three migraine auras treated or
      three months, which ever comes first.
