      and mixed. Some studies suggested that an important role is played by the immune response to
      surgery. The inflammatory response could contribute to the development of postoperative
      cognitive decline (POCD0 through secretion of cortisol, cytokines, and other inflammatory
      mediators. Comparing the effects of general and spinal anesthesia on pregnant patients
      undergoing an elective cesarean section, found no cognitive change after both anesthesias.
      Our observational comparative study will be carried out at Beni Suef University Hospital. We
      will compare early cognitive functions undergoing general anesthesia in patients undergoing
      elective and emergency cesarean section.
