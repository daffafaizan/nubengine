      concentrations, although this is of lesser magnitude in SG compared to RYGB. Data suggests
      that endogenous GLP-1 is at least partially responsible for reducing free-choice caloric
      intake after RYGB, providing a mechanism underlying differences between procedures.
      Inhibition of GLP-1 action with Exendin-9,39 after RYGB accelerates gastric emptying. These
      observations suggest that factors other than anatomy regulate the upper gastrointestinal
      response to food ingestion. It is therefore reasonable to consider that the postprandial rise
      in GLP-1 might affect feeding behavior after RYGB, and to a lesser extent SG, where the
      increase in GLP-1 is less marked.
