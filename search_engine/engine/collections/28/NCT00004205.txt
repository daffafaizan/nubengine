        -  Compare adjuvant letrozole vs tamoxifen administered for 5 years in postmenopausal women
           with operable, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

        -  Compare these treatment regimens given sequentially vs continuously in this patient
           population.

        -  Compare these treatment regimens in terms of overall survival, disease-free and
           systemic-free survival, safety, and tolerability in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to adjuvant chemotherapy (prior therapy vs no prior or concurrent therapy vs
      concurrent therapy), prior surgery (modified radical mastectomy vs a lesser surgical
      procedure), and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant oral letrozole daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive adjuvant oral tamoxifen daily for 2 years followed by adjuvant
           oral letrozole daily for 3 years.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive adjuvant oral letrozole daily for 2 years followed by adjuvant
           oral tamoxifen daily for 3 years.

      Patients may receive concurrent radiotherapy. Some patients receive concurrent adjuvant
      chemotherapy beginning within 8 weeks after surgery and continuing for no more than 6 months.

      Patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5,180 patients (1,295 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 6 years.
