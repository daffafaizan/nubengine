      and greater than 12,000 died from the disease. Kidney cancer that has spread to other parts
      of the body is one of the most treatment-resistant diseases. Standard of care treatment
      usually involves chemotherapy. Results from chemotherapy have been disappointing. Therefore,
      there is a need to develop additional safe and effective therapies to treat advanced kidney
      cancer.

      Sorafenib (NexavarÂ®) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced kidney
      cancer. Sorafenib works by interfering with a type of protein in your body that determines
      how your kidney cells work and grow. Sorafenib at standard doses for 400mg(two pills)
      twice/day, given seven days/week, may slow progression of the disease for an average of three
      months but it is not expected to be curative. Preliminary studies have suggested higher doses
      of sorafenib may increase the chance that the tumor will shrink.
