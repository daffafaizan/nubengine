      effects and toxicities. Remifentanil shares characteristics with N2O, including
      anesthetic-reducing and antinociceptive effects and a rapid recovery. Anesthetic requirements
      and stress hormone response in SCI patients undergoing anesthesia with sevoflurane
      supplemented with clinically equivalent doses of either N2O or remifentanil. Forty-five SCI
      patients scheduled to undergo pressor sore surgery below the level of the injury are randomly
      allocated to receive either sevoflurane alone (control, n=15), or combined with 67% N2O
      (n=15) or target-controlled infusions of 1.37 ng/mL remifentanil (n=15). Sevoflurane
      concentration is titrated to maintain a Bispectral Index (BIS) value of 40-50. Measurements
      include end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate
      (HR), and plasma catecholamine and cortisol concentrations.
