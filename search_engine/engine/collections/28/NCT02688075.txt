      site) study to evaluate the treatment of T2DM with canagliflozin in a usual clinical practice
      in Canada. Approximately 535 participants will be enrolled into this study. The planned study
      duration for each participant will be 12 months [plus or minus (+/-) 4 weeks], including 4
      study visits in accordance with the usual clinical practice: enrollment and visits at 3, 6
      and 12 months (+/- 4 weeks). Participants will primarily be observed for effectiveness,
      safety and PRO over an observational period of 12 months.
