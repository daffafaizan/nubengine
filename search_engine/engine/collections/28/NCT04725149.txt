      effects that can be beneficial for improving recovery from exercise. However, the
      investigator is currently not aware of how tart cherry polyphenol supplementation produces
      these effects. This study aims to determine the dose-response effects of 10-day tart cherry
      product consumption (placebo, 30 ml, and 60 ml Montmorency tart cherry concentrate in a 500
      ml beverage) on knee extensor isometric strength 24-h and 48-h after muscle damaging exercise
      on supplementation Day 8; on enhancing recovery of other measures of muscle function (single
      leg eccentric and concentric force development and single leg jump height) and muscle
      soreness; on reducing markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in plasma, muscle and
      urine; on inducing signaling in muscle via the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
      (Nrf2) pathway to upregulate endogenous antioxidant enzymes in muscle; on inhibiting muscle
      cyclo-oxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

      This study also aims to identify and establish the molecular mechanisms of action through
      which tart cherry polyphenols exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Oxidative
      stress and inflammatory signaling in primary human myogenic cells will be assessed by
      incubating primary human myogenic cells (commercial cell line) in sera derived from 6
      participants consuming 8-day placebo vs. 60 ml/day Montmorency tart cherry concentrate
      supplement. Subjects are permitted to participate in both the molecular mechanism of action
      part of the study (Part A, no exercise component) and the damaging exercise muscle recovery
      part of the study (Part B).
