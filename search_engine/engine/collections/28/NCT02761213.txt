      have demonstrated that many clinical practices continue to have rates of adequate preparation
      as low as 60% to 80%.

      Low-volume preparations for colonoscopy are designed to improve patient tolerability, another
      important aspect of bowel preparation. In addition, low-volume preparations should ideally
      not sacrifice efficacy. There are few data comparing the efficacy of available low-volume
      bowel preparations.

      In this study, we describe a prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial
      comparing oral sulfate solution (OSS) (SUPREP, Braintree Laboratories, Braintree, Mass) with
      low-dose polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (2-L PEG/Asc).
