    
      1. To assess ventricular volumes in the fasting state and after oral hydration in order to
           assess the effect of fluid status on ventricular volumes as measured by CMR.

        2. To evaluate the effect of hydration on ventricular volumes compared the effect of with
           inter-observer and intra-observer variability.

        3. To evaluate the effects of chamber volume on chamber deformation, including strain and
           peak strain rate.
