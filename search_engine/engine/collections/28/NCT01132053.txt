      outcome for PML patients and the role of inflammation in preventing JCV from causing brain
      disease. One of the goals of this study is to help establish non-invasive markers of PML
      evolution by studying the brain metabolism in PML lesions using Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI), Magnetic Spectroscopy (MRS) and other advanced imaging modalities.
