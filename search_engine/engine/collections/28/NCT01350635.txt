    
      BM32 is a hypoallergenic grass pollen allergy vaccine which consists of an aluminum
      hydroxide-adsorbed equimolar mix of four active ingredients, BM321, BM322, BM325 and BM326.
      The four active ingredients are purified recombinant proteins containing non-allergenic
      peptides from the four major timothy grass pollen allergens, Phl p 1 (BM321), Phl p 2
      (BM322), Phl p 5 (BM325) and Phl p 6 (BM326) which are fused to the PreS domain of hepatitis
      B virus, a protein used in childhood vaccines. BM32 holds promise not to induce IgE mediated
      immediate type (e.g. anaphylactic reactions) or T-cell mediated late phase side effects
      during immunotherapy.

      The aim of the present skin test study CS-BM32-001 is to evaluate whether the BM32 proteins
      due to their low/absent IgE- and T cell-reactivity exhibit low/no allergenic activity when
      applied by skin prick- and atopy patch testing to grass pollen allergic patients (n=60). This
      study will therefore provide important information for immunotherapy studies based on BM32.
