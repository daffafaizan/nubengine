      with hypertension. The current diagnostic work-up of RVH involves a complex algorithm which
      includes doppler ultrasound, captopril renography and conventional angiography. Because of
      the expense, risk and inconvenience of this workup, patients may not be correctly diagnosed.

      Advances in MR technology present the opportunity to develop a single comprehensive test.
      This would combine an MR angiogram that provides anatomic information about the renal
      arteries, and an MR renogram that provides information about the functional impact of a
      stenosis as a cause of hypertension. Our main purpose is to test MR renography with and
      without an oral angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) combined with MR angiography
      against the reference standard of captopril radionuclide renography. Secondary goals of this
      study are to test whether hypoxia within ischemic kidneys affected by RVH is detectable by
      T2* weighted (Blood oxygen level dependent or BOLD) MRI. This is considered of value since
      such a test of oxygenation would further shorten and simplify the diagnostic MR test.
      Information gained from this study could lead to important changes in the diagnosis and
      pathophysiologic understanding of RVH.
