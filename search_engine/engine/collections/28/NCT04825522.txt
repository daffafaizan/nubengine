      floor by history, clinical examination, and positive imaging findings. The surgeon will
      notify the study coordinator of the potential patient. The study coordinator will introduce
      the trial to the patient and obtain informed consent at the office during the clinic visit or
      his hospital stay. Patient's pre-operative data such as demographics (age and sex), presence
      of comorbidities like diabetes, ischemic heart disease, asthma patients on steroids,
      nutrition status using serum albumin level, and previous posterior spine surgical procedures
      at the operative level will be collected once the patient admitted prior to the procedure.
      The study coordinator will enroll the patient into the trial, and provide the appropriate
      intervention (vancomycin application, or no application) using the closed envelope technique
      of randomization to the neurosurgeon performing the procedure. Patients will also be blinded
      to avoid the placebo effect. All patients will receive the standard systemic antibiotic
      prophylaxis. The duration of the procedure, estimated blood loss, type of the procedure
      (instrumented versus non-instrumented) and the number of levels will be recorded. After the
      intervention, wound infections will be monitored during a follow-up period of 12 weeks from
      the date of surgery. Cultured organisms and subsequent treatments will be recorded. The
      primary outcome is the incidence of infection (either in-patient or in the follow-up). The
      secondary outcome is the development of other complications including Vancomycin related.
