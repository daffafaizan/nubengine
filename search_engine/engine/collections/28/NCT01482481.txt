      Service was used as the data source. NCPSM was identified by clinical records of NANDA and
      NIC nursing taxonomies, and were defined as nursing care based on the following three
      criteria:

      Criterion 1.- A patient's CCR must register valuation data based on Marjory Gordon
      "functional pattern" in at least the following areas:

        -  Health perception

        -  Nutritional-metabolic

        -  Activity-exercise. Criterion 2.- The problems identified and the proper management of
           treatment will be described using coded diagnoses with NANDA.

      Criterion 3.- The nursing interventions carried out by standardized language will be
      registered according to the NIC taxonomy.

      Eligibility criteria for patients were: older than 30 years of age, with previously diagnosed
      diabetes (cardinal clinical, plus random blood glucose >200 mg/dl or oral glucose of >200
      mg/dl at 2 h, twice, or plasma fasting glucose of >126 mg/dl on two occasions or being
      diagnosed previously, received specific treatment for diabetes) and exclusion criteria were:
      gestational diabetes, patients involved in clinical trials, patients with life expectancy of
      less than one year (according to clinical judgment), homebound patients.

      The primary outcome was HbA1c, lipid levels, blood pressure, and BMI after 24 and 48 months
      of follow-up.
