        1. Examine the effects of decision support tools on study outcomes during the 12 months
           prior to project start and across the 3.5 years of the project in NC and SC. The
           investigators will also determine which patient and practice level characteristics
           predict study outcomes.

        2. Evaluate individual provider-reported awareness, use and preference of health
           maintenance tables and algorithms amongst PCPs and ED providers in NC and SC at project
           start and yearly across the project. Additionally, the investigators will explore
           patient reported awareness of and satisfaction with co-management model of care in NC
           and SC.

        3. The investigators will conduct an exploratory cost analysis of the dissemination and
           implementation of the SCD co-management model and its effect on healthcare resource
           utilization.
