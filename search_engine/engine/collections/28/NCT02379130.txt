      neurobiological, sensory, perceptual, emotional, physical, and relational systems (Hofer,
      1987). For the developing infant, one of the most critical sources of regulatory input is
      through contact with the mother and her nurturing behavior. The infant's responses to the
      mother provide feedback that shapes her behavior as well. There are many co-regulatory
      processes embedded in these synchronous and reciprocal interactions which cross
      neurophysiological and neurobehavioral domains (Als, 1999). A necessary but detrimental
      separation between mother and infant is created at a critical period when mother-infant
      co-regulation should be developing. Regardless of NICU or well-baby nursery care, the
      physiological challenges associated with being born too soon, along with disturbances in
      normal mother-infant interactions are key factors underlying the risks of early and late
      preterm infants for a broad range of early and midlife disorders (DeBoer, et al., 1984 if
      this does not include late preterm, find another reference). This study compares common early
      interventions such as occupational, physical, and speech therapy with a Family Nurture
      Intervention (FNI), instituted at age 3 to 4 for preschool aged children with developmental
      delays. This is a developmental time point at which delays including deficits in emotion
      regulation, language, cognition, and attention are identifiable. The investigators
      hypothesize that the Family Nurture Intervention will alter a wide range of physiological
      regulatory capacities and will result in improved indices of mother psychological and child
      neurobehavioral outcomes.
