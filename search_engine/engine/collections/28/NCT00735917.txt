      I. To determine the 6-month survival of biomarker-positive patients with previously treated
      metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving AZD0530 (saracatinib).

      II. To determine the adverse events of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate in patients treated with this drug. II. To evaluate the
      overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III. To explore the pharmacodynamic
      effects of AZD0530 with optional tumor biopsies, pharmacokinetic studies, and positron
      emission tomography (PET) scans in a subset of patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
