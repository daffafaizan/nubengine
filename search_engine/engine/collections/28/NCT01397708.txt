    
      Single-arm, open label, Phase I/II dose escalation study of intratumoral injections INXN-2001
      and oral INXN-1001 in subjects with unresectable Stage III or IV melanoma.

      Four sequential dose escalation cohorts of INXN-1001 in combination with a fixed dose of
      INXN-2001 are planned. Subject enrollment and dose escalation will proceed according to a
      standard 3+3 design.

      Approximately 15 additional subjects will be enrolled as an expansion cohort at a single dose
      level at or below the MTD.

        -  Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse
           events.

        -  The antitumor activity of study treatment will be assessed according to RECIST v1.1
           guidelines. Additional assessment of anti-tumor activity will be explored based on total
           measurable tumor burden.

        -  Immunological and biological markers of response will include examinations of tumor
           biopsy samples, cytokine levels, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and antibody
           response to INXN-2001.
