      alcohol-free emollients used 2-3 times daily, sunscreen with titanium dioxide or zinc oxide
      with a skin protection factor (SPF) greater than 15, topic or oral antibiotic regimens (such
      as clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracyclines) when there is secondary infection as well as
      steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (betamethasone, triamcinolone) and isotretinoin.

      The objective of this project is to evaluate whether the prophylactic treatment with
      tetracycline can reduce dermatological toxicities such as rash, induced by the EGFR and HER-2
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBW 2992 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
