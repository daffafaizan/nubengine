      Patients receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 30 days, every 12
      weeks from baseline for up to 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
