      symptoms and comfort levels in patients with breast cancer in Turkey. The study employs an
      experimental research methodology with a sample of 96 ambulatory patients (48 experimental,
      48 control) who were receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer for the first time in a state
      hospital. Research data were collected by using "Patient Information Form", "Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment Scale", "General Comfort Questionnaire, "Symptoms Follow-up Form", and "Telephone
      Call Form". The experimental group received telenursing service every week until the end of
      the four-cycle chemotherapy treatment, which started one week after the first treatment. The
      control group did not receive any intervention. Investigators analyzed data with SPSS 15.0
      (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) with comparative statistical methods of
      MannWhitney U Test, Chi-Square Test, One Way Analysis of Variance in Repeated Measurements,
      and Pearson Correlation.
