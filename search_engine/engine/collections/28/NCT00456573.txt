      sample and portion of their tonsils after the induction of general anesthesia. The
      mononuclear cells will be isolated from both these tissues and stimulated with different
      markers and cytokines assayed and compared. We will also recruit patients with no symptoms of
      OSA undergoing unrelated elective surgery and ascertain the absence of OSA by having the
      parents fill out a sleep questionnaire. We will then collect blood samples from these
      patients after the induction of anesthesia and examine the cytokine secretion profile and
      compare it to that of the children with OSA.
