      ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function. Studies have show that echocardiographic
      signs of increased LV filling pressure (diastolic dysfunction) are associated with poor
      outcome after AMI. The optimal management of this group of patients is currently not known.
      LCZ696 is a novel combination drug consisting of two antihypertensives, sacubitril and
      valsartan. LCZ696 have demonstrated to reduce mortality in patients with systolic heart
      failure. In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction a positive effect
      has been demonstrated on natriuretic peptides and left atrial remodelling when treated with
      LCZ696, further, experimental data suggest inhibition of cardiac fibrosis.

      Hypothesis:

      LCZ696 compared with placebo will improve central hemodynamics (reduce pulmonary capillary
      wedge pressure (PCWP)), and increase cardiac index (CI) during exercise in patients with
      diastolic dysfunction following AMI. A beneficial effect that is attributed to improved
      cardiac remodelling (attenuation of cardiac fibrosis).

      Primary objective To asses the effect of 6 months treatment with LCZ696 compared with placebo
      on ratio of PCWP/CI during exercise in patients with a recent AMI and Doppler
      echocardiographic signs of diastolic dysfunction and preserved systolic function.
