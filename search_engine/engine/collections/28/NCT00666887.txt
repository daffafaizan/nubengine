        -  Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS): Patients with a first clinical demyelinating event
           suggestive of multiple sclerosis (At baseline participants may meet 2010 McDonald
           diagnostic criteria for MS, but not 2005 criteria)

        -  Men and women, aged 18-60y, first event within the previous 180 days; brain magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) with at least two brain T2 lesions which are at least 3 mm in
           diameter, and at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial.

        -  Up to 24 months of study drug (Up to 12 months of study drug for patients recruited
           after December 31, 2012)

        -  Patients will be discontinued from the study when they convert to McDMS based on the
           2005 McDonald definition.

        -  12 Canadian MS Clinics

        -  A total of 154 patients will be randomized. Because 30% of screened patients with CIS
           who are clinically eligible are not expected to meet the MRI criteria for inclusion, up
           to 280 patients will be screened.
