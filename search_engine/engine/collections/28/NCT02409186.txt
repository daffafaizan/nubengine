      experimental arm will improve median survival time (MST) from 18.2 month to 28.5 month.
      Assuming bilateral É‘ = 0.05, statistical power of 80%.Each group requires a minimum of 59
      cases. Consider the 20% loss factor.The total sample size is 200 cases.It is 100 cases in
      each group.
