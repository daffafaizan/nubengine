    
      The present study is designed to compare open minimal-invasive parathyroid surgery with
      video-assisted parathyroidectomy in pHPT patients with a positive sestamibi scan in a
      multicentre prospective randomized trial.

      In patients randomized to open surgery, a 15 mm transverse skin incision is made close to the
      site of the parathyroid adenoma indicated by sestamibi scintigraphy. In case of an enlarged
      upper parathyroid or dorsally located lower parathyroid, the incision is made anterior to the
      sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) whereas for anterior located lower parathyroids a central
      incision is chosen.

      In patients randomized to a video-assisted approach, the surgeon has the option to choose
      either the lateral- (VAPLA) or medial (MIVAP) techniques, both initiated with a 15 mm
      transverse skin incision.

      Postoperatively the patients receive a questionnaire for selfdocumentation.Variables recorded
      include postoperative pain, hypocalcaemic symptoms, breathing problems, cervical discomforts
      of pressure/globus and voice disturbances. A visual analogue scale (VAS) is used when
      appropriate. The intake of oral analgesics and calcium medication is also recorded. The
      questionnaire is used daily for the first four postoperative days, and thereafter weekly for
      four weeks.

      Follow-up is done at 1 and 6 month after surgery, with measurement of plasma calcium and PTH.
      Continued needs of calcium or vitamin D medication, length of scar, and symptoms or signs of
      complications are recorded. At the six-month follow-up, patients document their opinion of
      the cosmetic results and the remaining neck discomfort using a VAS.

      Primary outcome measures are postoperative pain and operation time. Secondary outcome
      measures are complications, persistent or recurrent disease, conversion rates and cosmetic
      results.
