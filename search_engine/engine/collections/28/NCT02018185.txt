      the treatment of OCD.

      rTMS will be provided to OCD patients in a randomized double blind controlled setting, and
      the investigators hypothesize that in this setting the treatment group would still show
      significant improvement in OCD symptoms as compared to the sham group.

      rTMS will be applied for four weeks on OCD patients and the investigators will assess
      improvement after four weeks of rTMS. The investigators hypothesize that patients will show
      significantly greater improvement after four weeks of rTMS vs. two weeks of rTMS.
