      Furthermore, drug therapy is too expensive for most affected populations. For this reason,
      there is a commitment to the development of safe, effective vaccines to prevent HIV infection
      and AIDS worldwide. This study evaluates the immunogenicity and safety of candidate HIV-1
      vaccines, based on the canarypox vector termed ALVAC, alone and combined with an MN rgp120
      product, at 3 [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: 5] international sites.

      [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: Volunteers in Rio de Janeiro, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago
      comprise Part I; volunteers in Sao Paulo and Peru comprise Part II.] Volunteers from Haiti,
      Brazil, [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: Peru] and Trinidad and Tobago are enrolled into 1 of 3
      arms and followed for 18 months. Arm 1 volunteers receive ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 at 0, 1, 3, and 6
      months. Arm 2 volunteers receive ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 on the same schedule as Arm 1 and receive
      HIV-1 MN rgp120 subunit simultaneously with the 3-month and 6-month vaccine doses. Arm 3
      volunteers receive a placebo. Blood and urine samples are collected for immunologic assays,
      virologic determinations, pregnancy testing, and safety assessments. Risk behavior and social
      harms are assessed every 6 months during follow-up [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: Social harms
      are assessed every 3 months during follow-up and risk behavior every 6 months]. At all clinic
      visits volunteers receive counseling on avoidance of HIV infection and pregnancy.
      Participants are tested for HIV-1 every 3 [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/19/01: the following text has
      been deleted: to 6] months. Counseling and follow-up for any needed medical care are
      provided.
