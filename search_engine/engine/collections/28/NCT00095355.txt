    
      Objective: The overall objective of this study is to examine the acute effects of lithium
      alone and/ or in combination with divalproex on markers of neuroprotective activity in
      patients with Huntington's disease (HD). It is hypothesized that at safe and tolerable doses
      these drugs will enhance depleted levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a
      neurotrophin which is necessary for the survival of striatal neurons.

      Study population: Patients suffering from Huntington's disease will be study participants.

      Design: The acute effects of lithium and divalproex on surrogate measures of neuroprotective
      activity will be evaluated in up to 24 HD patients. The study, lasting approximately 6 weeks,
      will be conducted on an outpatient basis.

      Outcome measures: In this proof-of-principle study, efficacy in restoring BDNF concentrations
      will be assessed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements. Safety will be monitored by
      means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory test.
