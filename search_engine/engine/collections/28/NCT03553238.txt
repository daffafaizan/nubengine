      committed to the T-cell lineage but with an unique immunophenotype indicating only limited
      early T differentiation. In the highly orchestrated development of T cell fate specification
      under physiological condition, the most immature early thymic progenitors (ETPs) retain
      multilineage potentials. ETP-ALL blasts have a characteristic immunophenotype, with
      reduced/absent expression of T-lymphoid markers CD1a, CD5, CD8; and positivity for at least
      one HSC and/or myeloid antigen CD34, CD117, HLA-DR, CD13, CD33, CD11b, CD65. Recent study
      shed light on the genetic landscape of adult ETP-ALL, which revealed that more than 40% adult
      ETP-ALL harbored histone modification mutations. Chidamide is a novel oral HDACi with
      promising activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Based on the pediatric-inspired,
      PEG-L-asparaginase-intensified and MRD-directed PDT-ALL-2016 protocol, this open-label,
      one-arm, multi-site trial is aimed to evaluate the safety and effect of a novel oral histone
      deacetylase inhibitor chidamide for adult ETP-ALL/LBL. HDACi chidamide at a dose of 10mg/day
      will be added to ETP-ALL group from induction therapy to consolidation therapy (total courses
      of chidamide treatment: 5 courses for allo-HSCT after Consolidation Module-3; 12 courses for
      patients non-allo-HSCT after Consolidation Module 1-9). Primary study endpoint of PDT-ETP-ALL
      is event-free survival of ETP-ALL group and secondary study endpoints are complete remission
      and MRD after induction, adverse event and overall survival of ETP-ALL group.
