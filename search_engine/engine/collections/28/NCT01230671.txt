      1-hour hatha yoga classes, once a week for a 12-week period. One class will be offered in
      French, another in English. The class will begin with approximately 10 minutes of pranayama
      (breathing exercises) and meditation, followed by 30 minutes of yoga poses and ending with 10
      minutes of sivasana (rest period.) The first couple of classes in the 12 week series will
      begin with restorative postures and will gradually progress to more gentle exercises. If
      health permits, the last couple of classes will involve some strengthening poses. A small
      portion of the class will work with the physical body in general and there will be a specific
      emphasis on the physical difficulties faced by most breast cancer patients, i.e. neck, chest,
      shoulders arms and hands.
