      without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have multiple myeloma, not
      everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of study drug.
      The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the
      study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses.

      The study drug, cabozantinib, comes in the form of tablets which you will take by mouth. You
      will take your dose of cabozantinib once a day during each 28 day cycle.

      Detailed instructions on how to take the study drug and which foods and drinks you will be
      prohibited from taking during the research study can be found in your study drug diary.

      During Cycle 1, you will come into the clinic weekly (Day 1, 8, 15 and 22). For all other
      cycles, you will come into the clinic on Day 1 and 15.

      A visit will be scheduled 30 days after you have finished or stopped taking the study drug so
      your doctor will be able to check your well being.
