      which 82% are women practitioners. The effects of yoga on the fetus have not been
      demonstrated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute fetal response to yoga
      exercises by assessing fetal well-being via ultrasound and non-stress testing among healthy
      women. The investigators hypothesize that yoga during pregnancy does not have any acute
      negative effects on fetal behavior as assessed by umbilical artery Dopplers and fetal heart
      rate or maternal vital signs.
