      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single agent carfilzomib in patients with
      relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) including angioimmunoblastic T-cell
      lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine
      kinase (ALK)+/ALK-, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma
      (NKL), transformed mycosis fungoides (MF) to large cell, and PTCL-unspecified (PTCL-U).

      II. To assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of single agent carfilzomib in patients
      with relapsed and refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) including angioimmunoblastic
      T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) ALK+/ALK-, adult T-cell
      leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), NK-cell lymphoma (NKL), transformed mycosis fungoides (MF) to large
      cell, and PTCL-unspecified (PTCL-U).

      III. To evaluate nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) activation in PTCL tumor
      tissue and correlate that with response to carfilzomib, a novel proteosome inhibitor, which
      targets NF-kappa B.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and
      16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1, then
      every 4 months for year 2, then every 6 months for years 3 and 4, and then yearly thereafter.
