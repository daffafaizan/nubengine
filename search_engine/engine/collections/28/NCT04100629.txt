    
      The purpose of this randomized control study (RCT) is to determine the impact of a 6-week
      digital support intervention (text messaging) on NLNs' levels of stress, resiliency,
      perceived social support, and ITL (intention to leave) their current jobs. The long-term
      objective is to examine if a 6-week digital support intervention impacts NLNs' (newly
      licensed nurses') ITL during the first year of hire. The central hypothesis is that a digital
      support intervention plays a critical role in NLNs' levels of stress, resilience, perceived
      sense of social support, and ITL their current jobs. In order to be included in this proposed
      study, participants must agree to not use their Smartphones while providing direct patient
      care but may access text messages while in designated break areas or when off duty.

      Research Questions: RQ1: What is the effect of a digital support intervention upon NLNs'
      stress? RQ2: What is the effect of a digital support intervention upon NLNs' resiliency? RQ3:
      What is the effect of a digital support intervention upon NLNs' perceived social support?
      RQ4: What is the effect of a digital support intervention upon NLNs' ITL their first jobs
      during their first year of hire?

      Design (Description of research plan, intervention(s) and time frame): A prospective, RCT
      design with an experimental and control group is proposed for this study to determine if a
      digital support intervention impacts NLNs' stress, resiliency, perceived sense of support,
      and Intention to Leave.
