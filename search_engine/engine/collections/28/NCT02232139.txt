      measures choice reaction time. The participants are instructed to respond by pressing the
      keys 1-4 of the keyboard, corresponding to the numbers, appearing on the screen of computer
      (PDA, SmartPhone). The average of the response latency, measured during the 10 trials is
      usually taken as 4CRT outcome.
