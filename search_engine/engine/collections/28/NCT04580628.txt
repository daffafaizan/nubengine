      management of benign prostate hypertrophy, the holmium:Yag laser is currently the most widely
      used. A new laser technology, the fibrous thulium laser (TFL), has recently appeared with
      clearly superior results for lithotripsy. The question therefore arises of the surgical and
      functional results of the use of fibrous thulium for prostate enucleation.
