    
      Briefly, during a one to two hour visit, subjects will provide written informed consent and
      then undergo:

        1. brief medical history and vital signs,

        2. full pulmonary function tests,

        3. proton MRI,

        4. spin-density and/or diffusion weighted 129Xe MRI.

      Full pulmonary function tests including spirometry, plethysmography and diffusing capacity of
      carbon monoxide (DLCO), Lung Clearance Index (LCI) and Airwave Oscillometry (AO) will be
      performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. MedGraphics Elite Series,
      MedGraphics Corporation. St. Paul, Minnesota USA and/or nDD EasyOne Spirometer, nDD Medical
      Technologies Inc. Andover, Massachusetts USA will be used. All measurements will be performed
      in the Pulmonary Function Laboratory at Robarts Research Institute.

      Subjects will be placed in the 3T Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanner with the 129Xe chest coil
      fitted over their torso and chest. Hearing protection will be provided to each subject to
      muffle the noise produced by the gradient radiofrequency (RF) coils. A pulse oximeter lead
      will be attached to all of the subjects to monitor their heart rate and oxygen saturation.
      MRI will be performed for up to a period of 30 minutes. All subjects will have supplemental
      oxygen available via nasal cannula at a flow-rate of 2 liters per minute as a precaution in
      the event of oxygen desaturation.
