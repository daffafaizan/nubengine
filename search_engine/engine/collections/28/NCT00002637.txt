      prostate carcinoma cells genetically engineered to secrete interleukin-2 and interferon gamma
      in patients with prostate carcinoma. II. Evaluate the antitumor effects of this treatment as
      assessed by post-therapy declines in PSA. III. Evaluate the induction of cellular and humoral
      immunity in vivo with this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Tumor Cell Vaccine Therapy. Immunization with irradiated, MHC class I-matched
      allogeneic human prostate carcinoma cells, LNCaP cells, engineered to secrete approximately
      58 ng/24 hr/million cells of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and approximately 0.72 U/24 hr/million
      cells of interferon gamma (IFN-G).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 12 patients will be entered on the Phase I study; accrual will
      continue to a total of 25 patients treated at the MTD (Phase II). Accrual is expected to
      require 2 years.
