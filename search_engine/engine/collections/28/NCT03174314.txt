      in real-time (enhanced scene interpretation for multi-object identification). And based on
      that, human-centered simulation trials and experiments for feasibility and efficacy of the
      platform's tactile and auditory 'communication' outputs will be conducted. Finally auditory
      and tactile 'prompts' (system output) based on the end user's immediate needs based on
      initial testing results, will be integrated into the platform.
