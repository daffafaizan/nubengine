      maintenance treatment, which compare to capecitabine conventional chemotherapy, who have
      responded to 16-18 months first-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The
      maintenance treatments are continued until disease progression or severe toxicity. The aim of
      this study is to demonstrate that capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy is non-inferior to
      capecitabine conventional chemotherapy. Furthermore, exploratory markers involving
      angiogenesis (serum VEGF, PDGF, Tie-1 and Tie2, etc) and immune function (CD clusters, serum
      tumor mutation burden(TMB), etc), are conducted via liquid biopsy.
