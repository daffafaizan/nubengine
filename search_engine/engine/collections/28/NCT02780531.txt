      Contributions likely come from both inherited and environmental factors. Amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis ("ALS") is a prototypical example. In 5-10% of cases, genetic mutations exert a
      strong enough influence on disease development that the syndrome is transmitted in a clearly
      Mendelian fashion. Investigations in these "familial" ALS cases have identified more than 20
      causative disease genes. Intensive study of these genes has helped identify several key
      cellular pathways as important for disease, not only in cases with obvious gene mutations,
      but even in the 90% of ALS cases that appear to be "sporadic." Further insights have come
      from investigating blood biomarkers in ALS such as gene and protein expression and lymphocyte
      profiling. It is hoped that further genetic and biomarker analysis will identify additional
      genetic risk factors or biomarkers to better understand the disease and improve therapeutic
      development. These advances can be applied not just to ALS but to the broad range of
      neurological and neuromuscular diseases, including Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy, the
      muscular dystrophies, epilepsies, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.
