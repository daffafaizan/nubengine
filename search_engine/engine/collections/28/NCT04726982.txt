      into one of the following treatment arms: (1) 250 mg of acetazolamide; (2) 500 mg of
      acetazolamide divided in two separate doses; (3) 500 mg of acetazolamide administered in a
      single dose. After 4 weeks, treatment outcome will be assessed by in-laboratory
      polysomnography. Additionally, arterial blood gas analysis will be performed before and
      during treatment.
