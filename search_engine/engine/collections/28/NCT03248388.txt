      use the Orcam device with and without the Argus II. After a half-day interactive training
      session with the Orcam device, the investigators will interview the subject with a
      questionnaire. The investigators will then contact the subject every two weeks via a
      telephone call for two months (4 phone interviews). The investigators will then ask the
      subject to return to Mayo Clinic to demonstrate their ability to use the Argus II and Orcam
      together and separately. These sessions will be videotaped.
