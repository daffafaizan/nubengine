      pressing need for effective and cost-efficient models of early intervention (EI) services.
      Many EI systems are struggling to meet the needs of the increasing number of families of
      children with ASD. In rural areas, there is a shortage of EI therapists, and the distances to
      reach families results in an inefficient use of professional time and research shows that
      rural families of children with ASD receive fewer EI services, which has detrimental effects
      on children's developmental trajectories. If occupational therapy interventions for young
      children with ASD utilize innovative methods of service delivery in rural areas,
      investigators can increase the number of families that receive services thereby positively
      influencing child and family outcomes. Therefore, investigators propose to test the
      acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and efficacy of a 12 week telehealth intervention for
      families of young children with ASD.
