      index test (MDW) against different reference standards (operational definitions). One of
      these references identifies a situation when IV antibiotics need to start (i.e. sepsis
      diagnosis) and the other, a situation when they need to be discontinued (i.e. clinical
      improvement).

      One reference standard will be Sepsis 3 definition and will be operationalised in ED using
      qSOFA â‰¥ 2. This is used in ED as a bedside score to identify patients with suspected sepsis.

      As part of the exploratory objectives for this ED dataset, sepsis will be operationalised
      using other common scores (SOFA, NEWS2, REDS, and Simplified-MISSED scores), and also against
      the reference standard for confirming septicaemia (blood culture results).

      The second reference standard will be expert clinical criteria. Antimicrobial stewardship
      groups and care team review antibiotic treatments for all inpatients at regular intervals.
      Decisions on whether discontinuation (due to clinical improvement) is indicated is ultimately
      based on clinical criteria.

      As part of the exploratory objectives for the dataset of in-patients, sepsis will be
      operationalised using the results of blood cultures. Also, different subpopulations will be
      described on the basis of MDW levels:

        -  Hospitalised patients admitted through ED but not in the sepsis pathway.

        -  Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI), surgical operations, and IV antibiotic treatment
           modification due to lack of clinical improvement and/or antibiotic resistance.

        -  Non-bacterial causes of septic syndrome (i.e. surgical tissue injury, myocardial
           infraction, pancreatitis, pulmonary-thromboembolism, influenza, RSV, autoimmune and
           neoplastic processes).
