      birth weight (< 2.5 kg) term infants born in a large government hospital catering to a
      low-middle income population in Delhi. Mothers and infants are recruited at delivery and
      given weekly vitamin D supplements or placebo until 6 months of age. Data on infant
      morbidity, sun exposure and diet, with particular emphasis on breast milk and other milk
      intake, is collected by fieldworkers visiting the homes each fortnight. Mothers are
      encouraged to bring their infants to the hospital in case of any illness and at these visits
      the infant is seen by the project doctor who treats the infant and records additional
      morbidity data. At 6 months blood samples are being collected from a 20% random subsample of
      infants for measurement of 25OHD and indicators of immune activation. The primary outcome is
      mortality or incidence of any illness requiring admission to hospital.
