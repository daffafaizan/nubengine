      three groups that contained 50 parturients each via www.randomization.com.

      Group C (control group): 10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% (2 ml) + 100γ morphine (1ml) + 2.5
      γ sufentanil (0.5ml) + 1 ml physiological saline.

      Group Mg (magnesium sulfate group): 10 mg hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.5% (2 ml) + 100γ Morphine
      (1ml) + 2.5 γ sufentanil (0.5ml) + 100 mg MgSO4 (1 ml).

      Group MDZ (midazolam group): 10 mg hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.5% (2 ml) + 100γ Morphine (1ml) +
      2.5 γ Sufentanil (0.5ml) + 2mg Midazolam (0.4 + 0.6cc physiological saline (1 ml)).

      The parturients as well as the anesthetist who evaluated the protocol did not know the nature
      of the adjuvant injected in spinal anesthesia. The presented syringe contained one of the two
      adjuvants or the physiological serum in the same volume and of the same appearance. It was
      prepared by an anesthesist who was not included in the analysis of the study and was
      presented anonymously to the anesthetist in charge of the patient. A postoperative monitoring
      (PO) was performed during the first 24 hours in the intensive care unit by the anesthesist
      who did not know the nature of the injected adjuvant. All patients were kept nil per os for
      six hours prior to surgery.
