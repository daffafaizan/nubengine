    
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, RCT designed to collect patient outcome data on
      two commercially available SOC treatments for DFUs. The trial will be single blinded in
      regard to wound healing assessment (another clinician, other than the investigator at each
      site will assess wound healing) and confirmation of wound healing will be overseen by an
      independent adjudication committee made up of wound care experts. The study will last twelve
      weeks, with a two week screening period prior to enrollment.

      There are two standard of care arms in the study:

      Arm 1: The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact
      casting [TCC] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM), appropriate sharp or surgical
      debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement)
      and wound care covering with bioactive resorbable glass fiber dressing, MIRRAGENâ„¢Advanced
      Wound Matrix, followed by a padded 3-layer dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll
      and compressive wrap (DynaflexTM or equivalent).

      Arm 2: The SOC therapy in this study is offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact
      casting [TCC] if the subject's foot is too large for a CAM), appropriate sharp or surgical
      debridement, infection management (systemic antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement)
      and wound care covering with calcium alginate Fibracol dressing followed by a padded 3-layer
      dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, soft roll and compressive wrap (DynaflexTM or
      equivalent).
