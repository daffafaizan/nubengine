      rapidly absorbed into the airway because of their lipophilic chemical characteristics.
      However, the majority of the currently used β2-adrenergic bronchodilators cannot freely
      diffuse across the epithelial cell membrane because of their transient or permanent positive
      charge at physiological pH. Inhaled albuterol, a β2-adrenergic agonist used widely for the
      treatment of obstructive airway disease, is charged positively in neutral or acidic
      conditions and thus requires active transport across the airway epithelium. Previous studies
      in the lab have shown that albuterol uptake into airway epithelia occurs via a pH sensitive
      cation transporter (OCTN2). The vasodilator response to an inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist
      could be an expression of epithelial cation transport. The investigators propose that the
      magnitude and duration of vasodilation in the airway caused by an inhaled hydrophilic
      β2-adrenergic agonist such as albuterol may be altered by changes in airway pH. The purpose
      of this protocol is to determine the effect of ASL pH on the response of Qaw to inhaled
      albuterol by manipulating airway pH through ventilatory maneuvers in health subjects:
      hyperventilation to raise pH and ventilation with CO2 bleed-in to lower pH.
