    
      Objective:

      An increasing body of preclinical literature suggests a role of the gut microbiota in a wide
      range of medical disorders, including neuropsychiatric diseases like autism, anxiety, and
      depression. Preliminary studies have reported alterations in microbiota composition,
      inflammation, and intestinal permeability in alcohol-dependent patients. However, there is
      little research on the association between these alterations and behavioral outcomes
      associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD), such as alcohol craving and drinking. The main
      goal is to investigate gut microbiota differences in current drinking versus abstinent
      individuals with AUD, and whether microbial profiles are correlated with alcohol cue-induced
      craving. Finally, another goal of this project will be to conduct preliminary translational
      bed-to-bench work using rodent models of excessive alcohol use via collaborations with basic
      science laboratories.

      Study population:

      Alcohol use disorder participants (current drinkers and abstinent) and healthy controls.

      Study Design:

      Between subject, observational study

      Outcome measures:

      We will compare the gut microbiota of AUD participants who have been abstinent to that of
      current drinkers. In addition, we will further compare the gut microbiota of these two groups
      to a third group of healthy controls with no prior or current diagnosis of AUD. The secondary
      aim of this study is to examine whether the overall microbial community composition, function
      and individual taxa correlate with alcohol cue-induced craving.
