      and clinical outcomes study is designed to determine which VNS Therapy titration paradigm
      allows more patients to achieve a therapeutic dose within a specified time frame.
      Additionally, the study will collect data on the acute tolerability and clinical outcomes for
      patients with drug-resistant epilepsy treated with adjunctive VNS Therapy employing three
      different titration paradigms.
