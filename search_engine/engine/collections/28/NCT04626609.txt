    
      Prostaglandin D2 and E2 receptors, and components of the endocannabinoid system (cannabinoid
      receptors and endocannabinoid-metabolizing enzymes) are examined in mucosal esophageal
      biopsies and blood leukocytes from EoE patients (acute and in remission), individuals with
      gastroesophageal reflux and from individuals with no esophageal disease. Expression of these
      components are compared between all cohorts by polymerase chain reaction, Western blots, flow
      cytometry and immunohistochemical methods. EoE disease activity is evaluated by determining a
      symptom score and the number of eosinophils per high-power field (hpf) in histologic sections
      of mucosal biopsies. Additionally, an Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) is used. Disease
      activity is correlated with cannabinoid/prostaglandin D2 and E2 receptor expression. Blood is
      collected and immediately processed for flow cytometric experiments. Prostaglandins and
      endocannabinoids are measured in plasma and esophageal mucosal biopsy samples of all cohorts
      by mass spectrometry.
