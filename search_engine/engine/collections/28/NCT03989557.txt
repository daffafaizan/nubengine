      antiplatelet therapy (100mg aspirin + 75mg clopidogrel) is considered to be the most
      effective antiplatelet regimen in reducing ischemic complications. However, despite the use
      of standard antiplatelet therapy, a number of patients continue to have ischemic events. A
      hypothesis is that high platelet reactivity (HPR) patients identified by platelet function
      test have higher ratio of the ischemic events, and dose adjustment of HPR patients reduces
      the rate of the ischemic complications at early periprocedural period and follow-up period.

      Objectives: The study aim to evaluated the superiority of the strategy of platelet function
      test(Monitoring Arm) with the modified strategy in HPR patients compared to the standard
      strategy (Conventional Arm) whether reduce the primary endpoint after intracranial stent
      implantation at early periprocedural period (7 days) and 1 months follow-up period.
