      pathogenesis of Uremic Pruritus is unknown, therefore treatments are ineffective. According
      to several studies Uremic Pruritus is not an isolated skin disease. It seems to be a systemic
      inflammatory disease with a deranged balance of T helper cell differentiation. In this study
      investigators considered to evaluate effect of Fumaria Parviflora L. in uremic pruritus by a
      double blind placebo control clinical trial. It is hypothesized that oral Fumaria Parviflora
      L. may minimize uremic pruritus by decreasing serum Interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) and
      high-sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP).
