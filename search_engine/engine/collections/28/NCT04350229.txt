      drugs such as anthracyclines and taxanes and its main side effects described are cardiac
      toxicity and hypersensitivity and / or allergic reactions, respectively. Dexamethasone is a
      drug that is part of the arsenal of pre-chemotherapy medications to prevent adverse events
      resulting from treatment, however common endocrine pathological conditions resulting from
      high doses of this corticoid are clinically evident in these individuals.

      These changes certainly have a negative impact on the patient's quality of life, however,
      with early recognition and the treatment of hypercortisolemia, we can lead to a reduction in
      morbidity and mortality in cancer patients.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the omission of corticosteroid doses as
      pre-medication in cancer treatment after the second week of treatment with taxane in a
      setting with curative intent can prevent or decrease the incidence of endocrinological
      changes, and what is its impact on treatment and on quality of life of the patient.

      This is a prospective, randomized clinical study, without blinding as a research strategy
      used to increase the validity of clinical trials that evaluate the effect of interventions
      (eg, drugs or exercise). The process involves randomly assigning participants to an
      intervention group or to a control group and requires that participants have an equal chance
      of being allocated to either group.

      Will be recruited 86 patients diagnosed with breast cancer with indication for neoadjuvant or
      adjuvant treatment with the standard ICESP protocol.
