      These lesions are identified on imaging before surgery and then during the operation, but
      they are macroscopically inconsistent on genuine unstable shoulders. While the importance of
      posterior capsuloligamentous structures (soft tissue) in antero-inferior stability has been
      the subject of biomechanical studies, the soft tissue has not been the subject of
      histological studies, as has the "bare area" or zone devoid of cartilage, the exact role of
      which in glenohumeral biomechanics is unknown. However, this research is based on the
      hypothesis that the antipodal lesions are constant, underestimated and that an architectural
      disorganization at the capsulo-ligament level could contribute to the instability of the
      shoulder. The aim of this study is therefore to better characterize these lesions which could
      be the subject of a complementary stabilization procedure even in the absence of a humeral
      notch.
