    
      NP10679 is a pH dependent inhibitor of the GluN2B subtype of the NMDA receptor. Compounds of
      this drug class are hypothesized to be beneficial in a number of central nervous system
      disorders, including brain ischemia associated with stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, severe
      pain, major depression and substance abuse disorders. This study uses a double blind,
      adaptive design approach to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 5 once
      daily doses of NP10679 when delivered intravenously in three escalating dose levels in
      comparison to placebo
