      SARS-CoV2 antibody responses in patients who were treated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 convalescent
      plasma under Expanded Access protocol, NCT04372368. Hospitalized patients with acute
      respiratory symptoms with or without confirmed interstitial COVID-19 pneumonia will be
      enrolled. The investigators anticipate that a minimum of 150 eligible subjects will be
      enrolled to receive COVID19 convalescent plasma over the 12 month period for the FDA IND
      expanded access protocol, NCT04372368, to provide COVID19 convalescent serum, which is a
      separate treatment trial. This observational protocol will co-enroll patients in parallel
      with the expanded access protocol and expects to enroll approximately the same number of
      patients but no treatment will be provided as part of this protocol. Additionally, the
      investigators will use Compass data with identifiers to pull information on hospitalized
      control COVID19+ patients from hospital admission date 4/20 to current for comparison.

      This protocol is limited to data collection using the EMR to evaluate outcomes following
      COVID19 convalescent plasma treatment. Patient-linked specimens will not be obtained and
      analyzed outside of the expanded access protocol for distribution of COVID19 convalescent
      plasma. For this protocol, only de-identified, discarded samples may be obtained during
      routine patient care. Thus, consent will only be obtained from patients/subjects for
      participation in data abstraction/analysis from the electronic medical record.
