        -  Determine the safety of contrast-enhanced high-dose radiotherapy administered with
           sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

        -  Determine immune response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (biopsy or simple surgery vs
      radical surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy).

      Patients receive a contrast agent intratumorally followed by a single fraction of kilovoltage
      radiotherapy. Beginning 24 hours after radiotherapy, patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      intratumorally continuously for 1 week and then subcutaneously for 2 weeks. Patients with
      lung tumors receive GM-CSF by inhalation twice daily for 1 week and then every other week for
      a total of 3 weeks of drug treatment.

      Treatment may repeat in several weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients (12 for phase I and 35 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study.
