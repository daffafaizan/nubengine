    
      This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study with 3
      dose levels of IMO-2125 in combination with standard ribavirin or placebo plus ribavirin.
      Each cohort will be randomized 4:1 to receive the investigational treatment arm or placebo
      and ribavirin. Three varying dose levels of IMO-2125 will be included. In both arms,
      ribavirin will be dosed based on patient weight.

      Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled in France and Russia. Patients will provide
      informed consent prior to any screening procedures being performed. Screening will occur
      within 21 days prior to randomization. Enrolled patients who qualify and proceed successfully
      through the screening period will be randomized to receive 4 weeks of either the
      investigational treatment arm (IMO-2125 and ribavirin) or placebo and ribavirin, with a 4
      week follow-up period.

      Patients who are randomized to the investigational treatment arm will receive one of 3 dose
      levels of IMO 2125 SC once weekly; each patient will receive the same dose throughout the 4
      weeks of treatment. In addition to IMO-2125 treatment they will also receive daily ribavirin,
      which will be given based on the patients weight and will be taken twice daily for a total of
      4 weeks.
