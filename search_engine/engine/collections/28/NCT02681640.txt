      tested by observer-blinded readings (two separate teams) and compared to diagnostic
      performance of conventional preoperative diagnostic workup procedures. The reference test
      will be histopathology of lymph nodes obtained by operative lymph node dissection (SN/ALND).
      Primary end point dichotomized: +/- lymph node metastases in ipsilateral axilla.
