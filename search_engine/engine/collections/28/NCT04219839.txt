      their baseline of knowledge regarding post-transplant care, medication adherence and patient
      satisfaction. Participants will then be randomly selected to receive either the usual patient
      education care provided for patients following kidney transplant, or to receive the usual
      care plus access to educational videos designed especially for post- transplant patients.
      Videos can be viewed on a tablet computer with their transplant team during clinic visits and
      at home using a smartphone.

      At 3 months post-transplant, all participants will be asked to repeat the knowledge
      assessment. Hospital re-admissions and patient satisfaction will be measured at 6 months
      after transplant.
