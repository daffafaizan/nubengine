    
      Women affected with hyperemesis gravidarum are at severe nutritional risk. Reference values
      for biochemical parameters evaluating nutritional status during early pregnancy needs to be
      determined.

      The investigators will compare clinical nutritional parameters (weight gain/weight loss) with
      rate of nausea (PUQE-questionnaire), self-reported nutritional intake form and biochemical
      measurements (prealbumin) in women admitted to hospital with hyperemesis gravidarum and
      healthy pregnant women.

      For hyperemesis patients measurements will be repeated at discharge.
