      care, accounting for 37% of all breast complaints. Pathologic nipple discharge (PND) is
      defined as spontaneous or easily expressible single duct nipple discharge, which contributes
      to 5% of referrals to breast surgeons. Patients with PND represent a diagnostic and
      therapeutic challenge for the surgical clinician. The most frequent causes of PND in these
      cases are intraductal papilloma (IP) in 36% to 66%, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 3% to
      20% and other benign causes in up to 23%. The evaluation of women with PND usually involves
      radiological(mammography, ultrasound, ducto (galacto)graphy and cytological (nipple smear,
      ductal lavage) examinations; however, each of these procedures has found to have low
      sensitivity and specificity. A ductoscope is an instrument which allows visualization of
      abnormalities and polypoid lesions within the ductal system with access via the nipple
      orifice to aid in evaluation of PND. Moreover, it is currently being used to improve
      localization of lesions in patients with PND. Ductoscopically guided excision is an
      improvement over standard surgical approaches with terminal duct excision which removes a
      large volume of tissue with potential cosmetic deformity and for young women may make breast
      feeding not possible. Ductoscopy also allows retrieval of intraductal cells for diagnostic
      purposes using brush cytology.
