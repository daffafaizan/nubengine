      patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy were recruited in the prospective
      observational study. Anesthesia was maintained using incremental propofol doses until the
      patient was calm and unresponsive to painful stimuli. Bispectral Index (BIS), blood pressure
      (BP) and pulse were monitored in typical intervals: before induction, during induction, at
      the beginning of the procedure, at 2nd, 5th and 10th minute of the procedure, and on
      emergence. On the emergence of anesthesia, the patient's facial expression was rated
      numerically (-3 pain, +3 smile). Thereafter patients were asked to rate their dream.
