      Fibromyalgia to explore the effect of r TMS on pain and depressive symptoms. The focus on
      African Americans is due to the mandate from the funding source (internal), as well as
      possible higher prevalence of FM in AA women. If recruitment is slow, the PI proposes to open
      up the study to other groups. Twenty subjects will be randomized to either sham or active TMS
      condition. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are well thought out and seem appropriate.
      mTreatments will be administered at IOP 5 times/wk with each session lasting 20 minutes. Pain
      intensity and unpleasantness will be measured pre and post each TMS session using three
      different pain evaluation paradigms. GCRC resource is mainly requested for two blood draws
      pre and post first TMS session. The blood samples will be used to measure inflammatory
      cytokines IL-1, IL-6, AND IL-8. The main aim is to ascertain feasibility of the study and
      secondary aim is to gather information on variability in response for power analysis for
      future larger study. The introduction and rationale (including pain evaluation, and methods
      relating to TMS) are clearly presented. Use of GCRC resources seem appropriate.
