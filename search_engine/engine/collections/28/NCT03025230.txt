      pain, the presence of myofascial trigger points (PG) in the musculature is a important and
      prevalent problem.

      Currently one the techniques most used in the treatment of PG is dry needling. Dry needling
      has been shown effective in the treatment of neck pain associated with PGs.

      To our knowledge, there are no studies that they have compared the effectiveness of dry
      needling and intramuscular stimulation by applying an electric current.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial that aims to demonstrate that the application of an
      electric current associated with dry needling in the treatment of PG.

      In this study we will treat subjects with cervical pain who they have active PGs in the
      levator scapulae muscle.
