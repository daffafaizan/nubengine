      techniques. It has been advocated that a battery of neurological assessments (including MEG)
      be developed to assess mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and studies have shown that
      somatosensory evoked fields in severe TBI can serve as a measure of cortical function in
      comatosed TBI patients. Functional neuroimaging techniques such as PET and fMRI may reveal
      abnormalities in areas considered 'normal' on traditional MRI. Most significantly, advanced
      functional neuroimaging may enable customized neurorehabilitation planning with more
      efficient use of resources.

      The study aim is to compare healthy brains, civilian TBI brains, and combat-related TBI to
      identify correlations between abnormal imaging parameters with neurorehabilitation potential
      utilizing advanced neurological imaging.

      The study hypothesis states Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-traumatic
      Stress Disorders (PTSD) can be detected and quantified using a multimodal battery of
      neurodiagnostic imaging techniques (MEG, PET/CT, 3 Tesla-MRI w/ DTI and fMRI) and
      rehabilitation potential can be predicted in the post acute phase.
