      years. Cannabis is comprised of more than 100 cannabinoids, including D9-tetrahydrocannabinol
      (THC), the major psychoactive constituent, and cannabidiol (CBD), the major non-intoxicating
      constituent that has demonstrated significant medicinal properties for a variety of
      disorders. Currently, 33 states and the District of Columbia have enacted full medical
      marijuana (MMJ) programs, and 14 states allow limited access to CBD-containing products. MMJ
      products can vary drastically in their cannabinoid constituent quantities and ratios, ranging
      from high THC products with very little CBD, to 1:1 ratios of THC to CBD, to high CBD
      products with very little THC. Although a wide range of products exist and are being actively
      used by consumers with a variety of medical indications, little is known about the direct
      impact of certain cannabinoids and constituent ratios on the symptoms that cause patients to
      seek treatment.

      Chronic pain is one of the most common indications for MMJ use, and several studies have
      yielded compelling data suggesting that MMJ and its constituents may have analgesic and
      anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting that particular cannabinoids may have the potential
      to treat chronic pain. To date, no clinical trials have been conducted assessing the effects
      of a high-CBD, low-THC product for chronic pain. This investigation will involve a an
      open-label to double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a high-CBD sublingual product;
      patients will be assessed at baseline and over 6 weeks of treatment with CBD or placebo on
      measures of clinical state, including pain and related symptoms, conventional medication use,
      cognition, and brain imaging (as appropriate).
