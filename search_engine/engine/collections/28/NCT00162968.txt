      polyneuropathy. However, these drugs are contraindicated in some patients and a substantial
      number of patients decline treatment due to side-effects. Therefore, effective drugs that are
      better tolerated are needed. Clinical and basic research has demonstrated that drugs with
      serotonergic action can alleviate neuropathic pain. Escitalopram increases serotonin
      concentration in the central nervous system, suggesting that it might be a potential
      alternative to current treatments of neuropathic pain. The aim of this study is to test if
      escitalopram would relieve painful polyneuropathy.

      Comparisons: Treatment with 20 mg escitalopram daily will be compared in a cross-over design
      with placebo. Each treatment period will last 6 weeks. During the last week of each treatment
      period, the dose will be tapered.
