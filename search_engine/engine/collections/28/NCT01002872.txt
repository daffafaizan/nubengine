      Kidney Disease ( CKD) stages 3-5 who are not undergoing renal replacement therapy and have
      not been started on phosphate binders will be randomized to either lanthanum carbonate 1500
      mg daily or placebo for a 60 day treatment period. Patient doses will be increased up to a
      maximum dose of 3000 mg if the serum phosphate is greater than 5.5 mg/dL.
