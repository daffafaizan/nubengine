      Sciences Rehabilitation Program. Mirror therapy has been successfully used with people that
      have injuries such as strokes or other types of brain injuries that affect movement on one
      side of their body. Mirror therapy involves placing a mirror over the affected limb and
      angling it to reflect the unaffected limb. This creates a visual illusion that moving the
      unaffected limb also results in movement in the affected limb. This is theorized to aid
      recovery of the motor system in the brain. Virtual Reality (VR) can also be used with people
      with strokes and brain injuries and many studies of VR have shown positive results. In this
      study, the investigators will combine VR and mirror therapy. The investigators have designed
      a special new system that uses VR headset to make it appear that both limbs are moving when
      only the unaffected limb is moving. The investigators are going to do this by having people
      complete virtual tasks wearing this specially programmed headset. The tasks are everyday
      activities that a person might perform using two hands. Ultimately, the investigators hope to
      determine whether there is any difference between VR mirror therapy and regular mirror
      therapy in improving upper limb function.
