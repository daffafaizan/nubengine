    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the prevalence of organ dysfunction, subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN),
      growth impairment, abnormal pubertal development, and neurobehavioral dysfunction in a large
      cohort of representative 5-year survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma treated with modern
      therapy.

      II. To identify the demographic, clinical and treatment-related risk factors associated with
      increased risk of organ dysfunction, SMN, growth impairment, abnormal pubertal development
      and neurobehavioral dysfunction in long-term survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma.

      III. To explore the impact of new biologic therapies and diagnostics including immunotherapy,
      immunocytokines, isotretinoin (cis-retinoic acid) and iobenguane I-131 (131 I-MIBG) on the
      risk of late effects.

      IV. To determine the impact of impaired organ function, physical growth, pubertal
      development, and neurobehavioral function on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in
      long-term survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a cohort of high-risk neuroblastoma survivors, with stored peripheral blood
      samples, who were treated with multi-modal therapies since the year 2000 as a resource for
      future investigation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood and urine samples on day 1. Patients also undergo
      clinical assessments, laboratory, radiographic, and other ancillary studies on day 1.
