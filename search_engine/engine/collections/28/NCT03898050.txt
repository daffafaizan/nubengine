      bradycardia. The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for the management of unstable
      bradycardia recommend initiating transcutaneous pacing in patients unresponsive to atropine
      while addressing the primary cause of the bradycardia. The two most commonly described pacer
      pad application sites are the anterior-posterior (A-P) position (positive pad placed under
      the left scapula and negative pad placed on the left anterior lower chest wall) and the
      anterior-lateral (A-L) position (positive pad placed on the right anterior chest wall and
      negative pad placed on the left lower axilla). Major resuscitation organization (AHA,
      European, Australian) guidelines and text books of emergency medicine recommendations for
      pacer pad placement do not address the issue of which set of positions are preferred. There
      are no published human studies addressing ideal pacer pad placement. This study's objective
      is to assess if there is a significant difference in the pacing threshold (mA) between these
      two pacer pad positions. The study hypothesis is that the anterior-posterior position will
      require a lower current and cause less involuntary muscle contraction. The investigators plan
      to enroll volunteer human subjects undergoing elective cardioversion in the electrophysiology
      laboratory for atrial fibrillation/flutter. After successful cardioversion to a sinus rhythm,
      each subject will be transcutaneously paced to mechanical capture in both pacer pad
      positions. Optimal placement will be determined by the pad position with the lowest current
      required for capture. The conclusions of this study will provide evidence for the optimal
      choice regarding pacer pad placement, which can be used in future resuscitation guidelines.
