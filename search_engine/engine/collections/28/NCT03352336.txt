      atelectasis, which is common in the perioperative setting. Atelectasis increase the risk of
      postoperative pulmonary complications and result in pulmonary shunt, which is one of the two
      major causes of impaired oxygenation. The other cause is admixture of venous blood from
      poorly ventilated regions of the lungs. The investigators have developed an oxygenation test
      utilizing arterial blood gas analysis at different inspired fractions of oxygen, which may be
      used to distinguish between these two causes. This observational study aims to establish the
      agreement between computed tomography and the oxygenation test for estimating the extent of
      atelectasis.
