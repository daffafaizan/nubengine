      have progressed following first-line therapy. In clinical practice, topoisomerase inhibitor,
      topotecan or irinotecan is commonly used in this setting.

      AZD1775 is a highly selective, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) competitive, small-molecule
      inhibitor of Wee1 kinase. Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase involved in regulation of intra-S and G2
      cell cycle checkpoints through phosphorylation and inhibition of CDK2 and CDK1, respectively.
      Because activity of these and other CDKs coordinate progression through the cell cycle, they
      are inhibited at cell cycle checkpoints, causing transient arrest at the G1-, S-, and G2
      phases of the cell cycle.

      P53 is a key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and is one of the most frequently mutated genes
      in cancer. Therefore, a majority of human cancers lack G1checkpoint but retain the S- and
      G2-phase checkpoints. As a result of p53 deficiency,cells lacking the G1 checkpoint are
      predicted to be more dependent on the Wee1-mediated G2 checkpoint. Hence, p53-deficient
      tumors treated with inhibitors of Wee1 may be particularly susceptible to DNA damage because
      multiple checkpoints have been lost.

      One hundred percent of SCLC has TP53 mutation, therefore we can expect that most of SCLC have
      lost G1 checkpoint and has high probability of WEE1 dependency for proper DNA repair and cell
      cycle progression.

      Therefore, the AZD1775 monotherapy might have some clinical activity as a 2nd line therapy in
      small cell lung cancer patients.
