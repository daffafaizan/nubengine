    
      The purpose of this study is to find out if SymbicortÂ® (budesonide/formoterol), a new
      combination asthma medication, is more effective than budesonide alone in controlling
      exercise induced asthma.

      The investigators hypothesize that in children and adults who suffer from asthma and exercise
      induced asthma there will be less decline in lung function associated with exercise when they
      receive the study medication.

      40 subjects will be randomized to receive both active medications in separate testing periods
      to determine the effect on their lung function after exercise testing.
