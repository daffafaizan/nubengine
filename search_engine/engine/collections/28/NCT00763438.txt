      This protocol is an extension study of a randomised study comparing the safety of Sertindole
      versus Risperidone. Patients who were randomised to Sertindole and who completed the previous
      study have the possibility to receive continued Sertindole treatment in this open one-arm
      study. Sertindole is generally well tolerated and is approved in the EU, but not yet marketed
      in France. The follow-up of the patients will be similar to that in the previous study and
      requires quarterly visits. Patient management reflects routine clinical practice in
      accordance with the Sertindole label. Any severe safety issue is reported to the company.
