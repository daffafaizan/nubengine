    
      BKM120 is a PI3K inhibitor. The PI3K/Protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway deregulation
      is frequently observed in Head and neck cancer. In addition to its role in tumor genesis, the
      PI3K/AKT pathway seems to be involved in resistance to cetuximab.

      In this context, the study proposal is to evaluate the clinical interest of a monotherapy
      with a PI3K inhibitor (BKM120, Novartis) in patients with metastatic head and neck cancers
      refractory or relapsing under platin and cetuximab based- chemotherapy. Since resistance to
      cetuximab can result from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit
      alpha (PIK3CA) mutation, PIK3CA amplification or mutation upstream in the PI3K pathway,
      BKM120 activity will be evaluated in two parallel independent cohorts of patients: patients
      presenting a PI3KCA mutation and patients without a PI3KCA mutation.
