      are significant and costly healthcare burdens in both veteran and nonveteran populations in
      the United States (US). When these two diagnoses are considered together, they appear to
      occur in a clinically significant proportion of patients. Further, opioid use disorder (OUD)
      interferes with chronic pain treatment outcomes and continued pain interferes with OUD
      outcomes treatment. While buprenorphine is effective for the treatment of pain and OUD,
      retention, relapse, and continued pain interference is not addressed through treatment with
      buprenorphine alone. Integrated treatments that target the key outcomes for both conditions,
      specifically pain's interference on functioning and opioid misuse/relapse, as developed in
      our prior work, allows for a parsimonious and efficacious way of providing treatment. Our
      recently completed pilot study indicated that such an integrated treatment was feasible and
      more effective than treatment as usual. To study this further, a multisite clinical trial
      comparing a three month integrated behavioral treatment that combines Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention, as compared to an education
      control will be conducted with 160 veterans recruited from three VA Medical Centers who have
      been stabilized on buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD. To assess longer-term outcomes,
      participants will be followed for 1 year after completion of the 3 month intervention.
