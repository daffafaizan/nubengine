      morbidities were reduced by tight glycemic control of a normal level for blood glucose using
      artificial pancreas. However, the most feared one is hypoglycaemia, which, when severe and
      prolonged, may cause convulsions, coma and brain damage, as well as cardiac arrhythmias.
      Recently, Ven den Berghe G report that the development of accurate, continuous blood glucose
      monitoring devices, and preferably closed-loop systems for computer-assisted blood glucose
      control in the ICU, will help to avoid hypoglycaemia. In our study, no hypoglycemia showed in
      more than 100 patients who performed perioperative tight glycemic control by artificial
      pancreas.
