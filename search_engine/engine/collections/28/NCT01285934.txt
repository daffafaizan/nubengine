    
      Eligible patients will have type 1 diabetes (aged â‰¥ 18 years old) within five months of
      disease diagnosis, and a positive antibody to an islet cell autoantigen, and fasting
      C-peptide > 0.2 nmol/l. Hematopoietic stem cells will be mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2.0
      g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (10 g/kg/day) collected from peripheral blood
      by leukoapheresis and cryopreserved. HSC will injected IV after conditioning with
      cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) divided 50 mg/kg on day -5, -4, -3, -2, and rabbit antithymocyte
      globulin (4.5 mg/kg) divided 0.5 mg/kg day-5, and 1.0 mg/kg day -4, -3-, -2, -1. Rituxan
      (500mg) IV will be given on days -6 and +1. The control arm will receive either continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or intensive subcutaneous insulin therapy with multiple
      insulin injections (at least 4/day) utilizing a long acting background insulin and pre-meal
      rapid acting insulin. The main outcome measure will be: fasting C-peptide. Other outcome
      measures will include: daily exogenous insulin requirements, serum levels of hemoglobin A1c,
      area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during mixed meal tolerance test, islet cell
      autoantigen antibody titers, and quality of life (QOL) short form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire.
