      inclusion in the study. Non-eligibility includes patients with obvious impaired cognitive or
      physical function or patients living in nursing homes. After signing informed consent, the
      patients first undergo geriatric assessment. Patients that are classified as having fit or
      intermediate function, and with no significant cardiovascular disease, are randomized with a
      2:1 randomization process to either chemotherapy (Arm A: Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid day 1-14
      q3 weeks, 8 cycles) or no chemotherapy (Arm B: observation).

      The purpose of this study is to examine the tolerability of chemotherapy in elderly (> 75
      years) patients operated on for colon cancer stage III. There is little evidence of benefit
      and tolerability of this therapy in the elderly; it is recommended individual consideration
      in elderly. In the study, a comprehensive geriatric a comprehensive geriatric assessment is
      performed first, to exclude frail patients or patients with serious comorbidities such as
      cardiovascular disease. Fit or intermediate patients will then be randomized so that 2/3 will
      receive chemotherapy with capecitabine tablets for 6 months, and 1/3 will not receive
      chemotherapy. A new geriatric assessment is performed after 6 and 12 months. The main
      objective of the study is to examine whether chemotherapy leads to significant loss of
      function, but secondary aims include survival, quality of life, and prognostic effect of
      biomarkers. The study may provide useful information on selection of patients who tolerate
      and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
