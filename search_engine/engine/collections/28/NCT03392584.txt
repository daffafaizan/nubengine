      needs neoadjuvant (chemo-) radiotherapy to down-stage the tumor before surgery. The Norwegian
      Radium Hospital Oslo University Hospital is a regional center for treatment of LARC in the
      south-eastern part of Norway and treat approximately 80-100 patients in this category
      annually. About 50 of these patients receive abdominoperineal resection (APR) as the main
      surgical treatment. A very high rate of deep surgical site infections is reported in the APR
      group internationally, particularly in the patients that have received chemo-radiotherapy.
      The knowledge of why these patients have such a high rate of infections is scarce.

      Microdialysis is a technique which enables close to real-time monitoring of the tissues and
      organs of interest.

      The investigators want to utilize the microdialysis method to describe and monitor metabolic
      and inflammatory parameters, after extensive oncological surgery for LARC in patients that
      have undergone chemoradiotherapy before surgery. With the knowledge of how the normal biology
      is, the investigators hypothesize that infection can be readily detected by the biomarkers
      retrieved by microdialysis.
