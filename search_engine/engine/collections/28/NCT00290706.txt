      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial remission) in patients with relapsed
           or refractory aggressive B- or T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride and bortezomib.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure, duration of response, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II,
      open-label study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and bortezomib IV
           over 3-5 seconds on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 9 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) OR the dose that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience DLT.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride and bortezomib as in phase I at the
           MTD.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
