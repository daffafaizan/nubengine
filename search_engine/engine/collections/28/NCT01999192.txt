      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to Methotrexate (MTX) alone.
      The main phase of this study is followed by a 24-week extension phase for subjects meeting
      the respective entry criteria. Patients will be randomized to one of three different Active
      treatment groups or Placebo. The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of subjects with
      an ACR20 response after 12 weeks of double blinded treatment with the study medication based
      on observed cases in the FAS.

      At Week 12, all subjects who had a minimum improvement of at least 20% (from baseline) in
      their tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) continued on the same treatment.
      Subjects who had not demonstrated an improvement of at least 20% of TJC and SJC were assessed
      as non-responders. Non-responders who received placebo were randomized to an active treatment
      dose in a blinded manner. Non-responders who received active treatment were rolled up to the
      next highest dose in a blinded manner, apart from those already on the highest dose. These
      subjects remained on the highest dose.
