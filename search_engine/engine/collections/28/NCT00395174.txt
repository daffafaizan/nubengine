      particularly among the elderly. Licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIVs) have
      been shown to reduce hospitalization and death following influenza in this vulnerable
      population, but their efficacy is lower than that observed in younger, healthy populations.
      In addition, recent studies have questioned the level of effectiveness of TIV in the elderly,
      suggesting that cohort studies have overestimated the benefits of immunization with current
      TIV formulations in this age group. In view of these considerations, it is widely accepted
      that improved and alternative vaccines are needed for control of seasonal and pandemic
      influenza.

      Currently available TIVs are prepared from viruses that are grown in embryonated hens' eggs.
      Alternative substrates for vaccine production are desirable in order to reduce the
      vulnerability of and to expand influenza vaccine supply. Recombinant DNA techniques allow for
      expression of the influenza hemagglutinin (rHA) by baculovirus vectors in insect cell
      cultures. Advantages of this technique include speed of production, absence of egg protein,
      and a highly purified product. Previous studies among healthy younger and older adults have
      confirmed that rHA vaccines are safe, well tolerated and immunogenic at dosages up to nine
      times higher than those contained in TIV. Dose-related increases in serum antibody levels
      after immunization also were observed.
