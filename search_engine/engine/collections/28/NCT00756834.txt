      performance of the MammoDetector™ Pro on biopsy-proven malignant cases obtained with the
      Siemens Mammomat NovationDR FFDM system is not inferior to its performance on biopsy-proven
      malignant cases obtained with conventional film-screen mammography (FSM). The overall
      sensitivity of the MammoDetector™ Pro with both imaging modalities will be compared.
      Furthermore, the study is designed to demonstrate that the false marks noted by the
      MammoDetector™ Pro on routine screening "Normal" cases obtained with the FFDM system is not
      inferior those marked by the software on routine screening "Normal" cases obtained with
      conventional film-screen mammography (FSM).
