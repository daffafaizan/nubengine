      estimate: This is a pilot study therefore power calculations are not appropriate. A group
      size of 12 participants has been selected for feasibility.

      Number of participants: 12 patients to complete study Description of interventions

        -  6 sessions of conventional haemodialysis each lasting 4 hours

        -  6 sessions of online haemodiafiltration each lasting 4 hours

        -  2 sessions of Cardiac MRI each lasting 6 hours in total to take place around 6th session
           of dialysis Randomisation and blinding: This is an open study. Statistical methods: All
           continuous variables will be tested for normality. The primary and continuous secondary
           endpoints will be compared between the two modalities using a paired t test or Wilcoxon
           signed rank test as appropriate. The association between categorical variables will be
           tested using the Chi squared or Fischer's Exact test. An alpha error at 0.05 will be
           judged as significant.
