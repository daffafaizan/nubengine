      characterization in children and adolescents with primary cardiomyopathy and their
      first-degree family members. Family screening contains complete cardiac work-up with medical
      history, physical examination, 12-lead-/Holter-electrocardiogram, cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing, echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and laboratory including
      genetic testing. The aim is to facilitate early identification of at-risk individuals and
      contribute to patient-specific follow-up and therapy regimes preventing progressive heart
      failure and arrhythmia in pediatric CMP.
