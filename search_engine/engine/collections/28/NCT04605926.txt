      will receive either itolizumab or placebo administered intravenously on Day 1 and Day 8 with
      follow-up to Day 90. Two interim analyses of futility are planned. The first will take place
      when approximately 20% of the subjects have been evaluated for the primary endpoint, and the
      second will take place when approximately 50% of the subjects have been evaluated for the
      primary endpoint.
