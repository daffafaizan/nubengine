      cells by brushing cells from the airways and we will study genes that may be related to cilia
      length. Our goals are (1) to prove that exposure to cigarette smoke results in shorter cilia,
      (2) to learn which specific genes control cilia length, and (3) to learn how smoking affects
      the gene ODF2 and what effect this has on cilia. Understanding how smoking affects cilia may
      help us identify new ways to treat patients with COPD.
