      unresectable or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma or gallbladder cancer treated with
      gemcitabine, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium. II. Determine the tumor response in these
      patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by leucovorin calcium IV
      and fluorouracil IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks
      for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.
