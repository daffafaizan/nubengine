      ultrasound (US) in patients with neck and arm pain who demonstrate neural mechanical
      sensitivity. Twenty-three patients with neck and arm pain and a positive upper limb
      neurodynamic test (ULNT) were randomly assigned to receive STM or therapeutic US during a
      single session. Outcome measures were collected immediately before and after treatment, and
      at 2-4 day follow-up. Primary outcomes were the Global Rating of Change (GROC), range of
      motion (ROM) during the ULNT, and pain rating during the ULNT. Secondary measures included
      the Neck Disability Index (NDI), Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), Numeric Pain
      Rating Scale (NPRS), and active range of shoulder abduction motion combined with the wrist
      neutral or wrist extension.
