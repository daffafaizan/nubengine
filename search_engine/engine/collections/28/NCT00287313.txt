      patients with unstable INRs on warfarin therapy. Subjects with unstable INRs will be
      identified from the existing patient records of the UNC Anticoagulation Clinics. Eligible
      subjects will sign an informed consent form and will receive a point-of-care (POC) INR
      monitoring device. They will undergo 9 weeks of home INR monitoring via the POC device (with
      monthly clinic follow-up). They will subsequently be provided with 500 mcg Vitamin K tablets
      to be taken once daily. Weekly POC INR monitoring with monthly clinic follow-up will continue
      for an additional 8 weeks.
