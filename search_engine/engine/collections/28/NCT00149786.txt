      development. Despite the seriousness and prevalence of adolescent anorexia nervosa, few
      studies have focused on the effectiveness of various types of psychotherapy treatment.
      Family-based therapy may be an effective approach to treating adolescent anorexia nervosa.
      This study will compare the effectiveness of family-based therapy versus ego-oriented
      individual psychotherapy for the treatment of adolescent anorexia nervosa. Simultaneously, it
      will examine potential predictors, mediators, and moderators of weight gain, psychological
      concerns about weight and shape, and changes in family functioning.

      Participants in this open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive one of two types
      of therapy: family-based therapy or ego-oriented individual psychotherapy. Both types of
      therapy will be given for a total of 24 hours over the course of 12 months. Physical and
      psychological assessments will be completed during study visits at baseline, immediately
      post-treatment, six months post-treatment, and one year post-treatment. Amount of weight gain
      will be evaluated, along with changes in weight and body shape concerns, as measured by the
      Eating Disorder Examination.
