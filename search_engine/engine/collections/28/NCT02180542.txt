      compared to the general population. Identifying AF can be challenging, but prolonged rhythm
      monitoring of ischemic stroke patients have shown to enhance detection rates of AF. Therefore
      it is important to identify predictors of AF to allow targeted screening of patients after
      ischemic stroke and thereby reduce the recurrent stroke rate. Few former studies have shown
      an association between excessive numbers of premature atrial complexes (PACs) and AF.

      The study population of ischemic stroke patients will at admission undergo following
      examinations:

        1. ECG

        2. 48 hours inpatient cardiac telemetry (If not known AF)

        3. 24 hours holter monitoring (if not known AF)

        4. echocardiogram

        5. blood sample

        6. CT scan of carotid arteries with contrast made on Dual Energy CT scan.

      In the follow-up period, patients will have two visits with 48 hour holter monitoring (after
      6 and 12 months, respectively) It will be noticed if patients have any recurrent events, die
      og developing AF.

      The study population will be divided into four groups as follows:

        1. patients with new AF at admission

        2. patients with known AF

        3. patients with frequent PACs

        4. patients without frequent PACs. These groups will be compared on baseline
           characteristics and on outcome as mentioned.

      The overall perspective is to make better strategies for detecting occult AF after ischemic
      stroke to improve secondary stroke prevention care.
