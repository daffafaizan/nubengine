    
      A total of 49 healty volunteers will be allocated to receive either three immunizations with
      15 NF135.C10 infected Anopheles mosquitoes (n=30), 3 immunizations with 5 NF135.C10 infected
      mosquitoes (n=10) or no immunizations (n=6). Immunizations in cohort A (n=20) will be
      performed under mefloquine prophylaxis, spaced 4 weeks apart. In cohort B, volunteers will
      not take mefloquine prophylaxis, instead all volunteers will be treated presumptively on day
      7 after each immunization with a curative regimen of artemeter/lumefantrine, regardless of
      parasitaemia or symptoms.

      Nineteen weeks after the last immunization, all volunteers plus na√Øve controls will be
      challenged either by the bites of 5 NF135.C10 (n=36) or 5 NF54 (n=13) infected mosquitoes.
      After challenge infection, volunteers will be followed up on an out-patient basis once daily
      for qPCR and safety lab measurements from day 6 until day 21 post challenge. All volunteers
      will be treated with a curative regimen of atovaquone/proguanil, either at the time of
      detection of blood stage parasitemia, or 28 days after challenge infection.
