      (LSC) for the treatment of symptomatic vaginal vault prolapse as well as paravaginal repair
      (PVR) for symptomatic cystocele between two-dimensional and three-dimensional laparoscopic
      systems. Additionally this study will evaluate postoperative complications from surgeries
      performed using two-dimensional versus three-dimensional laparoscopic systems.
