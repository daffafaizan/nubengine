      Intravenous administration of PMZ-1620 (sovateltide) augments the activity of neuronal
      progenitor cells in the brain to repair the damage by formation of new mature neurons and
      blood vessels. In addition, PMZ-1620 has anti-apoptotic activity and also increases cerebral
      blood flow when administered following ischemia.
