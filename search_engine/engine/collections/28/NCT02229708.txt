      period represents a critical life stage of heightened vulnerability for new or persistent
      obesity, especially among Black women, who retain 2-3 times more weight after pregnancy than
      White women. Pregnancy weight gain is the strongest identified risk factor for retaining a
      substantial amount of weight after pregnancy, yet few published interventions have been
      effective in reducing excessive weight gain in pregnancy, particularly among low-income Black
      mothers.

      The proposed research aims to meets the needs of low-income, Black mothers by developing a
      novel pregnancy intervention that 1) focuses solely on Black women, 2) incorporates Black
      mothers' information needs, values, and social context, and 3) uses technology to facilitate
      participant engagement.
