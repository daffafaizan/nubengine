      dietary supplement on markers of iron status among a sample of premenopausal women that are
      iron-deficient without anemia. This study will also assess the incidence of mild adverse
      events (constipation, nausea, etc.) that are relatively common with other over the counter
      iron dietary supplements and that the investigators hypothesize will be reduced with this
      lower-dose formulation.
