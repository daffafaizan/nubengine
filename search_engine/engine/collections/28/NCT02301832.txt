      compartment syndrome. NIRS values normally increase in traumatized legs compared to the
      contralateral uninjured leg or forearm, indicative of a hyperemic response. The investigators
      hopes to build upon the current knowledge and verify the ability to accurately detect ACS
      using two easily identified and accessible leg compartments, the anterior and superficial
      posterior utilizing the Nonin 7600 oximeter with the Sensor Model 8004CV. Additionally, since
      this device was originally designed with brain tissue in mind, the NIRS device will collect
      vital engineering data that will be used to validate the algorithm used to produce the
      oxygenation values in injured muscle tissue.
