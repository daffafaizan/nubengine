      higher than 30%. In addition to nephron loss induced by renal parenchyma resection,
      ischemia/reperfusion injury produced by clamping/unclamping of renal arteries is also an
      important reason. However, studies investigating the effect of circulatory management on the
      incidence of acute kidney injury after partial nephrectomy are limited.

      It has been shown that perioperative hemodynamic optimization protected renal function in
      surgical patients. And in patients undergoing renal transplantation, adequate hydration and
      optimal perfusion enhances early graft function. The investigators hypothesize that hydration
      and circulatory management to guarantee optimal renal perfusion may decrease the occurrence
      of acute kidney injury after partial nephrectomy. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      whether circulatory management based on LiDCOrapid hemodynamic monitoring can reduce the
      incidence of acute kidney injury in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy when compared
      with routine circulatory management based on blood pressure and urine output monitoring.
