      This substrate ablation method is performed routinely in the centers involved in the study
      so, patients were not assigned by the investigators to undergo a specific procedure because
      of the study, in all cases patient would have beneficiate from this substrate mapping
      ablation method.

      We assessed procedural and follow up outcomes of this subatrate ablation group and compared
      them with an historical control group undergoing conventional ablation.
