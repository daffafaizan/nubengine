      The investigators developed a means to directly measure creatine kinase flux, the major
      energy reserve of the heart, in the human heart exploiting new magnetic resonance
      technologies.

      The investigators propose to study 10 healthy subjects and up to 25 with heart failure
      (dilated cardiomyopathy) before and after a single 300mg IV infusion of allopurinol.
