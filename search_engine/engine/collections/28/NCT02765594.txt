      world. Its estimated frequency is at least 2.5 cases per year per 100,000 adults. The
      glomerulopathy usually progressed slowly leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD
      developed in 20%-40% of patients after 20 years. Given its complex and as yet incompletely
      understood pathogenetic mechanisms, there is to date no curative therapy for patients with
      IgAN.

      Although pathogenesis of IgAN is still obscure, underglycosylated IgA-containing
      immune-complex including IgG or IgA antibodies against the hinge region of IgA1 are key
      factors for IgA nephropathy. Aberrant mucosal immune response might lead to increased
      production of underglycosylated IgA1. It is considered that dendritic cells, Toll-like
      receptor (TLR)9, and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), , interferon-alpha (IFN-a) and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), play an important role in the aberrant mucosal response.

      Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent and had a notable impact on immune activation by
      the reduction of circulating activated immune cells that including decreased TLR-expressing
      cells, reduced IFN-secreting plasmacytoid dendritic cells, reduced production of inflammatory
      cytokines including interferon alpha, IL-6 and TNF alpha. Recent studies showed
      hydroxychloroquine had a benefit for renal remission and could retard the onset of renal
      damage in patients with lupus nephritis.

      Therefore, hydroxychloroquine, targeting dendritic cells, TLR, IL-6, IFN-α and TNF-α，may have
      the potential effect in IgA nephropathy, alleviated the proteinuria and had the renal protect
      effect. This will be a single center, prospective, randomized, controlled study to assess the
      utility of hydroxychloroquine added to valsartan in IgAN patients.
