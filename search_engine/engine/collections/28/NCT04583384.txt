    
      Paragangliomas (PGL) are rare neuroendocrine tumors inherited in 40% of cases. SDHx genes
      (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD), encoding the 4 subunits of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate
      dehydrogenase (SDH), are the most frequently involved.

      Accumulation of succinate, the substrate for SDH, is a very specific biomarker for these
      mutations. Recently, we have demonstrated the feasability of detecting and quantifying
      succinate in tumors in vivo, by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-SRM).

      Patients carrying these mutations frequently develop cervical PGL for which the treatment of
      choice is external beam radiation therapy (EBR).

      The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of using 1H-SRM for the
      evaluation of early response to EBR therapy in patients with cervical SDHx PGL.
