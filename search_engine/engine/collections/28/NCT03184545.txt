      athletic population. In patellofemoral knee syndrome, one of the theory is that the vastus
      medialis obliquus muscle is weak. To strengthen the muscle, physical therapy exercises are
      commonly used. This study evaluates addition of the electrical muscle stimulation device.The
      electrical muscle stimulation device "Flex MT Plus" (Electrostim Medical Services Inc. Tampa,
      FL) is a FDA approved device and has been used in knee for other conditions like treating for
      weakness associated with knee injuries or after knee surgeries. It has shown to improve the
      outcomes in above mentioned conditions. Its efficacy has been tested in patellofemoral pain
      syndrome but in smaller sample size. We intend to test it in larger sample size patient
      population.

      Bily et al (2008) (reference #1) published their results on patellofemoral pain syndrome
      comparing EMS +PT to PT only and found that overall significant improvement in outcome score
      in all patients but when compared between the groups there was no difference. But there
      sample size was 19 patients in each group. Small sample size was one of the limitation of
      their study. We intend to collect 46 patients in each group to find significant difference
      based on power analysis.
