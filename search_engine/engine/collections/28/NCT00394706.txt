      ITD is a small hard plastic device about the size of a fist that is attached to the face mask
      or airway tube used during CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). The ITD provides increased
      blood flow back to the heart during chest compressions until the heart starts beating on its
      own again.

      The other treatment involves the amount of CPR given before the emergency medical services
      (EMS) providers first look at the heart rhythm to determine if a shock is needed. A person
      would receive either about 30 seconds of chest compressions or about 3 minutes of
      compressions before checking the heart rhythm. Giving some compressions before checking the
      heart rhythm increases the blood being circulated to the body. Researchers do not know how
      many compressions before the rhythm check are necessary to save more lives.

      Depending on the circumstances of the cardiac arrest a person may receive only one of these
      treatments or both of these treatments. The purpose of the research study is to determine if
      more people live when either the real ITD is used or if additional CPR is given before
      looking at the heart rhythm the first time. This study is being conducted in 9 different
      areas throughout the United States and Canada by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC).
      About 15,000 patients will be enrolled in this research study.
