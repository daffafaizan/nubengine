      Certain anti-HIV drugs are associated with increased insulin resistance and may lead to
      abnormal fat distribution, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The dietary supplement
      chromium picolinate has been shown to safely improve insulin sensitivity in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus with no serious side effects. However, the effects of the supplement
      have not been thoroughly examined in HIV-infected individuals. This study will determine the
      effectiveness of chromium picolinate in improving insulin resistance in HIV-infected
      individuals.

      This study will last 2 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      chromium picolinate or placebo once a day for 2 months. Participants will have four overnight
      visits at the research center and two additional daytime visits for safety monitoring. During
      the overnight visits, participants will undergo a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, in which
      a continuous infusion of insulin is given through a vein and glucose levels are monitored
      through blood samples taken every 5 to 10 minutes. Fat tissue biopsies will also be conducted
      at the overnight study visits. During the safety monitoring visits, blood collection will
      occur for kidney and liver function tests, CD4 count, and viral load assessment.
