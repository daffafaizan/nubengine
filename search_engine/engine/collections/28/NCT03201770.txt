    
      This is a non-comparative Cohort Event Monitoring study. The study will assess the safety of
      Pyramax in terms of the evaluation and identification of the hepatic safety events in a sub
      group of patients enrolled with liver function tests (LFT)s >2x upper limit of normal (ULN)
      from blood taken immediately prior to treatment without any clinical signs or symptoms of
      hepatotoxicity and with signs and symptoms of uncomplicated malaria confirmed by a Rapid
      Diagnostic Test (RDT) or microscopy (thick blood smear). The study will compare the clinical
      hepatic safety of Pyramax between a cohort of patients enrolled with LFTs >2xULN and a cohort
      of patients enrolled with normal LFTs matched for demographic characteristics.

      An estimated 8,572 malaria episodes are to be recruited to provide 120 malaria episodes in
      patients with baseline raised LFTs >2xULN for follow up of liver function. A cohort of at
      least 2% of children who are <1 year of age will be included for monitoring of liver
      function.
