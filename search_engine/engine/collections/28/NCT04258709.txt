    
      The purpose of the PREPARE Trial is to examine the impact of an antenatal milk expression
      (AME) intervention among women with pre-pregnancy BMI 25 or more on breastfeeding outcomes,
      including breastfeeding self-efficacy, breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, and perception
      of insufficient milk supply. Specifically, the investigators will:

        1. Determine the effect of the AME intervention on short-term breastfeeding outcomes,
           including breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, to two weeks postpartum.

        2. Explore the sustained effect of the AME intervention on longer-term breastfeeding
           duration and exclusivity over the first year postpartum.

        3. Examine participants' experiences with and perceptions of AME.
