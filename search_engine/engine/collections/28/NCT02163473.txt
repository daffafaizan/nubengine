      most severe form of sepsis and is associated with higher mortality, significant financial
      expenses and longer lengths of stay. Pathophysiological mechanisms of SS include 3 key
      components: 1) bacterial overgrowth, 2) spill of bacterial product into the blood causing
      hemodynamic insufficiency, and 3) both lead to tissue hypoxia (TH). To date the biomarkers of
      sepsis/SS are limited to hemodynamic parameters. However, aggressive fluid resuscitation does
      not fully prevent development of tissue hypoxia (TH). To date the investigators are limited
      in appreciating TH by measurement of lactic acid (LA), which is neither an early nor an
      accurate marker. Unfortunately, LA has limited predictive value in SS due to its complex
      metabolism. Thus, there is an acute need for biomarkers that would aid diagnosis and
      prognosis of sepsis/septic shock.

      Cellular responses/adaptations to hypoxia rely on the transcription hypoxia-inducible factor
      HIF, a heterodimeric protein composed of a constitutively expressed subunit and an inducible
      (types 1, 2, and 3) subunit. More recently HIF was identified in diverse tissues including
      blood; it has been also shown that HIF expression in blood cells is representative of
      systemic tissues in hypoxic conditions.
