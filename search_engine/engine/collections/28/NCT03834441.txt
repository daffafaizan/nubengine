      predetermined criteria and approach eligible patients with a brief description of the study
      and opportunity for participation. Interested participants will complete a verbal consent
      process to reduce the barriers to participation, a brief demographic questionnaire, and an
      assessment of health literacy (Newest Vital Sign) followed by the Partners Healthcare HRSN
      screener randomized to an oral v. iPad screening strategy.

      After completion of the screening tool, participants will complete a secondary questionnaire
      asking about satisfaction with the process, the presence of additional HRSN not recorded by
      the Partners HealthCare screener, and their perspectives on screening. At the conclusion, all
      participants will be provided with standardized, bilingual list of community resources to
      address each of the screening domains.
