    
      patient in the linagliptin plus basal insulin will receive linagliptin at single dose of 5
      mg/day, and a starting total daily dose (TDD) of glargine of 0.3 units/kg/day, while patients
      >70 years of age and/or with a serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL will receive starting TDD of 0.15
      units/kg.

      Patient in the basal bolus group will start at a TDD of 0.5 units/kg divided half as insulin
      glargine once daily and half as insulin glulisine before meals. In patients >70 years of age
      and/or with a serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL, the starting TDD will be reduce to 0.3 units/kg.

      The results of BG values will be measured as 2 hour pre meal glucose, bedtime glucose, and
      mean daily BG after first day at hospital, HbA1c will be measured on the first day of
      hospitalization.

      Patient with pre-meal and bed time blood glucose levels over 180 mg/dl will receive
      correctional doses of short acting insulin based on glucose levels as follow- 180-250mg/dl 2
      units of insulin, 250-300 mg/dl 3 units of insulin, 350-400 4 units of insulin.

      Hypoglycemic events shall be documented as well. In case of treatment failure, defined as
      average blood glucose levels or two consecutive measurements of more than 240 mg/dl,
      patient's treatment will be changed to basal based regimen.Patient with pre-meal and bed time

      Patient will be discharged according to discharged protocol. Follow-up visits will take place
      at 3 and 6 months post discharged.

      Patients will be instructed to measure and record BG levels (pre meal glucose, bedtime
      glucose, and mean daily BG) during three days before follow-ups visits.
