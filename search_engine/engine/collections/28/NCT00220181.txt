      disease management. Acute intestinal changes such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea
      ocur in about 75% of patients. Severe acute changes predispose to chronic, intractable
      intestinal changes. Nutritional intervention during radiotherapy may protect the bowel from
      toxicity.

      A number of nutritionally related changes in bowel function may cause acute intestinal
      problems during radiotherapy. These include: Bile-acid & pancreatic enzyme potentiated damage
      to mucosa causing loss of epithelial integrity and in turn increased permeability to antigens
      and luminal bacteria; Bile-acid malabsorption, decreasing the gut's ability to digest fat;
      Reduced disaccharidase activity due to loss of the intestinal brush border, causing
      malabsorption of sugars leading to osmotic diarrhoea; Statis/ dysmotility in the small
      intestine prompting bacterial overgrowth.

      There is little prospective data in patients undergoing radiotherapy to help to identify
      which are important. To understand what changes are relevant during a 6-week course of
      radiotherapy we plan this prospective observational study. Any changes identified in this
      study could be ameliorated by specific nutritional intervention in future studies.
