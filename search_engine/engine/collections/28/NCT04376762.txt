    
      Once the need for fibrinogen supplementation is confirmed, study participants will be
      randomized into one of two treatment groups (n=15 in each group):

        1. Cryoprecipitate group (dose: 10 ml/kg; active control group) or

        2. Fibrinogen Concentrate group (dose: 70 mg/kg; intervention group). There will be no
           placebo group since withholding treatment is neither consistent with standard of care
           nor acceptable ethically. No other aspects of care will be modified. In the event that
           an additional dose of fibrinogen supplementation is required (bleeding with documented
           hypofibrinogenemia) cryoprecipitate will be administered to all study subjects
           (including those who initially received FC).

      Data to be obtained:

        1. Demographic/preoperative data:

             -  Use of hypothermic circulatory arrest (ice packs placed on the head)

             -  ROTEM: Extem (CT/A10/A20/MCF) and Fibtem (A10/A20/MCF) at the following time
                points: baseline (after induction of anesthesia), 20 min prior to separation from
                CPB and 10 minutes after completion of fibrinogen concentrate/cryoprecipitate
                administration

             -  Platelet count prior to separation from CPB

             -  was ATIII administered? (thrombate)

             -  Transfusion requirements: PRBC/Cell Saver/FFP/PLT/ cryoprecipitate - to be
                collected as number of units per each product, not volume. (for PLT - was it pooled
                PLT or single donor apheresis)

             -  was rFVIIa given (factor seven, novoseven).

             -  Need for ECMO support after separation trial from CPB

             -  Was the chest left open?

        3. Postoperative Data

             -  PT/aPTT/INR/platelet count/ fibrinogen level/ Hgb level/HCT level on admission to
                the ICU

             -  ROTEM parameters

             -  Liver and kidney function tests on admission to the ICU

             -  Bleeding (Chest drain output until 48 hours after surgery)

             -  Need for additional transfusion (RBC/FFP/platelets/cryoprecipitate) until 7 days
                after surgery.

             -  Factor VIIa administration

             -  re-exploration for bleeding/tamponade (need for postoperative chest re-exploration
                or re- operation either in the ICU or in the OR due to excessive postoperative
                bleeding and/or cardiac tamponade)

             -  Need for initiation of ECMO support in the ICU postoperatively

             -  Duration of postoperative intubation

             -  AKI (AKIN criteria)

             -  Stroke/seizures > 24 hours post-operatively

             -  Infection (sternal wound infection/mediastinitis/pneumonia/sepsis)
