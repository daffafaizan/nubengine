      pelvis is located between the hip and lumbar region, where many muscles are attached to
      regulate the movement of the hip and lumbar spine. Asymmetrical pelvic alignment affects
      stability of the lower extremities and trunk, making normal walking difficult. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate the pattern of gait according to pelvic displacement in patients
      with lumbar disc herniation.
