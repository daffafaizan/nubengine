      corticosteroid administration and about 24 hours after each dose is given.

      Women who consent to an optional PK portion of the study will have plasma samples obtained
      pre-dose and then on a schedule of approximately 0.5-2, 4-8, 10-15, 22-24 hours after the
      first dose and then 6-8, 24, and 48 hours after the 2nd dose. One sample will be collected in
      each of these times.

      A sample of whole blood will be obtained for DNA isolation. At the time of delivery,
      umbilical cord blood will be collected before being discarded for DNA and plasma. If we are
      unable to obtain umbilical cord blood, a buccal swab will be collected from the baby for DNA
      extraction.
