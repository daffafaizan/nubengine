      after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a COMBO-stent based strategy associated
      with short-term antiplatelet therapy with a guidelines-based therapy in patients with an
      indication for chronic oral anticoagulation. The study is organized as a national,
      multi-centre prospective, randomized trial. The duration of the follow-up is 15 months.
