      infections (GABHS) may trigger the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tic
      disorder in certain vulnerable children via an autoimmune process. In this subgroup of
      children with childhood-onset OCD and tic disorders, preliminary data suggest some children
      have a rapid response to amoxicillin. After only 24 to 48 hours of treatment, they have a
      dramatic reduction in OC symptoms and tics. To date, we have observed this phenomenon in at
      least 5 children, each of whom relapsed when the amoxicillin was stopped. These observations
      raise a number of questions, including whether or not amoxicillin has a direct central
      nervous system (CNS) effect or an indirect effect through perturbations of the immune system
      (e.g., cytokine shifts).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if amoxicillin is an effective treatment for
      PANDAS, as well as examining possible mechanisms of this effect. We propose to do this with a
      3-month double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of amoxicillin treatment with a
      randomized A-B-A-B design. Outcome measures will be blinded ratings of tic severity,
      standardized measures of psychopathology, and immunologic assays (such as type I and type II
      cytokine levels).
