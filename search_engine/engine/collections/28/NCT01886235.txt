      I. To determine the feasibility of performing intravital microscopy on accessible human
      melanoma tumors during their standard course of treatment (i.e., wide local excision). (Part
      I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the blood flow velocity of the tumor vessels and tissue penetration of
      fluorescein (fluorescein sodium) as a marker of tumor vessel permeability. (Part II)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fluorescein sodium intravenously (IV) followed by intravital microscopic
      observation over 10-15 minutes during excision of the melanoma.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then
      periodically for 5 years.
