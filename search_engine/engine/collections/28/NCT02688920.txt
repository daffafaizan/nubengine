        1. To assess duodenal layer (mucosa, submucosa and muscularis) thickness differences
           between patients with and without type 2 diabetes using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and
           optical coherence tomography (OCT).

        2. To assess duodenal layer thickness differences between patients with type 2 diabetes.

        3. To assess duodenal layer thickness differences as a function of measurement location
           along the length of the duodenum.

        4. To compare measurements obtained by endoscopic ultrasound, to those obtained by optical
           coherence tomography.
