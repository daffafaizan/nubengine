      Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) is used post liver transplantation (OLT) in hepatitis B
      surface antigen-positive recipients to prevent recurrence of hepatitis B. One formulation of
      HBIG, HepaGam B, contains the disaccharide maltose, which can potentially falsely elevate
      glucose readings when glucose nonspecific point of care (GNSPOC) testing is used, such as a
      glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ)-based method. This can result in
      inappropriate administration of antidiabetic agents and resultant episodes of clinically
      significant hypoglycemia. Glucose specific point of care (GSPOC) testing, such as a glucose
      oxidase-based method, however, is not affected by the presence of maltose. The purpose of
      this study was to determine if there was a significant difference in glucose readings using
      GSPOC and GNSPOC monitoring devices after HBIG administration.

      METHODS:

      This is a nonrandomized, prospective study evaluating patients receiving maintenance HBIG
      therapy over 3 months post liver transplantation. Blood glucose levels in each subject were
      analyzed by GSPOC and GNSPOC devices at specific times around HBIG administration.
