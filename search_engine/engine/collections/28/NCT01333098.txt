      disorders. In this study, fifteen patients aged 60+ with an anxiety disorder (current or in
      partial remission) and subjective and/or objective evidence of cognitive impairment will
      receive treatment with mifepristone. At the baseline visit participants will be randomized to
      receive either mifepristone 300mg or a placebo daily for 7 days. Participants will be
      reassessed after 7 days (week 1 visit) of receiving study medication (mifepristone or
      placebo). At that time all participants will be provided mifepristone 300mg daily for the
      remaining 3 weeks of study treatment. The primary outcome measure will be neurocognition, as
      assessed by a battery of neuropsychological measures focusing on immediate and delayed memory
      and executive function (administered at baseline, week 1, week 4, and week 12). Saliva
      samples for cortisol measurement will be collected immediately following the baseline visit
      and week 4 visit. Secondary outcomes will be self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms.
