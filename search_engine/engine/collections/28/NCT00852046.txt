    
      Patients identified by selection criteria within 48 hours of intubation will be randomly
      assigned to one of three study arms: dexmedetomidine 0.2 mcg/kg/hr, dexmedetomidine 0.6
      mcg/kg/hr, or placebo. If not already on, patients will be converted to propofol and fentanyl
      for sedation and analgesia, which will be titrated to a goal SAS score of 3-4.

      Patients will be monitored, assessed, and evaluated by all regular policies and procedures of
      the institution. Extubation will be at the discretion of the physicians and medical team
      caring for the patient. If the patient is still intubated at five days study drug will then
      be stopped and further use of dexmedetomidine will be at the discretion of the physicians.

      Primary objective will assess impact of increasing dose of dexmedetomidine on total daily
      dose of fentanyl and propofol while maintaining sedation in a mechanically ventilated patient
      in a general medical intensive care unit.

      Secondary objectives include total ventilation time, ICU length of stay, hospital length of
      stay, patient outcomes/mortality, and total pharmacy expenditures.
