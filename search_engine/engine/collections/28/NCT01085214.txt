      I. To assess the response rate of AZD6244 (selumetinib) hydrogen sulfate capsules in patients
      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of AZD6244 in patients with MM. II. To estimate progression-free
      survival and duration of response to AZD6244. III. To test whether AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate
      capsules downregulate tumor cell phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (pERK)1/2.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks.
