      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 in combination with temozolomide
      in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

      II. To study the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABT-888 and PARP inhibition in peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to recommend a Phase 2 dose of ABT-888 in combination
      with temozolomide in children with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

      III. To describe the toxicities of the combination of ABT-888 and temozolomide in children
      with recurrent or refractory CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) prior to and following ABT-888 administration.

      II. To assess PARP expression and/or activity in tumor tissue obtained at either initial
      diagnosis or relapse.

      III. To determine expression and/or activity of DNA repair pathways, including MGMT and
      mismatch repair, in tumor tissues, when available.

      IV. To document, within the confines of this phase 1 trial, radiographic tumor response to
      ABT-888 and temozolomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ABT-888.

      Patients receive oral ABT-888 twice daily and oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 13-26 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetics and further laboratory analysis.
