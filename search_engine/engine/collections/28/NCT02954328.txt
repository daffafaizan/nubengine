      other study procedures. In the study will be used a battery-driven electrical stimulator.
      Stimulation and sham condition will be performed based on previous studies. Briefly, the
      anode will be placed over the PFC and the cathode over the right supraorbital region. The
      real tDCS condition will consist of 20 min of continuous stimulation at target intensity of
      1.5 mA. This amount of stimulation is safe for healthy young and older adults and has been
      shown to induce acute beneficial changes in cortical excitability and cognitive functions.
      For the sham condition, an inactive stimulation protocol would be followed, as compared with
      an 'off-target' active protocol, in order to minimize participant risk.

      Pre- and post-tDCS assessments will include:

      Gait assessment: Gait parameters will include both spatial and temporal parameters obtained
      using body fixed wearable sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) [Weiss et al. 2015; Ben et
      al. 2015]. Parameters will include (but are not limited to) gait speed, stride length and
      stride time as well as rhythmicity measures such as stride to stride variability and gait
      regularity.

      Fall history and fear of falling will also be assessed (e.g., Falls Efficacy Scale
      International, FES-I) to further characterize the cohort and explore possible confounds.

      Cognitive assessment: A detailed computerized cognitive battery that has been used
      extensively at TASMC in different cohorts [Dwolatzky et al. 2003;Hausdorff et al.
      2006;Springer et al. 2006;Yogev et al. 2005;Aarsland et al. 2003] will quantify several
      cognitive domains including working memory, executive function, verbal function, problem
      solving, a global cognitive score, and attention.
