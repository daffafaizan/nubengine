      Patients will receive written information of the study together with the time for
      colonoscopy. A specific research nurse will call them and for those accepting participation,
      history and current medication will be collected. Kits will be sent to patients and they will
      provide three faecal samples before examination. These will be analysed at one certified
      laboratory.

      Hemoglobin concentration will be notified in the range of 50 - < 1000 ng/mL, or as a negative
      outcome.

      Macroscopic findings at the colonoscopy will be collected, as well as the outcome of the
      pathological report.
