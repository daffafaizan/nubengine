    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of creatine
      monohydrate, a dietary supplement, on skeletal muscle size and function (i.e., strength,
      energy metabolism, work capacity, fatigue); whole-body exercise performance; and body
      composition. This study is also designed to determine whether creatine supplementation
      augments the functional benefit derived from progressive resistance exercise. The safety of
      creatine supplementation in people with HIV infection will also be evaluated. Forty
      HIV-positive subjects will be randomly assigned, on a 1:1 basis, to receive creatine
      monohydrate or placebo for a period of 14 days, followed by a 12-week program of supervised
      progressive resistance exercise training during which administration of creatine monohydrate
      or placebo will continue.

      Measurements of muscle strength, size, composition, energetics and fatigue, as well as body
      weight and composition and serum biochemistries, will be made at baseline, after two weeks of
      treatment with creatine or placebo (before PRT), and again after 12 weeks of PRT (study week
      14). Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
