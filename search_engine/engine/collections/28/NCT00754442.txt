      Vitamin D must then be activated by both the liver and the kidneys to perform its function of
      maintaining strong bones and helping to prevent heart disease, infection, diabetes and
      cancer. Reduced kidney activation of Vitamin D occurs with advanced age and with all kidney
      diseases. We have identified a small group of patients who appear to have reduced ability of
      the kidneys to activate vitamin D, even though they are young and do not have chronic kidney
      disease. In these patients, we are comparing the ability of their kidneys to activate Vitamin
      D to that of healthy controls. To stimulate the kidneys to activate Vitamin D, we are giving
      parathyroid hormone intravenously over 8 hours and collecting blood and urine at baseline, 4
      and 8 hours. This type of parathyroid infusion does not cause side effects. The gene that
      controls this activation is also being studied (by a simple blood test) to look for
      abnormalities. We are now actively recruiting healthy controls for this study.
