      a cohort of non-obese, non-diabetic, insulin resistant subjects. The insulin sensitivity of
      180 subjects will be initially estimated by measuring fasting glucose and insulin levels
      (homeostasis model assessment) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The 60 most insulin
      resistant subjects will then be randomized to 6 weeks of therapy with either 600 mg three
      times a day of LA or placebo. To quantitate the ALA-induced improvements, euglycemic
      hyperinsulinemic clamps to evaluate insulin sensitivity, OGTT using deuterated glucose to
      evaluate glycolytic glucose disposal, and muscle biopsies to evaluate insulin signaling
      pathways, will be performed before and after treatment. We believe these studies will (1)
      confirm the beneficial effect of CR-ALA on insulin sensitivity; (2) further our understanding
      of the molecular mechanisms of LA action; and (3) because these insulin resistant subjects
      are at risk for the development of type 2 diabetes, the Metabolic Syndrome, and coronary
      artery disease (CAD), a demonstration of the beneficial effects of LA on insulin action could
      ultimately have important public health consequences.
