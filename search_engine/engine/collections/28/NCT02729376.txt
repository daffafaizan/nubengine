      tobacco using, male subjects will be enrolled. Screening of subjects will occur within 28
      days prior to dosing. On Day 1, a single dose of radio-labeled galeterone will be
      administered orally. Blood, urine, and fecal samples will be collected until release criteria
      are met to measure total radioactivity, for analysis of galeterone concentrations, and for
      potential metabolic profiling.
