    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Submit tumor and serum samples for central review

        -  Imatinib 600 mg (orally qd);

        -  Docetaxel 30mg/m2 (4 of 6 weeks);1 cycle = 6 weeks

        -  Evaluate every other cycle

      Each cycle will begin only when the granulocyte count is > 1,500/mm3 and the platelet count
      is > 100,000/mm3 and any other treatment-related toxicities are < grade 1. If the toxicity is
      not resolved to grade 0 or 1 after three weeks, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.
      For days 8, 15, and 22 patients must have an absolute neutrophil count > 1,000/mm3 or greater
      and platelet count > 75,000/mm3. Imatinib mesylate can be administered if platelets >20,000
      and ANC >500.
