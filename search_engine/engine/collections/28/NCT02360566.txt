      intervention, is an effective, feasible, and acceptable means of treating people in the early
      stages of psychotic illnesses.

      We intend to randomly assign 20 patients being treated for psychotic illnesses in an early
      intervention program to a Participatory Video intervention group or treatment as usual group
      (control). Participants who are randomly assigned to the Participatory Video intervention
      will take part in 12 expert-facilitated group-based workshops over a period of 6 months, in
      which they will learn how to develop, film and produce a documentary-style video of their
      experiences with psychosis. At the end of the 12 workshops participants will have worked
      together to produce a group documentary video about their experiences with psychosis and,
      should they wish, individual videos about their own personal experiences with psychosis.
      Participants in the Participatory Video intervention group will receive the intervention in
      addition to any treatment they would usually receive through the early psychosis program.
      Those assigned to the treatment as usual group will continue to receive the standard care
      available to them in the early psychosis program.

      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, at 6-months (immediately post-intervention) and
      at 9 months (3 months post-intervention) on a number measures. Participatory Video
      intervention acceptability will be assessed through the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and
      qualitative interviews, feasibility will be assessed through recruitment, consent and
      completion rates, and efficacy will be assessed on measures of symptoms, functioning,
      subjective recovery, metacognitive capacity and narrative development.
