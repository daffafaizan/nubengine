      mild-to-moderate depression and/or anxiety. Two 8-week long MBCT groups will be held between
      September 2019 and March 2020, based on the adapted protocol. Modifications will include
      shortening the traditional 120-minute to 90-minute format and performing mindful yoga from a
      chair, instead of a floor mat. Participants will be recruited from the community, according
      to the eligibility criteria detailed below. The participants' pre- and post-MBCT anxiety
      and/or depressive symptom severity and mindfulness levels (as measured with standardized,
      validated scales) will be compared, using a paired t-test.
