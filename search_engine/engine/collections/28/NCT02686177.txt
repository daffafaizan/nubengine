      efficacy is documented. Beside their therapeutic benefits, direct cardiovascular effects have
      also been reported. However, safety aspects are also important to evaluate with respect to
      micro and macrovascular complications associated with T2D. T2D patients treated with GLP-1
      analogs may suffer from microvascular complications such as macular oedema and proliferative
      retinopathy, characterized by excessive retinal angiogenesis. Few studies have properly
      addressed the role of GLP-1-based therapies in regulating vascular integrity and
      angiogenesis. The role of GLP-1 on endothelial cell (EC) growth, EC integrity and
      angiogenesis thus needs to be characterized. Our aim is to provide the proof of concept that
      agonists of GLP-1 regulate angiogenesis in humans and identify the underlying mechanisms. The
      present project is the translational part of the ANR Angiosafe-T2D, regarding clinical safety
      aspects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (namely Liraglutide) on angiogenesis.

      The study evaluate the impact of one-month treatment Liraglutide on both ANGPT2 and ANGLPT4
      levels and endothelial circulating progenitor cells, angiogenesis biomarkers in type 2
      diabetic patients.
