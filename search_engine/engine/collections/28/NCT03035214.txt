      Maadi, Ghamra military hospitals, and Ain Shams University hospitals, will be prospectively
      enrolled within 24 hours after birth. Daily evaluation of oxygen histograms with measurement
      of the cumulative time of oxygen saturations below 80%, (risk of hypoxemia and potential
      tissue hypoxia), and arterial oxygen saturations Sao2 above 95% (potential risk of hyperoxia
      and increased oxidative stress). Evaluation window will be on a weekly basis as long as the
      infant is on oxygen support and by applying oxygen tolerance test. The treating clinical team
      will be blinded to all results of Oxygen tolerance test.
