      than the general population. Interns also tend to have lower sleep and decreased physical
      activity. The goal of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile health intervention
      intending to help improve the mental health of medical interns. The intervention sends mobile
      phone notifications which aim to help interns improve their mood, maintain physical activity,
      and obtain adequate sleep during their internship year.

      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate how notifications affect participants' weekly
      mood, as measured through a daily one question mood survey. The second primary aim of the
      study is to evaluate how notifications affect participants' long-term mental health, as
      measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire. The first secondary aim is to evaluate how mood
      notifications affect participants' weekly mood. The second secondary aim is to evaluate how
      activity notifications affect participants' weekly step count. The third secondary aim is to
      evaluate how sleep notifications affect participants' weekly sleep duration. In order to
      better optimize notification delivery, the final aim (exploratory) is to understand
      moderators of these effects. Moderators of interest are previous week's mood, previous week's
      step count, previous week's sleep duration, study week, sex, previous history of depression,
      and baseline neuroticism.
