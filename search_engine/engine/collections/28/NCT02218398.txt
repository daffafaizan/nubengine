      disease patients. It is assumed that patient's response to bronchodilator is the same during
      acute exacerbation or when stable whether on mechanical ventilation or not. Decision to treat
      is often independent of response and the patient's response to the medicine is not precisely
      evaluated. Investigators developed a test to assess the bronchodilator effects in
      mechanically ventilated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients by comparing the
      change of airway resistance. No matter whether patients respond to bronchodilator or not,
      they are randomized assigned to bronchodilator 3-4 times per day group and no bronchodilator
      group. Then investigators could objectively decide whether individual patients need or
      benefit from bronchodilator administration.
