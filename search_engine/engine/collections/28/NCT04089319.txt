      outpatient integrative health (IH) oncology clinic in the USA. Likewise, the combination of
      acupuncture and mindfulness combined as not been studied. Given that both acupuncture and
      mindfulness have demonstrated some analgesic relief in an acute pain setting, each merit
      study for pain relief in an outpatient setting.

      The investigators are evaluating the impact of two different acupuncture approaches for
      patients reporting chronic pain. Acupuncture will be provided by a Licensed Acupuncturist for
      patients reporting chronic pain. Participants will be randomized to one of two treatments -
      acupuncture as usual or acupuncture plus mindfulness.

      The investigators will collect data regarding chronic pain, interoceptive awareness, emotion
      regulation, and acceptability. The study is open to participants with any etiology and any
      location of chronic pain.
