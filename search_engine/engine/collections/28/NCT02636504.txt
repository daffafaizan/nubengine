      tooth in question. Vitality of a tooth is defined as the presence of blood flow into the
      tooth. The vitality status of a tooth will affect the success of endodontic treatment, and
      therefore plays an important role in treatment planning. Two established methods of
      determining vitality are electric pulp tests and cold tests. However, both these methods have
      drawbacks. Both methods use the presence of sensory feedback in the tooth as a predictor of
      tooth vitality. This can lead to errors because blood flow and nerves in the tooth may be
      lost at different times, resulting in false-positive and false-negative responses. Both are
      subjective and patient-dependent, relying on the patient to indicate when pain is felt. In
      addition, studies have suggested that electric pulp testing and cold tests are not as
      reliable in immature teeth, teeth undergoing orthodontic movement, traumatized teeth, and
      teeth with significant secondary dentin. Laser Doppler flowmetry is a technique that utilizes
      the Doppler principle to determine blood flow. It has been used widely in the medical field
      to measure blood flow in the skin. Some studies have also shown good results in measuring
      blood flow in the pulp of teeth. The objectives of this study are to determine the
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy
      of laser Doppler flowmetry in determining the vitality of teeth and comparing with those of
      electric pulp testing and cold testing.
