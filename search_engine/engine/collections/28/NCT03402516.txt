      hysteroscopic resections are thus frequent. This management is a minimally invasive surgery.

      Usually, a 26Fr resectoscope is used and the main articles on this topic report hysteroscopie
      resections with a 26Fr resectoscope. Miniaturization of resector led to decrease in the size
      of resectors with a potential benefit because of a less important cervical dilatation and
      then a smaller risk of adverse events and an increase in the number of surgery under local
      anaesthesia.

      Use of 18.5Fr resectors is more and more frequent but, to our knowledge, it has never been
      evaluated for benefit on cervical dilatation but also for rate of complete resection in one
      time, surgical length and rate of unbalanced input/output.

      Intuitively, a smaller diameter could led to a less traumatic cervical dilatation but it
      could also led to an higher risk of incomplete treatment in one time and a longer surgical
      duration and a more frequent unbalanced input/output.

      No study compare use of these two resectors (18.5 and 26Fr) all the more randomized. With
      26Fr resector, the rate of complete resection in one time for less than 3cm myoma is around
      90%. If this rate is higher with the 18.5Fr resector, the risk/benefit balance (including
      economic evaluation) won't be favorable to this use.
