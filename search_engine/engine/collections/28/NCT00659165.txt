      properties. In limited studies, it has been shown to result in less weight gain in type 1 and
      type 2 diabetics compared with other long acting insulin formations. A possible mechanism for
      its weight neutrality is the fatty acid chain that may allow for improved central nervous
      system activity and effects on satiety. The primary objective of this study is to determine
      if patients with type 1 diabetes consume fewer calories when allowed to eat to satiety while
      treated with insulin detemir compared to insulin glargine. Secondary objectives are 1)
      subject responses on validated satiety scales and food diaries, 2) bioelectrical impedance
      analysis, 3) resting energy expenditure on indirect calorimetry/metabolic cart measurement,
      and 4) centrally acting mediators of satiety measured in the serum (Peptide YY [PYY],
      ghrelin, leptin).
