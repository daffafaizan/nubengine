    
      IN TEST SITE :

      Local anesthesia will be administered and Vertical incisions will be given at interdental
      papillae away from recession defect site and a pouch will be created. A sulcular incision
      will be made through each recession area and the tissues will be gradually undermined
      including the base of the interdental papilla. At the recession sites rhEGF incorporated
      absorbable collagen membrane will be gradually manipulated into the pouch through the tunnel
      till it covers the recession sites and will be stabilized with sutures.

      IN CONTROL SITE:

      Same procedure will be done as the test site but plain collagen membrane will be gradually
      manipulated into the pouch through the tunnel till it covers the recession sites and will be
      stabilized with sutures.
