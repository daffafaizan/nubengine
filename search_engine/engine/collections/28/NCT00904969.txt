    
      A multi-center study conducted under a common implant and follow-up protocol. The study will
      collect pre-operative urologic testing, medical history and subject quality of life
      (Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire). Intra-operative procedural data will be
      collected.

      Pad weight and incontinence severity rating (using the International Consultation on
      Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)) will be used to characterize continence status.

      Post-operative complications, urologic testing, and subject quality of life will be collected
      at six weeks and three, six, 12, and 24 months.
