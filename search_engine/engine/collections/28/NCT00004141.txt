        -  Determine the toxicity of cisplatin and dacarbazine followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF),
           interferon alfa, and interleukin-2 in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the objective response rate, relapse free survival, and overall survival of
           these patients on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour and dacarbazine IV over 30-60 minutes
      sequentially on day 1, followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-7,
      interleukin-2 SC on days 8-14, and interferon alfa SC on days 8, 10, 12, and 14. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression, and then every 8-12 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
