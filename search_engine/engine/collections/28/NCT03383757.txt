      conditions to ensure proper function (clinical performance) with the U-TruSignal device.

      The study will include both the TruSignal AllFit Sensor and TruSignal Sensitive Sensor.

      After providing consent, no preparation beyond the investigational site's standard of care is
      required before study procedures begin. At the start of the procedure, one to two sensors,
      upon the discretion of the investigator, shall be applied to the subject.

      The duration of the subject's participation in the study is dependent upon the scheduled
      routine arterial blood draw and obtaining the maximum of 6 data pairs (3 data pairs per
      sensor). The Investigator or designated study staff will collect of SpO2 and pulse rate for
      each study subject. Laboratory results from arterial blood draw will be collected from the
      hospital's medical records. The description, severity, and device relatedness of any AE or
      SAE during the study will be recorded.
