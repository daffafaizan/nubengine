    
      A double-blind, single centre comparative study in which fourteen groups of 40 male and
      female adults >18 years of age will be randomly allocated to receive 1.7, 5, 15 or 45 Âµg
      quantities of whole virion (WV), Aluminium -adjuvanted WV(Al-WV), and virosomal (V) influenza
      A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) vaccines by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle; or 5
      or 15microg WV vaccine administered by intradermal injection. A second dose of the same
      vaccine containing the same quantity of antigen as in the first dose will be administered 21
      days later. Subjects will be observed for local and systemic reactions for 30 minutes after
      each immunisation (day 0 and 21), and will be monitored for any reactions and other adverse
      events for 7 days after immunisation. Blood for immunogenicity studies will be obtained at
      day 0 (pre-immunisation), day-21 (+4 days), and at day-42 (i.e., 21 +4 days after the second
      immunization). Immunogenicity will be evaluated by haemagglutination inhibition, virus
      neutralization,, single radial haemolysis, neuraminidase inhibition and cellular mediated
      responses (in a subset of 5-10 subjects from each group).
