      that bariatric surgery and intensive lifestyle intervention could lead to remission in
      diabetic patients. Our present study aims to assess the effect of dapagliflozin add-on
      intensive lifestyle intervention on remission of type 2 diabetes in obese patients with type
      2 diabetes. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The
      study consists of a 12-months treatment period (in which subjects will receive either
      dapagliflozin plus intensive lifestyle intervention or placebo plus intensive lifestyle
      intervention in addition to the background therapy), and a 2-month follow-up period after
      treatment period.
