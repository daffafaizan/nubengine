      and AIDS, the ability to effectively combat the disease is inconsequential when individuals
      do not take their medication as prescribed and do not attend their scheduled medical
      appointments. Non-adherence to effective ART and medical visits is widespread in the United
      States, especially among ethnic minorities. A recent study indicated that patients who miss a
      medical appointment in the first year of an HIV diagnosis show over twice the mortality rate
      of patients who attended all visits. This study is developed to investigate the relationship
      between HIV Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) and adherence to HIV treatment among
      traditionally marginalized populations. Participants will be administered a brief
      neuropsychiatric screener. Participants will be randomly enrolled one of two cognitive
      rehabilitation programs so they may learn compensatory cognitive strategies to remain
      treatment adherent, or they will be receive psychoeducation concerning the importance of
      taking their medications and regularly attending medical appointments. Participants will be
      tracked and followed-up with regarding their treatment adherence in regular intervals over
      the course of 6 months.
