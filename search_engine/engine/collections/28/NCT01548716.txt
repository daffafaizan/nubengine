      25-hydroxy vitamin D levels from our ongoing study in HD patients with itching. The primary
      endpoints for both studies are continuous variables. Student's t test will be used to test
      for statistical significance. Multiple regression analysis will be used for controlling
      covariates and testing the interaction among covariates.
