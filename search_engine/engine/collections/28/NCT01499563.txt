      study in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and an acute exacerbation of psychosis. The
      efficacy and safety of two dose levels of ITI-007 administered daily for 28 days will be
      evaluated as compared to placebo; risperidone has been included as a positive control.

      Upon completion of the inpatient 28-day Study Treatment Period, patients will be started on
      standard antipsychotic medication and will be stabilized over a 5-day period before discharge
      from the study clinic. Patients will be seen for a final outpatient safety evaluation at the
      End-of-Study visit approximately 2 weeks after discharge.
