      following 3 cycles of the standard salvage regimen of RICE for the treatment of relapsed or
      refractory diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study will include patients who have
      relapsed after 1 prior treatment regimen or who are refractory to initial chemotherapy. We
      will evaluate patients for response rate (both partial and complete), toxicities, as well as
      overall and progression free survival. Eligible patients will receive standard RICE x 3
      cycles followed by GaRD x 2 cycles. Patients who would otherwise be eligible, may then
      proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).
