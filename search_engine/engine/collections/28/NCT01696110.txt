      research and the study would enrolled a total of 2100 AMI patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) to one of three antithrombotic regimens: bivalirudin alone, or
      unfractionated heparin alone, or unfractionated heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
      inhibitor. All enrolled patients would be followed-up to 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year. The
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bivalirudin in AMI patients
      with DES.
