    
      The Reveal LINQâ„¢ Respiration study is a Non-Significant Risk IDE, observational,
      non-randomized, multi-center, clinical study. The study is expected to be conducted at up to
      5 centers in the United States and up to 100 subjects will be enrolled, with no more than 25
      subjects enrolled per site. In addition, a minimum of 30% of all enrolled subjects will have
      a history of heart failure.

      All enrolled subjects will either have the investigational LINQ HF or ALLEVIATE-HF RAMware
      downloaded onto their implanted Reveal LINQ device, Holter monitor and capnography monitor
      applied and undergo a series of activity and breathing maneuvers. The expected duration of
      subject participation in the study (from start of study procedures to study exit) is
      approximately 1.5 hours. The expected total study duration (from time of first enrollment to
      the exit of last enrolled subject) is approximately 3 months.

      All Adverse events will be collected throughout the study duration of a subject's
      participation in the study, beginning at the time of informed consent.
