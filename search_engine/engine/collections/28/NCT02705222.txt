      through detailed history taking, general and abdominal examination, local gynecological
      examination, transvaginal sonography (TVS) scanning and routine blood investigations.
      Eligible participants in our study will be those who complain of menorrhagia, metrorrhagia,
      polymenorrhoea or polymenorrhagia without local gynecological cause with failure of medical
      treatment for at least 3 months. All women participating in the study will be randomly
      allocated into two groups; dilatation and curettage (D&C) group and hysteroscopy group. For
      women in the D&C group, cervical dilatation and fractional endometrial curettage will be done
      under total intravenous (IV) anesthesia in operation theater and the curetting will be sent
      for histopathological examination. For women in the hysteroscopy group, hysteroscopy will be
      done under total IV anesthesia in operation theater hysteroscopic-guided curettings will also
      be taken and sent for histopathological examination.
