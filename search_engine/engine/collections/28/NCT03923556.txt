      kidney failure undergoing kidney transplantation surgery. Patients will have their muscles
      paralyzed during general anesthesia for surgery. At the end of surgery, muscle paralysis will
      be reversed with either neostigmine (control group) or sugammadex (intervention group).
      Residual muscle weakness and respiratory function will be monitored after surgery with a
      quantitative train-of-four (qTOF) monitor and a noninvasive continuous ventilation monitor.
      The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving sugammadex will have less residual
      muscle weakness and better respiratory function than patients receiving neostigmine.
      Respiratory and kidney function parameters and any adverse events will be collected during
      the hospital stay. Patients will contacted for a study follow up around 2 weeks after their
      surgery.
