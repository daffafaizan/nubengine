      musculature, and particularly of the external anal sphincter, is a frequent cause of anal
      incontinence and/or dyschesia. Biofeedback training is often offered to patients suffering
      from incontinence or constipation. However, its mechanisms of action is still controversial.

      Objective of the study: to compare excitability of the cortical area responsible for control
      volunteer of the external anal sphincter in healthy subjects before and after 4 biofeedback
      sessions.

      Subjects and methodology: we offer to perform two groups of 12 healthy subjects (one active
      and one control group) without any neurological or digestive disease and having never
      performed biofeedback. In each group, cortical excitability will be evaluated by cortical
      magnetic stimulation (curve intensity/amplitude, silent period, inter-stimulus period, motor
      threshold) before and after 4 biofeedback sessions (one session by week) in active group or 4
      placebo sessions (placebo group).

      We hope to show a modification of cortical excitability in subjects performing biofeedback
      compared to others.
