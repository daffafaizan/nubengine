      independent prostate cancer whom have a rising PSA while on chemotherapy. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate PSA response rates of the combination of Doxil and
      Thalidomide in patients with AIPC who have failed chemotherapy. Secondary objectives include:
      1) To evaluate the clinical response rate of this combination on measurable disease (If
      measurable soft tissue lesions are present on radiological or clinical exam) ; 2) To evaluate
      overall survival for this combination. There will be between 18 and 35 subjects at least 18
      years of age enrolled on this single site study.
