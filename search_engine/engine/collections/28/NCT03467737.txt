      stunted children have low pancreatic Î±-amylase activity; and 2.) Modified starchy food
      preparations will have better (higher) digestibility than the commonly given foods for both
      moderately malnourished stunted and healthy non-stunted children. A noninvasive breath test
      was used to assess amylase insufficiency in moderately malnourished and stunted children in
      Mali, as well as in healthy children in Mali and the United States. Moderately malnourished
      and healthy children in Mali were fed sorghum porridges, which are commonly consumed in Mali.
      Porridges contained a 13C-labeled substrate (algal starch or octanoic acid) for assessment of
      amylase insufficiency and gastric emptying rate. In a follow-up study, healthy children in
      the United States were also assessed for amylase sufficiency.
