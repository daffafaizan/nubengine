      motion within a distinct area of the myocardium providing amendatory characterization of
      diastolic and systolic function of the heart. TDI is hypothesized to be of additional value
      in the evaluation of adult congenital heart disease, especially tetralogy of Fallot (TOF),
      which is one of the most common conditions. In particular, Fallot patients are at risk of
      developing right ventricular (RV) dysfunction due to pulmonary valve defects or alterations
      of the outflow tract. It is pivotal to recognize this progression at an early stage before
      irreversible changes occur. Aim of the study is to test feasibility of TDI in Fallot patients
      as a new technique that provides new parameters to characterize RV dysfunction, more precise
      than common methods. Additionally TDI is performed at rest and during different endurance
      testings (passive Leg Raising (PLR), handgrip (HG) and cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX), as
      certain changes might be compensated at rest, first apparent during exercise.
