      undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplants. Driven by inflammation, oGVHD can result in
      damage to the ocular surface and tear-producing glands, which over time significantly
      diminishes quality of life and restricts daily activities due to visual impairment.

      Early studies in animals and humans indicate that Brimonidine nano-emulsion, also known as
      OCU300, may relieve the signs and symptoms of oGVHD. These symptoms include blurry vision,
      foreign body sensation, burning sensation, severe light sensitivity, chronic conjunctivitis
      (pink or red eye), dry eyes and eye pain.

      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, multicenter phase 3 study
      in the United States conducted at approximately 15 centers. Upon meeting the eligibility
      criteria, enrolled subjects with a diagnosis of definite oGVHD will be randomly assigned in a
      2:1 (test: control) fashion to receive either Brimonidine Nanoemulsion Eye Drops 0.18%
      investigational product (test) or ophthalmic buffered saline (placebo).
