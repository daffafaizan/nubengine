    
      The purpose of CLCT-006, a multi-center open-label study, is to evaluate the safety of CL-108
      (hydrocodone 7.5 mg/APAP 325 mg, promethazine 12.5 mg) for the treatment of moderate to
      severe acute pain ("flare") associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip under actual
      conditions of use.

      The study will also endeavor to determine

        -  the physicians' global evaluation of CL-108 as a treatment for moderate to severe acute
           pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip

        -  the patients' global impression of change in pain after treatment of moderate to severe
           acute pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip

        -  any change in the patient's quality of life after treatment of moderate to severe acute
           pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip

        -  the percentage change in pain intensity after treatment of moderate to severe acute pain
           associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip
