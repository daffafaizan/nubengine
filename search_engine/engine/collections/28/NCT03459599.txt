      mortality in developing countries. Ragged placental membrane is a risk factor for
      endometritis and is not infrequently encountered. Several hospitals in Malaysia, largely
      those geographically-removed currently practice administering prophylactic antibiotics for
      women with ragged placental membranes. The aim is to reduce the risk of postpartum
      endometritis in a subgroup of women who may present in dire straits. The investigators sought
      to examine the necessity of such protocols.
