    
      The Utrecht Symptom Diary-4 dimensional (USD-4D), a Dutch instrument based on the Edmonton
      Symptom Assessment Scale, will be used for multidimensional screening and assessment of
      intensity and prevalence of symptoms. The questionnaire assesses twelve symptoms: pain,
      sleeping problems, dry mouth, dysphagia, anorexia, constipation, nausea, dyspnoea, fatigue,
      anxiety, depressed mood and confusion. This is measured on a numeric scale from 0 (no
      complaints) to 10 (worst imaginable or intolerable).

      The prevalence of symptoms will be described by frequencies, dichotomizing symptom scores in
      absent (0 on NRS) or present (1 or higher on NRS). Symptom scores of 4 or higher on NRS are
      considered clinically relevant.

      There is a possibility to add two more complaints not enlisted and to prioritise the problems
      which should be addressed first by the HCP.

      Quality of life is assessed using a (un)well-being measure and the opportunity to score the
      experienced value of life.

      Finally, five multidimensional questions will screen for mental capacity ("draagkracht"), the
      relationship with loved ones and thoughts concerning end of life. These multidimensional
      questions will be filled out together with the HCP. Therefore the HCP decides beforehand
      whether those questions will be asked.

      The USD-4D will be filled out only once by participating patients without follow-up. The
      patients will be asked to fill out the following characteristics: age, gender, education
      level, cultural background, living situation, underlying disease, comorbidities, performance
      score, medication groups and interventions.

      The estimated time to fill out both questionnaires is fifteen to twenty-five minutes.
