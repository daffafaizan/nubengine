    
      Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score; Grade B) caused by Hepatitis C
      or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis are enrolled to the study. In Phase 1, one of 3 doses of
      AD-MSCs is administered by 1 hour single intravenous infusion. Patients are hospitalized for
      1 week and a recommended dose for Phase 2 is determined by the evaluation of the safety and
      efficacy. In Phase 2, patients with the same disease criteria are enrolled and dosed to
      investigate the exploratory efficacy and safety.

      The safety and efficacy are evaluated until 24 weeks after dosing both in Phase 1 and Phase
      2.
