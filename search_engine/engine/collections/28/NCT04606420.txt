    
      100 patients who have early Alzheimer's disease (MoCA above 17) in the San Francisco Bay area
      are being enrolled over time and are randomly assigned to one of two groups.

      After baseline testing, the first group then receives this lifestyle medicine program for 20
      weeks, four hours/day, three days/week (all done virtually via Zoom since March 2020 due to
      COVID-19).

      The second group will not receive the lifestyle program for 20 weeks and will serve as a
      randomized control group during this phase of the study.

      Both groups will be re-tested after 20 weeks.

      Then, the second group will "cross over" and receive this lifestyle medicine program for 20
      weeks and the first group will continue the lifestyle program for 20 additional weeks. After
      a total of 40 weeks, both groups will be re-tested again and compared. Those initially
      randomly assigned to the control group will receive the intervention for 40 weeks and then be
      re-tested at that time.

      The intervention may be extended beyond 40 weeks.
