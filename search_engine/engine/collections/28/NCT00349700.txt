      animal studies and studies at ulcers smaller than 20 cm². Mostly larger venous leg ulcers
      have a stronger exudation than smaller leg ulcers. Therefore larger ulcers exhibit apparently
      moist conditions also beneath simple gauze, ointments and compresses.

      The purpose of the study was to investigated if modern wound dressings adapting to wound
      exudation and the amount of bacterial colonization can heal large therapy resistant leg
      ulcers which had a pre-treatment with compresses, ointments and gauze.

      Patients and Methods: In an open, non-randomized prospective trial 139 consecutive patients
      (86 female, 53 male) with long standing (159 ± 335 weeks) large sized (> 20 cm², 53.8 ± 90.6
      cm²) venous ulcers were included. The pre-treatment with compresses, ointments and gauze and
      two layer short stretch bandages during the time before consulting our wound outpatient
      department was compared to the following therapy protocol: After two weeks with four layer
      bandages compression stockings were applied. After a surgical debridement wound dressings
      were applied according to exudation (strong: calcium alginate, mean: polyurethane foam, low:
      hydrocolloid). Critical bacterial colonization was treated by activated charcoal cloth with
      sil-ver. Criteria for evaluating efficacy were healing time and reduction of ulcer size at
      the end of observation time.
