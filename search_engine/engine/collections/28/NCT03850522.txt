      progression to the incurable cancer multiple myeloma. While many patients live for many years
      without progression, high risk patients have a median risk of progression of 29 months. No
      therapy has been approved for this indication. New treatments with limited adverse events are
      in high demand for this unmet medical need. An effective peptide vaccine would represent an
      ideal candidate, since vaccines generally have very low levels of side effects.

      This study will explore if vaccination against the immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1 leads to
      responses in patients with high risk smoldering myeloma. PD-L1 is thought to play a role in
      the rate of progression from smoldering myeloma to symptomatic myeloma. Targeting this
      pathway with little risk of adverse events would potentially prevent or delay progression to
      symptomatic myeloma.
