      treatment in the RTF (abstinent <3 months) were administered the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale
      Symptom Checklist (ASRS) v. 1.1 Screener. Patients who screened positive(>= 4 out 6
      significant items) were then administered the Adult Clinician Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) v.1.2
      to establish a diagnosis of ADHD and the Predictive Value Positive (PVP) in this population.

      Phase II (Treatment): Participants who screened positive for ADHD on the ACDS were given
      informed consent and baseline evaluations for inclusion. Those meeting inclusion/exclusion
      criteria were treated with atomoxetine starting at 25 mg/day. The dose was adjusted based on
      clinical response and tolerability over a 4-week period up to 120 mg/day and held constant
      for the final six weeks of the trial.
