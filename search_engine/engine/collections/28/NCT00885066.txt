      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum-tolerated dose of the combination of gemcitabine hydrochloride,
           capecitabine, and erlotinib hydrochloride in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Analyze the limiting toxicities according to CTC.

        -  Analyze the toxicity according to CTC.

        -  Determine the recommended dose.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic dosages of the three drugs.

        -  Analyze interactions between the drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive one course of chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21, and oral erlotinib
