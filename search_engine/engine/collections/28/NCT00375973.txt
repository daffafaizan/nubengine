      months duration that cannot be fully explained by an identifiable medical condition . Pain
      symptoms are also a part of the diagnostic criteria for CFS, and include muscle pain,
      multi-joint pain, and headaches. The prevalence of CFS ranges from 0.007 to 2.8 % in the
      general adult population and 0.006 to 3.0% in primary care practice (2). Although most who
      receive a CFS diagnosis are 30-40 years of age, Caucasian, and female, CFS affects both women
      and men, adults and children, and all racial and socioeconomic classes.

      Patients with CFS have 2-4 times the rate of depression and anxiety compared with the general
      population. CFS is also commonly comorbid with fibromyalgia, a disorder characterized by
      chronic widespread pain, tenderness, fatigue, sleep and mood disturbances. In some samples,
      70% of patients with fibromyalgia also meet criteria for CFS. CFS and fibromyalgia are
      characterized by greater similarities than differences and may share pathophysiologic
      features. Like fibromyalgia, CFS is associated with chronic pain, sleep and mood
      disturbances. Because fibromyalgia responds to treatment with antidepressants, particularly
      the dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, including duloxetine,
      antidepressant trials in CFS are clearly needed.
