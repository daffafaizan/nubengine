      critically ill adults. The population of this study is defined from the ages of 18-90
      admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). This study will compare the
      glucose-insulin dynamics in critically ill adults that are feed using either a CGF or IGF
      scheme while their glucose concentrations are maintained between 140-180 mg/dl using an
      insulin infusion protocol. Randomization performed using computer generated random numbers
      kept individually in sealed envelopes. All participants will have nasal gastric or oral
      gastric (NG/OG) tube previously placed for their nutritional needs. The amount of Osmolite
      given will be determined by the ideal weight for each participant: 1.2 cal/ml Osmolite with
      caloric goal of 25 kcal/kg/day. Feeding intolerance develops which is defined as: excessive
      abdominal distention, emesis, abdominal pain, vomiting and gastric residual > 250 ml for IGF
      and gastric residual > 500 ml for CGF.
