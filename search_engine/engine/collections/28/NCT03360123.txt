      during dental treatment. Triazolam and nitrous oxide are commonly used in adult patients
      requiring anxiolysis during dental treatment. The participants in this study are patients
      already scheduled for 2 sedation appointments to complete their dental treatment. The
      medications are both benzodiazepines that have similar risks, neither medication has greater
      adverse effects than the other. This study will evaluate the perceptions of the effects of
      the medications via a parent survey and chart review. The goal of the study is to determine
      which anxiolytic medication is perceived to provide a better sedation experience for older
      pediatric patients based on parent perception of the medication's effects and the patient's
      behavior during dental treatment.
