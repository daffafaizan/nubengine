    
      The Neo Non-Randomized Hypertension Study is a non-randomized, open-label, verification study
      in participants diagnosed with drug resistant hypertension, defined as medical treatment
      failure for hypertension defined as office cuff systolic blood pressure (SBP) â‰¥ 140 mmHg
      despite being prescribed to at least three antihypertensive medications, including a
      diuretic, in accordance with the AHA guidelines.

      Participants should remain on their prescribed anti-hypertensive medications and same dosing
      schedule for the duration of the study unless investigators determine medically necessary
      changes are needed. Additionally, every effort should be made to maintain adequate rate
      control for subjects with atrial fibrillation throughout the duration of the study.

      All (Canadian) participants are now in long term follow-up and are required to have at least
      one annual visit.

      Parameters assessed during long-term follow-up visits:

        -  Physical Assessment

        -  Office Cuff Blood Pressure

        -  Subject Medications

        -  Serious adverse events
