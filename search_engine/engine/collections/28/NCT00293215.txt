    
      Subjects received a single infusion of 111-In-CMD-193 on Day 1. Collection of blood for PK
      and whole body gamma camera imaging for assessment of biodistribution and tumor uptake were
      performed on Days 1, 2, 3 or 4, 5 or 6, and 7 or 8 following the 111-In-CMD-193 infusion.
      Subjects were evaluated for safety for 3 hours post-infusion on Day 1 of each cycle, with
      subsequent safety assessments performed on Days 8 and 15. Blood for human anti-human antibody
      (HAHA) response was collected pre-infusion, prior to each subsequent cycle (every 3 weeks)
      and at study discontinuation.

      CMD-193 was administered on Day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle as a 60 (Â± 5) minute
      intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 1.0 mg/m^2 in Cohort 1 and 2.6 mg/m^2 in Cohort 2.
      Each subject received up to 6 cycles of CMD-193 (including the initial infusion of
      111-In-CMD-193) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.
      Up to 6 additional cycles of CMD-193 were permitted if approved by the Sponsor in subjects
      who tolerated CMD-193 treatment and had evidence of response. Pretreatment medications (e.g.,
      paracetamol, promethazine hydrochloride) were to be administered to reduce the incidence and
      severity of an anticipated infusion syndrome characterized by fever and chills, and less
      commonly hypotension.

      Restaging by computed tomography (CT) scan was performed at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6.
      Assessment of tumor metabolism was performed by positron emission tomography with 18F-labeled
      fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET) prior to Cycle 1 and at the time of restaging at the end of
      Cycles 2 and 4.
