      which in turn, confers a higher cardiovascular risk in this population. Diabetic patients
      undergoing PCI have worse outcomes than non-diabetics regardless of the degree of complexity
      of their coronary anatomy. Although the 30-day in-hospital outcomes have been similar between
      diabetic and non-diabetic patients, DM has been invariably associated with greater stent
      failure with target vessel revascularization (TVR), major adverse cardiovascular event
      (MACE), and mortality in the long-term follow-up, even with the use of drug-eluting stents.
      In relation to the above, two of the sirolimus-eluting stents (SES): the Abluminus and the
      Orsiro, have been considered as promising options in patients with DM. The Abluminus stent
      has been designed for diabetic patients in order to reduce cardiovascular events. Said stent
      consists of a cobalt-chromium platform covered with a layer of biodegradable polymer and
      mounted on a balloon, both sirolimus-releasing. The Rate of target lesion failure (TLF)
      reported to date in diabetic patients is 3.8%. On the other hand, the Orsiro stent, a
      cobalt-chromium platform with ultrathin struts, has had favorable results in different
      clinical settings and patients with different characteristics]; specifically in a subgroup
      analysis in DM, a TLF rate of 3.5% was reported
