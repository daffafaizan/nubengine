    
      This is an open-label study (participants and the study physician [Investigator] will know
      the identity of the assigned treatments) to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) (how the drugs
      are absorbed in the body) and pharmacodynamics (PD) (the actions or effects of drugs on the
      body) of rivaroxaban in study participants with mild or moderate renal impairment (reduced
      kidney function) receiving multiple doses of erythromycin, to the PK and PD of a single dose
      of rivaroxaban administered alone in study participants with normal renal function. The study
      drugs used will be rivaroxaban, a drug that acts to thin the blood to prevent the formation
      of blood clots, and erythromycin, an antibiotic used to treat patients with bacterial
      infections. Study participants with normal renal function will receive Treatment A (1 oral
      [by mouth] dose 10 mg rivaroxaban for 1 day) and Treatment C (500 mg oral erythromycin 3x a
      day (t.i.d.) on Days 1-6 + 1 oral dose of 10 mg rivaroxaban on Day 5). Study participants
      with mild and moderate renal impairment will receive Treatment A, Treatment B (500 mg oral
      erythromycin t.i.d. on Days 1-6 + 1 oral dose of 5 mg rivaroxaban Day 5), and Treatment C.
      Treatments A, B, and C will be separated by up to 14 days.
