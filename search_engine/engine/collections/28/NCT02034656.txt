      partly due to historical limitations in capabilities for mutation testing. While numerous
      mutation studies have been done in non-Asian populations, there are very few published
      reports on mutations in Asians. CML management in Asia therefore continues to be largely
      intuitive.

      Anecdotal reports, suggest that there may differences in the presence or absence of mutations
      at the time of initial diagnosis and their occurrence during imatinib treatment. At present,
      however, we have no comprehensive formal knowledge of the actual nature of mutations in
      Asians. There are moves towards the establishment of CML registries that will capture the
      pattern of mutations among Asian patients.

      In recent years, several laboratories in the region have been performing mutation analysis.
      However, no systematic evaluation of or report on these data has been undertaken. This study
      therefore intends to collect documented mutation data in Asian CML and Ph positive ALL
      patients from identified Asian institutes. While this is a retrospective, cross-sectional
      analysis of mutation information, the study will provide the first comprehensive formal
      report on mutations in Asian CML and Ph positive ALL patients. The collecting information has
      the potential better to inform the clinical management of CML and Ph positive ALL in Asia
      according to the mutation result and possibly future research in these patients.
