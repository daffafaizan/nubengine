    
      Cretan IAMA (CAPeo) is an essential oil mixture of three native herbs of Crete (Thymbra
      capitata (L.) Cav., Salvia fruticosa Mill. and Origanum dictamnus L.), which exhibits
      remarkable in vitro antiviral activity against Influenza A & B and the Human Rhinovirus
      HRV-14 strains, decreasing the symptoms of upper respiratory tract viral infections. It has
      also been proven safe in experimental animals and humans. There is currently a strong unmet
      medical need for safe and effective therapeutic regimens for patients in ambulatory settings.
      Given its properties, it was, therefore, deemed both appropriate and urgent to explore its
      potential in the context of COVID-19 for patients in primary care settings. It was also
      deemed important to investigate the Cretan IAMA (CAPeo) regarding prophylactic treatment for
      people coming in close contact with these ambulatory patients.

        -  Single-arm, open label (proof-of-concept) study to assess the potential of Cretan IAMA
           (CAPeo) benefit of COVID-19 as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent

        -  VRI/COVID-19 patients seeking primary health care services at home

        -  SARS-CoV-2 infection testing by real-time RT-PCR, performed in the regional COVID-19
           reference centre (Laboratory of Clinical Virology, University of Crete, School of
           Medicine)

        -  Cretan IAMA (CAPeo) to be administered in the form of two 0.5 ml soft capsules, in a
           concentration of 15 ml/L, daily for two weeks (14 days), per os

        -  Data collection on Day 1 (baseline), Day 4, Day 7 and Day 14
