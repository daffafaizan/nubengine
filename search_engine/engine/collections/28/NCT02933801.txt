      past few years. First line treatment with one of the novel antihormonal drugs abiraterone or
      enzalutamide followed by chemotherapy with docetaxel is now standard of care. If a patient
      has disease stabilization on chemotherapy he undergoes a watchful waiting period and further
      treatment is only started at the time of disease progression. This trial tests the immediate
      use of the novel androgen receptor antagonist ODM-201 as maintenance treatment after
      chemotherapy aiming at prolonging radiographic progression free survival as compared to
      watchful waiting.

      The main objective of the trial is to assess impact of maintenance therapy with ODM-201 on
      radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) of patients with mCRPC pretreated with novel
      hormonal agents who have non-progressive disease after chemotherapy with a taxane.
