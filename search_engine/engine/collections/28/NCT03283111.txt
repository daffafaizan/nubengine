      the consolidation treatment for advanced lymphoma patients and approved for treating
      recurrent and refractory lymphoma by prolonging progression-free survival significantly while
      also improving quality of life. Evidences to date, have validated that changes of
      T-lymphocyte subsets after autologous stem cell transplantation associated closely with
      immunologic reconstitution, and have produced amazing effects in prognosis. Whether
      T-lymphocyte subsets changes could serve as an effective index for prognosis has been a
      serious question for lymphoma patients treated by autologous stem cell transplantation. In
      this study, the investigators explore the changes of T-lymphocyte subsets in lymphoma
      patients before and after autologous stem cell transplantation, and evaluate the significant
      effect of T-lymphocyte subsets changes in immunologic reconstitution and prognosis in these
      patients.
