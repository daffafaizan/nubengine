      dysfunctional cortical inhibitory mechanisms and alterations in neurotrophins (biological
      markers involved in neuronal survival and plasticity) and that rTMS therapeutic effects are
      associated with changes in cortical excitability. CI produced by rTMS can be demonstrated
      through SICI, CSP and LICI. However it remains unclear which rTMS parameters induce the best
      CI. Exploring different rTMS stimulus conditions versus sham condition effects in CI of human
      motor cortex can be the way to identify the best rTMS therapeutic parameters. Also,
      evaluating the molecular effects produced by rTMS treatment on serum blood levels can help
      identify the mechanisms through which rTMS exerts its therapeutic effects and ultimately
      clarify mechanisms through which treatment effects are mediated.

      This experiment intends to demonstrate the best rTMS parameters to acquire higher CI. If our
      hypotheses are correct, these parameters will help to obtain higher therapeutic effects, and
      consequently, improvement of rTMS treatments.
