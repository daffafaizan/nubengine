      the detection of acidosis, alkalosis, electrolytes disturbance and tissue perfusion. in
      regard to tissue perfusion serum lactate above 4 mmol/L indicates poor tissue perfusion.
      serum lactate could be measured at ABG or separately. in this study we will test the effect
      of both noradrenaline and phenylephrine on lactate level at ABG during the stage of HIPAC in
      managing abdominal cancer patients.
