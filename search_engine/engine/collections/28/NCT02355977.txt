      combinatory efficacy of minocycline and scaling and root planning in the aspects of both
      clinical parameters [Pocket depth (PD) and sulcus bleeding index (SBI)] and the loads of four
      main periodontal pathogens [Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Fusobacterium
      nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Prevotella intermedia (Pi)]. Real-time
      quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) will be used as a powerful tool with high sensitivity and
      specificity to quantitatively assess target periodontal bacteria in a period of 7 days. The
      investigators will also try to correlate the reduction of either total or respective bacteria
      with the improvements of clinical parameters, with an aim to uncovering the potential
      microbiological mechanism accounting for the efficacy of a therapy.
