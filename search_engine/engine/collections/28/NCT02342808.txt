      above goal (e.g., systolic blood pressure [SBP]>140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure
      [DBP]>90 mm Hg), despite adherence to a regimen of 3 or more antihypertensive medications of
      different classes, one of which is a diuretic.

      With the growing prevalence of hypertension (HTN) in this country, RH is a major public
      health concern, affecting more than 7.5 million Americans. Patients with RH are 50% more
      likely to experience a CVD event, including stroke, kidney failure, myocardial infarction,
      and death, compared to patients with controlled BP. There is an urgent need for developing RH
      management strategies to lower BP as well as to reduce the high risk of CVD-related events.
      Lifestyle modifications, including exercise training and dietary modification, are of proven
      efficacy in lowering BP in unmedicated patients with HTN and are often recommended as the
      first step for treating high BP. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has
      been shown to lower BP in HTN patients who are not treated with drugs. Moreover, when the
      DASH diet is combined with exercise and caloric restriction, even greater, and quite marked,
      BP reductions can be achieved. However, the efficacy of these lifestyle modifications in HTN
      patients who are refractory to medical therapy is unknown. This application aims to build
      upon evidence supporting the value of lifestyle modifications in unmedicated patients with
      HTN by proposing a randomized clinical trial (RCT) that will evaluate whether an intensive,
      medically-supervised lifestyle intervention can successfully lower BP in medicated patients
      with RH.
