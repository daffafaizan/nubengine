      extent than normal cells. The effect of this PARP-inhibiting treatment is evident although
      the greatest effect is seen in patients with mutations in BRCA genes. The reason for this is
      that BRCA deficient cancer cells are unable to repair both DNA double strand and single
      strand breaks and undergo apoptosis to a large extent.
