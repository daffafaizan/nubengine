    
      This study is a sixteen week placebo-controlled, double-blind investigation of the effect of
      pramlintide on body weight in clozapine- and olanzapine-induced weight gain. We will recruit
      approximately 72 volunteers with the plan of having a final N = 25 in each of the 2 treatment
      groups. (This number is to allow for normal attrition in this patient population. If needed,
      we will recruit more than 72 volunteers in order to achieve the appropriate number of
      completed subjects.) Patients will be recruited from the local Dallas public and VA mental
      health systems as volunteers for this study. This study is anticipated to last 20 weeks (2
      weeks lead-in [approximately 2-3 visits], 1 week training [4 visits], 16 weeks active
      drug/placebo [one visit per week for the first 4 weeks, then one visit every 2 weeks for the
      remainder], and one week follow-up [one visit]. Please see attached chart for more details
      about each visit.) Volunteers will have to have a history of significant weight gain
      accompanying olanzapine or clozapine treatment and have a BMI=>27 and =<40. Each volunteer
      will be maintained on their optimal dose of clozapine or olanzapine and be randomized blindly
      to pramlintide or placebo. Pramlintide will be administered by the patients in a
      self-injectable form and dosing will begin at 180 mcg bid for 2 weeks and then increase to
      360 mcg bid for the remainder of the study. The randomization to pramlintide/placebo will be
      preceded by a week-long self-administration training program using placebo for pramlintide
      (with additional information regarding nutrition, exercise, general self-care, and risk
      factors for diabetes being provided to the patients during this training program).
