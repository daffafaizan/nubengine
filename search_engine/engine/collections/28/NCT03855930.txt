      temporo-spatial cortical activation during micturition and pain generation.

      We hypothesis that in amputees with phantom-limb pain a shift of the genital representation
      into the leg representation will occur; and will be demonstrated as an uni-hemispheral
      activity on fMRI during micturition and pain suggesting maladaptive CNS plasticity. Moreover,
      we speculate that healthy volunteers will not display a similar shift.

      During the study, standard motor and sensory paradigms will be performed to establish
      anatomical and functional patterns in the non-painful state. The patient will then be asked
      to urinate (to an external collecting tube system).

      All anatomical data will be examined by a certified clinical imaging specialist to exclude
      concomitant brain pathology.

      Study population -

        1. 10 Patients with chronic post amputation micturition induced PLP.All subjects must
           fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and meet none of the exclusion criteria.

        2. 10 Patients with chronic post amputation with PLP and without post amputation
           micturition induced PLP All subjects must fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and meet
           none of the exclusion criteria.

        3. 10 healthy volunteers

      FMRI data analysis signifying, statistically significant uni-spatial voxel activity during
      micturition, in the study group
