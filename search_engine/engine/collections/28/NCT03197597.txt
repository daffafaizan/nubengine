    
      B. pertussis is considered as a monomorphic pathogen. However, genetic changes have been
      observed in several antigens (pertussis toxin, pertactin, filamentous haemagglutinin and
      fimbriae) included in the current acellular pertussis vaccines between vaccine strains and
      circulating isolates.

      To study genetic changes in the B. pertussis populations in Europe, four distinct panels have
      been collected: EUpert I in 1999-2001 including 102 isolates, EUpert II in 2004-2005
      including 154 isolates, EUpert III in 2007-2009 including 140 isolates and EUpert IV in
      2012-2015 including 265 isolates. Selection criteria have remained unchanged for all four
      collections, which enables the opportunity to study changes in B. pertussis populations
      during the last 15 years.
