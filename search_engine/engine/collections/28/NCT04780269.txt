      (1:1 treatment ratio) in Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. Women with a term
      pregnancy, an indication for induction of labor, and a live singleton fetus at cephalic
      presentation, intact membranes, an unfavorable cervix, no prior cesarean section or
      contraindication to vaginal delivery, are eligible to participate. After informed consent,
      they will be randomized to undergo induction of labor by Foley catheter or PGE2.

      Our primary outcomes will be (I) a composite of severe perinatal complications and (II)
      vaginal delivery. Before the formal recruitment of this RCT, a pilot study with a sample size
      of 200 pregnant women will be performed.
