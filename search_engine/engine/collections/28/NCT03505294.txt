      randomly assigned to two groups, the "task-oriented training" group, and the control group.
      "Task-oriented training" consisting of 10 different motor tasks including lower extremity and
      upper extremity activities will be applied to the training group twice a week for 6 weeks.
      The control group will be taught relaxation exercises and will be asked to perform the
      exercises 2 times for 6 weeks at home.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
      IL, USA). The pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the
      Wilcoxon Test. The significance level was set at p< 0.05.
