      recipient's kidney graft from a living donor.

      Material and methods: Controlled, double-blind trial with 12 months follow-up. Composed of 48
      patients, randomized manner, realized at the Transplant Department of Western Medical Center,
      Mexican Institute of Social Security. Universe was patients accepted as kidney donors and
      their recipients. Patients included as donors were randomized into two groups (study or
      control) the intervention was implemented 4 weeks before kidney transplant. During surgical
      procedure, a biopsy from the recipient's kidney graft was obtained to measure IL-2, IL-6
      TNFalpha and HLA by immunohistochemistry, 3 and 12 months after surgery. Recipients kidney
      function, surgical complications and kidney graft survival were registered. During surgical
      procedure, 3 and 12 months of following, biopsies were obtain to performed histopathological
      analysis based on Banff classification of renal allograft rejection grades.

      The statistical analysis was performed according to the nature of variables, for continuous
      data using measures of central tendency and dispersion and for the qualitative data with
      frequencies and percentages. Inferential analysis with student's t-test, and/or
      Mann-Whitney's U test; chi-square distribution, and/or Fisher's exact test respectively.
