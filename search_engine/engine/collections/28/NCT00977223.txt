    
      STUDY DESIGN

      Phase IV, proof of concept, interventional, monocentric, randomised, double blind, cross-over
      study: The effects of a substance P antagonist (Emend) on corticosteroid secretion will be
      compared to those of a placebo.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Main objective: to verify that adrenal corticosteroid secretion is actually controlled by
      substance P.

      Secondary objective: to determine the physiological conditions that involve the control of
      adrenocortical function by tachykinins.
