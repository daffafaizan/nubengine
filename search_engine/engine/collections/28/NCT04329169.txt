      lower posterior edentulous area selected from those admitted to the Prosthodontics
      Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University. A full digital implant-prosthetic
      protocol was followed and a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of the protocol was
      performed using computer software and superimposition of the planned and post-operative
      images was done.
