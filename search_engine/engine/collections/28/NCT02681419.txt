    
      This is a prospective, randomized control study of glaucomatous eye undergoing tube shunt
      implantation using a nonvalved implant for poorly controlled glaucoma of any type. Eyes
      scheduled to receive a nonvalved tube shunt implant will be randomized to receive either
      needle fenestration(s) or a suture wick using a single 10-0 vicryl anterior to the ligature.
      The operative quadrant will be imaged using anterior-segment optical coherence tomography at
      pre- and post-operative visits.
