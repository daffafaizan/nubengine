      casual puzzle video game (CPVG) intervention in healthy older adults (HOA), patients
      suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and acquired brain injury (ABI). Although
      there have only been a small number of studies specifically using CPVG interventions, recent
      studies were able to demonstrate the validity of CPVG in improving attentional and executive
      function and speed of processing (Oei & Patterson, 2013; Stroud & Whitbourne, 2015; Styron,
      2015) in healthy older adults as well as their potential in reducing depressive symptoms,
      physical stress and anxiety (Russoniello, O'Brien, & Parks, 2009). These findings match
      general findings from video game training studies reporting improved processing speed,
      attentional, executive and visuospatial skills (Jak et al., 2013). In addition a recent
      large-scale study showed that regular engagement in Sudoku and similar puzzles represents a
      cognitively enriching leisure activity prevents and delays age-related cognitive decline
      (Ferreira, Owen, Mohan, Corbett, & Ballard, 2015). Since depressive disorders affect between
      10% and 20% older adults and even more in persons suffering from MCI and dementia, and that
      mood disorders affect about 31% (anxiety disorders up to 40%) patients after suffering a
      stroke, these populations could potentially draw both cognitive and emotional benefits from
      CPVG intervention (Arba et al., 2016; Barua, Ghosh, Kar, & Basilio, 2011; Robinson, 2003).

      The main objective of this study is to investigate long-term training benefits of a CPVG
      intervention on cognitive and emotional functioning in healthy older adults and patients with
      cognitive impairment.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine whether a long-term CPVG intervention
      significantly improves attentional function (visual search) and leads to in-game learning
      effects in healthy older participants and cognitively impaired patients (MCI, ABI). The
      secondary objectives include: a) improvements on further cognitive outcome measures proposed
      to be engaged by the CPVG (attention, processing speed, working memory and spatial reasoning)
      and b) the efficacy of the CPVG intervention in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety and
      stress and improving quality of life.
