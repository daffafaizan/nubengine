      sessions within 5 weeks) will be examined in a sample of 34 children with cerebral palsy.

      Children will be randomly assigned to an intervention or waiting list group. Assessments will
      be performed at baseline, in week 6 as well as in week 12. The intervention is provided to
      the waiting list group after the assessment in week 6.
