        -  Improve the long term disease-free survival of patients with rare cancers at high risk
           for lethal relapse by using myeloablative chemotherapy with thiotepa, carboplatin, and
           topotecan followed by autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell rescue.

      OUTLINE: Autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested. Patients
      receive high-dose thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days -8 to -6, carboplatin IV over 4 hours on
      days -5 to -3, and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -4. Autologous bone marrow or
      PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV twice daily beginning on
      day 1.

      Patients are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
