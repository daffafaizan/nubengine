      inflammatory arthritis patients. Thermography has advantages of simple, time-saving, low
      skill demanding, no radiation exposure and non-invasiveness. It is possible to conduct a
      quantitative analysis with thermography. However, it is still unknown whether thermography
      evaluation can provide clinical information regarding the joint health in hemophilia
      arthropathy patients. The project will focus on:

        1. Investigate the association among thermography findings and functional status in
           hemophilia arthroplasty

        2. Investigate the novel biomarkers in predicting function in hemophilia arthropathy
           including: soft tissue ultrasound, body composition, thermographic findings of joints,
           muscle composition and serum biomarkers of joint degeneration.
