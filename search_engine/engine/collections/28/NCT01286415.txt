      Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans are at significant risk for chronic post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), which can become a chronic disorder that impacts all areas of a
      person's life. PTSD treatment programs are being developed throughout the Department of
      Defense (DoD) and the Veterans Affairs (VA), but because of the large number of Service
      Members returning from deployment with PTSD, it is often necessary to provide psychotherapy
      in groups. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an evidence-based treatment for PTSD, was
      originally developed as a group-based intervention. However, group-based CPT treatment has
      never been systematically compared to other forms of group treatment. The public policy
      implications of the results of this trial are significant. If group treatment is found to be
      effective, then group treatment would be a more efficient and cost-effective therapy modality
      in most cases. The purpose of this study is to compare group-administered CPT-Cognitive-only
      version (CPT-C) to Present Centered Therapy (PCT) in order to determine whether the results
      of CPT exceed those of receiving a therapy that focuses on current problems rather than past
      trauma in a group format. One hundred (100) adult male and female active-duty OIF/OEF
      military personnel over 18 years of age will be enrolled into this study. Participants will
      be randomized to receive either group PCT or group CPT-C.
