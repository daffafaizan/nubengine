    
      Subjects who have undergone saphenous vein [arterial] bypass grafts from the femoral to
      above-knee popliteal artery will undergo ultrasound imaging at rest, and again after 5
      minutes of blood pressure cuff occlusion of the calf. (at 1 minute and 15 minutes) Subjects
      will then be given sub-lingual nitroglycerin, and repeat ultrasound will be performed 3
      minutes later. Following 10 minutes of rest, subjects will be given intravenous L-NMMA, a
      specific nitric oxide inhibitor, to help determine the responsible agent of the vein graft
      flow mediated dilation.
