      criteria, a seed number was set in the PLAN program of the SAS 9.4 software by the
      statistician before the formal enrollment, and the subject screening numbers were randomly
      assigned to the two groups by using a 1:1 block randomization method. The enrolled subjects
      were assigned a subject number according to the results of randomization and received stage I
      dosing of HSK3486 injectable emulsion (sequence 1) or HSK3486 injectable emulsion +
      voriconazole (sequence 2). After a 7-day (sequence 1) or 14-day washout period (sequence 2),
      the stage II dosing of HSK3486 injectable emulsion + voriconazole (sequence 2) or HSK3486
      injectable emulsion (sequence 1) was carried out in a crossover fashion.
