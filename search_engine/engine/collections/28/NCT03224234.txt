      to insulin regimens is reported in up to two-third of patients with diabetes; thus it is
      important to identify patients at risk and to develop strategies and tools to increase
      adherence to prescribed insulin regimens. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      InsulclockÂ® - small electronic device to help track date, time and dosage of the last
      injection, type of insulin used and temperature, with an alarm system to prevent insulin
      omissions and mistiming. The Insulclock's real time memory and alert system are likely to
      improve treatment adherence, patient's satisfaction, and quality of life measures, which may
      improve glycemic control in insulin treated patients with Type 2 Diabetes.
