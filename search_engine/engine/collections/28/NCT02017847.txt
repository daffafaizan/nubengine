      of the measured activity. In this study the count cut off points for low, moderate and high
      intensity activity will be investigated in a population of elderly people over the age of 70.
      This information will subsequently (in future studies) be used to investigate the physical
      activity patterns in a population of elderly over the age of 70 who have worn an activity
      monitor for a duration of 7 days.
