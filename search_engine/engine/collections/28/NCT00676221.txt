      Transplant Program.

      Study design: Three month, longitudinal, open-label, single arm study. Number of study
      visits: 3 (Baseline, 4-6 weeks, 12 weeks)

      Planned sample size :Approx. 110 subjects. Study population will be primary or secondary
      renal transplant recipients who are stable and are on maintenance immunosuppressive
      medication which includes MMF.

      Gastrointestinal rating scale (GSRS) and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI)will
      be the evaluation tool for GI symptoms, completed by study subject via a "touch screen" pc.
      at baseline, 4-6 week and final 12 week visit.

      Study subjects will discontinue MMF following the evening dose on the day of Baseline visit
      and commence EC-MPS at equimolar doses of subject's current MMF dose.

      At Final study visit (Week 12) study subject will be given the option of continuing on EC-MPS
      or resuming MMF.

      Endpoints:

      Primary: Incidence of patients tolerating MMF related GI symptoms.

      Secondary:

        1. Patient reported symptoms and quality of life after conversion from MMF to EC-MPS.

        2. Adverse events.

        3. Renal function as determined by Cockroft-Gault equation

        4. Routine hematological and chemistry bloodwork.

      Statistical consideration: Descriptive, pair T-Test analysis.
