      in case of fetal polymalformation in order to assess significant genomic alterations. Up to
      now, in case of isolated heart defect, only fetal karyotype with FISH 22q11 was usually
      offered. However, micro deletions or duplications could not be identified elsewhere
      throughout the genome. Then, in case of fetal chromosomal micro-rearrangements, parents could
      not be fully informed for global and neurodevelopmental prognosis. To our knowledge,
      clear-cut study, to assess whether array-CGH provide a diagnostic utility in case of isolated
      congenital heart defect, don't exist.

      After informed consent, 80 women will be enrolled during two years in 2 official prenatal
      diagnosis centers in France. This survey is assumed to identify at least 8% of unbalanced
      chromosomal abnormalities. This will be also compared with 22q11 rearrangements rate.

      This is the first prospective study aiming at defining the right chromosomal screening when a
      fetal isolated congenital heart defect is identified by ultrasound.
