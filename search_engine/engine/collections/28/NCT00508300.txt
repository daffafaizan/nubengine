    
      Allocation by individual random number generated by a computer program to either EDA or PCA
      for 48h after laparoscopic colonic surgery.

      Short, both groups are treated according to a recent Fast track protocol. Group A will
      preoperatively receive a mid thoracic EDA (th 8-9; naropine 0,1%) while group B will receive
      a PCA (morphine) postoperatively. Both EDA and PCA are removed the afternoon at day 2.
      Patients with a non-functioning EDA within the first 24h will be crossed over to the PCA
      group.
