    
      The study will consist of 2 parts:

        -  Part 1 is an open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 2 exploratory study that will
           investigate the clinical activity of the combination of eryaspase and
           gemcitabine/carboplatin in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic TNBC who have
           not received prior systemic therapy for locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Data
           analysis of Part 1 will inform choices for the final design and patient population in
           Part 2 (Phase 3 study).

        -  Part 2 will be a randomized Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy of the
           combination of eryaspase and gemcitabine/carboplatin in TNBC patients.

      Part 1 is the focus of the current trial.

      Patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to one of the following treatment arms:

        -  Arm A (experimental arm): eryaspase 100 U/Kg on Days 1 and 8 of combination chemotherapy
           with gemcitabine/carboplatin (G/C), or

        -  Arm B (control arm): gemcitabine/carboplatin combination.

      Treatment will continue until objective disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the
      patient's withdrawal of consent.

      A survival follow-up period will include the collection of survival, progression of disease
      if applicable, subsequent anti-cancer therapy every 12 weeks.
