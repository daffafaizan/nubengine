      Blood extraction was performed in the pre-surgical area using a vacuum system. A total of 20
      ml of blood (4 samples of 5 ml) per patient was collected in sterile sodium citrate tubes.
      PRGF was obtained following Anitua's technique. The tubes with citrated blood were
      centrifuged at 1,800 rpm for 8 min to obtain a concentrate of platelets suspended in plasma,
      which was separated into three fractions. Pipetting was carried out with extreme care in all
      steps, particularly in the last fraction where, in order to avoid inflammation, leukocytes
      present in the lowermost portion of the centrifuged plasma were not aspirated. PRGF was
      activated by adding calcium chloride 10%,immediately before infiltration. The proportion
      required for PRGF activation is 50 ml of activator per 1,000 ml of PRGF. Separation of plasma
      into three fractions and subsequent activation of the fractions for injection was performed
      in a laminar flow chamber.

      Between the collection of blood and its subacromial administration must not exceed 90 minutes
      to avoid contamination.

      Control group: Celestone Cronodose® (bethametasone).

      They were given 3 infiltrations of 2 cc of Celestone cronodose® (bethametasone) every 21 days
      (If necessary, it could be administered after an application of a small quantity of a local
      anaesthetic).
