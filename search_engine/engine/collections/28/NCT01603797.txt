      of internet as a delivery format for interventions could be a way of overcome many barriers
      (financial obstacles, reluctance to seek treatment and paucity of clinicians trained in ACT)
      that hinder persons with chronic pain to seek or receive adequate help. Persons were
      randomized to either treatment for 7 weeks or to a control group who were invited to
      participate in a moderated online discussion forum. Follow up data was collected six months
      after the treatment.
