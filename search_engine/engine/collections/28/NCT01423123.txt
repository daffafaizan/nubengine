    
      Patients will receive concurrent therapy with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of
      a 28-day cycle), trastuzumab (4 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 2 mg/kg IV weekly), and
      neratinib. The neratinib dose-escalation will include 4 dose levels (120 mg, 160 mg, 200 mg,
      and 240 mg) as a daily oral dose.

      The neratinib dose-escalation for the study will proceed on the basis of dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1. DLT will be defined as the occurrence of 1 or more of the
      following events during cycle 1: any grade diarrhea that is associated with fever or
      dehydration; grade 3 diarrhea lasting more than 2 days on optimal medical therapy; grade 4
      diarrhea of any duration; grade 3 or 4 neutropenia associated with fever; grade 4 neutropenia
      lasting more than 7 days; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity;
      or any toxicity-related delay of more than 2 weeks to initiate cycle 2. Patients will be
      enrolled at the next dose level when all evaluable patients at the same dose level have
      completed the first treatment cycle. Enrolled patients will remain on the assigned dose level
      treatment until toxicity or disease progression.
