      dextromethorphan with their pre-medication and three more times in the first 24 hours after
      surgery. Group P received the placebo following the same schedule. Post-operative analgesic
      requirements were assessed using a patient-controlled analgesia system.

      Pain was assessed at rest using a visual analog scale in the post anesthetic care unit(PACU),
      6 and 24 hours after surgery.
