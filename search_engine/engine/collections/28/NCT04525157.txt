      phototherapy with narrow-band ultraviolet B irradiation (NB-UVB). Further therapeutic
      approaches are desired and currently being evaluated. The investigational product,
      afamelanotide, is a synthetic analogue of the human alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone
      (alpha-MSH). Afamelanotide activates melanin in skin, with the controlled-release injectable
      implant formulation having an affect across the total body surface area (pandermally).
      Earlier studies in vitiligo patients showed afamelanotide, in combination with NB-UVB, could
      induce faster and deeper repigmentation in patients compared to NB-UVB alone.
