      populations, children diagnosed with ADHD (ADHD and not on medication) and neuro-typical
      children. The investigators plan to evaluate 80 subjects (N = 40 per group) in three site
      locations over a 29 day study period. The 29 day study period includes 2 in-clinic sessions
      and 27 days of out-patient game play. During the 27 days of out-patient game play, the
      subjects will be instructed to play EVO 5 days per week for typically 30 minutes per day

      The investigators' hypothesis is that EVO will be playable and interesting to ADHD children
      and cognitive measures, as captured by EVO, will show a difference between ADHD children and
      age-matched neuro-typical children.
