        -  To determine the incidence of good/excellent cosmetic outcome, as defined by the Harvard
           Scale, after radiotherapy in women treated with lovastatin, as compared to historical
           controls.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard external beam whole-breast irradiation and/or accelerated
      partial breast irradiation. Patients receive oral lovastatin once daily beginning on the
      first day of radiotherapy and continuing for 12 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete a questionnaire, the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale, at baseline and
      then at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 years after completion of radiotherapy to assess cosmetic
      and functional outcomes.

      After completion of radiotherapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
