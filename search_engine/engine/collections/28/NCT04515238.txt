      CLL in need of treatment. This trial will evaluate a debulking with two cycles bendamustine
      (only for patients with a high tumor load), followed by an induction and maintenance
      treatment with obinutuzumab, zanubrutinib and venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory
      CLL. Thus, this trial combines one established (chemotherapy) and three novel, synergistic
      (antibody, Bruton's tyrosine kinase(BTK)-inhibitor and Bcl-2 antagonist) principles of action
      in order to achieve deep and long lasting remissions with a short duration of treatment.
      Additionally, this trial has an extensive accompanying scientific program aiming at a better
      understanding of the kinetics of response and clonal evolution of CLL.
