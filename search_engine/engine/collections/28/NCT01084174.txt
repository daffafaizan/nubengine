    
      To effectively address the Primary Objectives of this pilot study, 30 subjects aged 6-21
      years with: (1) a convincing clinical history of peanut allergy (PA), (2) a serum
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to peanut of >0.35 kilo units per liter (kU/L) and a skin
      prick test (SPT) wheal >3 mm, will be enrolled. Subjects will be recruited from the Johns
      Hopkins Pediatric Allergy Clinic.

      Participants will undergo an initial screening visit that will include a medical history,
      physical exam, skin testing, and phlebotomy. Informed consent and assent will be obtained. At
      the next two visits, 20 participants will complete a double-blind placebo-controlled food
      challenge (DBPCFC). Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into two groups. One
      group will receive active SLIT with placebo OIT and the other group will begin active OIT
      with placebo SLIT dose escalation. Over the next 16 weeks of the study, subjects will undergo
      SLIT and OIT dose increases. A maintenance dose will then be taken at home daily for 12
      months. A DBPCFC will be completed after 6 months and 12 months of home dosing. Those
      patients who pass the DBPCFC will be taken off SLIT and OIT for 4 weeks. A final challenge
      will be administered at the end of this period.

      Ten additional peanut-allergic subjects age 6-21 years will be enrolled and followed as
      longitudinal controls for the mechanistic studies. These subjects will follow a modified
      schedule compared to those subjects receiving study treatment and will be evaluated by
      phlebotomy, end point titration prick skin testing, and saliva collection. These patients
      will continue strict avoidance of peanut unless otherwise advised by their personal
      physician.
