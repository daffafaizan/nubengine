      combination with 1592U89 or indinavir. If after 16 weeks (and every 8 weeks thereafter until
      week 48) a patient has HIV-1 RNA >= 400 copies/ml (by PCR on two occasions >= 1 week and < 4
      weeks apart), the patient has the option to switch to open-label therapy consisting of
      indinavir, 1592U89, and Combivir.
