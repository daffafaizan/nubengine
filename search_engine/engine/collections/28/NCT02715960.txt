      key gene variants which associated with ADME affect the efficacy of Acitretin Capsules;
      2.Direct full genetic sequencing of MHC genes, to explore the genetic variations of efficacy
      and side effects; 3. Direct sequencing of all exons in the gene in the patients of the
      response of serious and effectively, to explores the rare genetic variation may cause
      deterioration of treatment by Acitretin Capsules.
