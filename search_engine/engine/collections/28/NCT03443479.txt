    
      We will compare various clinically relevant outcomes in patients treated for type II
      (hypercapnic) acute respiratory failure (ARF) with either High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) or
      Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) in a general adult hospital.

      All patients treated with HFNC were treated with an Optiflow device (Fisher&Paykel). Various
      Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) devices were used during the study period.

      All ventilatory parameters were set according to the treating physicians' preferences.
