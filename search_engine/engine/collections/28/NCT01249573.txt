      this injury and the often residual symptoms, there is a large variety in diagnostic approach
      and therapeutic protocols. Concerning the treatment of an acute ankle sprain, it remains a
      challenge to minimize injury consequences on short and long term.

      In this study we investigate the immediate effect of two therapeutic techniques: fascia
      therapy and transcutaneous fibrolysis. They will be compared to a third group, who receives a
      placebo treatment. Muscle strength, muscle vascularisation, muscle tenderness and joint
      position sense are measured before and after treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to contribute to the knowledge of treating acute ankle sprains.
