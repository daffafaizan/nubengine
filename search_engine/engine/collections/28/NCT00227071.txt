      and clinicians. This study compared the effects of aquatic exercise (AE), land exercise (LE)
      and no exercise (NE) on fall risk factors. Subjects: Seventy-three women, 60 or older, with
      osteoporosis (OP). Method: Randomized clinical trial comparing balance, posture, strength,
      mobility, function, falls, and quality of life. Results: Significant differences (p<0.05)
      were found for participants' ratings of global change (AE and LE > NE), tandem balance (AE >
      LE) and function (LE > AE). Joint pain and falls occurred more often during LE. Discussion
      and Conclusion: Participants experienced significant global improvement with both AE and LE.
      Less joint pain, reduced falls and improved balance were found in AE, however LE was more
      effective in improving functional ability at home. Clinicians should consider the
      individual's specific impairments and risk factors when recommending exercise programs on
      land or in water.
