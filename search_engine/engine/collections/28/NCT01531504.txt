      holder for laparoscopic surgery. It holds the endoscope and is controlled by either a foot
      pedal or voice activation. It received FDA approval in December 2008 and since that time has
      been used to facilitate laparoscopic surgery in multiple specialties.

      EndoControl now considers using the technology for uterus manipulation in
      laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomies. Most gynecologic surgeries require displacement of the
      uterus out of the anatomic location to optimize the surgery. During an abdominal hysterectomy
      clamps are placed on the uterine cornua allowing easy manipulation of the uterus. The
      development of laparoscopic surgery required new techniques to manipulate the uterus.
      Typically a uterine manipulator is placed vaginally and controlled by the surgeon or the
      surgical assistant during the procedure.

      In conventional operations, the constant physical force decreases the surgical team's
      efficacy and increases fatigue levels. The use of the ViKY device to control the position of
      the uterus facilitates surgery by enabling the surgeon to maintain a constant "locked"
      position or by allowing the surgeon to remotely move the uterus at any point of the surgery.
      The ViKY device also eliminates the need for an extra surgical assistant during
      laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomies.

      The aim of this study is to collect data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the use
      of the ViKY device for uterine manipulation during conventional laparoscopic-assisted
      hysterectomies or computer-controlled laparoscopic hysterectomies.
