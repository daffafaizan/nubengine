      (CB1 and CB2), substances acting on the cannabinoid receptors, and the enzymes and proteins
      involved in regulating endocannabinoids in tissue and at the receptors. The substances acting
      the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are called endocannabinoids. The present study examines
      the effects of Osteopathic Manipulative Lymphatic Pump Techniques on levels of anandamide, an
      endocannabinoid, in saliva samples of adult subjects. Based on existing research, the
      investigators hypothesize that subjects who undergo osteopathic lymphatic treatment will have
      increased levels of anandamide. Establishing the levels of endocannabinoids in these subjects
      will allow for a direct measure of the efficacy of the Osteopathic Manipulative Lymphatic
      techniques. In addition to the quantification of endocannabinoid levels in saliva, a series
      of 16, 100 mm analog scales will be used to assess the cannabinomimetic effects in the
      subject pre and post OMM treatment/control and it will be correlated to changes in
      endocannabinoid levels.
