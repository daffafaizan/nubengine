      conditions in this study. By randomization, the participants will experience at least two of
      the conditions and likely all three, depending on the number of their wound care sessions.
      All subjects will always receive all their usual pain medications for all treatment
      conditions. The three conditions are: High Tech Virtual Reality (VRD), Low Tech Virtual
      Reality (Nature Slides), and standard wound care (no VR). The subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive some portions of their wound care sessions during High Tech Virtual
      Reality (VRD), some portions during Low Tech Virtual Reality (Nature Slides), and some
      portions with standard wound care, no virtual reality. The treatment orders will be
      randomized. After each treatment condition the investigators will ask subjects one pain
      question about their pain intensity during the most recent treatment condition.
