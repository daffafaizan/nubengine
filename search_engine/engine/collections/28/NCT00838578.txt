    
      Phase II portion is an open-label, single arm study. Based on the results of the Phase I
      portion, weekly KRN330 (0.5 mg/kg) and biweekly irinotecan (180 mg/m2) will be used in the
      Phase II portion. To be eligible for the Phase II portion, a patient will have recurred or
      progressed within 6 months of the last cycle of FOLFOX/CapOx +/- bevacizumab (first-line or
      adjuvant regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer). Patients will continue the treatment
      until disease progression.

      Per protocol, the decision was made to terminate the study based on interim analysis results.
      The Response Rate in Phase II did not meet the protocol-specified RR of 15% when 0.5 mg/kg
      KRN330 was administered weekly in combination with irinotecan(180 mg/m2)biweekly.
