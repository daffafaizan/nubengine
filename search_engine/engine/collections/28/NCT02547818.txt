    
      This Phase III study is designed as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study
      for subjects with evidence of early AD. The study will evaluate safety and tolerability,
      efficacy as measured by CDR-SB, and will determine if the combination therapy ALZT-OP1 will
      slow down, arrests, or reverse cognitive and functional decline in an early stage AD
      population.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment arms: Group I will consist of
      ALZT-OP1a (cromolyn) for inhalation, plus an oral placebo tablet; OR the Group II arm, which
      will consist of ALZT-OP1 combination therapy ALZT-OP1a (cromolyn) for inhalation, plus
      ALZT-OP1b (ibuprofen) tablet for oral administration; OR to the Group III arm, which will
      consist of inhaled placebo, plus ALZT-OP1b (ibuprofen) tablet for oral administration; OR to
      the Group IV placebo arm, which will consist of inhaled placebo plus an oral placebo tablet.

      A minimum of 400 evaluable subjects will be randomized to receive one of four possible
      treatment assignments containing various combinations of active study drug or placebo.

      To account for subject dropouts (estimated rate of 30%), it is anticipated that up to 600 (or
      150 subjects per treatment arm) may be recruited and randomized, to achieve a minimum of 100
      evaluable subjects per treatment arm.
