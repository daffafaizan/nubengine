      accelerometer-based technology. They are intended to give indications about sleep
      quality/duration in order to give people an internet-based feedback about their own sleep..

      For clinical and research purposes, tri-axial accelerometers/multi-sensors devices are used
      routinely to assess objective sleep quality/patterns. Their use is also validated to estimate
      sleep in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA).

      The purpose of our study is to compare the accuracy of consumer-level sleep trackers and
      validated tools to measure sleep in OSA patients.
