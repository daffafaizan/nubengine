      mass, body mass index were measured by height and weight and skeletal muscle mass and body
      fat were measured by Bioelectrical impedance analysis (InbodyH20B). Find the highest
      correlation between the 8 factors (total body weight, corrected body weight, ideal body
      weight, fat-free mass, body mass index, skeletal muscle mass, body fat) and the amount of
      rocuronium administered to deep neuromuscular blockade in bariatric surgery.
