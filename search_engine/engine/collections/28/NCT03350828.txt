      CFTR modulator for at least 3 months will be enrolled for a single visit to collect sweat to
      be analyzed for SC at their local site laboratory. Limited clinical data obtained at this
      visit will be augmented by retrospective and prospective data obtained from the Cystic
      Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR). Study subjects who have been prescribed and
      switch to an alternative commercially approved CFTR modulator will be approached to re-enroll
      in the study after being on the alternative modulator for at least 3 months so that a new SC
      value can be obtained.
