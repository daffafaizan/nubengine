      did not have a medically eligible, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor for
      bone marrow transplantation. The EFS-ADA lentiviral vector with the human ADA cDNA will be
      used to transduce autologous CD34+ cells from the bone marrow of these subjects. The subjects
      will receive 4 mg/kg busulfan prior to re-infusion of their gene-modified cells. Safety is
      the primary endpoint. During the follow-up phase, the investigators aim to determine whether
      the cells could engraft and produce mature cells that contain and express the corrected ADA
      gene in the absence of pegademase bovine (PEG-ADA) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which
      will be withheld at Day +30 following transplant. Efficacy studies to evaluate the level of
      immune reconstitution, will be performed in the first and second years of the study.
