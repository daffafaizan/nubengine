      brushing discomfort was significantly higher in sites with <2 mm of KT width, which exhibited
      more plaque and more bleeding on probing than sites with â‰¥2 mm of KT width. Therefore,
      various procedures and materials were proposed in the past to augment the soft tissues around
      dental implant. Soft-tissue grafting seems beneficial, especially in posterior mandible, when
      patients complains of soreness during oral hygiene procedures and plaque control is less than
      ideal and it may be facilitated by a better topography. The surgical procedures most
      frequently used to increase the width of keratinized tissue around an implant-supported
      restoration include an apically positioned split-flap/vestibuloplasty (APF) with or without
      the application of autogenous tissue (i.e., free gingival graft) or a xenogeneic collagen
      matrix.

      However, it remains unclear whether or not surgical procedures for gain of KT may establish
      peri-implant health limiting the incidence of peri-implant disease and may positively affect
      self-performed oral hygiene measures reducing peri-implant soft tissue inflammation when
      compared with non-augmented, inadequately dimensioned implant sites. Neither do clinical
      suggestions exist for a specific soft tissue transplant to obtain more favorable outcomes.

      The aim of the present randomized controlled clinical trial is to assess the effect of soft
      tissue augmentation procedures at diseased (mucositis) implant sites in terms of:

        -  occurrence of peri-implant health (absence of BoP/suppuration, PPD>6mm, longitudinal
           radiographic bone loss) at 3, 6 and 12 months

        -  reduction of BoP (%) at 3, 6 and 12 months

        -  marginal bone loss (MBL) at 12 months

        -  improvement of self-performed oral hygiene measures (PI, VAS) at 3, 6 and 12 months and
           post-operative morbidity (VAS) at 7 days.

        -  change in tissue morphology: increase of KT width (2D in mm.) and tissue volume
           (volumetric 3D) at 3, 6 and 12 months and aesthetic (blinder examiner) at 6, 12 months.
