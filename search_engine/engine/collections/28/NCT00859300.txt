      are due to myocardial infarction. This complication occurs, for 70% of cases, at the
      patient's residence, within 30 minutes following the thoracic pain. Emergency care often
      comes too late and allows only 2% of the patients having a heart failure to be revitalized.

      At equal sex, age and clinical status, patients may or not develop ventricular rhythm
      disorders. Then, the notions of risk background and genetic disposition should be
      investigated.

      No prospective study has been conducted on a sufficient number of patients yet. Such a study
      and the recent development of new genetic technologies will help identifying markers of
      sudden death risk at the acute phase of myocardial infarction.

      The study we are implementing will increase knowledge on sudden death mechanisms at the acute
      phase of myocardial infarction. The analysis of phenotypic/genotypic relations will lead to
      an identification of new risk markers. Further evaluations of new diagnostic and therapeutic
      strategies will be possible on the basis of this trial.

      Ventricular fibrillation at the acute phase of myocardial infarction follows a polygenic
      determinism. The genes involved in this electrical trouble are those which lead to the
      expression of potassic, calcic and sodic channels of ventricular myocytes: KCNQ1, KCNH2,
      SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, PRKAG2, RyR2, PKP2, DSP, CASQ2, CACNA1C, and FKBP1B.

      An association of a favourable genetic background and ischemia represents a cause for
      ventricular arrhythmia as a complication of myocardial infarction.

      Haplotypes or genes considered as new markers for sudden death risk of ischemic origin will
      be searched.
