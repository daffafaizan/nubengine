    
      This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of first-line, risk-stratified
      rituximab-based MCD treatment in Malawi in a single-arm, phase II clinical trial. The
      investigators will enroll 27 subjects with newly diagnosed or previously treated MCD (who
      have not previously received rituximab) requiring treatment (B symptoms or hemoglobin <10
      g/dL). Subjects will be treated with four weekly doses of rituximab. High-risk subjects
      (defined as patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status >2 or
      hemoglobin <8 g/dL) will also receive etoposide chemotherapy. Subjects will be followed for
      one year for toxicity and two years for survival. The primary outcome will be safety, defined
      as the frequency of â‰¥Grade 3 treatment-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (AEs). Secondary outcomes will be event-free survival (death, progression, or development of
      NHL) and 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS). The investigators also aim to compare the
      cost-effectiveness of first-line rituximab treatment for MCD in Malawi to chemotherapy (using
      the investigators' historical controls).
