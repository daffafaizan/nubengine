      TV=6 ml/kg; Group 3, if TV=8 ml/kg; and Group 4, if TV=10 ml/kg. It was determined how many
      breaths per minute (minute ventilation) would be given with tidal volume x respiratory rate=6
      L. The patients were ventilated with the same ventilation parameters for 30 minutes and then
      arterial blood gas analysis was performed. Arterial blood gas was collected at t1 for group
      1, t2 for group 2, t3 for group 3, and t4 for group 4. The ETCO2 value, Peak pressure
      (Ppeak), Plateau pressure (Pplato), mean airway pressure (Pmean) values were recorded at the
      time of arterial blood gas collection. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peak heart rate (PHR) values were evaluated.
      The patients with a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mmHg were excluded from the study.
      Partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2), partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2),
      oxygen saturation (SO2) values were recorded from the arterial blood gas analysis. P (a-ET)
      CO2 gradient value was calculated.

      The groups were compared, in each patient, under the same conditions, when the different
      tidal volume was applied, how the ETCO2 monitorization, PaO2 values and hence the P (a-ET)
      CO2 gradient changed.
