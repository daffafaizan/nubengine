      exhaustion and overheating. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) tests aspirin as a method
      to increase time to exhaustion for persons with MS, through its antipyretic mechanism.
      Participants will be seen at our laboratory for maximal exercise tests on three separate
      days. At each session, they will be given one of three treatments: aspirin, acetaminophen (a
      drug that is anti-inflammatory but not antipyretic, thereby allowing for isolation of the
      antipyretic action of aspirin), and placebo. Primary outcome is increased time to exhaustion,
      secondary outcome is reduced body temperature increase during exercise.
