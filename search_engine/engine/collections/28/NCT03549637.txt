      cardiovascular protection due to prolonged exposure to low levels of LDL-C. However, while
      LDL-C reduction has been studied extensively for its beneficial effect on cardiovascular
      risk, other studies have reported that low levels of LDL-C (either spontaneous or
      artificially occurring with low-fat diets or lipid-lowering drugs) may be associated with
      psychiatric symptoms (psychotic or mood disorders, aggression, suicidal attempts, etc.) or
      altered cognitive performance (particularly executive functioning). These studies have led to
      contradictory results, and the possible link between low LDL-C levels and psychiatric
      symptoms remains highly controversial so far.

      The PARTITION study aims at estimating the prevalence of hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBL),
      defined as a LDL-C level â‰¤ 0,50 g/L, in a psychiatric population. Moreover, the study
      includes the characterization of psychiatric disorders as well as psychological and personal
      characteristics associated with HBL. The evolutionary profile of patients with and without
      HBL will be studied. Genetic characteristics and biomarkers of HBL will also be studied.
