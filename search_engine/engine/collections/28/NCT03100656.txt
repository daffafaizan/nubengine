      including death. The EPHX2 gene has been identified as a susceptibility gene for anorexia
      nervosa. This study utilizes a multi-omics biomarker system approach to investigate how
      genetic factors interact with dietary factors to influence food aversion, psychopathology,
      and clinical outcome in patients with anorexia nervosa.
