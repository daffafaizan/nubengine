      the opportunity to enroll in the study. Patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral surgical
      fixation would be included. Written, informed consent to enrollment will be recorded and
      included in the patient record. The study is designed around the standard of care for
      postsurgical pain management. There are no additional costs to the patient strictly related
      to this study.

      Patients will undergo surgical fixation of a lower extremity fracture(s) by one of surgical
      investigators at a single institution. A sealed, opaque envelope, selected in the
      pre-operative holding area, will accompany each patient participant to the operating room.
      The envelope will be opened at the conclusion of the fracture fixation to reveal patient
      assignment to either study Group 1 or Group 2. Once the total numbers of patients have
      completed their procedures and follow-up, the study will close.
