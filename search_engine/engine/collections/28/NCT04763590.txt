      weaning standard of care leaves much to be desired in both patient anxiety and time to wean.
      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the gold standard treatment for anxiety. The purpose of
      this study is to use CBT strategies in assisting patients hospitalized in intensive care
      units in ventilation wean through a case series of 2 patients.
