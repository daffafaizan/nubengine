      knee joint. Especially, open wedge high tibial osteotomy might cause moderate amount of
      bleeding and hematoma formation. Bleeding and hematoma could be a reason of soft tissue
      infection and wound complications. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a medication used to treat or
      prevent excessive blood loss from major trauma, postpartum bleeding, surgery, tooth removal,
      nosebleeds, and heavy menstruation. The objective of the study is to test whether
      preoperative tranexamic acid could reduce the postoperative complications due to bleeding.
