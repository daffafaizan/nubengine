      of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Up to 42% of patients receiving paclitaxel experience
      an HSR, with serious (> grade 3) reactions observed in about 2% of patients. Paclitaxel
      prescribing information and many other references therefore strongly recommend pre-medicating
      patients who are to be treated with paclitaxel-containing regimen with a corticosteroid, a
      histamine-1 (H1), and a histamine-2 (H2) antagonist prior to paclitaxel infusion. This is
      done to help prevent or minimize the occurrence of HSRs that could be caused by treating
      patients with paclitaxel. However, the method and timing of administering these
      pre-medications (particularly in the case of dexamethasone) have not been standardized. The
      current and most commonly used methods of preventing paclitaxel HSR includes one of the
      following: 1. Administering oral dexamethasone (20 mg), 12 hours and 6 hours prior to
      paclitaxel infusion and intravenous administration of H1 and H2 receptor antagonists 30
      minutes prior to paclitaxel infusion (Conventional method); 2. Administering intravenous
      dexamethasone (20 mg), concurrently with H1 and H2 antagonists, 30 minutes prior to
      paclitaxel infusion (Short-course method); 3. Administering oral dexamethasone (20 mg), 12
      hours prior to treatment in addition to intravenous dexamethasone (20 mg), H1 and H2 receptor
      antagonists administered 30 minutes prior to paclitaxel infusion. The goal of this study is
      to do a single center, prospective, randomized, open-label study to determine the most
      effective method in preventing paclitaxel HSR among these three commonly used methods.
