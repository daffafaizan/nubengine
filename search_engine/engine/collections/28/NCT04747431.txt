    
      PBFT02 is an adeno-associated viral vector serotype 1 carrying GRN, the gene encoding for
      human progranulin, formulated as a solution for injection into the cisterna magna. This is a
      global interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of PBFT02
      delivered as a one-time dose administered into the cisterna magna to patients with FTD-GRN.
      Subjects aged ≥ 35 and ≤ 75 years with early stage symptomatic FTD-GRN may be enrolled into
      the study.

      Two dose levels of PBFT02 will be studied in patients with FTD-GRN. The study will
      sequentially enroll 2 cohorts. An optional third dose level cohort may be enrolled based on
      the results of the first two cohorts.

      This will be a 2-year study with a 3-year safety extension.
