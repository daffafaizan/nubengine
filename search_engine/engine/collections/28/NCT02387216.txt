    
      This study is a randomized, open-label, international, multi-center, phase 2 study in
      patients with Heregulin-positive NSCLC histologically classified as adenocarcinoma that have
      progressed following no more than two systemic therapies for locally advanced or metastatic
      disease, one of which must have been a platinum containing regimen. All patients will
      initially be screened for heregulin status. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive
      MM-121 in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone.
