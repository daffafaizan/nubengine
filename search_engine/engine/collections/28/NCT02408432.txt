      I. To demonstrate the safety of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) administered
      by intravenous infusion in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure
      secondary to chemotherapy with anthracyclines.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate the efficacy of allogeneic hMSCs administered by intravenous infusion in
      patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%)
      and heart failure secondary to treatment with anthracyclines.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive allogeneic hMSCs intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes once weekly
      for 4 weeks and standard of care drugs for heart failure.

      ARM II: Patients receive only standard of care drugs for heart failure.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months and then
      at 12 months.
