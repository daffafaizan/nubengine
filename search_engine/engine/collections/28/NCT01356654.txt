      for 2 months in the study. Group 1 received true tDCS in the first month followed by SHAM
      stimulation in the second month. Group 2 received SHAM in the first month and true
      stimulation in the following month. Four stimulations of 20minutes were provided during 4
      weeks before before changing stimulation intensity.
