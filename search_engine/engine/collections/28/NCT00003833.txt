        -  Determine the adverse prognostic significance of 8p allelic imbalance (AI) in patients
           with colon cancer.

        -  Determine if patient prognosis is dependent on the region of 8p AI.

        -  Perform fine mapping studies to further localize the putative tumor suppressor gene(s)
           on 8p.

        -  Perform multicolor FISH to examine the role that 8p loss and 8q gain play in the
           prognosis of patients whose tumors exhibit 8p AI.

      OUTLINE: Matched normal and tumor DNA is analyzed for 8p allelic imbalance with at least 8
      markers: D8S262 and D8S1825 localized to 8p23, D8S254 and D8S261 at 8p22, D8S560 and D8S136
      at 8p21, and D8S1820 and D8S283 at 8p12. Normal/tumor tissue pairs are used for fine mapping
      studies.
