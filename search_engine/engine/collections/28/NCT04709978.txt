      for older adults with pneumonia involves hospitalization and antibiotics. However, recent
      studies suggest that a significant portion of suspected community-acquired bacterial
      pneumonia (CABP) cases may actually be due to distinct, dysphagia-related aspiration
      syndromes (e.g. aspiration pneumonia, pneumonitis).

      The proposed study will utilize diagnostic imaging to generate a prevalence estimate for
      aspiration in older adults diagnosed with pneumonia. The following aim will be completed:

      Determine the prevalence of aspiration among older adults with pneumonia and rates of
      recurrent pneumonia in this population.
