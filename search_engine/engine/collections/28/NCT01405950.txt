      pre-screen failures noted in areas of Botox injection inclusion; family participation refusal
      / disinterest and gastric or jejunostomy tube placement. A third protocol amendment to
      improve enrollment was discussed with the Investigators who did not believe further amendment
      would overcome the barriers expressed by parents that would subject their children to an
      intense study time commitment without direct benefit. The investigative sites were notified
      that the study was closed to enrollment March 27, 2012.
