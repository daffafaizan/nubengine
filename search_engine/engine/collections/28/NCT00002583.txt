      completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy
      with vinorelbine and cisplatin versus observation only. II. Confirm the prognostic
      significance of ras mutations when present in the primary tumor. III. Provide a comprehensive
      tumor bank linked to a clinical database for the further study of molecular markers in
      resected NSCLC. IV. Measure and compare the health-related quality of life of patients on
      both treatment arms. V. Evaluate any toxicity related to this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      institution, nodal status (N0 vs N1), and ras mutation status of primary tumor (absent vs
      present vs unknown). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      are evaluated at 3 and 6 months after randomization. Arm II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV
      over 6-10 minutes weekly for 16 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV on days 1 and 8
      every 4 weeks for a total of 4 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at Canadian centers.
      Quality of life assessments are optional for ECOG and SWOG centers. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients will be accrued for this study within 6.75 years.
