      drainage (MLD, performed either by a therapist or self-MLD), exercises and skin care.
      Subjects presenting to a vein clinic (Center for Vein Restoration or CVR) with lymphedema of
      the lower extremity/ies may receive a standard-of-care prescription for conservative care or
      for the Flexitouch Plus pneumatic compression device along with conservative care. Subjects
      will be followed (by phone and in clinic) for 12 months after initiating treatment for
      venous- and lymphedema-related complications, unscheduled visits, changes in quality of life
      measures and edema measures, skin changes, and changes to wounds (if present).
