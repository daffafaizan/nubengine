      significant increase in a woman's risk of infection with HIV-1. Further clinical and
      epidemiological research is needed to evaluate strategies for prevention and treatment of
      vaginal infections as a means of reducing HIV-1 acquisition. Developing a vaginal health
      intervention to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection is a particularly important goal in
      sub-Saharan Africa, where female controlled strategies for reducing the risk of HIV-1
      transmission may be an important means of decreasing the spread of the epidemic. This study
      will evaluate the efficacy of a regimen for reducing the rate of vaginal infections. The
      study is a double blind, randomized, controlled trial of monthly treatment with single-dose
      metronidazole and fluconazole as a means of decreasing vaginal infections and promoting
      normal vaginal flora in HIV-1 seronegative female sex workers (FSWs) in Mombasa, Kenya.
      Participants will be recruited from an existing cohort of HIV-1 seronegative FSWs followed at
      a municipal sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Mombassa, Kenya, since February
      1993. Participants will be randomized to treatment with metronidazole 2 grams plus
      fluconazole 150 mg once a month or placebo. All patients will be asked to return for
      follow-up after 1 month. All women in the study will be treated as indicated for symptomatic
      vaginal infections, other genital track infections and followed until they have completed 12
      monthly follow-up visits.
