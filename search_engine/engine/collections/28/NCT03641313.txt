      I. Determine objective response rate (ORR) superiority (target 35%) in TP53 mutant patients
      with progressive metastatic or unresectable gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer
      who receive berzosertib (M6620) and irinotecan compared to ORR (15%) in historical control
      patients treated with single agent irinotecan alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP), progression-free survival
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS) superiority in TP53 mutant gastric/GEJ cancer patients who
      receive M6620 and irinotecan compared to these measures in historical control patients
      treated with irinotecan alone.

      II. Perform the following correlative studies in 9 patients: gamma-H2AX, KAP1 phosphorylated
      (p)-Ser 824 and p-ATR analysis from biopsies collected at 24 hours (+/- 1 hour)
      post-irinotecan infusion on cycle 1 day 2 (C1D2) and at 24 hours (+/- 1 hour) post-M6620 on
      cycle 2 day 2 (C2D2).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine ORR, DOR, TTP, PFS, and OS in patients with other concomitant damage response
      defects (DDRD), such as mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, MRE11, RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54L, NBN,
      ATM, H2AX, PALB2, RPA, BRIP1, BARD1, ATR, ATRX, CHK1, CHK2, MDM2, MDM4, FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2,
      FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, treated with the experimental combination.

      II. Determine whether patients with first line platinum sensitivity (PFS > 3 months)
      demonstrate improved ORR, DOR, TTP, PFS, and OS compared to patients who were platinum
      insensitive (PFS < 3 months).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and berzosertib IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2
      months for up to 1 year.
