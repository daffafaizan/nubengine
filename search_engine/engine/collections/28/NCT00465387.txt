      providers, led by the Algoma Health Unit (AHU) and the Group Health Centre (GHC) - a
      community-based, not-for-profit, multidisciplinary health organization. Other partners
      include the multi-agency, consumer-orientated Algoma District Slips, Trips and Falls
      Committee, the Sault Area Hospital (SAH), the Algoma Community Care Access Centre (ACCAC),
      and Pharma Companies Alliance (Aventis and Proctor & Gamble), Merck Frosst and Lilly. The
      Green Shield Foundation has also provided sponsorship.The results of this study might
      directly benefit up to eight thousand seniors in the district by providing the impetus to
      integrated, evidence-based health services. Qualitative and quantitative research during this
      time will also be a unique opportunity to identify the modifiable barriers to the continuity
      and quality of care in this high-risk population. By involving the community, the project
      will also educate those at future risk and hopefully prevent disease and complications.
      Evaluation and research should provide nationally suggestions for better health service
      delivery.
