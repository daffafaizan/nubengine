      seed, isoflavonoid and cranberry mix in improving LUTS, urological quality of life, and
      erectile function in BPH patients. The compound will be administered orally two tablets daily
      for 3 months. Recruited patients will be seen at 3 visits: initial visit (visit 1), 1-month
      visit (visit 2) and 3-month visit (visit 3) and their data will be collected in a dedicated
      case report form.
