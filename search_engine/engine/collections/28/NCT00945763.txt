    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center study in subjects who
      have undergone third molar extraction surgery. Eligible subjects will have surgical removal
      of >2 third molars, of which at least 1 must be a complete or partial mandibular impaction.
      Each subject's study participation will consist of a screening visit (1-21 days prior to
      surgery), an inpatient evaluation period of 24 hours following dosing, and a follow-up phone
      call 3-5 days postdose.
