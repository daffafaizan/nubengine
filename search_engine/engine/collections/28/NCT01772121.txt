      infected with viral hepatitis with their clinical presentation. This study will provide the
      first nation-wide estimate of key host genetic polymorphisms associated with immune response,
      such as in the IL28B gene locus which has been associated with treatment outcomes in
      hepatitis C. Characterization of HCV and HBV viral genotypes and sub-types across different
      geographic regions will allow for an exploration of associations between host and viral
      genotypes. Another objective of this study is to identify co-morbid illness and metabolic
      factors that are associated with chronic liver disease due to viral hepatitis. Finally, this
      survey will explore patient awareness of their disease, risk factors for disease progression,
      and their treatment options
