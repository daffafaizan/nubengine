      intervention in 38 pre-liver transplant patients with End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD). The
      investigator estimates an attrition rate of 20%, resulting n=30 participants; 10 participants
      in Arm 1 (control arm) and 20 participants in Arm 2 (intervention arm). To be eligible,
      patients must be waitlisted or "Penn-Ready" with a MELD-Na less than or equal to 25,
      English-speaking, able to safely participant in an exercise program, have a smartphone, and
      be identified as frail. The purpose of this trial is to develop and implement a program of
      medical optimization, physical activity, and nutrition recommendations specifically tailored
      to ESLD and designed to reduce frailty, improve physical function, and optimize pre- and
      post-transplant outcomes.
