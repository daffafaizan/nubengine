    
      The primary objective of the trial is to assess the feasibility of implementing
      Ultrasonography and Range of Motion (ROM) as objective measurements to correlate the
      improvement of the knee mobility with the pain reduction of the affected knee in the patients
      assuming nutraceutical containing hyaluronic acid (HA).

      The secondary objectives of the trial are:

        -  to assess the feasibility of implementing Actigraphy as objective measurements to
           correlate the improvement of the knee mobility with the pain reduction (optional).

        -  to evaluate the enrollment rate in one month.

      The explorative objectives of the trial are:

      â€¢ Preliminary data on efficacy of the tested product.
