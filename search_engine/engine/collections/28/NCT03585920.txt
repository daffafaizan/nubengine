    
      The aims are: (1) To determine whether reducing fat in a snack leads to rebound hunger and
      higher food intake at the subsequent meal, (2)To determine whether a low fat snack product
      matched for expected satiety leads to differences in post-ingestive satiety (i.e. mouth-gut
      discordance), (2) To determine whether individual differences in sensory perception influence
      expected or post-ingestive satiety.

      Stage 1, Characterising Volunteers:

      Fat is perceived through three sensory modalities; mouthfeel, taste and odour. Humans vary in
      their perception of fat across all sensory modalities. Volunteers will be characterised on
      their ability to taste fatty acids and perceive mouthfeel.

      Stage 2, Establish Sensory Tolerance in Expected Satiety of a fat reduced snack model:

      Reduced fat products are typically reformulated to match the perceived texture and mouthfeel
      of the original product. This stage aims to quantify sensory tolerance to fat reduction.

      Stage 3, Establish Mouth Gut Discordance of a fat reduced snack model:

      Using a standard preload study design, and the same fat-emulsion snack model from stage 2,
      the investigators will contrast effects of 3 test samples in a balanced cross-over design.
