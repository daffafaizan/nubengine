      treatment the participant is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter study (more than 1
      study site) in participants with TRD to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      fixed doses of intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with
      a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo. The study
      will consist of 3 phases: Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4-7 weeks), Double-blind
      Induction Phase (4-weeks), Follow-up Phase (24-weeks). Participants who rollover into a
      long-term maintenance study will not participate in the Follow-up Phase. At the start of the
      screening/prospective observational phase, the participant must have had documented
      non-response to at least 1 antidepressant treatment (based on Massachusetts General Hospital
      - Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnair [MGH-ATRQ]) in the current episode of
      depression, and participant is taking a different oral antidepressant treatment on the
      MGH-ATRQ for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimum therapeutic dose. This
      antidepressant treatment, as well as any other ongoing medications being taken for depression
      at screening (including adjunctive/ augmentation therapies), will continue from the start of
      Week 1 through the end of Week 4 of the screening/prospective observational phase.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive Intranasal esketamine (56 milligrams [mg]),
      Intranasal esketamine (84 mg), or Intranasal placebo. In addition, each participant will be
      assigned to receive 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medications from 2 different classes of
      antidepressant treatments, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) (escitalopram or
      sertraline) or a Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) (duloxetine or
      venlafaxine extended release [XR]), initiated on Day 1 and continued through the double-blind
      induction phase. Participants will be primarily evaluated for improvement in depressive
      symptoms as assessed by change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total
      score at Week 4. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
