      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib during maintenance phase after
           high-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in
           patients with multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of bortezomib in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate, complete response rate, and response duration in
           patients treated with bortezomib at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-finding study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 21 or 28 days
      for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive de-escalating doses of bortezomib (at varying dosing
      schedules) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At
      least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
