           tracking in localizing intrahepatic lesions and assess the concordance between
           fluorescence ICG and histopathology for the diagnosis of liver cancer.

        -  Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer globally with an
           increasing incidence worldwide. Percutaneous sampling of focal hepatic lesions is a
           cornerstone in management of patients with hepatic pathology. In a retrospective study
           of patients with small hepatic lesions, up to 45% of the lesions biopsied were
           insufficiently visualized and resulted to a false negative rate (defined as patients
           with benign biopsies who were subsequently found to have malignant lesions at the
           attempted site of biopsy). Thirty seven percent of those were for HCC.

        -  EM navigation and fusion of real-time images with pre-acquired scans has been used in
           hepatic biopsies at the NIH for more than 15 years. NIH / NCI clinical trials have
           performed fusion biopsies with EM tracking in > 2000 patients, > 40,000 biopsies over
           the past 12 years.

        -  Indocyanine green (ICG) is an FDA approved optical molecular imaging fluorescent dye
           used for visualization of cells and tissues. ICG has been used for decades in
           ophthalmology for imaging retinal blood vessels. ICG was FDA cleared in 1959 and has
           been widely used to assess liver function perioperatively. ICG is administered as an
           injection. Adverse effects are rare and most often minor.
