      Plasmin (Human) in acute ischemic stroke caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion
      documented by arteriography. Plasmin (Human) will be administered through a catheter into the
      thrombus within 9 hours of stroke onset. Approximately sixty-one (61) patients will be
      enrolled and will receive Plasmin (Human). The objectives of this study are to determine the
      safety of escalating doses of Plasmin (Human) and to determine the proportion of patients
      with treatment success, defined as partial or full recanalization.
