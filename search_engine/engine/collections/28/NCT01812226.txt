      days after a positive result (PEth >20ng/ml). The rationale for this procedure is to
      determine the test retest reliability of this marker and as well as being able to correlate
      levels of drinking with changes in biomarker levels over time. There is limited information
      on the length of time PEth levels remain elevated in transplant patients after drinking
      episodes.

      Hypothesis H.1. PEth will have a significantly higher "area under the Receiver Operating
      Characteristic (ROC) curve" in a sample of post-transplant patients who report any alcohol
      use in the past 30 days compared to the control group.

      H.2. PEth will have a significantly higher "area under the ROC curve" in a sample of
      post-transplant patients who report daily alcohol use of >40 grams/day (three drinks/day) in
      the past 30 days compared to the control group.

      H.3. PEth will have a significantly higher "area under the ROC curve" in a sample of
      post-transplant patients who report heavy episodic drinking (>60 grams of alcohol, eight or
      more occasions in the past 30 days) compared to the control group.

      H.4. PEth levels will be <20 ng/ml in the control sample of 50 post transplant patients who
      do not have a history of alcohol dependence or alcohol related liver disease.

      H.5. The test-retest reliability of PEth will be >0.90.
