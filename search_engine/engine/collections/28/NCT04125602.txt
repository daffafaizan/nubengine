      carbohydrate diet (HF-LC) to a low fat, high carbohydrate diet (LF-HC). Participants will
      enter the study on a usual diet and will have a 6-day run in period for diet planning and
      baseline data collection before beginning their intervention. The HF-LC or the LF-HC will be
      randomized as the starting intervention followed by a wash-out period lasting for 6 days with
      normal diet between two interventions to eliminate previous intervention effects. Then the
      participants will be provided with the other diet. Both HF-LC and LF-HC last for 6 days in
      each set which consists of two wash-out periods and two intervention periods. There will be 3
      sets in this study and investigators will aggregate the results of the completed N-of-1
      trials across all participants to estimate the group level impacts of HF-LC compared to
      LF-HC.
