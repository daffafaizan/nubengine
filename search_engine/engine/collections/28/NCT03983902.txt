      the placental blood to the baby until the cord clamped during the birth. Placental
      transfusion can be accomplished by delayed cord clamping or umbilical cord milking.

      One group will receive 2 minutes of delayed cord clamping, the second group will receive
      umbilical cord milking and the third group will receive immediate cord clamping. Following
      the cord clamping, the blood samples will be taken from the placental site of the umbilical
      cord to measure the stem cells from all subjects and placental residual volume will be
      measured.

      Delivery room conditions, hospitalization (if needed), short-term outcome during
      hospitalization, prematurity related morbidities (if baby is preterm) will be recorded.
