      diagnosis of primary soft-tissue sarcoma in this open label, single center, clinical trial of
      ABY-029. The study will enroll patients with an EGFR pathology score ≥ 1.

      Initial diagnostic biopsy specimens will be analyzed for EGFR positivity by
      immunohistochemistry following routine diagnostic processing by Pathologist. Patients will be
      administered a single intravenous dose of ABY-029 1-3 hours before surgery. Following tumor
      excision, the tumor will be transported to the Pathologist and will be inked and sectioned.
      Following sectioning the tumor will be imaged using near-infrared imaging systems.
      Quantitative measurements of fluorophore concentration will be measured for tumors with EGFR
      pathology score ≥ 1 and compared to those with EGFR pathology score < 1. Quantitative mapping
      of fluorophore concentration will be correlated with local EGFR concentration and blood
      vessel density. Upon specimen analysis, fluorophore measurements will be taken from normal,
      marginal tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle, adipose) in addition to the tumor. Average EGFR
      concentration and blood vessel density will be determined for each tumor through histological
      analysis of sections by routine sarcoma protocol and analysis guided by regional variations
      in ABY-029 concentration based upon near-infrared scan results.

      The protocol is not a safety study since no physiological effects are expected at microdose
      levels of ABY-029. No diagnostic or therapeutic intent is proposed, and administration of the
      study drug is not intended to alter the extent of planned tumor resection during the surgical
      procedure.
