      infusion. Both drugs will be administered once every 28 days. Treatment is expected to
      continue for 6 cycles, unless disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity
      requires discontinuation of the drug. At the discretion of the investigator, patients who
      show signs of benefit may continue beyond 6 cycles.

      Once a MTD/RD has been determined, a dose expansion cohort of patients with metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer will be treated at the determined MTD.
