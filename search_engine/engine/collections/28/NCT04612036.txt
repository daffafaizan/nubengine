      vibroarthrography (VAG) signals for subjects implanted with Journey II Bi-Cruciate Stabilized
      (BCS), CR (Cruciate Retaining), and Bi-Cruciate Retaining (XR) TKAs. The Journey II BCS Knee
      System was designed to resect and replicate both the PCL and ACL, the Journey II CR System
      retains the posterior cruciate ligament, while the Journey II XR System retains the cruciate
      and collateral ligaments so they remain intact.
