    
      Autism spectrum disorder presents many alterations in amino acid metabolism and in
      neurotransmitter systems (gamma amino acid system, glutamate-glutamine, nicotine-acid,
      serotonin-system) . Also alteration in gene activation within nerve cells and lymphocyte
      cultures encloses over 600 genes, affecting a wide field of enzymes , metabolic pathways and
      hormone formation. Male hormones and their precursors are often increased and their influence
      to nerve cell growth and spine formation is evident.

      The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is made in accordance of criteria of the Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) of the American Psychiatric
      Association by an experienced and specialised paediatrician or psychologist and /or by an
      Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) or Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)
      .

      Overnight urine with measurement of quantity and time will be collected and a little part of
      the urinary samples will be frozen for storage till analysis. Age, weight and length of the
      children at collection time will be ascertained.

      Four stratified groups (autistic boys, girls, and healthy controls, boys and girls, each age
      5-15) will be formed.

      Urinary samples will further remain anonymous through an Identification-Number (ID).

      Analysis of hormones and the most of the known metabolites excreted in urine will be
      performed by a specialised laboratory using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
      analysis (University Hospital Bern, Steroid Laboratory, Switzerland).

      The statistical analysis, with age, gender, weight, diagnosis and hormone analysis results as
      factors , consists in linear regression analysis to detect deviation in hormone formation and
      metabolism.
