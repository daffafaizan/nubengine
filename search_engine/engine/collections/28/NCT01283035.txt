      I. To assess the activity of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in patients with recurrent grade
      2 or 3 platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, as
      measured by the frequency of patients experiencing an objective tumor response by Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria or who survive progression-free for at
      least 6 months after initiation of therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the duration of progression-free and overall survival following initiation of
      therapy with MK-2206 in the cohort of patients enrolled on this study.

      II. To determine the toxicities of MK-2206, as assessed by the active version of the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 III. To
      explore the association between select biomarkers and response to MK-2206 (as assessed by
      objective tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival) IV. To explore the
      development of feedback loop activation and target inhibition with MK-2206 via analysis of
      pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies in select patients enrolled in the trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Akt inhibitor MK2206 will be taken orally (PO) once a week for four weeks (one cycle).
      Treatment will continue for as long as a subject is benefiting from the study drug.

      During each cycle subjects will have a physical exam, blood samples and an electrocardiogram
      (EKG) (first 2 cycles). Every 2 cycles a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of chest, stomach area, and pelvis will be performed. Optional tumor biopsies
      may be performed.
