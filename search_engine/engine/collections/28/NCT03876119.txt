      mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke and complete or near-complete
      recanalization of a proximal vessel occlusion and successful brain reperfusion on cerebral
      angiogram (corresponding to mTICI score 2b/3) The study is a multicenter, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double blind, phase 2b trial of acute stroke patients treated with MT, in
      which two therapies are compared: rt-PA or placebo. Allocation at each center will account
      for 1 stratum: use of alteplase (yes vs. no) before MT. Subjects will be followed up to 90
      days post-randomization

      Patients will be enrolled in the angiosuit by interventionalists or neurologists once a mTICI
      2b/3 is confirmed on cerebral angiography. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients
      with a mRS 0 to 1 at 90 days. A sample size of 100 patients per treatment arm in a 1:1
      allocation will have at least 80% statistical power for the primary outcome (mRS with 0-1
      score values) assuming a rate of 40% in the control arm and a 21% benefit in the experimental
      arm (odds ratio (OR) of 2.33) for a 5% two-sided type I error. This sample size will also
      guarantee the study power for that relative treatment benefit even if the success rate in the
      control group rises up to â‰ˆ56%. No study losses are accounted for since all randomised
      patients will be included in the analysis.
