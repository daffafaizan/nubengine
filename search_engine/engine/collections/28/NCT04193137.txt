      aldosteronism screening. Every patient will undertake four confirmatory tests to compare the
      diagnostic accuracy of the oral sodium loading test with captopril challenge testing (CCT)
      and Seated saline infusion test(SSST)using the fludrocortisone suppression testing (FST) as
      the reference standard, and to investigate the optimal cutoff of oral sodium loading test
