    
      This is a prospective, multi-center phase 2 clinical trial in which 200 primary heart
      transplant recipients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either tocilizumab (ActemraÂ®) or
      placebo (normal saline) plus standard triple maintenance immunosuppression. Investigators
      will recruit primary heart transplant recipients from 14 participating centers. Subjects will
      be screened, consented, and enrolled while on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)
      wait list. When the recipient has received the transplant and is deemed hemodynamically
      stable, randomization will occur.

      Study duration: The study duration will be approximately 4 years. There will be a 36-month
      accrual period, and participants will be followed for a minimum 12-month, and a maximum 24
      months after heart transplantation.

      *** IMPORTANT NOTICE: *** The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases does not
      recommend the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy for recipients of cell, organ, or
      tissue transplants outside of physician-directed, controlled clinical studies.
      Discontinuation of prescribed immunosuppressive therapy can result in serious health
      consequences and should only be performed in certain rare circumstances, upon the
      recommendation and with the guidance of your health care provider.
