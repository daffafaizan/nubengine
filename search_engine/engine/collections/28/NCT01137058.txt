      glucose control compared to the conventional treatment. This study has become the foundation
      of web-based methodology in the glucose control. In addition, the combined application of
      mobile device and web-based monitoring system for chronic diseases showed improvement in
      various metabolic parameters in obese patients with diabetes and hypertension.

      Thus, the application of U-healthcare based on advanced information technology would be
      helpful in the diabetes management. We plan to provide an individualized U-healthcare service
      using advanced information technology that enables more effective glucose control.
