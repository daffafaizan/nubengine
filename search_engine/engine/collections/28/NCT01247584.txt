        -  To compare the frequency of germline telomerase mutations in pediatric patients with
           acute myeloid leukemia (AML) demonstrating prolonged myelosuppression, defined as â‰¥ 1
           episode > 35 days of neutrophil count recovery after chemotherapy, to the pediatric
           patients with the expected myelosuppression, defined as consistently < 35 days of
           neutrophil count recovery after chemotherapy.

        -  To assess association between telomerase mutations and incidence of grade 3 or 4
           mucositis, relapse, and death.

        -  To compare germline (remission) telomere length in pediatric AML patients demonstrating
           delayed bone marrow recovery with the pediatric patients with consistently expected
           recovery.

        -  To assess whether a correlation between telomere length and incidence of grade 3 or 4
           mucositis, relapse, and death exist.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Cryopreserved bone marrow samples are analyzed for DNA sequencing and mutation by
      Sanger-based sequencing methods, quantitative PCR, and SeqMan Pro (Lasergene from DNAStar).
      Results are then compared with previously published data and existing databases to determine
      the allele frequency in control populations.
