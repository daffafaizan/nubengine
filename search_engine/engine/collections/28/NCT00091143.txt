      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity and immune effects of vaccination comprising modified gp100
           peptide (gp100:209-217[210M]), Montanide ISA-51, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin followed
           by peripheral blood mononuclear cell reinfusion after treatment-induced lymphopenia with
           fludarabine in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the induction of antigen-specific T-cell responses in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the kinetics and duration of immune response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Compare the immunologic effects of this regimen in these patients with historical
           results.

      Secondary

        -  Compare 2 different dosing schedules of fludarabine, in terms of induction of
           lymphopenia and granulocytopenia and on the induction of a specific immune response to
           this vaccine, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Within 2 weeks before the start of fludarabine, all patients undergo leukapheresis over 4-6
      hours for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fludarabine as in arm I on days 1, 3, and 5. In both arms,
           patients receive autologous PBMCs IV over approximately 30 minutes on day 8 and
           vaccination comprising gp100:209-217(210M) peptide, Montanide ISA-51, and keyhole limpet
           hemocyanin subcutaneously on days 8, 22, 36, 50, and 64. Patients with stable or
           responding disease continue to receive vaccination on day 78 and then every 28-31 days
           for up to 1 year.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
