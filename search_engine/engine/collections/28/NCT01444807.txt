      However, up-regulation of the Ras pathway is thought to play a role.

      VEGF expression could represent independent prognostic factors for survival possibly linking
      expression of this protein with clinical outcome.

      Sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of both Raf-kinase and VEGF R2 signalling The anti-tumoral
      activity of Sorafenib was clearly demonstrated in phase III trial regarding advanced
      pretreated RCC.

      Surgical removal of metastatic disease could potentially increase the disease control rate.

      Particularly in patients with a disease free interval post nephrectomy of at least 1 year,
      with one small metastatic lesion, metastasectomy could represents an important therapeutic
      approach.

      After a radical resection of the metastatic disease is unclear if an anti-tumoral systemic
      therapy may increase patient survival.

      In summary, both the preclinical and clinical data support further evaluation of Sorafenib in
      RCC patients.
