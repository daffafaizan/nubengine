      basic life support (BLS) which is fundamental as an initial response in cases of emergency.

      This study aimed to (1) Evaluate the efficacy of peer-led model in basic life support
      training among medical students in their first three years of study, compared to
      professional-led training and (2) To assess the efficacy of the course program and students'
      satisfaction of peer-led training.

      A randomized controlled trial with blinded assessors will be conducted on 72 medical students
      from the pre-clinical years (1st to 3rd years in Syria) at Syrian Private University.
      Students will be randomly assigned to peer-led or to professional-led training group for
      one-day-course of basic life support skills.

      Analysis will be done on students who underwent checklist based assessment using objective
      structured clinical examination design (OSCE) (practical assessment of BLS skills) and
      answered BLS knowledge checkpoint-questionnaire.
