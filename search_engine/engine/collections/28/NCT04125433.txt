      Community Health Advocate (CHA). Contact and engagement with participating members will be
      through both direct intervention in the emergency department by Peer Support Specialist (the
      peer) as well as in the community for prevention visits and follow up by both the peer and
      Community Health Advocate. These well-positioned Peers and Community Health Advocates will
      address Behavioral and Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) concerns through a highly
      coordinated intervention supported by a common IT Medicaid member tracking platform. This
      research project will determine the feasibility of deploying a single shared IT platform that
      will include referral, appointment completion, and intervention outcome data. Project staff
      will develop a trusting relationship with the members and will improve member access and
      engagement with community-based services. The project will also seek to determine the impact
      on total cost of care through redirecting study participants to community resources that are
      more appropriate, and less expensive than return visits to the emergency department.
