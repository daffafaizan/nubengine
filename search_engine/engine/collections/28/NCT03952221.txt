      has physical, chemical and biologic effects, like thermal effect, micro-massage, increased
      tissue metabolism, capillary permeability and tissue healing. Continuous or pulsed forms can
      be applied.

      As pulsed ultrasound therapy has no thermal effect, greater intensity can be used. It can
      alleviate acute pain and inflammation. Continuous ultrasound is usually used in chronic
      musculoskeletal diseases, in case of limitation of joint motion because its thermal effect.

      Ultrasound can be combined with electrotherapy, when the effects of the two modalities are
      summed up.
