      programs on gait function in older adults. It is expected that improved control of foot
      placement in the lateral stepping task will transfer to improved control during typical
      forward walking. Moreover, it is expected that lateral stepping gait training will have a
      greater effect on recurrent fallers older adults than on the non-fallers older adults and
      young adults. It is also expected that the above beneficial results will be retained in a
      follow-up test six weeks after completion of the intervention and will result in improvements
      in common clinical balance tests that are used to assess fall risk. Therefore, in the current
      proposal, older adults aged 65 years of age and over are being asked to participate.
