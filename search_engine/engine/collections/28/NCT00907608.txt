      percent of the global diabetic population coming from Asia. Growing evidence confirms the
      predictive role of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
      This is due to the constellation of conventional and non-conventional risk factors in
      patients who develop CKD, such as anemia, inflammation and abnormal bone metabolism. In this
      regard, anemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in
      patients with CKD, patients with left ventricular dysfunction and in general population.

      Effective erythropoiesis is dependent on the production of erythropoietin by the kidneys.
      Anemia is a common finding in patients with diabetes and up to 20% of diabetic patients are
      noted to have anemia. In a meta-analysis of community-based population studies, anemia
      interacts with CKD to increase the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and all-cause
      mortality among patients with diabetes. Previous studies that examined the effect of
      erythropoietin therapy on anemic subjects with CKD did not find statistical difference in
      mortality rates between the treated and untreated groups. Possible explanations for the lack
      of benefits include higher level of blood pressure and increased blood viscosity leading to
      worsening of chronic congestive heart failure in the treated subjects. We hypothesize that
      partial correction of hemoglobin may be more appropriate.
