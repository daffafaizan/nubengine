    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      trial of oral enoximone in approximately 700 subjects with advanced chronic heart failure of
      either ischemic or nonischemic etiology receiving optimal conventional heart failure therapy.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either enoximone or placebo at
      the Randomization Visit. The initial dose of study drug will be 25 mg t.i.d.(3xday) and will
      be administered immediately after randomization. Subjects who tolerate this initial dose will
      be continued on 25 mg t.i.d. for at least two weeks. After two weeks, eligible subjects will
      be titrated to 50 mg t.i.d. for the duration of the study.
