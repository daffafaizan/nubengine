        -  Busulfan (Busulfex®; Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC, Greenville, NC 27834) 3.2 mg/kg
           + 5% DW (the diluent quantity should be 10 times the volume of Busulfan, so that the
           final concentration of busulfan becomes approximately 0.5 mg/mL), intravenously for 3
           hours once daily for 3 days (days -7 to -5)

        -  Fludarabine (Fludarabine®, Zydus Hospira Oncology Private Ltd., Ahmedabad, India) 30
           mg/m2 + 5% DW 100㎖, intravenously for over 1 hour once daily for 6 days (days -8 to -3)

      Primary objective of this study I. To determine the 2-year progression-free survival of this
      reduced toxicity conditioning in relapsed or refractory T- and NK/T-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma
      patients.

      Secondary endpoints I. To evaluate the response rate, engraftment rate and time to
      engraftment, 2-year overall survival, 100-days treatment-related mortality, regimen-related
      toxicities by CTCAE version 4.03, post-transplantation complications (HVOD, acute/chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,CMV disease) of this
      reduced toxicity conditioning in relapsed or refractory T- and NK/T-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma
      patients.
