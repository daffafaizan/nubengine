      refugees and poor Ecuadorian households in four urban and peri-urban areas of Carchi and
      Sucumbios in northern Ecuador. The transfer is given monthly for 6 months. The program is
      conditional on attendance at nutrition and community trainings occurring once a month. In
      most cases the transfer recipient is the female head of household or spouse, however in some
      cases men may also receive the transfer.

      The study is a 2 stage randomized control trial where, first, 80 neighborhoods were
      randomized to either treatment or control group; second, treatment clusters (geographical
      units within neighborhoods) were randomized to either: cash, food voucher or food assistance.
      Approximately 20 - 28 participants from each of the 145 clusters were randomly selected for
      interviews. In addition to the household socio-economic survey, hemoglobin measures were
      taken from children between 6 months and 5 years of age and adolescent girls from age 10 to
      16 years in each household. The baseline survey occurred in April 2011 and the endline in
      November 2011.

      Interviews were conducted with female heads of households or spouses where possible, or with
      adult male head of households. In addition, hemoglobin was collected for all children ages 6
      months to 5 years and for adolescent girls residing in surveyed households.
