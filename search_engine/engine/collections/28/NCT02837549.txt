    
      Our specific aims are to:

        1. Determine the feasibility of a novel rehabilitation strategy provided at the University
           of Michigan Scleroderma Clinic to scleroderma patients who have upper extremity
           contractures.

           Investigators will assess 3 main aspects of the process that are key to the success of a
           larger study including the proportion of eligible people who enroll in the study, rate
           of adherence to the treatment protocol, and the time it takes to conduct sessions
           including treatment and outcome assessment completion. Based on a framework of
           recommendations for well-designed pilot studies [1], investigators have set the
           following criteria for success to examine these aspects:

             1. At least 50% of participants who are eligible for the study will enroll.

             2. At least 80% of participants will attend all treatment sessions.

             3. The 3 sessions involving both treatment and outcome assessments will not last on
                average more than 2 hours.

        2. Develop a standardized treatment manual to train therapists to provide this treatment to
           their patients.

           A standardized treatment manual for therapists is a critical component needed to ensure
           consistency in a larger multi-site trial. This manual will be drafted for use in this
           study and refined as needed.

        3. Establish preliminary effects of this 8-week rehabilitation program on improving arm
           function.

      Investigators hypothesize that participants with scleroderma will have significant
      improvements in the QuickDASH disability measure at post test. Although the investigators
      think large effects will be shown, this study will allow us to determine estimates of the
      effects and the variability for power calculations in a multi-site trial.
