    
      First phase will enrol 10,000 persons initiating vaccination (assuming 4 vaccines). If more
      vaccines become available additional 2,500 persons per vaccine will be included. Subsequent
      phases with larger sections of the population included may be implemented.

      Participants will have 6 study visits and be followed for 2 years after the first
      vaccination, which offers the participants an extra close follow up on vaccine effectiveness.
      Safety data will be collected at study visits until 3 months after the first vaccination.
      Research samples will be collected at each study visit during the two year follow-up
