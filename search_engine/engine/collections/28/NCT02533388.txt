    
      A total of 100 elderly patients scheduled for elective supratentorial craniotomy under
      propofol-remifentanil total intravenous anaesthesia were randomly divided to either TEAS
      group (received stimulation at LI4, PC6, LU7, LU5, LI18 and ST9 acupoints, 2/10Hz, 6-15 mA)
      or Sham group (received no stimulation). The primary outcomes were the haemodynamic
      parameters and plasma concentrations of epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol
      (Cor). The secondary outcomes were the consumption of remifentanil and propofol, the time
      from discontinuation of anesthetics to extubation and reorientation, extubation quality
      score, the quality of postoperative recovery and postoperative complications.
