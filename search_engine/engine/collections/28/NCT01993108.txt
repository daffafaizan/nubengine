      brain. These are brain circuits which allow a person to regulate their attention, regulate
      their behavioral responses, and regulate their decision-making. We are also interested in how
      the medications methylphenidate and naltrexone affect these regulatory circuits.
      Methylphenidate is a widely-used, FDA approved medication used to treat Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and is also known as Ritalin. Naltrexone is an FDA approved
      medication used to help treat alcohol and substance abuse.

      This research study will use a scanning technique known as functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI)which takes a special kind of picture of the brain that enables us to "see the
      brain at work". Adult participants will be given a one-time dose of either methylphenidate,
      naltrexone,or placebo before each fMRI scan session. There are three total fMRI scan
      sessions. Therefore, each participant will receive each possible medication/placebo only
      once.

      Using the fMRI technique, the main purpose of this research is to better understand the
      functioning of regulatory circuits in healthy individuals and individuals with psychiatric
      disorders. This research may one day help us develop better treatments for these disorders.
