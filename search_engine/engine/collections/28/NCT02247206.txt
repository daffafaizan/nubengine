      with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and has been shown to be efficacious in separate randomized
      trials with children and adults; however, many families of children with TS are prevented
      from accessing it due to limited availability of adequately trained treatment providers.
      Recent research has shown that videoconference-delivered CBIT is as effective as face to face
      delivery, and that both modalities are efficacious. Despite its effectiveness, traditional
      videoconferencing has limitations including lack of portability, ease of access, the need for
      third party clinics, and cost. A newer, more convenient alternative to increase access is the
      use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transmission, allowing for the direct delivery of
      CBIT to patients' homes.

      Therefore the objective of this study (the final phase of a three-phase project) is to
      establish the preliminary efficacy of VoIP-modified CBIT for reducing tics in children with
      TS relative to a waitlist-control. Twenty children (ages 9-17) with TS or Chronic Tic
      Disorder as a primary diagnosis will be recruited for a randomized, observer-blind, waitlist
      controlled trial of VoIP-delivered CBIT. Participants will be randomly assigned to 8 weekly
      sessions of CBIT-VoIP over a 10-week acute treatment period, or waitlist control condition.
      As an exploratory aim, the current study will investigate potential correlates of treatment
      outcome, including home computer equipment available (i.e., web camera type, microphone type,
      internet upload speed, and type of internet connection), prior computer experience, and
      comfort with study computer equipment.
