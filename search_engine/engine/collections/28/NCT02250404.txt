      I. To collect and analyze small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumor DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      from 3 human patients before and after relapse to identify the molecular signatures of
      relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via RNA sequencing and DNA methylation at
      baseline. Patients also undergo collection of tissue samples for analysis at relapse.
