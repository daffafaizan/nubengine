      mortality and morbidity account for 22% to 25% in cerebrovascular disease ,which is a growing
      trend. IA is one of the major diseases which relate with people's living standards.
      Endovascular embolization is one of the main treatments of IA with less invasive, Better cure
      rates and higher safety. It has been developed rapidly and improve quality of patients' lives
      after treatmen.With the rapid development of neural intervention and the proliferation of
      specialized stents in IA, stent-assisted embolization technique is becoming more and more
      common .Especially, stents play an important role in intracranial aneurysmal aneurysm.

      There are many kinds intracranial stents for clinical surgery, but how to choose the
      appropriate stent type is one of the key issues that clinicians need to settle. And, there is
      no relevant multicenter cases study about selection strategy of intracranial stent at home
      and abroad.
