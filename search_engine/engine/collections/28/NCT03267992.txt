    
      COPD Co-Pilot AIR™ combines a digital respiratory symptom reporting participant application
      (an "app") with facilitation of rapid personalized clinical recommendations made by the
      participant's health care provider and communicated to the participant through the
      application. COPD Co-Pilot AIR™ provides early identification of an increase in a
      participant's respiratory symptoms relative to the participant's own baseline symptom profile
      which in turn enables health care providers to rapidly implement modified treatment plans.
