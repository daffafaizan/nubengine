      world. The screening tests include flexible sigmoidoscopy, optical colonoscopy (OC),
      double-contrast barium enema , or CT colonography . Such screening can reduce CRC incidence
      and mortality but its effectiveness depends on its quality, ease of use, and patient
      adherence .Colon capsule endoscopy(CCE) is being actively evaluated as an emerging
      complementary or alternative procedure for evaluation of the colon. magnetic -controlled
      capsule endoscopy system is a new ingestible colon capsule robot provided by Chongqing
      Jinshan Science & Technology. While Screening the colon, the capsule is drove by
      magnetic-manipulator outside the body, which means it can move from the cecum to anus step by
      step under the control of the doctor. However, there's little data report on this colon
      capsule robot system in clinical application. The investigators plan to conduct this
      prospective study to determine the feasibility and safety of magnetic-controlled capsule
      endoscopy system in examination of human colon under the real time monitoring by colonoscopy.
