      microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC). MMR expression and MSS
      status are the important effective factors of immunotherapy. PD-1monocolnal antibody therapy
      has accessed excellent treatment effect in advanced dMMR/MSI-H CRC and neoadjuvant
      therapeutic effect in early colon cancer, more than fifty percent of dMMR/MSI-H CRC patients
      might get pathological complete response(pCR) after PD-1 monoclonal antibody treatment. The
      treatments had been proved to be safe and the toxicities were controllable. Rectal cancer(RC)
      is one of the most common malignant tumors in China. So far, radical resection with or
      without neoadjuvant chemotherapy of chemoradiotherapy are still standard comprehensive
      treatments recommended to distal RC by NCCN, ESMO and CSCO. For distant RC, radical resection
      and neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy might cause lots of treatment cost,damage
      to defecation and sexual function, acute toxicity, chronic dysfunction, even loss of anus and
      psychological disorder. So far, whether watch and wait could be performed in patients with
      dMMR/MSI-H distal RC accessed pCR after PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy or not is still not
      clear. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effect and safety of watch and wait in patients
      with dMMR/MSI-H distal RC accessed pCR after PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy.
