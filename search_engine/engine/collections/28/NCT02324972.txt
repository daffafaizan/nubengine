      chemokines and other chemoattractant factors followed by recruitment of inflammatory cell
      subtypes (10). IL-16, a Langerhans cells (LC)-derived chemoattractant cytokine for CD4+
      cells, RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-4) and eotaxin are overexpressed in
      epidermal keratinocytes from AD subjects and may contribute to the chemotaxis of eosinophils,
      macrophages and Th2-lymphocytes (11).

      Since the activation of SHIP1 by AQX-1125 results in the inhibition of inflammatory cell
      chemotaxis and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, this study hypothesized that
      AQX-1125 would improve AD.
