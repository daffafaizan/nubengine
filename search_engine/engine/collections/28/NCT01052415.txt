      in the battle against HIV in China. The number of annual reported HIV infections in China has
      increased steadily. The proposed study will be the first randomized controlled intervention
      trial that specifically targets stigma and access to universal precautions in medical
      settings, and is implemented at multiple sites in Yunnan and Fujian. Among the two target
      provinces, Yunnan has the highest number of reported HIV infections in China whereas Fujian
      is one of the provinces reporting the lowest HIV prevalence rate in China. With the trial
      implemented in Yunnan and Fujian Provinces simultaneously, we will examine the program's
      efficacy in two provinces that vary dramatically in HIV prevalence and infection routes. We
      propose to include two provinces that represent China as a whole, due to the varied HIV rates
      and infection routes in diverse regions; thus allowing us to disentangle the relations among
      HIV-related stigma, fear of infection, and HIV prevalence.

      Specific Aim 1: To examine whether providers in the intervention hospitals, compared to
      providers in the standard care condition, will demonstrate positive attitudinal outcomes,
      including an increase in comfort in working with PLH and a decrease in unrealistic fear of
      infection at work, prejudicial attitudes, and support of coercive policies.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine whether providers in the intervention hospitals, compared to
      providers in the standard care condition, will demonstrate more positive behavioral outcomes,
      including an increase in adherence to universal precaution, routine treatment and referrals,
      confidentiality protection, diffusion of positive messages with co-workers, and a decrease in
      critical incidents.

      Specific Aim 3: To explore whether patients in the intervention hospitals, compared to
      patients at hospitals in the standard care condition, will report a decreased level of
      perceived unfair treatment and increased service satisfaction, service utilization, and
      treatment adherence.
