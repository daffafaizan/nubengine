      reason not to quit and actual weight gain is a primary reason for relapse, especially among
      women. Although the causes of weight gain following smoking cessation are complex, increased
      caloric intake is recognized as one of the primary sources. One explanation for increased
      caloric intake is that, there are common neural mechanisms for food and cigarette reward and
      hence food reward can substitute for cigarette reward and vice versa. An alternative
      explanation for weight gain following smoking cessation is that there is an overall decrease
      in brain reward function during nicotine withdrawal, which leads to a decrease in the reward
      value of food and consequent increase in intake to maintain the total amount of reward
      obtained by food. The success of the proposed studies relies upon our ability to deliver
      odorants in the fMRI scanner and to measure neural activation in regions such as the
      amygdala, which are susceptible to inhomogeneity artifacts.
