      catheter (trade name: Bactiseal) produced by Codman & Shurtleff, Inc. of the United States.
      Device safety would be assessed based on all the adverse events that occurred within one year
      after the subjects implanted the catheter.

      This study was designed to be single arm, multi-center, and retrospective. A total of 50
      patients would be retrospectively enrolled. Information would be collected on adverse events
      of subjects enrolled within one year after the implantation of the Bactiseal Catheter from
      August 07, 2018 to January 31, 2021.

      The following information would be collected from subjects' medical records or hospitals'
      databases (if any):

        1. General condition of the subjects

        2. Intraoperative condition and catheter implantation

        3. Information on the shunt product

        4. Adverse events of subjects within one year after the operation and classification of the
           adverse events

        5. Relevant examinations in case of postoperative infection

        6. Other adverse event-related information (except anticipated adverse events)
