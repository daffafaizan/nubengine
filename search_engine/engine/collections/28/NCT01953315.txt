      undergo a biopsy of the muscle from the inner thigh under anesthesia. The muscle sample will
      be cultured and expanded for approximately 6 weeks. The product, composed of autologous, ex
      vivo-expanded muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) in suspension, will be delivered via targeted
      injection into the bladder neck sphincter region using either an endoscopic needle via a
      cystoscope or periurethral injection under ultrasound guidance. All subjects will be followed
      at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-injection.
