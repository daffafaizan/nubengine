      ACEI/ARB during the initial phase of in-patient treatment with aggressive diuresis. This
      hypothesis will be tested by randomly allocating 360 admitted patients with ADHF on two
      treatment paths: 1) no ACEI/ARB administered for initial 72 hours of treatment during
      aggressive diuresis versus 2) full dose ACEI/ARB administered concurrently with aggressive
      diuresis in na√Øve patients/home dose, who are already on such therapy. The study team hopes
      to find that holding ACEI/ARBs during the initial 72 hours of admission with acute
      decompensated systolic heart failure will help preserve renal function, as demonstrated by a
      lesser decline in GFR. In addition, this treatment would allow the option of aggressive
      diuresis in volume overloaded CHF patients, resulting in a lesser decline of AKI, length of
      stay, readmission rates, and costs associated with CHF treatment. By understanding the
      complex interaction between holding ACEIs/ARBs and continued aggressive diuresis, the
      investigators intend to develop optimal dosing strategies for acute, decompensated CHF
      patients, further minimizing adverse events such as electrolyte issues and declining GFR/AKI.
