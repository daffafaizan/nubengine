      injection oxytocin with blood samples taken thereafter in order to create a formula to
      describe the concentrations of oxytocin in the blood over time (pharmacokinetics). In this
      study people with knee arthritis so severe that a joint replacement is needed are recruited
      for a one day study. Participants will come to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and have an
      intravenous catheter (IV) inserted in the forearm. Participants will get a single IM
      injection of oxytocin (PitocinÂ®), 17 micrograms (10 International Units (IU)) and blood will
      be taken several times over the next 120 minutes and the amount of oxytocin measured in the
      blood samples. This information will be analyzed by another group at Stanford University in
      the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) Core part of this application. The Core group
      at Stanford will use mathematics to fit the amount of oxytocin over time as it disappears
      from blood to a formula, called pharmacokinetics. The effect of subject age, sex, race,
      ethnicity and weight on the pharmacokinetics of oxytocin will be tested for, since these
      things can affect how quickly drugs circulate in the blood and are important to better adjust
      the dose of drug to the individual.

      The main purpose of this study is to sample the blood and calculate the pharmacokinetics of
      oxytocin. The research participants will not benefit from this study, but the knowledge
      investigators get will be important not only to adjust oxytocin dose to individuals, but to
      study its possible effects on pain in a very standardized way. The sample size chosen is
      needed to get an accurate estimate for the parameters in the pharmacokinetic model for the
      population, not just the subjects in this study.
