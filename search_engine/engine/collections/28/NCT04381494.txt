      experience pulmonary AEs that could become severe if not recognized and treated in time.

      Data collected will be used to evaluate the likelihood of early detection of pulmonary AEs in
      unresectable Stage III NSCLC patients on durvalumab. This project seeks to understand if
      multiparametric mobile technology collecting patient reported outcomes, vital signs, and
      respiratory function, integrate well into a patients daily life and aid physicians in early
      detection of pulmonary AEs.
