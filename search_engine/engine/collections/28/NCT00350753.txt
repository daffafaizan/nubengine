    
      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the median time to progression (TTP) and response rate (RR) of the
           combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with advanced upper
           gastro-intestinal carcinomas, refractory or intolerant to standard systemic therapy.

      Secondary Objective

        -  To determine safety, tolerability and toxicity.

        -  To determine median and overall survival (OS).

        -  To correlate efficacy of treatment with the expression of tumor markers obtained in
           serum (EFGR, bFGF, p-VEGF-A, and sVEGF-R2), in paraffin embedded tumor tissue (micro
           vessel density (MVD), and expression of VEGFR and EGFR, after immunostaining), and in
           fresh frozen tumor biopsies (micro array-based analyses of patterns of gene expression).

      Treatment:

      Bevacizumab (Avastin√í) will be given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every other week.

      Erlotinib is given as an orally daily dose and most be taken at least one hour before or two
      hours after ingestion of food.
