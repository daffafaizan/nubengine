      limiting characteristic. Inhaled β2-adrenoreceptor agonists like albuterol are the most
      effective treatments available for the relief of acute asthma symptoms. However, there is
      evidence that regular use may lead to adverse effects in some patients. Previous studies have
      shown that polymorphisms of the β2-adrenergic receptor can influence airway responses to
      regular inhaled beta-agonist treatment.

      Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genetic differences influence the variability in
      patients' responses to therapy, both therapeutic and adverse. Genetic susceptibility and
      environmental factors both play major roles in the etiology of asthma. The strong familial
      clustering of asthma has lead to a surge of research into the genetic predisposition of
      asthma. The aim of the present study is to utilize a double-blinded prospective cohort study
      to investigate whether genotype-specific effects occur when assessing the duration of
      protection conferred against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction by regular salmeterol
      treatment.
