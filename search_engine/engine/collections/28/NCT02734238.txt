      placebo-controlled trial. After completing a 14-day (free-living, phase 1), energy-adequate,
      diet-acclimation phase (protein, 1.6 g∙kg-1∙d-1; fat 30% total energy intake, with remaining
      energy derived from carbohydrate), participants will be randomized to one of two experimental
      groups and undergo a 28-day (live-in, phase 2), 55% energy deficit phase: energy deficit
      alone (DEF) or energy deficit + exogenous testosterone (DEF+TEST). Recovery (free-living,
      phase 3) will be assessed after completing phase 2 to determine when body mass has been
      recovered within ± 2.5% of initial body mass (duration will vary, 42-day maximum for phase
      3). This study will delineate the contribution of testosterone declines from the physical and
      mental demands encountered by Warfighters during military training and combat operations on
      complex markers of physiological and psychological status, addressing a direct, consistently
      observed, gap in knowledge.
