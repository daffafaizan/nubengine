    
      This is a multicenter, randomized superiority trial comparing closed reduction and cast
      immobilization to flexible intramedullary nails in 7-12 year old children with > 10Â° of
      angulation and/or > 10mm of shortening in displaced both bone forearm shaft fractures
      (AO-pediatric classification: 22D/2.1-5.2). A total of 78 patients with minimum 2 years of
      expected growth left are randomized in 1:1 ratio to either treatment group. The study has a
      parallel non-randomized patient preference arm. Both treatments are performed under general
      anesthesia. In the cast group a long arm cast is applied for 6 weeks. The flexible
      intramedullary nail group is immobilized in a collar and cuff sling for 4 weeks. Data is
      collected at baseline and at each follow-up until 1 year.

      Primary outcome is 1) PROMIS Pediatric Item Bank v2.0 - Upper Extremity and 2) forearm
      pronation-supination range of motion at one-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes are Quick
      DASH, Pediatric pain questionnaire and Cosmetic VAS and wrist range of motion as well as any
      complications (malunion, delayed union, non-union or deep wound infection, peripheral nerve
      injury, need for re-intervention during 1-year follow-up) and costs of treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that flexible intramedullary nailing results in a superior
      outcome.
