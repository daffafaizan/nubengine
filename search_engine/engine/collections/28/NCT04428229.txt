      performed (Trendelenburg) during laparoscopic colon and gynecologic surgeries. Intracranial
      pressure (ICP) may be affected by positive intraabdominal pressure due to pneumoperitoneum.
      The Trendelenburg position (usually at a degree of 25-400) causes increasing in the pressure
      of cerebrospinal fluid during surgery. Therefore, cerebral edema and an increasing in ICP may
      occur. It is difficult to measure the several levels of intracranial pressure during
      abdominal surgery, and direct monitoring with intracranial devices is often impossible.
      Measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) via ultrasonography has been developed as
      an alternative method for evaluating intracranial pressure. The optic nerve is an extension
      of the central nervous system, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and continues with the
      nerve sheath. Increased intracranial pressure may cause in expanding of the optic nerve
      sheath and may increase the diameter. Therefore, measuring the diameter of the optic nerve
      sheath via ultrasonography is considered as a non-invasive, easy-to-apply and reliable method
      to evaluate intracranial pressure.

      In this study, we aimed to evaluate the changes of optic nerve sheath diameter in patients
      who will undergo laparoscopic colon and gynecologic surgery during trendelenburg position.
      Our primary goal is to compare the optic nerve sheath diameters via ultrasonography, and our
      secondary aim is to evaluate the effect of this change on intracranial pressure.
