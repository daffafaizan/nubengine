      gangrene attributable to objectively proven arterial occlusive disease, is associated with
      the appalling prospect that approximately 30% will lose their leg and 25% will die at one
      year. Despite the progress of therapeutics these statistics haven't changed. Critical limb
      ischemia is a clinical diagnosis but should be supported by objective tests. None of theses
      tests (toe blood pressure (TBP), transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) and skin perfusion
      pressure (SPP)) have proven to be enough specific or sensitive, more so they are time
      consuming, can be subject to several artifacts and may be in some cases discordant making
      diagnosis difficult. Fluorescence angiography has long been used in ophthalmology for the
      evaluation of the microcirculation of the retina. Infracyanine remains within the
      intravascular space allowing the visualization of the vasculature to a depth of 10 mm. With
      the Fluobeam system, images to a maximal width of 20 cm can be obtained therefore allowing
      the evaluation of the tissue perfusion of the entire foot.

      Method: Fluorescence angiography is performed in the laboratory in the same time as TCPO2, TP
      and SPP. Infracyanine is injected in an antecubital vein and visualization and signal
      acquisition carried out using a specific camera device (Fluoptic SAS, France) producing the
      time course of hemodynamic parameters (slope, amplitude, saturation time).

      30patients will be evaluated with correlation between data obtained by fluorescence
      angiography and too blood pressure
