      safety and efficacy of autologous cord blood infusion in children who demonstrate
      non-progressive motor disability due to brain dysfunction (commonly called cerebral palsy)
      and who do not have an apparent disorder of brain development or obstructive hydrocephalus.
      The degree of delay in motor development will be such that the children are unable to sit
      independently by 12 months of age or unable to walk independently by 18 months of age.
      However, because the diagnosis is one of exclusion, we will enroll patients only after they
      have reached two years of age. By this age, it is likely other conditions would be excluded.
      As the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was developed for children up to 12
      years of age, the maximum age of recruitment will be 12 years. Any level of cerebral palsy
      severity will be allowed. The subjects will be children whose parents have saved their
      infants cord blood, who have clinical evidence of a non-progressive motor disability, and
      whose parents intend to have a cord blood infusion.
