      contact pressures secondary to decreased acetabular coverage of the femoral head and/or
      incongruity of the articular surfaces. The investigators' hypothesis is that when
      periacetabular osteotomy is performed and contact pressure on cartilage reduced, additional
      joint degeneration will be slowed or prevented unless irreparable damage to the cartilage has
      happened at the time periacetabular osteotomy is performed. Hence, the purposes of this study
      are:

        -  to develop an unbiased and precise method for measurement of the thickness of the
           articular cartilage in the hip joint because such a method can be used to evaluate the
           effect of periacetabular osteotomy and also to give a more precise
           indication/contraindication for surgery;

        -  to evaluate the migration of the acetabulum postoperatively and 6 months after surgery
           by use of RSA to examine the stability of the osteotomy; and

        -  to examine bone mineral density in acetabulum 1 and 2 years after surgery in order to
           find out whether the change in load distribution will affect bone density of the
           acetabulum over time in a way that in the area where more load is applied, bone density
           will increase, and in areas with less load, bone density will decrease;

        -  to examine the labrum in the hip joint.
