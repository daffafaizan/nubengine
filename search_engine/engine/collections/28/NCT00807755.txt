      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of everolimus combined with carboplatin and
           etoposide in patients with advanced solid tumors, with emphasis on small cell lung
           cancer (SCLC).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the maximum-tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Describe the dose-limiting toxicities and toxicity profile associated with this regimen
           in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in an expanded cohort of patients
           with SCLC.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of everolimus in this combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus on days 1-21, carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1,
      and etoposide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients in the expanded cohort undergo blood collection on days 1, 15, and 22 for
      pharmacokinetic studies by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.
