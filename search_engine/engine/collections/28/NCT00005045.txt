      recurrent or metastatic renal cell cancer (refractory to immunotherapy) treated with
      carboxyamidotriazole. II. Evaluate the progression free survival rate and response rate in
      these patients on this regimen. III. Evaluate the toxic effect of this regimen on these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral carboxyamidotriazole daily. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease may
      discontinue therapy after 6 courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and every 12 months thereafter until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.
