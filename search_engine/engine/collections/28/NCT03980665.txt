      type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the persistence of HIV-1 viral reservoir make it extremely
      difficult to achieving cure of AIDS. The shock and kill strategy has been extensively
      practiced. The latency reversing agents (LRAs) could reactivate latent HIV-1 and then the
      reactivated virus could be eradicated. However, no appropriate activator has been found nor
      manufactured. Our previous work found that the arsenic trioxide, clinically approved for
      treating acute promyelocytic leukemia,could efficiently reactivate latent provirus in CD4+T
      cells from HIV-1 patients and Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques, without
      significant systemic T cell activation and inflammatory responses. In this study, we are
      going to study the safety of and efficacy of arsenic trioxide combined with cART in 20 HIV-1
      infected patients, by observing adverse events,HIV-1 reservoir, HIV-1 load, and some immune
      index.
