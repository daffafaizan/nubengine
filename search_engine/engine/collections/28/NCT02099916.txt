      of poor response was based on the presence of at least one of the following criteria: Age >
      40 years old, day 2 FSH >9.5 mIU/ml, AMH < 2ng/ml ,at least one previous COH with less than 3
      oocytes retrieved, at least one cancelled attempt due to poor response, estradiol less than
      500 pg/ml on the day of HCG. All patients will be counseled regarding their prognosis and
      other treatment options including oocyte donation as well as adoption were also presented and
      discussed in detail. All patients will be aware that the use of DHEA is experimental and
      informed consent was obtained for those agreeing to use the medication. Women in the DHEA
      group will receive 25 mg of DHEA three times a day for at least 12 weeks. During this period,
      women will be subjected to monthly measurements of early follicular phase FSH and estradiol.
      Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) will be measured prior to the initiation of treatment and at the
      end of the observation period. Patients will be stimulated with a short GnRH-antagonist
      protocol. Briefly, all women will have measurements of serum FSH and estradiol and a pelvic
      sonogram on the second day of their cycle. Providing that serum FSH is < 17 mIU/ml and
      estradiol is < 70 pg/ml on day 2 , ovarian stimulation will be initiated with 450 IU of
      gonadotropins either in the form of a combination of highly purified urinary FSH and LH or
      with a combination of Rec FSH and Rec LH. All patients will be re-evaluated on day 5 of the
      stimulation, and dosage adjustments will be made and the antagonists (Cetrorelix or ganirelix
      0.25 mg/day) will be initiated. When at least 2 follicles reach an average diameter of 17 mm,
      final oocyte maturation will be triggered with 10,000IU of hCG ( Pregnyl, Organon, Greece
      Inc.). Oocyte retrieval will be performed 34 to 36 hours later. All patients will undergo
      ICSI. Patients with successful fertilization will have embryo transfer under sonographic
      guidance on day 3 after retrieval.
