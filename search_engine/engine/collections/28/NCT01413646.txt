      significantly over the past 50 years. More than 66% of adults in the US are now overweight or
      obese and at least 17% of children in the population at large are now considered
      overweight.Obesity may be a factor predisposing patients to a myriad of comorbidities that
      increase the associated mortality rate.Several large prospective trials have documented that
      obesity is an independent risk factor for mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Considering the major metabolic and biochemical changes that occur in obesity, such as
      atherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, endothelial dysfunction,
      and chronic inflammatory and prothrombotic states, obesity plays a role in the pathogenesis
      of systemic atherosclerosis and its clinical complications.

      Walnuts are rich in alpha-linolenic acid, an essential omega-3 fatty acid, L-arginine and
      antioxidants. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants have anti-oxidative effects and
      are thought to help preserve the endothelium's capacity to generate nitric oxide (NO), which
      acts to promote vasodilation, stabilize platelets, and promote the anti-inflammatory
      abilities of the endothelium. Evidence of this anticipated effect would have implications for
      strategies to prevent or retard type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.
      Endothelial function testing using high frequency ultrasound imaging of the brachial artery
      to assess endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) offers a non-invasive,
      uniquely valuable means of assessing aggregated influences on cardiac risk by gauging a
      physiologic response of the vascular endothelium. Proposed, therefore, is a randomized,
      controlled, cross-over clinical trial, to assess the effects of walnuts on endothelial
      function in overweight adults with elevated waist circumference and at least one risk factor
      of metabolic syndrome.
