      organs available from deceased donors cannot meet demands. Beginning in the early 1990s,
      organs from living donors became a widely-available option, increasing the number of
      available organs for transplant. However, because organ donation has the potential to
      adversely affect a living donor's health, long-term studies to determine the effect of
      donation on these donors are needed. The purpose of this study is to determine the mortality,
      the early postoperative morbidity, and the occurrence of end stage lung disease for
      participants who underwent donor lobectomy between 1993 and 2006. Participants in this study
      will have had donor lobectomy at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles or the
      Washington University Medical Center and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis.

      There will be no study visits for retrospective cohort study. Investigators will collect data
      from existing medical records and databases.
