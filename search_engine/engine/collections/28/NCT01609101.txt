      laryngoscopy using the Macintosh laryngoscope. There are many different videolaryngoscopes
      available, and the blade differs largely between videolaryngoscopes. Different size and
      angles of blades may have an impact on the space available for insertion of the endotracheal
      tube. The space between the blade and the palatopharyngeal wall may be reduced significantly,
      so that there is less room in the mouth to insert an endotracheal tube. Positioning and
      manoeuvring of the endotracheal tube may consequently be more difficult and may traumatize
      the pharynx as was described in a few case reports, especially when an endotracheal tube with
      a rigid stylet inserted was used.
