      an approach that does not address the oral hygiene and dietary behaviors that cause the
      disease. Professionals agree that behavioral strategies to prevent tooth decay are needed,
      but they have not been well studied in Hispanic children in the United States that have
      disproportionately high rates of this disease. Use of fluoridated toothpaste twice a day and
      consumption of a healthy diet can both prevent tooth decay and stop it from progressing.
