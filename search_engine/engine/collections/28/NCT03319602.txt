      design. Enrolled participants had severe hypoxia being treated at Intensive Care Unit
      associated with a hospital in Hornu (Epicura).

      The study consisted of two intervention periods of 2 weeks separated by a washout period of
      20 minutes. (Figure 1) The objective of the study is to determine whether adjunctive mask of
      our design (Double Trunk Mask - DTM) has an effect on increasing arterial pressure in Oxygen
      (PaO2) diagnosed with severe hypoxia.

      The protocol and informed consent documents were reviewed and approved by a recognized ethics
      review board at the study facility. The study was performed in accordance with the
      Declaration of Helsinki.

      Statistical Analysis

      All participants who received this intervention and completed two phases of study were
      included in the efficacy analysis.

      A sample size of 15 participants was needed to provide 90% power to detect a 10 mm Hg
      difference in PaO2. ANOVA for repeated measures followed by a post hoc test were used to
      compare the difference between participants receiving (CHFONP + DTM) and CHFONP alone.

      The test was performed with a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided). Statistical analyses
      were carried out using SigmaPlot software version 11.0 (Systat Software Inc. UK).

      Adverse Event Assessment

      Safety was assessed by the number of participants with adverse events (AEs). AEs were
      collected by systematic assessment using terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
      Activities (MedDRA), version 11.1 in participants who received one or more doses of
      intervention. Adverse events during washout were not collected.
