      hospitals. Each site was assigned to one of 3 staggered waves of implementation and data
      collection. The Patient and Family Centered I-PASS intervention included a health
      literacy-informed, structured communication framework for family-centered rounds; written
      rounds summaries for families; a training and learning program; and strategies to support
      teamwork and implementation. We measured errors and adverse events (AEs) via an established
      systematic surveillance methodology, family experience via pre-discharge surveys, and
      communication processes via direct observations.
