    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      disease type; each stratum is randomized separately.

      The first group of patients receives a true plasma exchange using continuous-flow
      centrifugation with serum albumin and crystalloid replacement every 2 days for a total of 7
      exchanges.

      The second group receives a sham plasma exchange with no centrifugation every 2 days for a
      total of 7 exchanges.

      Patients cross to the alternate therapy if there is less than a moderate improvement by day
      14. The treatment decision is based on a blinded neurologic assessment.

      Concurrent corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, and high-dose barbiturates are not
      allowed.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 6 months after the last exchange.
