      astigmatism and vision over time. With FDA approval of corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL),
      we now have the ability to halt the progression of keratoconus and prevent further vision
      loss in these patients. Although CXL has now become standard of care, the immediate
      post-operative period can be quite painful despite use of anti-inflammatory medications/eye
      drops. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an intracanalicular
      dexamethasone insert in reduction of post-CXL pain as compared to routine steroid eye drop
      therapy.

      To date, no studies have been performed evaluating the success of an intracanalicular
      dexamethasone insert for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain in corneal
      cross-linking patients. Oftentimes, patients experience a great deal of discomfort post-CXL,
      which may also make it difficult to apply eye drops in the correct fashion. Use of a
      dexamethasone insert alleviates the need for postoperative steroid eye drops and may provide
      increased pain relief post-CXL as compared to topical therapy. This will be a head-to-head
      study where steroid therapy (topical or insert) will begin in a standard fashion on the date
      of CXL. This will allow for accurate comparison of a 4-week taper of topical steroids, versus
      a dexamethasone insert designed to release steroid for 30 days.
