    
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of AZD2014 that can be tolerated
      without causing very severe side effects when receiving temozolomide and see what good and/or
      bad effects AZD2014 can have on the tumour. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the
      one that we know can be given safely to the participants when used on its own. Participants
      are given AZD2014 together with temozolomide and will be watched very closely to see what
      side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects
      are not severe, then new participants will be given a higher dose of AZD2014. Participants
      joining this study later on will get higher doses of AZD2014 than participants who join
      earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side
      effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.
