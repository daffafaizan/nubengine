      Phase 1: All participants will be required to independently interpret a set of 12 CXRs, as
      provided by the consensus panel. The possible radiographic interpretations include
      consistent, inconsistent, or equivocal for the diagnosis of ARDS.

      Phase 2: Training materials adapted according to the recently published Berlin definition of
      ARDS, with its expanded rationale and interpretation of all 12 CXRs, will be sent to all
      participants.

      Phase 3: The same set of 12 CXRs, in different order, will be sent to all participants for
      interpretation for the second time.
