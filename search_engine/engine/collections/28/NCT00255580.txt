      most common neurological complications of HIV infection. Nucleoside analogues such as ddI and
      d4T, key components of modern, potent, combination antiretroviral therapies (ART), are also
      neurotoxic and contribute to the frequent occurence of painful neuropathy. By using treatment
      with available non-narcotic analgesic and adjunctive pain medications, approximately half of
      patients with painful HIV neuropathy obtain sufficient pain control.

      On the first day each study week (active or placebo), participants will follow a specific
      titration procedure to achieve the optimal dose. This optimal dose will then be continued for
      the duration of the treatment week. Participants will undergo a 2-week washout period, after
      which they crossover to the other arm (active or placebo) and will again repeat the dose
      titration and dose maintenance procedures.

      Comparison: Active cannabis doses ranging from 2-8% THC will be compared to placebo for the
      reduction of neuropathic pain.
