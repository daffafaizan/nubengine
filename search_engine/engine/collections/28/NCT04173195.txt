      of chemotherapy treatments are administered by nurses in a outpatient clinic context.
      Although outpatient oncology care are generally associated with a significant improvement in
      the quality of life in cancer patients, one-third of patients believe that health
      professionals (including nurses) are not doing everything in their power to comfort or
      relieve discomfort during chemotherapy treatments. Among the known elements for enhancing the
      well-being of oncology outpatients, comfort talk (CT) has been found to be very effective.
      Indeed, CT is a simple and direct form of conversation that is inspired by the principles of
      clinical hypnosis. While the soothing mechanisms of CT are poorly understood, involvement of
      cortical regions involved in the modulation of emotions and pain is suggested in several
      neuroimaging studies.This pilot trial serves as a proof of concept and aims to explore
      whether CT can be used by nurses to optimize the perception of emotional support and physical
      comfort during outpatient chemotherapy treatments. To do this, patients enrolled in a
      chemotherapy treatment cycle will be recruited during a visit to the oncology outpatient
      clinic. Half of the patients will be assigned to enhanced routine care with an CT
      intervention and the other half will receive routine care without CT. If there is an overlap
      between CT mechanisms and those involved in the endogenous control of emotions and pain, a
      significant interaction of these elements on the well-being of patients during chemotherapy
      treatments is expected. The results of this pilot trials will be used to justify and prepare
      for a larger study to evaluate the effects of CT on cancer symptom management and treatment
      at the outpatient clinic.
