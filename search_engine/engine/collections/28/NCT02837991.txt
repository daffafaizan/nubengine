      a high percentage of kidney cells that are clear or papillary and ovarian cancer cells that
      are clear cell.

      The study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma and ovarian
      clear cell carcinoma to determine the safety and efficacy of CDX-014.

      This study will include a Dose-Escalation Phase followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.
