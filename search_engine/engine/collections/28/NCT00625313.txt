    
      A prospective, single-phase, non-randomized, open-label study to include patients with
      operable cataract of the human crystalline lens who have a potential post-operative best
      corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better and no pre-existing progressive sight-threatening
      ocular disorders. Patients who are eligible per inclusion / exclusion criteria will undergo

      intervals to assess safety and effectiveness, for up to 36 months.
