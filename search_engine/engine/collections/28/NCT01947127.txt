      emergency department (ED) patients with sepsis. Regarding its predictive role in the clinical
      deterioration in normotensive sepsis patients, a recent prospective observational study of
      the patients with moderately-high serum lactate (2.0-3.9 mmol/L) showed that one-forth of the
      patients eventually developed progressive organ dysfunctions or required vasopressor or
      mechanical ventilator. Unfortunately, low serum lactate (< 2.5 mmol/L) was still found up to
      50% of overt septic shock patients, even in vasopressor-dependent cases. For the prognostic
      role on mortality, numbers of articles showed that blood lactate can also predict death in
      sepsis patients, especially in those who are elderly and critically-ill. However, no previous
      study was done in younger patients since lactate kinetics in the body may differ among the
      age groups. The primary aim of our study is to investigate the role of initial venous lactate
      levels in predicting the chance of severity progression to overt septic shock especially in
      non-elderly patients who suspected to have acute infections and without hemodynamic shock in
      ED. The secondary outcomes are to evaluate its prognostic role on hospital length of stay and
      30-day mortality of this target population.
