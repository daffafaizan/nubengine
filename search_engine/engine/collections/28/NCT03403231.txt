      strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Yet, little attention has been devoted
      to how the investigators can better leverage the processes through which patients receive
      information about prevention of T2DM to better engage them in such prevention. Further,
      despite efforts to disseminate structured programs, many patients at high risk for developing
      T2DM may still be unable or unwilling to access them. In these cases, increasing patient
      engagement in individually directed lifestyle change or pharmacotherapy is critical.
      Strategies developed in the fields of behavioral economics and health psychology hold
      significant promise for improving Veteran engagement in each of these approaches. To date,
      however, these strategies have rarely been translated into real-world settings where they
      could benefit Veterans. This novel work will address this critical gap and could transform
      communication with Veterans about prevention in ways that will improve their health outcomes.

      The following 5 strategies will be implemented in the weekly messages that study participants
      will receive: (1) tailoring to aspirations in life; (2) implementation intentions; (3)
      preference checklists; (4) urgency framing; (5) social norms. The investigators will
      implement these strategies alone and in combination in a 16-arm factorial design experiment.
