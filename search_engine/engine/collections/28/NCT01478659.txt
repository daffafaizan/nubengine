           previous day

      Randomization:

        -  Measure weight, waist circumference, and body composition. We will use the BodPod to
           measure your body composition. The BodPod uses air displacement to measure body volume

           You will be asked to use these foods to replace foods you are currently eating

        -  Consume one study food per day for the first week and then 2 foods per day for weeks 2
           through 8.

        -  Complete the 10-question online daily survey

        -  Complete 7 days of 24-hour dietary recalls using the ASA24 during weeks 4, 6, and 8

      Final:

        -  Return any uneaten study foods.
