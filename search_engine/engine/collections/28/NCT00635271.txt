      mortality. Patients at increased risk for asthma decompensations include those with severe
      asthma that is refractory to therapy, as well as patients with poorly controlled disease due
      to inadequate treatment. The aim of this exploratory specimen procurement protocol is to
      develop a non-invasive method for the detection of asthma-specific biomarkers in exhaled
      breath condensates (EBC) utilizing a novel collection device that was engineered at the Johns
      Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Biomarkers in EBC will be identified by mass
      spectroscopy. We propose that the identification of biomarkers in EBC that correlate with
      airway inflammation and disease activity may be used to guide therapy and prevent
      exacerbations in asthmatic patients.
