      I. To establish the recommended dose level for the phase II trial. (Phase I) II. To examine
      the safety profile of this combination in patients with metastatic breast cancer. (Phase I)
      III. To assess the anti-tumor activity (in terms of overall response rate) and toxicity
      profile of IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) in combination with temsirolimus in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival distributions (as
      well as the 6-month PFS rate).

      II. To evaluate the in vivo mechanisms of action of temsirolimus in combination with IMC-A12
      and to examine potential biomarker predictors of treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of cixutumumab followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cixutumumab IV over 60
      minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (cixutumumab is given on days 8, 15, and 22 of course 1
      only). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 (phase
      I) or 5 (phase II) years.
