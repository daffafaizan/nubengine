    
      15 study participants will include those using a Stryker STAR prosthesis and a Wright Medical
      INBONE 2 prosthesis and a group of matched control subjects.

      CT scans of lower limb anatomy (ankle-foot complex) will be obtained for all subjects to be
      converted into 3D bone surface models for use in the joint motion tracking software.

      Each participant will participate in one day of data collection with an X-Ray Motion Analysis
      (XMA) system. High-speed biplanar XMA system will capture video images of the skeletal
      motions within the foot-ankle complex during normal movement. Subjects will walk and perform
      controlled movements in the capture volume within the XMA system.

      Following data collection, the 3D bone surface models will be mapped to the sagittal (side
      view), coronal (front view), and axial (top view) plane skeletal motions demonstrated in the
      collected x-ray videos. Motion tracking data will then be used to accurately animate the 3D
      bone models to demonstrate the active range of ankle-foot joint motions during voluntary
      movement and gait.

      Resulting range of motion measurements in dorsiflexion/plantarflexion, internal/external
      rotation, and inversion/eversion will be used to determine the extent to which normal motion
      in the ankle-foot complex has been restored in ankle prosthesis users.
