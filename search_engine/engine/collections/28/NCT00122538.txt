      + ddI + EFV have never been studied.

      This regimen may lead to a better treatment of the HIV-1 infected children in developing
      countries, as well as in Europe. Because of its simplicity it would facilitate observance
      that is one of the essential parameters of efficacy of treatments.

      The main objectives are those of a phase II clinical trial:

        -  Assess the virological and immunological efficacy of a once daily HAART regimen
           comprising lamivudine (3TC) + didanosine (ddI) + efavirenz (EFV) [pediatric reference];

        -  Analyse the pharmacological characteristics of this combination in children;

        -  Assess the tolerance;

        -  Study the appearance of resistance;

        -  Evaluate the observance to treatment.

           50 HIV-1 infected children aged 30 months to 15 years whose clinical and immunological
           state (stage B or C) requires antiretroviral treatment, will be included in the study.
           They should be naive of any ARV treatment (except the treatment received in the
           framework of PMTCT (Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission).

      Data Collection and Development of the Study:

        -  Monthly clinical examination;

        -  RNA HIV-1 and CD4 counts;

        -  Pharmacological dosages;

        -  Haematology and biochemistry surveillance;

        -  Genotypic resistance at inclusion; and, in case of unsuccess or failure,

        -  Assessment of observance according to alternate methods.

      Laboratory examinations will be carried out at Centre Muraz except for genotyping and for
      pharmacological tests sent to Montpellier Teaching Hospital (France).
