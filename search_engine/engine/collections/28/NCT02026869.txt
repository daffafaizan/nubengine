      drugs have been used to help improve follicular dynamics in PCOS patients. Metformin, an
      insulin sensitizer long known for its antidiabetic properties, has been used in PCOS
      patients. One of the major factors affecting compliance are the gastrointestinal side effects
      associated with oral administration of metformin. Knowing that the vagina is a good
      absorptive surface for many drugs, it is postulated that vaginal administration of metformin
      could be a good alternative to the oral route, if it proves effective. Both pharmacokinetic
      and clinical evidences of efficacy are traced for the vaginal route of administration.
