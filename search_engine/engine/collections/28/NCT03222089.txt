      the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer has shown a significant increase in
      response rate and overall survival compared to FOLFIRI and FOLFOX. The combination of GOLF
      chemotherapy with GM-CSF and IL-2（GOLFIG regimen） has shown more active than the standard
      FOLFOX chemotherapy in first-line mCRC patients，through the chemoimmunomodulatory effects. SO
      the FOLFOXIGIL chemoimmunotherapy regimen was designed with the same principle to evaluate
      the antitumor frontline efficacy in comparison with the FOLFOXIRI regimen as first-line
      treatment of mCRC patients. This is a multicenter, randomized controlled, double-blind, phase
      II trial.
