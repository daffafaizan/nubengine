      analyses of a large cohort of middle-aged to older Finnish men have established that frequent
      sauna bathing is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality, of developing
      dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and of developing hypertension. Given the observational
      nature of these relationships, it remains unknown if the beneficial effects of sauna bathing
      can be directly attributed to heat exposure.

      The objective of this study is to test the primary hypothesis that 8 weeks of sauna bathing
      improves flow-mediated dilation, a measure of blood vessel health, in middle-aged to older
      adults (50-70 yrs) with stable coronary artery disease.
