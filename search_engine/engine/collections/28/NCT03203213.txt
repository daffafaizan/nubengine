      for deaths. These substances, also called "festive drugs", circulate among other places in
      festive gatherings (night clubs, concerts, free music, feria, etc.).

      There is also a significant increase in the number of new psychoactive substances (NSPs)
      whose toxicity is unknown: by 2014, 101 new substances were detected for the first time in
      Europe. These molecules, because of this regular and rapid emergence, are not included in the
      narcotics list, in the great majority of cases.

      Poison control centers, as well as addictovigilance centers, are regularly called upon for
      serious poisoning resulting in hospitalization, for which analytical evidence is most often
      missing or difficult to obtain. The lack of documentation, both analytical and clinical, of
      these files limits its expertise. As a result, medical knowledge, in particular clinical
      knowledge, progresses little which limits the efficiency of the management of these
      poisonings.

      A 2015 pilot study on the Dax and Mont-de-Marsan (FERIATOX) fertilization sites on 27
      patients showed that although several psychoactive substances have been identified in these
      patients (cocaine, ketamine, MDMA, cannabis, etc.) No DK was identified in this study. It is
      possible, however, that the profile of people who frequent ferias is different from that of
      music festivals, which explains the lack of identification of these substances in the
      FERIATOX study. To support this hypothesis, it seems important to renew this study on festive
      events of the type of music festival. The Garorock Festival (Marmande), held at the beginning
      of July, seems to be relevant for the study.
