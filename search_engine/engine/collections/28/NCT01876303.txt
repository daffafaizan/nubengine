      I. To determine the association between the length of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region
      1-Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion protein binding sites
      (microsatellites) and risk of Ewing's sarcoma (ES).

      II. To determine the frequency and commonality of Caucasian ancestral markers in cases of ES
      self-identified as non-Caucasian (African-American, Asian, Hispanic).

      III. To determine the association between genomic variants in ES-related genes and hernia
      development (i.e. the integrin signaling pathway) and risk of ES.

      OUTLINE:

      Genomic DNA is extracted from participants' saliva samples and analyzed for expression of
      EWS-FLI1 and other ES-target genes.
