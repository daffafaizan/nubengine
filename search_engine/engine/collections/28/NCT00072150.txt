      I. To determine the efficacy of PS-341 in patients with measurable advanced urothelial
      transitional cell carcinoma who have not responded to, or have relapsed after one prior
      conventional chemotherapy.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity of PS-341 administered in this group of patients.

      III. To estimate duration of objective response, progression-free survival and overall
      survival in this group of patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with a solitary site of disease (i.e., lung or nodal metastases) and who have a
      partial response (PR) may be considered for surgical resection. Patients with a PR with
      residual disease after salvage surgery are eligible to continue study therapy. Patients who
      achieve a complete response, either through resection or bortezomib therapy, receive 2
      additional courses of study therapy.

      Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-17
      months.
