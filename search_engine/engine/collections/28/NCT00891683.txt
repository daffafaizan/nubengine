      mg) that may potentially include both a minimally effective dose and a maximum tolerated
      dose. Doses up to 400 mg were well tolerated in single- and multiple-dose Phase 1 studies.

      Before initiation of treatment with study drug, other analgesic medications will be
      discontinued during a 7-day Washout Period, and neuropathic pain will be assessed (in the
      absence of analgesic medication) over the next 3 days (Pain Assessment Period). Pain
      intensity level during these 3 days will be recorded daily, and only those subjects who meet
      predefined pain intensity threshold criteria on all 3 days will be eligible to receive study
      drug. Because pain may increase after analgesic medications have been discontinued, the
      combined length of the Washout and Pain Assessment Periods is limited in order that subjects
      who experience increased pain during this time may begin treatment with study drug without
      undue delay. This design will allow for adequate Baseline pain assessment over 3 days while
      avoiding a more prolonged period of increasing pain in the absence of analgesic medications.
