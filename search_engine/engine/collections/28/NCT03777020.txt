    
      Veterans with PTSD attend 8 weekly sessions of either training a service dog or learning
      about how to train a dog at the Warrior Canine Connection facility in Boyds MD. They complete
      questionnaires prior to the start of the program and at the midpoint (after 4 sessions) and
      end of the program (after 8 sessions). Participants also wear a monitor to record heart rate
      variability during the 1st, 4th, and 8th sessions and provide saliva samples at these same
      times.
