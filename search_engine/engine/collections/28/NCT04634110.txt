      treated with brigatinib alone without upfront brain irradiation. Patients will have close
      monitoring with clinical follow up visits and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      surveillance, which will maximize safety and allow for early treatment if disease progression
      is observed. If brigatinib alone can demonstrate high rates of CNS disease control, these
      data could support a strategy of upfront brigatinib alone for carefully selected patients
      with brain metastases from ALK+ NSCLC.
