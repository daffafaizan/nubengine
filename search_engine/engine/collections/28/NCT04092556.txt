      cortex or sham stimulation for 30 minutes. The type of stimulation depends on random
      assignment. The participants have a 1 week of wash out period between each stimulation.

      The assessment will be done by International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS),
      GAITRITE (CIR Systems Inc., Clifton, New Jersey, USA) and PEDOSCAN (DIERS PEDO, Germany) at
      baseline and immediately after each treatment.
