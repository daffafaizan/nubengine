      treatment of various types of cancer. Everolimus seems the most attractive mTOR inhibitor
      because of the favourable pharmacokinetic profile and possibility of oral administration.
      Based on preclinical findings, mTOR inhibitors may be more efficacious when used in a
      rational combination with other cancer regiments like cytostatic drugs. Indeed, several
      multiagent combinations are being investigated in clinical trials at the moment, and the
      results are promising.

      In our study we combine everolimus, administrated twice daily at a fixed total dose of 10 mg
      continuously with capecitabine administered bid for 14 days followed by 7 days rest. In this
      study, capecitabine will be dose escalated. The first dose level of capecitabine is 500 mg/m2
      twice daily. Three patients will be enrolled per dose level, starting at dose level 1. If one
      of the 3 patients develops dose-limiting toxicity at any dose level, 3 other patients will
      start at the same dose level. If 2 or more out of these 6 patients develop DLT, no further
      dose escalations will be performed. The MTD will be considered to be the dose given at the
      previous lower level. No intrapatient dose escalation will be applied.

      Once the MTD of capecitabine is established, the phase II part of the study will start in
      which 25 patients with various malignancies will be enrolled to evaluate the efficacy and
      feasibility of the combination of everolimus and capecitabine.
