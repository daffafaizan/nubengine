    
      The subscription version of the app "Sanvello" has several self-help exercises based on
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (to identify and challenge their thinking styles) and
      Mindfulness practices (to connect them with the present moment). Participants will be asked
      to complete these exercises on a daily basis for five weeks.

      Telephone calls will be provided weekly to half of participants to provide information about
      the app, or a rationale for its use. This phone call will not serve to provide any extra
      intervention or therapy to the participants.
