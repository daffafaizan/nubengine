      affect plasma lipids positively, the physiological effects of two different daily lupin
      protein dosages will be investigated in two separate study groups (group A: 25 g protein/day;
      group B: 40 g protein/day). Both study groups undergo double-blinded and controlled study
      conditions in a cross-over design.

      In each of the two study groups 35 volunteers with hypercholesterolemia will be allocated to
      one of two randomization groups: After a 1-week run-in period (baseline), half of the 35
      participants of each study group will consume drinks with lupin protein in the respective
      amount (25 g or 40 g protein/day) over a period of eight weeks, the other half will receive
      the analogue amount of milk protein as well incorporated in a drink serving as control. After
      a wash-out period of four weeks, the protein source will be crossed within the two study
      groups for a second intervention period of eight weeks.
