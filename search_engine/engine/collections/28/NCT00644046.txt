      community to identify the CKD population. This population will randomized into two group (one
      group with standard nephrologist care and another group with standard nephrologist care plus
      multidisciplinary CKD education) to evaluate the effectiveness of CKD education on the
      progression of renal function. The primary end-point will be the doubling tine estimated GFR,
      development of end-stage renal disease and all cause mortality. The non-CKD group of
      community will also follow up for urine and blood test for renal function, to determine the
      incidence and risk factors of new-onset renal disease. The accomplishment of this study will
      retard renal progression, improve community health and establish a model in preventing the
      chronic kidney disease.
