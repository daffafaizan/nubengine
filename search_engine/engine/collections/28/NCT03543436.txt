      the community by an empirical antibiotic treatment regimen. Enterobacteriaceae are the most
      common bacteria involved in urinary tract infection. Since 2006, extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing enterobacteriaceae have spread in France, as elsewhere.
      Finding therapeutic alternatives to carbapenems in infections caused by ESBL producing
      enterobacteriaceae is imperative. Although temocillin, 6-Î±-methoxy derivative of ticarcillin
      has been suggested as a potential alternative to carbapenem therapy for ESBL related
      infections, it was not investigated in accordance with current standard. The hypothesis to
      test in this study is that temocillin is not inferior to a carbapenem as initial intravenous
      treatment of urinary tract infections caused by ESBL producing enterobacteriaceae.
