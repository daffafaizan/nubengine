      induction):

      MTX 12 mg ARA-C 40 mg Dexamethasone 4 mg

      Maintenance during the first year will start after full recovery after induction and after
      complete reassessment of the disease (including mielograma and Bcr-Abl/Abl or Bcr-Abl/Gus
      ratio in peripheral blood) and will last until one year from the time of complete remission.
