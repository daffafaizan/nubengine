    
      ALVAC-HIV vCP205 is a second generation candidate vaccine that can be used to induce a
      humoral and cellular response against several antigens. This recombinant construct is based
      on the canarypox vector termed ALVAC and expresses gp120 of the HIV MN strain, plus the
      transmembrane portion of the LAI strain as well as gag and protease.

      Volunteers are randomized to receive doses of ALVAC-HIV vCP205 or ALVAC-HIV vCP65 control or
      both according to varying schedules over 12 months (was 6 months, amended 11/17/95) with a 12
      month follow up. [AS PER AMENDMENT 5/29/98: One additional follow-up visit is required at
      30-36 months.]
