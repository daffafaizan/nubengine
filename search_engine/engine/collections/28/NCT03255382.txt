      participants who were randomized. The safety analysis was performed in the safety set which
      included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. No participants were
      excluded from the efficacy analysis. Three participants in the FUMADERMÂ® group discontinued
      after randomization prior to receiving any study drug and were thus not included in the
      safety set.
