      on localized bone pain in patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. II.
      Compare the overall survival and quality of life of these patients after these treatments.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified according to quality of pain (mild vs moderate) and previous
      corticosteroids or one regimen of non-anthracycline-containing cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g.,
      estramustine) vs none. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I consists of oral
      prednisone twice a day and intravenous mitoxantrone followed by intravenous clodronate
      administered over 3 hours every 3 weeks. Arm II consists of oral prednisone twice a day and
      intravenous mitoxantrone followed by intravenous placebo administered over 3 hours every 3
      weeks. Doses are adjusted for myelosuppression. Treatment continues until disease progression
      (although patients initially on placebo can continue on open-label clodronate) or until the
      maximum cumulative dose of mitoxantrone is reached. Patients with a palliative response may
      continue on prednisone and the study drug (clodronate or placebo) until disease progression.
      Quality of life is assessed before and every 3 weeks during study treatment. A daily pain
      diary is also maintained. All patients are followed at 2 weeks and then every 3 months until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 204 patients.
