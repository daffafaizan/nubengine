      Faculty of Medicine on patients admitted to The Poison Control Unit (Emergency Hospitals,
      Tanta and Mansoura Universities) with acute phosphide poisoning in the period from January
      2016 to January 2018. A written informed consent was taken from each patient or his/her
      guardians (if the patient was unable to participate in the consent process). Confidentiality
      of the data was maintained by making code numbers for each patient. The investigators planned
      to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of LC as an adjuvant
      in treatment of patients with acute phosphide poisoning. Fifty patients was randomized to LC
      or a non LC in a 1:1 ratio (25 patients in each group). LC was given IV, as a dose of 1 g/8
      hours. Patients was monitored and a detailed documentation of any adverse effect due to LC
      therapy was recorded.

      This intervention represented an added treatment to the existing standard of care. All
      patients will continue to receive standard treatment, which was determined by the attending
      physician who maintained clinical responsibility for all patients. It consisted of patient
      resuscitation, gastric decontamination (with sodium bicarbonate, and activated charcoal [1
      g/Kg, orally] in the first 6 hours after onset of poisoning), adequate hydration and
      supportive treatment. All the patients was followed up until discharge or death. All patients
      was subjected to:

      I. History. II. Clinical examination. III. Laboratory investigations: At admission and
      repeated before discharge.
