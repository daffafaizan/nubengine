        1. To collect, catalog and store frozen samples of lung carcinoma and when possible,
           portions of involved lymph nodes, as well as adjacent grossly uninvolved lung tissue
           obtained from surgical specimens of patients undergoing surgical resection for
           previously untreated lung cancer as a source of quality DNA, messenger ribonucleic acid
           (mRNA) and protein for molecular analysis.

        2. To collect, catalog and store frozen samples of blood pre- and post-resection from the
           same patients to provide a source of reference DNA to assess somatic mutations
           associated with tumor or preneoplastic "normal" lung, and to allow assessment of levels
           of circulating markers.

        3. To associate these specimens with historical, clinical, pathological, and outcome
           information.

      Grossly viable tumor and grossly normal lung tissue are identified and removed from patient
      surgical specimens and cryopreserved until shipment to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
      (CALGB) Lung Cancer Tissue Bank for future use in research. Blood specimens are also
      collected prior to surgery and at 4-12 weeks post-surgery (before the start of adjuvant
      therapy) and shipped immediately to the Tissue Bank.
