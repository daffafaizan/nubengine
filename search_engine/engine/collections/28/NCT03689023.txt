      systematic institutional strategy incorporating targeted strategic patient education about
      cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity and a healthy diet lifestyle starting early in
      the primary rehabilitation process with 6 months of follow up compared to a historic control
      group. Test - retest reliability of four different VO2 peak tests and a multi sensor
      accelerometer respectively will be assessed as well.
