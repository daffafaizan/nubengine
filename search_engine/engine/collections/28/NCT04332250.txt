    
      -  Study groups: Patients will be divided into 2 groups

             1. Group I: Complete revascularization was achieved by PPCI.

             2. Group II: Complete revascularization was not achieved by PPCI.

        -  In hospital outcomes: All the patients will be reviewed for during hospital admission to
           record major acute cardiac events (MACE). Only the most serious event of major adverse
           cardiac events will be used to calculate the cumulative major adverse cardiac events per
           patient according to the following sequence: (death > heart failure > recurrent
           non-fatal MI > serious secondary arrhythmia necessitating DC shock> recurrent or
           refractory angina. MACE will be reported according to the standard definitions.(Tsai IT,
           et al.,2017)

        -  Long-term follow-up: The patients will be followed by telephone interviews for all-cause
           mortality, re-hospitalization by ACS, re-hospitalization by heart failure, planned and
           unplanned PCI or CABG. Long-term MACE will include: all-cause mortality,
           re-hospitalization by ACS, re-hospitalization by heart failure, unplanned
           revascularization. Patients who undergo planned revascularization later on after
           discharge will be followed till the date of revascularization for actual events and will
           be censored in Kaplan Meier Survival analysis. These patients will be included in a
           third group of staged late complete revascularization to be followed for the long-term
           MACE events starting from the planned revascularization procedure.
