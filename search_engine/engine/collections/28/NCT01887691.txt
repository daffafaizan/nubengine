      sleep contributes to impaired glucose and insulin homeostasis. The sleep spectrogram, an
      EEG-independent measure of sleep effectiveness, maps coupled oscillations of heart rate
      variability and ECG-derived respiration. In a sample of non-diabetic subjects with and
      without sleep apnea, we previously explored the association between ECG-spectrogram derived
      biomarkers and glucose metabolism and found that the marker of effective sleep, High
      Frequency Coupling (HFC), is associated with reduced diabetes risk (increased Disposition
      Index). HFC is also enhanced by sedative medications (unpublished data). In this study we
      will 1.) explore the relationship between sleep effectiveness and insulin sensitivity across
      the sleep period, by frequently sampling glucose and insulin during nocturnal polysomnography
      in healthy and prediabetic subjects; and 2.) evaluate the impact of pharmacologic enhancement
      of effective sleep with nightly eszopiclone (1 week, home environment) on glycemic profiles
      (continuous glucose monitoring, 72 hrs) in prediabetics and diabetics compared to
      pretreatment baseline. We expect that desirable glycemic profiles will correlate with the
      spectrographic marker of effective sleep while undesirable glucose profiles will correlate
      with the marker of ineffective sleep. Using pharmacologic enhancement of effective sleep, we
      expect to demonstrate improvement in glycemic profiles in prediabetic and diabetic subjects
      compared to pre-treatment baseline.
