      prevalence of about two percent of the population. The mode of inheritance is poorly
      understood but is likely complex, involving multiple loci of small to major effect. Since
      1995, the NIMH-IRP has been active in a multi-center family study of OCD, led by Dr. Gerald
      Nestadt of Johns Hopkins University, which was approved via a competitive NIMH extramural
      application (MH 502140). An expanded consortium of sites (including new sites at Brown and
      Harvard Universities) anticipates adding 300 new affected sib-pair families over the next
      three years. This sample will be used for linkage and association analyses. Data will be
      shared within this consortium of investigators studying OCD, and will eventually be combined
      with data obtained from a second consortium.
