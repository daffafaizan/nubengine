      function (DF) score over 32 or accompanying hepatic encephalopathy. These patients have shown
      poor prognosis of 28 day mortality as 30 to 50% without treatment. Steroid (prednisolone
      40mg/day for 28 days) is the treatment of choice in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.
      Alcoholic hepatitis with modified DF score greater than or equal to 32 or model for end-stage
      liver disease (MELD) score over 21 or with hepatic encephalopathy are indications. However,
      null- or partial responder of steroid treatment is recommended to consider liver
      transplantation. The yearly demand for liver transplants far exceeds the supply of available
      organs and alcoholic liver disease has been a controversial indication for transplantation.
      Even in the responders of steroid treatment, the mortality is still 20% (from 40% without
      treatment to 20% with steroid treatment). There is a need for development of new treatment
      for this catastrophic disease. Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) has been
      reported to have effect of proliferation of hepatic progenitors in alcoholic steatohepatitis.
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of G-CSF in patients with severe
      alcoholic hepatitis with null or partial response to steroid.
