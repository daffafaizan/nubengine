      departments in our institution. All patients who will agree to participate in the study and
      meet the inclusion criteria would undergo three major steps"

        1. Pre decannulation evaluation by otolaryngologist and intensive care specialist following
           inclusion criteria.

        2. Decannulation:

           In the immediate decannulation group - the tracheostomy tube is removed and the patient
           would be monitored overnight in an intermediate monitored unit. On the next day a
           clinical evaluation would be held, and the patient would be discharge or transferred to
           his department according to the clinical course of the patient.

           In the gradual decannulation group:

           The tracheostomy tube will be reduced in 2 sizes compared with the initial inner
           diameter of the tube. The patients will remain with the reduced tube for 48 hours, and
           the tube will be removed if the patients would meet pre-decannulation evaluation.

        3. Follow up:

      All patients would be followed in 7, 30, 90 days following decannulation in the outpatient
      clinic or in their departments if still hospitalized. In these visit questionnaires regarding
      possible respiratory complications will be documented.
