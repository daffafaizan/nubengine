      tests. The first test will determine how much insulin can their body produce in response to
      an intravenous glucose infusion over a period of several hours. The second test will
      determine how effective is the action of the sugar-processing hormone, insulin, in their body
      when it is infused intravenously together with glucose over a period of several hours.
