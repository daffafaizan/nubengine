      the intestines. It is a routine test and considered very safe. However, patients can
      experience discomfort from air insufflation in the stomach and unpleasantness due to gagging
      during the procedure. Conscious sedation with medications like sedatives and narcotics are
      used to improve patient satisfaction and enhance physician ability to perform an optimal
      examination. The choice of drugs used for sedation in upper endoscopy varies by endoscopist
      and the goal is always to use the lowest dose possible to achieve the best examination.
      Combination therapy (with a sedative & narcotic) may increase the adverse effect profile
      compared to a sedative alone and not improve the overall experience of the physician or
      patient. The goal of our study is to assess in randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      study, the effect of using a narcotic (fentanyl) and sedative (midazolam) for sedation
      compared to a sedative (midazolam) alone.
