      options for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. There have been controversial reports about
      possible ototoxicity of artemether / lumefantrine (CoartemÂ®) from retrospective studies. In
      this investigation treatment of uncomplicated malaria with artemether / lumefantrine,
      quinine, where side-effects on hearing are known, or atovaquone / proguanil, where no such
      effects have been reported, are compared. Auditoy function is examined (Auditory Brainstem
      Response, Pure-tone Audiometry, Otoacustic Emissions) before treatment, after 7, 28, and, for
      determination of irreversibility, after 90 days.
