      medoxomil is being tested to treat Chinese people who have essential hypertension. This study
      will look at change in blood pressure after 8 weeks of treatment in people who take
      azilsartan medoxomil compared to people who take valsartan.

      The study enrolled 612 patients. Prior to the start of study treatment, participants who have
      not received antihypertensive treatment within 28 days participated in a 2-week -run in
      period. Upon completion of the run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which remain undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg

        -  azilsartan medoxomil 80 mg

        -  Valsartan 160 mg

      All participants were asked to take study medication at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-centre trial was conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this study
      is up to 14 weeks. Participants made 9 visits to the clinic and contacted by telephone 14
      days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
