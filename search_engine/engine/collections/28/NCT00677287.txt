      cancer using genome-wide expression profile analysis by cDNA microarray technique. VEGF
      receptor 1 and 2 are essential targets to tumor angiogenesis, and we identified that peptides
      derived from these receptors significantly induce the effective tumor specific CTL response
      in vitro and vivo. According to these findings, in this trial, we evaluate the safety,
      immunological and clinical response of those peptides. Patients will be vaccinated twice a
      week for 8 weeks. On each vaccination day, RNF43 peptide (1mg), TOMM34 peptide (1mg), VEGFR1
      peptide (1mg) and VEGFR2 peptide (1mg) mixed with Montanide ISA 51 will be administered by
      subcutaneous injection. The patients will also receive oral chemotherapy
      (Tegafur/Uracil/Folinate) simultaneously. Repeated cycles of the vaccine and the chemotherapy
      will be administered until patients develop progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity,
      whichever occurs first. In the phase I study, we evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      these peptide vaccine. In the following phase II study, we evaluate the immunological and
      clinical response of this vaccine therapy.
