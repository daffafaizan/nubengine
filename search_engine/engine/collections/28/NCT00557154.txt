      of children < 7 years of age, who required i.v. access and who had failed the first i.v.
      attempt. We randomized patients to either continued standard i.v. attempts or
      ultrasound-assisted attempts. Clinicians involved in the study received one hour of training
      in ultrasound localization of peripheral veins. In the ultrasound group, vein localization
      was performed by an ED physician who marked the skin overlying the target vessel. Intravenous
      cannulation attempts were then immediately performed by a pediatric ED nurse who relied on
      the skin mark for vessel location. We allowed for technique cross-over after two failed i.v.
      attempts. We recorded success rate and location of access attempts.
