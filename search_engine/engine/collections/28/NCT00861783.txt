    
      This is an open-label, 2-arm, dose-escalation combination-therapy study in which patients
      with hepatoma and other advanced malignancies will be assigned by the Investigator to dosing
      with either irinotecan plus ON 01910.Na (Group A), or oxaliplatin plus ON 01910.Na (Group B).
      Note: As of Amendment 2 of this protocol, treatment in the irinotecan arm of the study (Group
      A) is closed to enrollment and patients will be enrolled only in Group B, the oxaliplatin
      treatment arm. Patients will be enrolled in 1 of 4 Cohorts (4 sequential Cohorts in Group B)
      of 3 patients each. Up to 6 additional patients will be tested at the MTD.
