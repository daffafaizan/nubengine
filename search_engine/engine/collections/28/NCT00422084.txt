      anti-malarials in terms of efficacy and lower propensity to resistance. Pyronaridine
      artesunate is a new ACT in development to treat acute uncomplicated malaria. Pyronaridine and
      artesunate are antimalarial agents with a history of clinical use both separately and in
      combination with other drugs. Each drug has powerful anti-schizonticidal actions. The aim of
      a fixed dose combination of pyronaridine and artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated
      acute malaria is to provide rapid reduction in parasitemia with a once-daily three-day
      regimen, thereby improving compliance and reducing the risk of recrudescence through the
      slower elimination of pyronaridine.
