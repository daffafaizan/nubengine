    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, single-dose, active and placebo controlled, 3-period crossover
      study of the effect of SEP-363856 150 mg on electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals in subjects
      with schizophrenia. SEP-363856 and matching placebo will be utilized in a double-blind
      fashion. Moxifloxacin will be utilized as an active control in an open-label fashion.

      The primary analysis will be based on concentration-QTc modeling of the relationship between
      plasma concentrations of SEP-363856 or its metabolite SEP-363854 and change-from baseline
      QTc.
