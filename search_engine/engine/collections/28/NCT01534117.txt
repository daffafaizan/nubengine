      activation and ascertain the level of platelet function impaired by these medications.
      VerifyNow® Aspirin Assay utilizes arachidonic acid as the agonist to measure platelet
      function specifically along this pathway. Our research question for this study is as follows:

      Does the administration of desmopressin (DDAVP) and/or the transfusion of platelets in
      patients with head trauma reverse the platelet inhibition caused by Aspirin and/or Plavix?
      The investigators hypothesize that with the administration of platelets and/or DDAVP that
      there is a reversal of the inhibition.
