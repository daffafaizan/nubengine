    
      Patients and methods: Girls ages 9-15 years old and boys ages 10-17 years old will be
      assigned to either therapist-supervised usual care, or to double-blind injection of 1%
      lidocaine solution with or without 12.5% dextrose. Injections will be administered monthly
      for three months. All subjects will then be offered dextrose injections monthly as needed.
      Change in the Nirschl Pain Phase Scale (NPPS) will serve as the primary outcome measure.
