    
      This is an open label multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple
      doses(3 monthly IV infusions) of SEL-212( a combination of pegsiticase( SEL-037) and
      SVP-rapamycin (SEL-110)) followed by multiple doses (2 monthly IV infusions) of pegsiticase
      (SEL-037) alone for a total of 5 treatment cycles in subjects with symptomatic gout and
      hyperuricemia. Additional subjects will be treated with multiple doses( 5 monthly IV
      infusions) of pegsiticase (SEL-037) alone.

      Uricase is an enzyme that converts uric acid to the readily soluble allantoin that is then
      excreted and SEL-110 is designed to prevent unwanted anti-drug-antibodies (ADAs) from
      forming. All subjects will be monitored for safety and tolerability to drug throughout the
      study on a weekly schedule. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters will at specific
      timepoints to monitor for continued efficacy. Pharmacodynamic parameters measured include
      uric acid levels and levels of ADAs.

      The study duration per enrolled subject will be approximately 6 months including a 1 month
      screening period followed by 5 treatment cycles and an end of treatment visit which will
      occur 30 days after the last IV infusion .
