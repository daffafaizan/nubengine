      48/72-hours intervals -2400 impulses at energy flux density 0.14-0.20 mJ/mm2 at each session-
      (ESWT Group, n=40) or 12 Cryo-US therapy sessions (4 daily sessions per week) in a continuous
      modality at 1.8 Watt/cm2 and -2ËšC at each session- (Cryo-US Group, n=40). Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) and satisfactory results, considered as the sum of the excellent and good scores
      in the Roles and Maudsley score, were used as outcome measures at baseline and 3, 6, and 12
      months post-treatment.
