      clinical practice. Many subjects receive infliximab only as a last resort, when the subject
      is very ill and has failed repeated attempts of corticosteroid induction therapy. Although
      this situation is far from ideal, to change such entrenched physician behavior will require
      compelling evidence that Step-care results in inferior outcomes to earlier introduction of
      effective therapy.

      Based on these considerations, we will perform a cluster randomization trial in which 40
      gastroenterology practices will be randomly assigned to a treatment algorithm featuring the
      early use of combination therapy, treatment intensification guided by objective assessments
      of inflammation and the use of remission as a therapeutic goal or a conventional Step-care
      approach.
