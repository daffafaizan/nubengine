    
      RPH-104 is a macromolecular compound with a molecular weight of 152.715 kilodalton (Data on
      file) and is capable of binding human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). It has also been shown in
      vitro to be a highly potent inhibitor of IL-1β signalling pathway, with low picomolar
      inhibitor activity. In this First in Human study, RPH-104 will be evaluated primarily for its
      safety and tolerability. In a phase I study conducted with health volunteers, a similar
      monoclonal antibody, canakinumab, was investigated in terms of pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics besides efficacy and safety. Similarly, this aimed to investigate effects of
      RPH-104 on selected pharmacodynamic parameters, including Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) along
      with obtaining first human data on pharmacokinetics of RPH-104 in humans will be investigated
      in the same study.
