      served as control and 14 patients with operable local gastric adenocarcinoma (4
      mucosa/submucosa/muscular y 10 serosa lesions) were studied. At the beginning of surgery, a 2
      x 2 cm. sample from macroscopically normal visceral peritoneum at mesenterium root was
      carefully obtained, washed with saline and fixed in glutaraldehyde solution. Besides a sample
      of peritoneal washing fluid was studied to exclude patients with free cancer cells.
      Peritoneal tissue was fixed during 24 hours and then all samples were evaluated by electronic
      microscope.
