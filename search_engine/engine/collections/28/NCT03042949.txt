      of the finger, blood flow is occluded and the pulse wave disappears. As the pressure in the
      cuff is released, blood flow returns, the pulse wave is again detected and blood pressure can
      be measured. This apparatus is easy to use and will allow simplified monitoring of blood
      pressure contains the laser source and optical sensors that measure the reflected light.

      The investigators proposed to validate the sensor by measuring the blood pressure in patients
      with this optical sensor and also by standard plethysmography. The investigators plan to
      measure participants with low, normal and high blood pressure in order to assess the accuracy
      and reliability of the new device.
