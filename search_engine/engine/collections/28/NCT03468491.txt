      college athletes with PFPS and hallux valgus and majoring in long distance running or soccer,
      or recreational runners in Taipei metropolitan area will be recruited. A set of clinical
      examination will be conducted to rule out abnormal knee structures, pathologies, or injuries
      apart from PFPS. The lower extremity alignment as well as hip and knee kinematics during a
      step down test will be tracked using Noraxon's myoMOTION system. Muscle activation of the
      muscles controlling the hip and knee movements during the step down test will be recorded
      using TELEmyo DTS of Noraxon. Hallux valgus angle will be measured with surface markers on
      photographs. Knee pain level will be rated in a visual analog scale. The investigators will
      analyze the data with Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) for Windows.
      Repeated-measure ANOVAs will be used to examine group-by-time interaction on all the outcome
      variables. All significance level will be set at 0.05.
