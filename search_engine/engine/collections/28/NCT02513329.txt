      lower in women randomized to active SGB as compared to sham controls. Mood, memory,
      cognition, sleep, and quality of life will all be improved in the treatment group as compared
      to the sham-control group.

      Specific Goals and Objectives:

      Goal 1: To determine the effect of stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) for reducing subjective
      and objective VMS in women with breast cancer on tamoxifen, AIs, or SERMs Goal 2: To evaluate
      the effect of SGB on mood, memory, cognition, sleep and quality of life in women with breast
      cancer on tamoxifen, AIs, or SERMs.

      We aim to conduct a randomized, single-site, sham-control clinical trial of SGB on VMS in 30
      women with breast cancer on anti-estrogen therapy (15 per group). The primary entry criterion
      will be 28 or more moderate to very severe hot flashes per week. VMS will be measured by
      self-report on a written daily dairy over a 6-month period. Secondary outcomes include
      changes in mood, sleep, quality of life, and objective hot flashes measured by ambulatory
      monitoring (skin-conductance temperature monitoring) for 24 hours at baseline, three months
      and six months. Memory performance with neurocognitive testing will be done at baseline and 3
      months.
