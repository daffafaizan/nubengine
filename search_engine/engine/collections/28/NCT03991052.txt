      avoid complications related to hypoperfusion (undertreatment) or hypertension (over
      treatment). However, the MAP needed to reach can vary over time based on intracranial
      pressure. Additionally, it is well know that the nurses in the Intensive care unit managed
      multiple patients simultaneously and cannot dedicate 100% of his-her time to adjust drugs
      infusions. Using a novel automated system can overcome this issue and may lead to more time
      in MAP target (+/- 5mmHg) than the traditional management.

      After initial rescuscitation of the patients, patients in both groups will have the same
      baseline maintenance fluid administration of 1-2 ml/kg/h of crystalloid solution and
      additionnal fluid boluses administered following the EV1000 monitoring device. The only
      difference will be the management of vasopressor titration (manual by nurses vs automated via
      a closed-loop system)
