      for a total volume of 2 oz donated on one day. To collect this human milk, participants will
      be asked to fully express one breast during each pumping session. Participants will pump once
      with the participant's own pump set-up and once with the sterile pump set-up (provided by the
      research team). Women will be randomized to which pump is used first.

      Randomization will be done using stratified randomization as follows: participants were
      stratified by how their infants were fed, namely whether infants were fed human milk only vs.
      human milk and complementary foods). Then, randomization was conducted within each strata.
      The researchers aim to have a minimum of 25 participants in each stratum.

      All human milk collections will occur at participants' homes between 0700 and 1100 hours. The
      second pumping session must begin 3 hours (+/-30 minutes) after the beginning of the first
      pumping session (e.g. the first pumping session at 7:30 am and the second at 10:30 am).
      Participants will elect from which breast to donate human milk and that breast will be used
      for both pumping sessions. Participants will be asked not to nurse from or pump that breast
      during the 2 hours before the first pumping session and not until after the second pumping
      session (a total of ~5.5 hours).

      From the milk produced during each pumping session (which could be up to ~6 oz), researchers
      will collect 1 oz using a sterile, plastic syringe. Participants will keep the remaining
      volume of milk. Each ounce of milk collected will be separated into 5 sterile containers
      (provided). Participants will store donated milk at home until it is picked up by a
      researcher 2, 4, and 30 days after pumping.
