      the Cogmed intervention at the end of their therapy, or to a standard-of-care condition.

      Cogmed is a computer-based cognitive training program that consists of rotating exercises
      that train attention and working memory. The exercises are presented in a child-friendly,
      game-like format. Training is completed at home in 25 sessions for 15-45 minutes each weekday
      for 5-9 weeks. A research team member serves as a coach who monitors progress and provides
      support through weekly phone calls with study participants and their parents/guardians.
      Information regarding compliance and performance is tracked over the internet and used to
      tailor feedback during weekly telephone coaching.

      Neurocognitive assessments will be conducted at baseline, immediate-post (3-4 months after
      baseline), and 8 month follow-up (12 months after baseline).
