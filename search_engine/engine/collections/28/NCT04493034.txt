      increased stress and anxiety, fatigue and sleep disturbance, impaired memory and cognition,
      and poor quality of life. Chemotherapy can cause a cognitive decline in up to 75% of
      patients; an impairment that oftentimes persists beyond completion of the regimen. This is
      known as "chemobrain". Integrative therapies are actively being investigated to help improve
      psychological wellbeing among cancer patients and survivors.

      The current standard at this institution is to inform patients of different complementary
      services that are available, including art therapy, music therapy or acupuncture, but not
      require patients to use them.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to one of three arms 1) Art therapy program, 2)
      Music therapy program, or 3) Standard of care (SOC). In-person and at-home therapy sessions
      will be scheduled in alternating, weekly sessions, to allow one week of self-reflection and
      remote therapy between in-person sessions. Each participant will be asked to attend two
      in-person therapy sessions per month (total of 6).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of a 3-month, therapist-led
      art or music therapy program to improve quality of life in breast cancer patients currently
      receiving therapy and in cancer survivors.

      Secondary objectives of this study are:

      To determine the effect of these programs on patient cognition in this population.

      To determine the effect of these programs symptoms of anxiety and depression in this
      population.

      To assess whether the effect of these programs is sustained at a 3-month follow-up.
