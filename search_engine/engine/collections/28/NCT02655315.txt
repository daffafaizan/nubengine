      first time) the feasibility, efficacy and acceptability of the conservative iron chelation
      approach in pilot translational studies in Parkinson's disease with a prototype drug:
      deferiprone (1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one) (in the FAIR-PARK-I project led by the
      applicant and funded by French Ministry of Health). The only available
      blood-brain-barrier-permeable iron chelator deferiprone is approved for treating systemic
      iron overload in transfused patients with thalassemia. Deferiprone has been on the European
      Union market since 1999, with a favourable risk/benefit balance at dose of 75 to 100
      mg/kg/day. The investigators shall adopt a repositioning strategy by using deferiprone at a
      lower dose of 30 mg/kg/day in this new indication for local iron overload in Parkinson's
      disease. Deferiprone will be the first-in-class drug for this novel therapeutic strategy. On
      the basis of the preclinical and clinical data from (FAIR-PARK-I), the present (FAIR-PARK-II)
      project should constitute a model for future cytoprotection strategies in neurodegenerative
      diseases; if deferiprone treatment is associated with significant slower disease progression,
      it would be the first non-dopaminergic drug to have a proven disease-modifying effect in
      Parkinson's disease.
