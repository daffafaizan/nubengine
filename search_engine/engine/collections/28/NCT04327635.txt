    
      Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) who undergo percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) at least 4 hours (but no more than 12 hours) after onset of heart attack
      symptoms will be treated with a single dose of PEP within 20 minutes after stent placement or
      post-dilation (whichever is last). Subjects will be screened at the time of emergency room
      presentation. From the emergency room, subjects will proceed to the cardiac catheterization
      laboratory where the PCI will be completed and PEP will be administered. Subjects will be
      followed for one year after PEP administration through clinic visits and a follow-up phone
      call.
