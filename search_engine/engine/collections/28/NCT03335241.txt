      Approximately 75% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage will eventually experience
      disease recurrence. The overall response rates of second-line chemotherapy for recurrent
      ovarian cancer are only 20-27%. The 5-year overall survival rates are less than 20%.
      Therefore, it is important to seek alternative agent that can improve the outcome.
      Fludarabine is a purine nucleoside analog prodrug that upon phosphorylation is toxic to
      dividing and quiescent lymphocytes and monocytes, exerting its effects through DNA synthesis
      interference and apoptosis. The preclinical studies suggest fludarabine may be effective in
      other cancers such as ovarian cancer. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the
      efficacy and safety of the study drug fludarabine combined with pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin versus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone in patients with platinum resistant
      or refractory ovarian cancer.
