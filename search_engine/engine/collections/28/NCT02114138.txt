      to the daily standard of care blood samples before, during and three times following an
      elective surgical procedure.

      Study participants will complete telephone interviews at 6 and 12 months after discharge from
      the hospital with a study team member. The telephone interview will consist of a short
      questionnaire asking about state of health and a health survey.

      At the same times of the phone interviews, the study team will mail a urine dipstick that is
      used to detect any amount of protein in the urine. Study participants will be asked to
      urinate on dipstick and send it back to the study team in provided shipping material.

      Healthy Controls will be enrolled to establish baseline values for kidney health based upon a
      single urine collection and a brief health questionnaire.
