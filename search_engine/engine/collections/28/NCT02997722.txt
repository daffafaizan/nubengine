      the opportunity to participate in the study. Those patients who consent to participate, after
      being informed about the study and its risks, will be randomized to receive an IV infusion of
      either saline or ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. The infusion will be given within 24 hours of arriving
      on the psychiatry inpatient unit. We will record the dates and times that the patient was
      admitted to and discharged from the psychiatric inpatient unit. At completion of the study,
      we will compare the average length of stay, defined as date and time of discharge minus date
      of time of admission, of the group that received ketamine to the average length of stay of
      the group that received placebo.
