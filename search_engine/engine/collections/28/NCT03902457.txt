      with standard dimensions will be placed at the test sites subjacent the sinus mucosa and the
      elevated space will be filled with a xenograft, both test and control groups. A collagen
      membrane will be placed to cover the antrostomy at both groups and sutures will be provided
      to close the wound. After six months of healing, mini-implants will be installed. After 9
      months, biopsies containing the mini-implants will be harvested for histomorphometric
      analyses. CBCTs will be taken for all patients before surgery (T0), after 1 week from sinus
      floor augmentation (T1) and after 9 months of healing (T2). Osseointegration of the
      mini-implants and dimensional changes over time of soft and hard tissues will be evaluated on
      the CBCTs.
