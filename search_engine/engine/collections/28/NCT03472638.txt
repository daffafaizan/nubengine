    
      Patients meeting standard DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder, who
      also meet diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode that has not responded to
      medication, will be eligible for inclusion. In a study with a randomized crossover design,
      they will undergo a course of either either active followed by sham or sham followed by
      active treatment. Each phase (active or sham) will involve 15 days of rTMS targeting the
      bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, 5x weekly, twice-daily with sessions 1 hour apart,
      using 20 Hz stimulation. Followup visits will occur at 1, 4, and 12 weeks after both courses
      of treatment.
