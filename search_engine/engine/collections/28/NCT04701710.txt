      control groups (CG: n=117; 38.4 +/- 7.4 years old, 61F).

      RESULT: The number of subjects who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in GE was lower, only 4 of
      117 (3.4%) than subjects in CG: 25 of 117 (21.4%) (p-Value = 0.0001). Twenty patients had
      mild symptoms (n= 4 in EG, n= 16 in CG), the proportion test was p-Value = 0.001. Six
      subjects were moderate, and 3 with severe diagnostics, all them in CG. The probability (Odd
      Ratio) of becoming ill with COVID-19 was significantly lower in EG with values of 0.13 (CI =
      [0.03, 0.40]; p-Value = 0.0001), this value (<1) indicates a protective effect of the
      Ivermectin / Iota-Carrageenan in the EG. Logistic regression test demonstrated that
      prophylactic in EG is independent of the patient's preexisting variable comorbidity was 0.11,
      CI= [0.04, 0.33], and p-Value= 0.0001. On the other hand, this variable was 2.78 CI= [1.19,
      6.48], p-Value = 0.018 in CG. Also, we found that when increase the age variable, also
      increases contagious risk for Covid-19 in all subjects 0,93 CI=[0.88, 0.98], p-Value= 0,0012.

      CONCLUSION: The intensive preventive treatment (short-term) with Ivermectin / Iota -
      Carrageenan was able to reduce the number of health workers infected with COVID-19. This
      treatment had an additional effect in preventing the severity of the disease, since most of
      the patients who received the treatment were mild. We propose a new therapeutic alternative
      for prevention and short-term intervention scheme (intensive) that is of benefit of the
      health worker in this pandemic accelerated time. This treatment did not produce lack of
      adherence or adverse effects.
