      to inclusion and exclusion criteria are going to be divided into 2 groups after signing the
      informed consent. In both groups their nutrition status, humoral and cellular immunity,
      respiratory system function and parameters of oxidative stress will be evaluated before
      entering the intervention.

      Afterwards the patients are going to be divided into one group who will receive nutrition
      support using immunonutrition for the next 8 weeks while the second one will continue with
      their nutrition support using routine sipping support with no immunonutrition. According to
      our hypothesis oxidative stress parameters will improve in the group of patients on
      immunonutrition comparing to the other group. Afterwards the patients will change their
      nutrition support for another 8 weeks. The patients who took immunonutrition in the first
      half of study will switch back to routine sipping support and contrary the patients who were
      in the first part of study on routine sipping will take immunonutrition. After the end of
      this period of study we expect the return of oxidative stress parameters to the baseline
      values in the group of patients who took immunonutrition in the first half of study but who
      were returned to routine nutrition support and contrary the improvement of oxidative stress
      parameters in the patients who started to take immunonutrition in the second half of study.

      The total energy support will be identical in both periods for each individual patient. After
      the first 8 weeks and after the completion of study the same examination are going to be
      evaluate as it was on the entrance to study.
