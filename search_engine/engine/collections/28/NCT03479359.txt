      Urology. The DRE is a very important daily practice for screen prostate cancer, and each
      internship in Urology is required to perform this for patients suspected of prostate cancer
      or benign prostate hyperplasia. However, how many DRE are usually needed for a internship to
      perform so as to obtain a stable accuracy in daily practice is currently unknown. The
      investigators thus conduct this prospective trial to investigate the learning curve of DRE
      among internship.
