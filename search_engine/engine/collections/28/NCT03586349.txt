      of Turkish and to work on the reliability and validity of it in healthy individuals between
      the ages of 18-64. Original form has nine questions but Spanish version of it had eleven
      questions so the investigators will translate Spanish version of SBQ. At first step by using
      a forward-backward translation method, a translation and adaptation process will be
      performed. At second step the validation process will be performed in a total of 200 healthy
      subjects aged between 18-64 years. Subjects will fill sociodemographic information form,
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form, and SBQ Turkish version ( at
      baseline and after seven days). Cronbach's alpha values, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
      will be evaluated for the reliability, construct and convergent validity.
