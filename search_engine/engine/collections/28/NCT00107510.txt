      Primary

        -  Determine the pathological complete response rate in patients with stage II or III
           breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel, carboplatin, and pegfilgrastim.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of breast-conserving surgery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility of drug administration, in terms of the percent of planned
           dose actually administered per course, in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients with negative pathologic lymph node status after
           treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients with residual ductal carcinoma in situ after
           treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      No more than 6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo definitive surgery.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months until disease
      progression and then annually for up to 5 years. Patients who do not complete all 4 courses
      of chemotherapy or do not undergo surgery are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.
