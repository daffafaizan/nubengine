      in the insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) in response to
      autonomic blockade. The investigators will measure EGP at baseline (EGPBsl) and during the
      last 30 minutes of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (EGPClamp) on two different occasions
      (intact and Blocked study days). A double blinded randomize cross-over design will be used.
      Subjects will be randomized to either the intact or blocked days and a month later will be
      crossed-over to the other arm. The investigator performing the analysis will also be blinded
      to the treatments received. At baseline in both study days it is expected to see any
      differences since the same subject will serve as his own control. During the clamp, insulin
      suppresses EGP. In obese insulin resistant subjects this suppression should be blunted. If
      the hypothesis is correct, it is expected an improvement in the suppression by insulin of EGP
      during autonomic blockade only. For this study, the primary endpoint therefore, will be the
      EGP during the clamp between the intact and blocked days.
