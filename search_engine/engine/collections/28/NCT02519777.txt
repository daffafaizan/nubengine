      or HAND), which includes asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive
      disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD), even if they are on ART and have
      undetectable viral loads. In this study, researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of
      adding MVC and DTG to the current ART regimen of HIV-infected people with undetectable (<50
      copies/mL) plasma HIV-1 RNA who have mild to moderate neurocognitive impairment and who have
      been on stable ART for at least 6 months prior to study entry. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate if the addition of MVC and DTG to participants' existing ART regimens will
      improve participants' neurocognitive performance.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms. All participants will remain on
      their existing ART regimens; they will take their assigned study drugs in addition to their
      ART regimen. Participants in Arm A will receive placebo for MVC and placebo for DTG.
      Participants in Arm B will receive DTG and placebo for MVC. Participants in Arm C will
      receive MVC and DTG. Study visits will occur at entry and Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96.
      Visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, neurocognitive testing, pregnancy
      testing, and questionnaires. Some participants may have an optional lumbar puncture
      procedure. Participants will have to return for refills of study drugs on Weeks 36, 60, and
      84.
