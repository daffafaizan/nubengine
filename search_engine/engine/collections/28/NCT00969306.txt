      including small cell lung cancer. Hypoxic cells are more radio-resistant, more
      chemo-resistant and more prone to develop distant metastases than normoxic cells.

      One of the mechanisms responsible for survival of these therapy-resistant hypoxic cells is
      (macro-)autophagy: a phenomenon in which cells provide themselves with energy (ATP) by
      digesting their own cell-organelles. Chloroquine is a potent blocker of autophagy and has
      been demonstrated in a lab setting to dramatically enhance tumor response to radiotherapy,
      chemotherapy and even anti-hormonal therapy.

      Thus, chloroquine might very well be able to increase overall survival in small cell lung
      cancer by sensitizing cells resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
