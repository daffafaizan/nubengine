      preterm children are thought to be related to neurobiological factors, including injuries to
      white matter structures of the brain and environmental factors, including decreased exposure
      to maternal speech in the hospital nursery. There is evidence to suggest that maternal speech
      input may be important for promoting healthy brain and language development.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. Each infant has a 50%
      chance of being assigned to the group that will listen to a recording of his/her mother's
      voice and a 50% chance of being assigned to the group that will not be played a voice
      recording. Mother's of participating infants will have her voice recorded as she reads a
      common children's storybook. Recordings will be played to infants each day until s/he is
      discharged from the hospital. To assess the long term impacts of this treatment, research
      participants and their families will be asked to return for follow-up visiting to perform an
      MRI brain scan and complete questionnaires and test that assess language development.
      Follow-up visit occur when infants are between 12 to 18 months of age.
