      bloody stool, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Endoscopic features of the disease severity and
      mucosal healing stage are strongly associated with treatment response and prognosis in the
      future. Currently, the Mayo endoscopic sub-score (Mayo ES) and Ulcerative colitis endoscopic
      index of severity (UCEIS) are commonly recommended to guide therapeutic adjustments. However,
      the accuracy of these scales greatly relies on intra-observer and inter-observer consistency
      for lack of objective measurements. Recently, deep learning algorithm based on convolutional
      neural network (CNN) has shown multiple potential in computer-aided detection and
      computer-aided diagnose of gastrointestinal lesions. Up to now, no randomized controlled
      trials have been conducted to evaluate the performance of deep learning algorithm for
      assessing disease activity in ulcerative colitis. This study aims to train a deep learnig
      algorithm to assess severity and mucosal healing stage of ulcerative colitis using the Mayo
      ES and UCEIS scale, then testify whether the engagement of AI can improve the evaluation
      accuracy of physicians in a multi-center clinical practice.
