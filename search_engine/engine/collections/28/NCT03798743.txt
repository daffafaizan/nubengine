      late-stage or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) failed platinum-containing
      dual-drug chemotherapy. Center, single arm phase II study. In this study, 30 patients with
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had failed platinum-containing
      dual-drug chemotherapy were treated with rituximab plus docetaxel every 3 weeks until disease
      progression and intolerance. Toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death or other
      cessation of treatment as prescribed by the program, whichever occurs first. The primary end
      point was the ORR based on RECIS 1.1, which was evaluated by the Independent Imaging Review
      Board (IRRC). The longest treatment time for ididibizumab is 24 months. An interim analysis
      will be conducted during the course of the study. The results and reports will be provided to
      the Independent Data Audit Committee (IDMC), which determines whether the trial is valid
      based on the valid cut-off value of the trial and whether the study data can be submitted in
      advance. Make recommendations to the sponsor. Prior to the interim analysis, the IDMC charter
      will be finalized and approved by IDMC and the sponsor. The responsibilities and related
      procedures of IDMC members will be defined in the IDMC charter.
