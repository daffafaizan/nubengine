      clinical definition is adopted. Radiologically defined osteoarthritis of the hand has been
      estimated to represent 38% of women and 24.5% of men over 66 years of age but higher
      prevalence of 60-70% has also been reported. Of patients with radiological signs, 20 to 40%
      become symptomatic. For patients over 55 years of age, the distal interphalangeal joints are
      the most prevalent site of osteoarthritis (20%) determined radiologically and clinically,
      followed by the base of the thumb (8%) and proximal interphalangeal joints (5%). This
      prevalence increases with age, and the incidence peaks in perimenopausal women.
      Osteoarthritis in the base of the thumb (BTOA) concerns the trapeziometacarpal joint, with a
      possible secondary location at the trapezotrapezoidial and scaphotrapezial joints. BTOA
      induces a closure of the first web, which in turn causes an alteration of the thumb-index
      pinch and therefore a limitation in hand function. Pain induced by the compression of the
      thumb column during pinching could also lead to functional disability. Effect of a simple
      intervention such as wearing rest thumb orthoses on pain and disability is unknown.
