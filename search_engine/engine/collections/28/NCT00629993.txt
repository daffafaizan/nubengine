        1. To test the hypothesis that an intervention, multi-component academic detailing, will
           increase the rate of physician cervical cancer screening at 3- and 6-months
           post-randomization, compared to the rate observed in a service-as-usual control.

        2. To develop models predicting which physician offices are most and least likely to adopt
           the intervention, and to generate hypotheses about tailoring the dissemination of
           cervical cancer screening guidelines to different physician subgroups.

        3. To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the incremental societal costs and
           effects (in lives saved, life-years saved, and quality-of-life-years saved) of the
           cervical cancer intervention implemented in physicians' offices.

      The long-term goal of this project therefore is to reduce cervical cancer risks among ethnic
      and racial minorities, by influencing the screening behaviors of their primary care
      physicians.
