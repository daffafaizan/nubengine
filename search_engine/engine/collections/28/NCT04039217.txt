      majority of MSM acquire HIV after exposure to the rectal mucosa through receptive anal
      intercourse without condoms. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis
      (PEP) are recommended for MSM who may be exposed to HIV to prevent infection. Current
      recommendations for PrEP are to take the combination anti-HIV drug, tenofovir+emtricibatine
      (TDF/FTC), on a daily basis for the duration of someone's HIV risk exposure period, which
      could be months or years. For PEP, a three-drug anti-HIV medication is recommended within 72
      hours of a possible exposure for a 28-day course. While PrEP and PEP are effective, some
      people find it difficult to follow the recommended regimen. Therefore, additional
      short-course dosing regimens for PrEP and PEP are being considered for future development.
      The study drug provided in this study will not protect participants from HIV or treat any
      active infection. This proposal seeks to understand how other anti-HIV medications are
      absorbed and how long they persist in different body compartments, including mucosal tissues,
      as they may be considered for PrEP or PEP regimens in the future.
