    
      Pregnant women diagnosed to have intrapartum fetal distress (Non reassuring or pathological
      changes according to NICE guidelines 2017) in any of the groups will receive the allocated
      treatment at least 20 minute before the procedure (emergency CS).

      measures to reduce the effect of hypoxia will be applied to all participate through:

        -  The position of the mother will be changed to left lateral position (allow increased
           blood supply).

        -  I.V. fluid bolus (to avoid maternal dehydration).

        -  Oxytocin or cervical ripening agent will be discontinued.

        -  Fetal heart rate monitoring with cardiotocography will be attempted.

        -  If umbilical cord prolapse is noted, elevate the presenting fetal part until preparing
           for emergency operative delivery.

        -  After birth, Apgar score will be used to identify distress newborns that need
           resuscitation.

      The study comprised 200 pregnant women. They were divided into two groups each are 100:

        -  Group A: pregnant women diagnosed to have intrapartum fetal distress who will receive
           MgSO4.

        -  Group B: pregnant women diagnosed to have intrapartum fetal distress who will receive
           placebo
