      analysis. All consecutive stroke patients included in the Prince of Wales Hospital stroke
      registry will be recruited.

      Patients will be stratified according to their stroke subtypes with reference to the TOAST
      classification (1), which includes large artery disease, cardioembolism, small vessel
      occlusion, other determined causes, undetermined cause or incomplete investigations.

      Stroke etiology is determined by stroke neurologists with reference to the history, physical
      signs, imaging including carotid duplex, transcranial doppler, computer tomography (CT), CT
      angiogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR angiogram, electrocardiography (ECG) and
      echocardiography. Interobserver variability for stroke mechanism determination will be
      evaluated.

      Pre-defined demographic data including age, gender, smoking status, vascular risk factors
      including hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes, prior stroke or TIA, etc. will be
      retrieved from the stroke registry.

      The investigator will also compare the use of antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants,
      lipid-lowering agents, specific antihypertensives in the Shatin territory across the 15-year
      period using the CDARS.
