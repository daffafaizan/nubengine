      permeability and increased plasma levels of IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10 causing interstitial
      fibrosis in the lung is considered. Considering these factors in pathogenesis, a picture with
      high mortality from acute respiratory failure to severe ARDS emerges in critically ill
      COVID-19 patients. However, despite numerous studies, an effective antiviral treatment has
      not yet been found in COVID-19 disease. The low level of evidence for the recommendations
      presented in the guidelines on both treatment and mechanical ventilation has brought
      supportive treatments to the agenda. Recently, many articles have been published on the
      potential effects of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant treatments such as high-dose vitamin
      C, vitamin D, zinc and ozone therapy. In particular, high-dose intravenous vitamin C
      treatment is inexpensive, easily accessible, and it reduces mortality in patients with sepsis
      and ARDS in studies, suggesting that it may be beneficial in COVID-19 disease. this is a
      retrospective cohort study. The main goal of the study; to compare patients who did not
      receive high-dose vitamin C treatment in the first period of the epidemic and those who
      received treatment in the next period. the investigator aimed to determine the effect of
      Vitamin C on short-term mortality and length of stay in intensive care in critically ill
      COVID-19 patients. All patients' data on age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities
      (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease, other), PaO2 / FiO2 ratios, SOFA scores, ferritin, C-Reactive Protein,
      procalcitonin, lactate, neutrophil and lymphocyte values will be collected by scanning the
      hospital information system.
