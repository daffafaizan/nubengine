      Strength training using devices that induce varying degrees of instability is widely
      practiced in numerous contexts and has been credited with benefits in prevention,
      rehabilitation and general health. Several studies have found a progressive decrease in power
      as the degree of instability increases. However, it is not known how mildly unstable
      situations are affected, nor are the differences between trained and untrained subjects.

      The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of different degrees of
      instability on power and speed of execution in a push-up or arm-bottoms exercise, in trained
      and untrained subjects.

      Method

      Maximum power (MP) and mean power (BP), and maximum speed (MV) and mean propulsive speed (VA)
      of push-up were analyzed in 44 subjects, 24 untrained (176.38±5.35 cm, 76.38±6.85 kg, 2.5±1.5
      months experience) and 20 trained (178.45±5.91 cm, 83.4±21.56 kg, 15.5±5.3 months
      experience), under six conditions of increasing instability: 1) stable, 2) device in
      suspension: rings, 3) monopodal, 4) device in suspension: TRX®, 5) with hands-on Bosu® and 6)
      with hands-on TRX® and feet on Bosu®.
