    
      Dose escalation in this study will include 24 healthy volunteers in six (6) dose cohorts:

        -  0.2 mg/kg, N = 2

        -  0.5 mg/kg, N = 2

        -  1 mg/kg, N = 2

        -  5 mg/kg, N = 6

        -  10 mg/kg, N = 6

        -  20 mg/kg, N = 6

      A minimum of 20-hour interval from the first dosing must take place before the second subject
      can be dosed within each cohort. No such time interval will be required for dosing of
      subsequent subjects (third subject onwards) within the same cohort.

      Dose escalations will be guided by review of clinical signs, adverse events (AEs), and
      laboratory tests of the prior group (up to Day 7 after dosing) by a safety monitoring
      committee.

      In order to assess the safety and tolerability of an intravenous (IV) infusion of Tyzivumab
      when given to healthy adult volunteers, the following vital signs and tests will be
      performed:

        -  Blood Pressure

        -  Pulse Rate

        -  Respiratory Rate

        -  Body Temperature

        -  ECG

        -  Urinalysis

        -  Serum Chemistry

        -  Haematology

      In order to assess Tyzivumab pharmacokinetics (only for doses 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg & 20
      mg/kg), the following parameters will be measured:

        -  maximum concentration (Cmax)

        -  time to maximum concentration (Tmax)

        -  area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-âˆž)

        -  AUC calculated from time of administration to the last measurable concentration
           (AUC0-last)

        -  half-life (t1/2)

        -  volume of distribution (Vd)

        -  clearance [CL] in serum PK will be assessed at pre-dose, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24
           h, 48 h, 72 h, 120 h, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84.

      The presence and extent of anti-drug antibody (ADA) production in response to dosing with
      Tyzivumab will also be assessed at pre-dose, Day 14, Day 56 and Day 84.
