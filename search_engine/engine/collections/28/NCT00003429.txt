        -  Assess the feasibility of using fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography
           (PET) imaging in patients with primary or recurrent cervical cancer.

        -  Investigate the ability of FDG-PET scan imaging to detect lymph node metastases in these
           patients.

        -  Investigate the ability of FDG-PET imaging to identify locally advanced disease in early
           stage cervical cancers.

        -  Compare FDG-PET to CT scan imaging with respect to distinguishing between postradiation
           pelvic fibrosis and recurrent cervical cancer.

        -  Investigate the ability of FDG-PET to identify recurrent cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a diagnostic study.

      Patients with primary cervical cancer receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) intravenously
      followed 45 minutes later with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging over 60 minutes, as
      well as computed tomography (CT) scan. Both diagnostic imaging techniques are to assess the
      abdomen and pelvis, and must be done within 2 weeks prior to surgery. Patients eligible for
      surgery undergo radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy and all specimens are evaluated for
      correlation with the preoperative diagnostic tests findings.

      Patients with recurrent cervical cancer obtain FDG-PET scan and CT scan of the thorax,
      abdomen, and pelvis prior to surgical exploration for pelvic exenteration. All biopsy
      specimens are evaluated for correlation with diagnostic tests findings.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients (20 patients with primary cervical cancer and 10
      patients with recurrent cervical cancer) will be accrued for this study.
