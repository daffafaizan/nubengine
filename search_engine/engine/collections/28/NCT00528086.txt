      PD and their caregivers. The feasibility will be assessed by the ability to enroll and retain
      (measured by number of individuals who complete the 12-month study and at least half the
      study visits) ~40 individuals in the pilot trial. The responsiveness of the following
      different outcomes to group visits will be assessed during the pilot trial: quality of life,
      patient satisfaction, depression, caregiver burden, resource utilization, and disease
      progression. The primary outcome measure for efficacy will be a comparison of the change in
      the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 from baseline to 12 months in the control (routine
      care) and intervention (group visit) groups.
