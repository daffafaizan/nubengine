      spent annually by consumers in the United States alone. Herbal supplements, such as Rhodiola
      and Cordyceps, both of which are considered to be adaptogens, remain popular among athletes.
      These adaptogens act as antioxidants, which have been speculated to confer endurance
      performance benefits by delaying muscle fatigue via the attenuation of muscle damage
      accumulation and its related by-products during prolonged or exhaustive exercise.
      Nevertheless, previous research investigating the individual effects of Rhodiola and
      Cordyceps on aerobic training performance remain equivocal. Moreover, literature elucidating
      the potential additive effects of Rhodiola and Cordyceps in human subjects are scarce.
      Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to determine the acute, additive influence of
      oral Rhodiola and Cordyceps supplementation on VO2 max, with secondary variables of interest
      being plasma glucose and lactate concentration, and measures of gastrointestinal distress.
