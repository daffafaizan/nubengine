      undergoing isolated CABG, a prospective one-to-one randomized trial comparing the fusion
      oxygenation to the currently used affinity oxygenation system will be conducted. Forty
      patients intending to undergo CABG will be divided into 2 groups according to the oxygenation
      system which will be used during surgery. Distribution into groups will be done randomly. Ten
      patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgical procedures under general anesthesia
      and 10 patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention will serve as control
      groups for the neurological outcomes. Clinical status, inflammatory and hematological
      response as well as Neurological outcome will be assessed.
