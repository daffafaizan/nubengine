      is being detected in the HAHA test for this group of patients, and if, in the laboratory, it
      increases the killing of tumor cells, accounting for the observation that some the patients
      who tested positive may have an improved outcome.

      The study will analyze DNA from blood samples of SJCRH patients treated with hu14.18K322A
      anti-GD2 antibody. Serological studies and confirmatory genotyping studies will be performed
      in a laboratory at the University of Wisconsin.
