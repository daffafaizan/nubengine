    
      This study is a prospective, pharmacokinetic study comparing ranibizumab clearance in two
      groups of patients; those with and without prior vitrectomy. Additionally it will compare
      ranibizumab clearance to aflibercept clearance as well as the effect on systemic circulating
      inflammatory and safety markers. Patients will already be receiving ranibizumab or
      aflibercept therapy - the injection is itself administered irrespective of their
      participation in this study and therefore this study will not alter medical management or the
      choice of therapy.

      To estimate ranibizumab and aflibercept clearance, it is important to measure serum
      concentrations at several intervals within the first 24 hours. Participants will ideally have
      venous blood sampling at the following times after their ranibizumab or aflibercept
      injection:

        -  1 hour

        -  2 hours

        -  3 hours

        -  4 hours

        -  6 hours

        -  24 hours

        -  2 days

        -  4 days

        -  1 week*

        -  2 weeks

        -  4 weeks*
