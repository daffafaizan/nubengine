      of electrical stimulation for bowel functions. The study will determine sensations elicited
      by non-invasive, transcutaneous abdominal electrical stimulation and its effects on bowel
      function in spinal cord injured individuals and in able-bodied persons with chronic
      constipation. The electrical stimulation will be delivered through commercially available
      equipment to each subject during a single site visit. Visits are anticipated to be no more
      than 5 hours.
