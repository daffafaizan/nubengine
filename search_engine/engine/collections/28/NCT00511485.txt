      progressive adenocarcinoma of the lung.

      Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate
      vitamin receptor (FR). Experimental evidence shows that this target receptor is expressed on
      a significant portion of non-small cell lung cancers. Early clinical evidence in a small
      number of Phase I patients suggests that vintafolide is generally well-tolerated, without
      many of the side-effects observed in more-standard therapeutic agents. This evidence suggests
      that vintafolide may be useful as a chemotherapy against progressive adenocarcinomas of the
      lung. The primary objective of this study is to collect data on clinical benefit produced by
      therapy with vintafolide .

      All participants will undergo imaging with the FR targeting investigational imaging agent
      etarfolatide (EC20, FolateScan) during the screening period to confirm eligibility for the
      treatment portion of the clinical trial. Clinical evidence suggests that etarfolatide may be
      used to identify patients with cancers that express the target receptor.

      Information about the safety and tolerability of both vintafolide and etarfolatide will be
      assessed.
