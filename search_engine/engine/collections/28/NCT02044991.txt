      defined as pain experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold,
      particularly in the region of the sacroiliac joint.2 Pain may radiate in the posterior thigh
      and can also occur in conjunction with/or separately in the symphysis. In PGP, the endurance
      capacity for standing, walking and sitting is diminished. The diagnosis of PGP can be reached
      after exclusion of lumbar causes and must be reproducible by specific clinical tests. While
      various pain mechanisms including mechanical, hormonal, inflammatory, and neural have been
      proposed in the development of PGP, the etiology and pathogenesis is poorly understood. It is
      possible that musculoskeletal changes influenced by hormonal (Relaxin) elevation in pregnancy
      predispose pregnant women to acute musculoskeletal injury presenting clinically as PGP. An
      inflammatory response in other acute musculoskeletal injuries has been well described3 and
      may also occur in pregnancy related PGP particularly given the musculoskeletal vulnerability
      during this time. Though PGP is common in pregnancy, no study to date has investigated the
      efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment in pregnancy related PGP in order to better establish
      the contribution of inflammation in the etiology of pregnancy related PGP.
