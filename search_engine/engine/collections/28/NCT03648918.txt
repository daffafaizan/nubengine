      as T1D is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. There has been a rise in the
      number of cases diagnosed as well as a decrease in the age of diagnosis. This project aims to
      understand the disease progression as seen in the immune system and to define the genetic and
      environmental factors that affect inflammation and regulation, which could determine disease
      progression or nonprogression. Families that include a family member with T1D will be
      recruited, as well as unrelated, healthy controls as a comparison group.

      Participants will have height and weight measured, complete a social & medical history
      questionnaire, and have blood drawn for analysis for HLA haplotype (a genetic sequence
      related to type 1 diabetes susceptibility)diabetes, blood glucose, immune system response,
      complete blood count, and autoantibody measurements. Some family members may return for
      follow-up visits for up to 10 years.
