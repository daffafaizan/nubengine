    
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is a complex and multifactorial disease. Therapeutic
      modalities, as PBM and MT, expected to relief of symptoms, improve of function and reduce the
      impact of the disease in patient's life. Fifty-one TMD patients were randomly allocated to
      three groups: PBM group (n=18) using 808 nm, 100 milliwatt (mW), 13.3 J âˆ•cm2, 4 J per point),
      MT group (n=16) with 21 minutes sessions of MT of the masticatory muscles and TMJ and
      Combined Therapy group (CT) (n=17) applying the 2 protocol described above. All treatments
      were done three times a week for four consecutive weeks. Evaluations were performed at
      baseline, during the treatment (days 7, 14, 21, and 28) and follow up (day 60 and day 90).
      Visual analogue scale (VAS), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) Axis I and II, Beck
      anxiety inventory (BAI) were used in different moments of evaluation time.
