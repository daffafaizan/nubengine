      angiography-guided PCI with routine high pressure NC ballooning arm in 1:1 ratio. Within
      OCT-guided PCI arm, the use of OCT will be also assigned to full OCT-guidance arm and
      postprocedural OCT only arm. and comparison of stent implantation with and without
      preprocedural OCT will be evaluated by postprocedural OCT (OCT-defined stent optimization
      will be assessed). In angiography-guided PCI arm, PCI for complex lesion will be performed
      without guidance of intravascular imaging, and routine use of high pressure postdilation with
      NC balloon will be also recommended. Primary endpoint will be evaluated during 12 months
      after PCI.
