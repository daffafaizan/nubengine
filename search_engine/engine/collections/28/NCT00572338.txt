      part of the diagnostic work-up or follow-up of your multiple myeloma. Bone marrow/peripheral
      blood/tissue samples will be collected for research purposes, as well as testing for genetic
      traits of Castleman's disease if you consent to this study. In addition, data will be
      collected including demographic information gathered from your medical record, including
      gender, date of birth, ethnicity, date of diagnosis, laboratory and pathology results,
      treatment protocols, dates of relapses, subsequent treatment protocols, and current
      treatments and medications.
