    
      Blood sampling: - 0:15 h pre-dose, 0:15, 0:30, 0:45, 1:00, 1:20, 1:40, 2:00, 2:20, 2:40,
      3:00, 3:30, 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 24:00 hours post-dose

      Urine Sampling: Pre-dose, 0-4 hours, 4-8 hours, 8-12 hours, 12-16 hours, 16-24 hours

      Drug analysis: by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)

      Pharmacokinetic Characteristics: Evaluation is carried out using standard noncompartmental
      characteristics including: area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve truncated at
      time t (AUC0-t), area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve extrapolated to infinity
      (AUC0-∞), peak plasma concentration (Cmax), time of occurrence of Cmax (tmax), apparent
      elimination half-life (t½), clearance over bioavailability (CL/F), renal clearance (CLr) and
      renal secretion. The evaluation may be completed by compartmental population pharmacokinetic
      approaches.

      Statistical evaluation: Pharmacokinetic characteristics are compared for cocktail
      administration vs. individual administration by standard average bioequivalence assessment.

      Safety, tolerability: Adverse events, laboratory and clinical parameters and vital signs will
      be assessed.
