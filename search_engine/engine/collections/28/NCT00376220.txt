      Hopkins for a screening visit during which they will talk with a psychiatrist, answer
      questions about their mood and symptoms, have their blood drawn and have a brief physical
      exam. If they meet criteria for the study, any antidepressant medication that they are taking
      will be tapered and stopped before beginning study medications. Participation in the study
      includes free study medication, labs, and testing plus reimbursement for transportation.
      Participants will also be paid and after the study referred back to their treating
      psychiatrist with treatment recommendations.
