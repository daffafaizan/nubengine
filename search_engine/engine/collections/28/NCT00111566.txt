      ischemic heart disease. In the majority of cases, the potent anti-platelet agent eptifibatide
      is administered (bolus followed by infusion for 18 hours). The principal reason to use
      eptifibatide for PCI is to prevent platelet aggregation and the associated ischemia and
      myocardial infarction (MI). With improved laminar flow following stenting, prolonged infusion
      of eptifibatide may no longer be necessary. We hypothesize that after successful stenting
      with good angiographic results, patients can have eptifibatide discontinued immediately
      without a higher risk of adverse ischemic outcome, i.e. death, MI or unplanned target vessel
      revascularization (TVR) by 30 days. MI is defined as creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB)
      concentrations elevated to more than three times the upper limit of normal or new pathologic
      Q wave as seen on electrocardiograms (ECG). In order to prove this hypothesis, we estimate a
      sample size of 2,100 patients.

      Before embarking on a large-scale clinical trial, we propose a pilot study using serum
      troponin I elevation as a surrogate end-point. Troponin I is a sensitive biomarker of
      ischemic injury. The absence of troponin I release following PCI would suggest excellent
      short and intermediate term prognosis. For the pilot study, we seek to prove the hypothesis
      that following successful PCI with stenting, an abbreviated regimen of eptifibatide is not
      inferior to the standard infusion in preventing ischemic injury, defined as troponin I
      release if baseline value is normal, or as CK-MB more than 3 times upper limit of normal if
      baseline troponin I is elevated. For this pilot study, we estimate a sample size of 620
      patients.
