      rise, a better understanding of this association may become critically important to public
      health. We will determine the impact of fish oil-derived Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on asthma control among obese asthmatics. These omega-3 fatty
      acids have been shown to: reduce inflammation important to asthma and improve asthma outcomes
      in an inconsistent manner across previous smaller studies - results that are consistent with
      a pharmacogenetic influence. There exists evidence that omega-3 fatty acid response displays
      a pharmacogenetic response related to ALOX5 genotype. Preliminary data suggests that obese
      individuals are at greater risk for possessing this same ALOX5 variant and thus obese
      asthmatics may be more responsive to fish oil. We will determine (in a sub-aim) if there
      exists an ALOX5 genotype-related response effect with fish oil. This will be the largest
      clinical trial of omega-3 fatty acid for the treatment of asthma, and the first applying
      pharmacogenetic/nutrigenetic analysis.
