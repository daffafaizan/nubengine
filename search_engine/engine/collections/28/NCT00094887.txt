      inhalation in the treatment of vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC) in patients with sickle cell
      disease. The study population will include patients with sickle cell disease (SS,
      S-beta-Thalassemia) presenting with vaso-occlusive pain crisis. Patients will be administered
      either placebo or inhaled nitric oxide to see if the experimental agent, inhaled nitric
      oxide, can reduce the time it takes for resolution of the vaso-occlusive crisis.
