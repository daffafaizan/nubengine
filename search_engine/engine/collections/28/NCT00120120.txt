      Ongoing; Total Study Duration: Up to 14 weeks + the duration of the extension phase

      For each subject, the study consists of three phases: Pre-randomization phase (14 days),
      Treatment Phase (12 weeks) and an extension phase where subjects have the opportunity to
      receive lenalidomide treatment as long as benefit is derived from the drug. Subjects who
      complete all 12 weeks of the treatment phase may be eligible to initiate (subjects randomized
      to receive placebo in the treatment phase) or continue to receive lenalidomide therapy
      (subjects randomized to receive lenalidomide in the treatment phase) in the extension phase.
      Subjects may continue in the extension phase as long as a benefit is derived from the drug.
