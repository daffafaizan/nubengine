      (Endometrioma) is a challenging complication for this operation, many treatment choices are
      available and the most common is the surgical excision, however recurrence could be seen
      after the surgical operation. We assess all patients who underwent surgical excision for
      abdominal wall endometriomas in our hospital by retrieving the medical files and pathology
      reports to study the possible age group,causes and duration of endometriomas. Also the rate
      of enodmetriomas among the previously experienced females with cesarean section operations.
      Pathological diagnosis tools will be also assessed.

      Ethical approval was obtained from the local committee. Results will be statistically
      assessed using SPSS programm.
