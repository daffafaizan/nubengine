      recruited from the local community, via the University of Missouri's Endocrinology Clinic and
      the primary care clinics. During screening, and after consent, anthropometrics (waist
      circumference and body composition) will be obtained and fasting blood will be drawn for
      serum chemistries, A1c, complete blood count, liver and kidney function. Screening will also
      include completion of an oral glucose tolerance test with measurements of arterial stiffness
      and assessment of endothelial function. Following screening, eligible subjects will be
      assigned to one of the four groups (allopurinol, placebo, fructose restriction/isocaloric, or
      fructose restriction/hypocaloric). Allopurinol will be titrated to achieve a target dose of
      300 mg/day. Along with placebo, this arm of the study is double-blinded. A separate group of
      men and women will be assigned to the isocaloric fructose-restriction study in which dietary
      fructose is replaced by starch and body weight is held constant. Lastly, a separate group of
      men and women will be assigned to the hypocaloric fructose-restriction in which baseline
      caloric intake will be reduced by 500 Calories/day while baseline intakes of protein and fat
      will remain constant. The subjects in these groups will not be blinded to the dietary
      treatment but the staff making measurements will be. Subjects in the four groups will be
      matched for age and BMI.
