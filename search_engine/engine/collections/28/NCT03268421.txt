      persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Whereas medications offer limited and
      short-term symptom relief for JFM, our research group has demonstrated that
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is safe, effective and durable in reducing functional
      disability and depressive symptoms in adolescents with this condition. However, 60% of
      patients receiving CBT did not show clinically significant improvement in functional
      disability, and pain levels remained in the moderate range despite being reduced overall. Our
      multidisciplinary team of experts in Behavioral Medicine, Rheumatology and Exercise Science
      has developed and tested the feasibility of a new Fibromyalgia Integrative Training program
      for Teens (FIT Teens), which enhances the established CBT intervention with a novel
      neuromuscular exercise training program derived from evidence-based pediatric injury
      prevention research. Pilot testing showed excellent patient engagement, no adverse effects
      and very promising early results indicating this treatment to have even stronger effects on
      disability and pain outcomes than CBT alone. This trial evaluates whether the FIT Teens
      intervention is more effective than CBT alone or graded aerobic exercise alone and whether
      treatment effects are sustainable over 1 year follow-up.
