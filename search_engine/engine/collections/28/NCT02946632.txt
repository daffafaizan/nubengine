      adding other classes of anti-diabetic medications if target HbA1c is not achieved. However,
      several clinical studies clearly showed that initial dual or triple combination therapy was
      more favorable in terms of glycemic control.

      A DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin increases serum level of GLP-1, and potentiates its action of
      increasing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and lowering glucagon secretion. A SGLT-2
      inhibitor dapagliflozin lowers hyperglycemia via blocking SGLT-2 to increase glucosuria, that
      is, in an insulin-independent manner. Therefore, the mechanism of action of these drugs are
      complimentary to that of metformin, and all of these have a low risk of hypoglycemia and
      weight gain.
