      cycles approximately 12 hours in length. During each cycle, contact lenses were worn for
      2-hour intervals, separated by lens-free (recovery) intervals of either 0, 30, 60, or 80
      minutes. A new pair of contact lenses was dispensed for each 2-hour interval of lens wear. A
      12-hour lens-free wear period preceded each phase.
