    
      A4250PBCpruritus (EudraCT 2014-004070-42) is an open-label exploratory study.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of A4250, 1.5 -
      3 mg orally during a four-week treatment period, in patients with PBC and cholestatic
      pruritus, as determined by the occurrence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events
      (SAEs).

      Other safety objectives of this study include assessment of the safety and tolerability of
      A4250 during a four-week treatment period, as determined by the occurrence of
      treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and changes in other safety parameters including
      liver and kidney function tests and vital signs.

      Exploratory efficacy objectives of this study are to demonstrate the efficacy of A4250 orally
      on pruritus variables and on QoL and lysophosphatidic acid formation as well as evaluation of
      changes in pharmacodynamic parameters of bile acid metabolism such as serum and fecal bile
      acids, C4 and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) assessments and assessment of surrogate
      markers of cholestatic liver disease such as alkaline phosphatase, transaminases and
      bilirubin.
