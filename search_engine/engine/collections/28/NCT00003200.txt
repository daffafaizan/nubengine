      radiotherapy regimen in which radiotherapy and Taxotere will be combined after having
      received induction chemotherapy. Taxotere has never been given together with radiotherapy,
      the highest dose of Taxotere that can be safely used in this setting in unknown. Taxotere
      will be added to radiotherapy gradually as each subsequent group of 3-5 patients gets a
      larger dose. Taxotere doses will be increased until certain toxicities occur. This will help
      investigators determine the best way to combine Taxotere with radiotherapy and to use that
      knowledge to treat other patients with tumors like yours.
