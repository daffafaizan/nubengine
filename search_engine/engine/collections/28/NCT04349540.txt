      patients. Adult and paediatric patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation who are admitted to hospital with a proven severe COVID19 infection will be
      eligible for the study. Within 72 hrs of admission, a 10 ml clotted blood (5 mls for pts
      below 15 kg weight) will be collected and serum frozen at -80 C. This sample will be sent
      with a 10ml blood sample (5 mls for pts below 15 kg weight) in EDTA to the Immunology
      Laboratories at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London for centralized cytokine and
      lymphocyte subset analysis. The sample will be divided into 2 aliquots, one being analyzed
      directly, the second one being frozen for further assays as developed. Other immunological
      and biochemical parameters will be tested locally and results with local reference ranges
      will be collected for the purpose of the current study.

      In case the patient deteriorates further from the respiratory perspective requiring either
      CPAP or mechanical ventilation, a second 5 ml serum sample may be collected, frozen at -80 C
      and sent to GOSH for repeated cytokine analysis.

      HScore will be calculated as per published data but bone marrow aspiration will be optional
      in calculating the scoring given the expected acute clinical situation of the patient.
      (Fardet et al, Arthritis Rheumatol 2014).

      Transplant research team members will collect demographic and clinical characteristics at the
      time samples are sent to GOS. Blood results, data on clinical course, therapy (including
      biological agents) and outcome data will be collected with a follow up survey 30 and 100 days
      after start of supplemental oxygen therapy for COVID19 infection.
