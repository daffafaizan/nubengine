      evaluating senior patients who have fallen. Clinical decision rules are a common method for
      standardizing diagnostic decision-making and minimizing misdiagnosis in the ED. Each patient
      will be assessed at their index ED visit by an emergency physician who will record history
      and examination findings. The primary outcome will be clinically important intracranial
      bleeding diagnosed with 42 days. Patients who return to the ED within 42 days with new
      confusion, headache, loss of balance, repeat falls, change in behaviour, reduced Glasgow Coma
      Scale score or other neurological symptoms will also undergo head CT. All intracranial
      bleeding events will be adjudicated independently.
