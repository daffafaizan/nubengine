    
      IgA nephropathy is the most prevalent primary glomerular disease worldwide and an important
      cause of end stage renal disease. Clinical course varies from long term stable renal
      functions with minimal proteinuria and microscopic hematuria to rapidly progressive
      glomerulonephritis with crescents on renal biopsy which progresses to end stage renal disease
      in a very short time.

      In current practice the diagnosis is made with renal biopsy. A less invasive procedure for
      diagnosis is not present and no serum biomarkers for clinical follow-up, treatment response
      and prognosis are available. For that reason follow-up of the disease is enabled with
      indirect markers of renal function like proteinuria, serum creatinine and glomerular
      filtration rate. These markers are not specific for IgA nephropathy. The lack of disease
      specific markers hinders the standardization of patient follow-up and treatment. Development
      of specific and sensitive, repeatable, histopathological and clinical markers for diagnosis,
      follow up and treatment response in IgA nephropathy the most prevalent primary glomerular
      disease affecting many patients worldwide will offer prospects of diagnosis and improved
      prognostication.
