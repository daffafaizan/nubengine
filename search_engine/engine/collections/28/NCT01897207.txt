      antigen-specific T cell responses in cancer patients. However, tumor escape with
      down-regulation or complete loss of target antigens may limit the susceptibility of tumor
      cells to the immune attack. Concomitant generation of T cell responses against several
      immunodominant antigens may circumvent this potential drawback. In this phase I/II clinical
      trial, the investigators determined the immunostimulatory capacity of autologous DC pulsed
      with multiple T cell epitopes derived from four different prostate-specific antigens in
      patients with advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Autologous DC of
      HLA-A*0201-positive patients are loaded with antigenic peptides derived from prostate stem
      cell antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, prostate-specific membrane antigen, and
      prostate-specific antigen. A strict quality control concerning the expression of surface
      markers and the migratory capacity of the DC secured optimal stimulatory capacity. DC were
      applied intradermally six times at biweekly intervals followed by monthly booster injections.
      Tolerability and PSA response will be investigated. Antigen-specific immune responses will be
      quantified.
