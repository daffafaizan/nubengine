      at school setting over the past 14 years.

      Aims The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there has been a change of
      criteria for tooth extraction at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) from 2005
      to 2018. The primary outcome is the change of mean of radiographic interproximal bone loss of
      extracted teeth. The secondary outcomes are changes of other parameters (periodontal,
      endodontic and restorative) of extracted teeth and reasons for extraction.

      Hypothesis Criteria for extraction of first molar teeth has changed between 2005 and 2018
      toward early extraction of teeth with less severe periodontal and other conditions.

      Significance Currently, there is not study presenting the quantified data for criteria change
      for tooth extraction. Also, determining whether to extract a tooth or not actually requires
      taking several clinical parameters into consideration. The present study will give clinicians
      a broad review of the change in clinical decision making for tooth extraction.

      Materials and Methods Retrospective chart review among patients in TUSDM Pre-doctoral and
      Post-doctoral Group Practices The study setting is among patients who received dental
      treatments at TUSDM. The database will be retrospectively reviewed by patients' electronic
      records in TUSDM Postgraduate (PG) and Undergraduate (UG) clinics from 01/01/2005 till
      12/31/2018.
