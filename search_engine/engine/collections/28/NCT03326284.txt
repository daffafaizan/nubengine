      meal in relation to enhancing muscle protein synthesis and thereby counteract muscle loss
      during weight loss.

      The hypothesis is that the optimum dose of protein for women on a hypocaloric diet will be
      greater than when women eat an energy sufficient diet, and also higher than the optimal dose
      previously determined in weight stable men.

      Methods: Forty women (~ 50 years) will be randomized to four groups. Following a five day
      hypocaloric diet (three groups) or an energy balanced diet (one group). The women will report
      to the laboratory to ingest one of three different protein doses. The muscle protein response
      to the different doses of protein will be determined by the muscle protein fractional
      synthetic rates using tracer kinetics.
