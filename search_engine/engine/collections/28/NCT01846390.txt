      in combination with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) without causing very
      severe side effects that are not tolerable. This is done by starting at a dose lower than the
      one that does not cause side effects in animals. Patients are given romidepsin and GDP and
      watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are
      not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then more patients are asked to join the
      study and are given a higher dose of romidepsin (with GDP). Patients joining the study later
      on will get higher doses of romidepsin (with GDP) than patients who join earlier. This will
      continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher
      than that will not be given.
