      receiving treatment, subjects were observed for a minimum of 4 hours, after which they could
      be discharged from the study center if they reported onset of symptom relief. Starting from 4
      hours after treatment, subjects who reported insufficient or no symptom relief could receive
      a second dose of double-blind treatment (called "rescue medication") as follows: C1-INH 20
      U/kg bw for subjects initially receiving placebo, C1-INH 10 U/kg bw for subjects initially
      receiving C1-INH 10 U/kg bw, and placebo for subjects initially receiving C1-INH 20 U/kg bw.

      The study was defined to be successful if the primary outcome measure and at least one of the
      secondary outcome measures were met in the comparison between the C1-INH 20 U/kg bw group and
      the Placebo group.
