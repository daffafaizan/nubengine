      (CBCT), a contemplative technique based on the Tibetan Buddhist tradition of compassion
      meditation, for enhancing immune restoration and psychological resilience in people living
      with HIV-1 (PLHIV). Psychosocial stress has been associated with increased circulating
      concentrations of key inflammatory biomarkers. The patients with HIV must cope with the
      physical impact of HIV disease itself, the often complex treatment regimens and side effects
      of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), illness-associated psychological and existential
      dilemmas, changes in social roles and lifestyle patterns relative to illness progression,
      social stigma, and financial and material resource concerns. This study aims to determine if
      engagement with CBCT is associated with reduced circulating concentrations of stress-related
      inflammatory biomarkers, improves HIV-related clinical outcomes and decreases stress in
      PLHIV.
