      before the intervention, after the intervention and at one month follow-up.

      Participants will be students and will be randomized into three groups using a randomization
      program. The first group will be the gaming with coaching group, the second group will bw the
      gaming without coaching group and the third group will be the control group.

      Measurements will be performed before receiving the game, after the intervention and at one
      month follow-up. We will measure depression, anxiety, stress and well-being as primary
      outcomes, solution focus orientation as secondary outcome and rational and irrational
      cognitions as mechanism outcome. All questionnaires will be completed online in a Google
      Form.

      The intervention will consist of the Rethink game. Rethink is a therapeutic game developed
      and tested to improve emotional abilities in children. Participants in our study will test
      two levels of Rethink as well as a trial version of the game. Each level of the game is
      focused on a component:

        -  Level 1: recognition of emotions

        -  Level 2: relaxation and mindfulness

        -  Level 3: rational and irrational cognitions

        -  Level 4:changing the cognitions

        -  Level 5: problem-solving

        -  Level 6: positive emotions

        -  Level 7: summary of previous aqusitions
