    
      Upon patient arrival to endoscopy suite heart rate (HR), pre-procedure baseline blood
      pressure (BP), and pre-procedure oxygen saturation (SPO2) via pulse oximeter are recorded in
      endoscopy holding area, patient alertness and orientation assessed (respond to name, know the
      state, know the hospital, know the year, know the season).

      Once the subject enters the endoscopy suite monitors are placed to record starting BP, HR,
      SPO2 recorded, nasal cannula with end tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) monitor attached, and 5-lead
      ECG.

      Following time out patient given 100mg Lidocaine IV bolus, 1-minute delay, then
      study-provided syringe administered. Once patient assessed to produce an RSS score >5 (Asleep
      with sluggish response to glabellar tap or NO response) endoscopy proceeds.

      Recorder (blinded) notes if initially provided syringe alone was enough to produce an RSS >5,
      notes subject's response to endoscopy insertion (presence or absence of gagging), notes
      amount of additional propofol required to maintain adequate conditions to continue endoscopy,
      records non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) at 3-minute intervals, notes for level of airway
      obstruction (obstruction with continued air movement, obstruction requiring chin lift or jaw
      thrust for relief, obstruction requiring progression to assisted ventilation or intubation),
      notes for desaturation events (SPO2 <90% with a coherent waveform).

      At the end of the procedure the total anesthesia time is recorded, total procedure
      start-to-finish time recorded, total dose of propofol recorded, and any incidence of patient
      agitation noted.

      Once in recovery the recovery room admission HR, SPO2, NIBP recorded followed by admission
      +15 minutes HR, SPO2, and NIBP, any incidence of desaturation (<90% SPO2 with waveform)
      recorded, incidence of airway obstruction (with air movement, requiring airway maneuver,
      requiring intervention) recorded, time until patient is alert and oriented recorded (response
      to name, able to state what state they are in, able to state what hospital they are in, able
      to state the year, able to state the season), time-until-recovered recorded (Modified Aldrete
      Score > 9), incidence of nausea prior to recovery recorded, incidence of vomiting prior to
      recovery recorded, incidence of agitation or delirium prior to recovery recorded.
