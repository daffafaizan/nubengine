      assess the feasibility and safety of intratumoral DaRT seeds implantation for the treatment
      of local prostate cancer prior to surgery.

      This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used
      in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that
      will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in
      patients.

      Prostate lesions with histopathological confirmation of adenocarcinoma will be treated using
      DaRT seeds in a neo-adjuvant setting.

      Feasibility will be assessed by the successful delivery of DaRT seeds into the intratumoral
      environment. In addition, objective response rate will be assessed both by imaging and
      pathology.
