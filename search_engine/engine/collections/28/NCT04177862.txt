      Upon arrival in the ambulatory surgery center (ASC) post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) if the
      patient has a pain score of 4 or greater they will then be randomized to one of two groups.
      Group 1 will receive 50 mcg of IV fentanyl and group 2 will receive 30 mcg of sublingual
      sufentanil. The primary outcome assessed will be time of readiness to discharge after arrival
      in the post-anesthesia care unit.
