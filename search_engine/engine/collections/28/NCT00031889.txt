        -  Compare the efficacy and tolerability of exemestane with or without bicalutamide as
           second-line therapy after failure of androgen suppression (luteinizing hormone-releasing
           hormone agonist or orchiectomy) in patients with stage IV prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the potential antagonistic effect of the weak androgen action of exemestane
           when combined with bicalutamide in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life (QOL) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate prostate-specific antigen response and data of QOL, including scores for pain
           intensity and analgesic consumption, in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 vs 1-2), pain (none or mild vs moderate or severe), and participating
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive exemestane as in arm I and oral bicalutamide once daily.

      Treatment in both arms continues every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline, on day 1 of course 2 and any subsequent
      courses, and at disease progression or treatment failure (if applicable).

      Patients are followed monthly until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-62 patients (10-31 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
