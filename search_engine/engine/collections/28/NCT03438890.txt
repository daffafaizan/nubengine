      experiments outlining the role of temperature and humidity. Despite many efforts, including
      uses of warm saline, various anti-fog agents, chlorhexidine, betadine, and rubbing the lens
      on serosal surfaces, to reduce LLF, there remains no consensus as to which method is superior
      to prevent LLF. Furthermore, most previous studies were experimental trials conducted in a
      simulation model or a non-human in vivo model or an expert's commentary based on their
      clinical experiences , and there was no randomized controlled trial focusing LLF in human
      model. Therefore, this randomized trial aimed to compare three popular methods of minimizing
      or reducing LLF by heating lens using warm saline, applying anti-fog agent to lens, and
      rubbing lens with chlorhexidine in laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.
