      To study the efficacy of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and
      angiotensin-receptor blockade (ARB) combination therapy as compared to ACE-I monotherapy and
      usual vs. low blood pressure targets on the percent change in kidney volume in participants
      with preserved renal function (GFR >60 mL/min/1.73m2)and high-normal blood pressure or
      hypertension (>130/80 mm Hg).

      * Hypotheses to be tested in Study A

      In ADPKD individuals with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure and relatively preserved
      renal function (GFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2), multi-level blockade of the RAAS using ACE-I/ARB
      combination therapy will delay progression of cystic disease as compared to ACE-I
      monotherapy, and a low blood pressure goal will delay progression as compared with standard
      control.
