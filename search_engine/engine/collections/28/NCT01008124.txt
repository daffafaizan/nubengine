      changes in the position of the head such as rolling, looking up, or bending down. BPPV is
      presently thought to be caused by small pieces of debris or crystals becoming displaced
      within the inner ear. It can be treated by moving the patient through a series of positions
      called a maneuver. There are 2 different maneuvers currently used to treat BPPV by the
      clinician called the liberatory maneuver and the canalith repositioning procedure. We would
      like to determine how effective the liberatory maneuver is in the treatment of BPPV compared
      to a placebo maneuver.
