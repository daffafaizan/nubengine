      with disease controlled after at least six months of systemic therapy will be enrolled in the
      study. Patients will be randomized to receive local therapy for oligometastatic sites in
      addition to systemic therapy or systemic therapy alone. Local therapy strategies will include
      surgery, radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation.
