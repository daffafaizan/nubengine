    
      This is a prospective, non-interventional observational study of the management and outcomes
      of patients admitted with SBO in Denmark.

      Relevant clinicopathological demographics will be retrieved from consenting patients' medical
      records. An initial analysis will be performed once these patients have reached 90 days
      follow-up after the start of treatment. The long-term outcomes of treatment will be assessed
      with further analyses at 1, 3 and 5 years follow-up.
