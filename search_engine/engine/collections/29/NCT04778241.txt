      (MOPs) perfomed by mini-implant (MI) screw In improving alignment of mandibular anterior
      teeth. Additionally, the possibility of inducing root resorption, and patient perception of
      pain during the initial phase of treatment.

      Subjects and Methods: Orthodontic patients aged 17-25 years old, non-extraction treatment
      with lower anterior crowding of 4-6 mm using Little's irregularity index. Outcome measures
      included the amount of crowding using Little's irregularity index (LII), apical root
      resorption, and pain perception. The effectiveness of alignment will be tested using t-test,
      while root resorption and pain perception will be tested by the Mann-Whitney U test, and
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P<0.05).
