      Primary

        -  To determine the progression-free survival rate (complete response, partial response,
           and stable disease as defined by RECIST criteria [Response Evaluation Criteria in solid
           Tumors]) at 24 weeks in patients with relapsed or refractory esophageal or
           gastroesophageal junction cancer treated with sunitinib malate.

      Secondary

        -  To explore the predictive role of a hybrid imaging protocol that combines PET/CT
           (Positron emission tomography) scan simultaneously with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.

        -  Correlate quantitative changes in mean vessel density, alterations in tumor cell
           proliferation, and apoptosis in tumor biopsy specimens with clinical outcome in these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate the objective response as defined by RECIST criteria, median overall
           survival, and median progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the toxicities of sunitinib malate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood and tumor tissue sample collection periodically for correlative
      laboratory studies. Tumor tissue samples are assessed by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL for
      detection and quantitation of mean vessel density, proliferating tumor cells, and apoptosis.
      Tumor tissue samples are also assessed by immunohistochemistry for MAPK levels. Blood samples
      are analyzed by ELISA for VEGF, PlGF, sVEGFR2, and sVEGFR3 levels. Patients also undergo
      PET/CT scan and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI periodically for correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 6 months.
