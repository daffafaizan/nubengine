        -  To compare the relative efficacy, as measured by a change in the 6-item Hamilton Rating
           Scale for Depression (HAM-D6), of 20 and 60 minutes of LFMS compared to sham (placebo)
           in subjects with treatment resistant depression (TRD).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine if subjects with TRD may respond to 120 minutes of LFMS.

        -  To determine the persistence of response to LFMS therapy during the observation period.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LFMS.
