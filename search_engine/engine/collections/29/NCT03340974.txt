    
      This is a parallel arm adaptive design phase I-II dose-finding study to determine the optimal
      dose of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT), given either with the
      radiomodulating agent GC4419 or placebo for treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
      Dose-finding will be done using the sequentially adaptive phase I-II Late onset
      Efficacy-Toxicity (LO-ET) trade-off-based design [1-3].

      A maximum of 48 patients will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A or Arm B. Patients in Arm A will
      receive GC4419 in combination with their assigned SBRT dose, and patients in Arm B will
      receive Placebo (PBO) with their assigned SBRT dose. The randomization will be restricted so
      that the sample size within each arm is exactly 24 patients.

      GC4419/placebo will be given intravenously in a one hour infusion. SBRT must be initiated as
      soon as possible upon completion of the GC4419/placebo infusion.

      GC4419/placebo will be given beginning on the first day of radiation and continuing daily,
      concurrent M-F throughout the administration of SBRT

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      â€¢ To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
      when given in combination with placebo or GC4419

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate Progression-free survival (PFS) at MTD for patients treated with SBRT given
           in combination with placebo or GC4419

        -  To evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR) including stable disease, partial/ complete
           response for patients treated with SBRT given in combination with placebo or GC4419

        -  To evaluate late (12 month) toxicity of SBRT in combination with placebo or GC4419
