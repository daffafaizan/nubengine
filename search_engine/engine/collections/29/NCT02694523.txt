           Part B

        -  Adalimumab nonresponders (<PASI 50 at Week 16) switched to risankizumab in Part B;

        -  Adalimumab responders (PASI 90 at Week 16) continued to received adalimumab in Part B;

        -  Adalimumab inadequate responders (PASI 50 to <PASI 90) were rerandomized to receive
