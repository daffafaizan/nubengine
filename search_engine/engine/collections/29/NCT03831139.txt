      European-Americans regarding academic outcomes, mental health, and physical health like
      cardiovascular health exist. While these domains are often treated as unrelated, they
      influence each other in a way that the disparity in one variable increases the likelihood for
      disparity in the others. Depression, a very common mental health problem, plays a central
      role by impacting academic outcomes and cardiovascular health. Thus, a program that
      successfully reduces the likelihood for youths to develop depression should also reduce
      problems with academic outcomes and physical health and therefore reduce disparity in all
      three domains. Unfortunately, research demonstrates that European-American youth benefit more
      from programs preventing the development of depression than their African-American peers.
      Thus, the main goals of this research project are to (a) identify mechanisms that may result
      in differential prevention program effectiveness across youth race groups, and (b) adapt such
      a program (TIM&SARA) so youth from diverse racial backgrounds benefit similarly.

      In this project, the depression prevention program TIM&SARA will be implemented as part of
      the normal school curriculum for freshmen in an urban high-school. The differential effects
      of the program on African-American and European-American youths will be examined using
      surveys and biological data in saliva.
