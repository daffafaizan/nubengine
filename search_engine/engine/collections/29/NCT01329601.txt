      methods stage-related, reproducible, relevant to everyday life group training in German for
      people with aMCI and slightly severe AD and compared with a - in terms of goal variables - to
      be less effective prestigious intervention . It is believed that the "active treatment" - in
      the intervention group, the overall level of functioning can longer be maintained and that
      positive transfer effects on non-cognitive level - to achieve and cognitive level - here at
      nationals. In addition, information is expected that the conversion rate of people with
      dementia and aMCI cut to a further loss of independence in humans can be delayed slightly
      with severe AD. The project aims to provide data to estimate the effect sizes of intervention
      can be determined on the basis of group size and duration of ongoing investigations.

      Involving functional imaging measures, the intervention study, an adequate platform for the
      detection of intervention effects on neurobiological basis using fMRI dar. Here, the cerebral
      blood flow in specific activation as a measure of neuronal and synaptic activity and
      integrity both in cross-section of a subsample of healthy elderly people studied determined
      and changes in cerebral activity patterns in people with severe AD, aMCI or slightly in
      comparison pre-/post interventions. There are detectable much earlier in the pathogenesis of
      functional changes as structural, using fMRI, the study is to make a significant contribution
      to prove whether a modular cognitive intervention altered neural and synaptic activity and
      whether this change is accompanied by an improvement in cognitive performance.

      A complete and proven effectiveness of cognitive group training could make a significant
      contribution that people with MCI and severe AD easily submit their own initiative mental
      condition, and add itself to sustain the intellectual, emotional and social potential. As a
      long-term perspective, the results for the optimization of cognitive intervention programs
      and continue to implement the organizations of the open and contribute stationary the elderly
      and specialized medical facilities and other medical facilities.
