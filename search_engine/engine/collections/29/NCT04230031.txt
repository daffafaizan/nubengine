    
      This is a single arm, two-stage, phase II study to evaluate the rate of â‰¥ Complete Response
      (CR) post-Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) in Multiple Myeloma (MM) subjects who failed
      to achieve at least a Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) post initial induction therapy for
      newly diagnosed disease, and for whom an ASCT is planned. Subjects will be treated with four
      weekly doses of daratumumab before mobilization for Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells (HPC)
      collection, followed by high dose chemotherapy and ASCT and four weekly doses of daratumumab
      after ASCT. A two-stage design will be implemented. Twenty three (23) subjects will be
      enrolled in the first stage, and if at least 12 of the 23 subjects have at least a CR after
      ASCT, an additional 16 subjects will be enrolled in the second stage (a total of 39
      subjects).
