      patients with chronic hepatitis C.

      - Treatment strategy: Vitamin D Arm: Vitamin D over a 4 weeks lead-in phase followed by
      Vitamin D in combination with PEG-INF plus RBV during 48 weeks. Standard of Care Arm: PEG-INF
      plus RBV during 48 weeks.

      - Main outcome: Proportion of patients with Sustained Virological Response (SVR) as defined
      by HCV RNA below the detection limit based on quantitative PCR 12 weeks after stopping
      treatment.

        -  Sample Size: 520 patients (260 per arm)

        -  Enrollment period: 12 months

        -  Patient's participation duration: 62 weeks (SOC Arm), 66 weeks (Vit-D Arm)

        -  Statistical analysis:

      The superiority of the vitamin D arm will be tested against the standard PEG IFN + RBV
      combination. 260 patients in each arm will give 80% power to document a 12% difference in the
      SVR rates between the experimental (Vitamin D) and the control (standard treatment) arms..

      A futility analysis is planned for this study, in order to be able to interrupt the trial
      prematurely in case preliminary results show a lack of efficacy of vitamin D.

      This analysis will be performed on half of the patients, thus 260 patients (130 patients per
      arm), on a week 12/14 week criterion (HCV RNA viral load at W12/W14).
