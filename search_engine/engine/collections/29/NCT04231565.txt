      national health. Current clinical guidelines do not recommend antiviral therapy for people
      with positive hepatitis b-DNA and normal Alanine Aminotransferase, but studies have found
      that viral replication is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and liver tumors.
      Nucleoside (acid) analogues can effectively inhibit viral reverse transcriptase, reduce HBV
      viral load in the blood, thereby reducing secondary inflammation, and contribute to liver
      cell regeneration and disease recovery. And its side effect is small, adverse reaction rate
      is low, use safety.
