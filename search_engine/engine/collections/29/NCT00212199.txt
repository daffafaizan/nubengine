      implement especially in a primary health-care setting where time is especially limited. Brief
      interventions that might provide benefits similar to those produced by more time-intensive
      and costly lifestyle interventions would be very useful. There is also increasing interest in
      the efficacy of primary drug therapies for obesity. The purpose of this 12-month study, and
      24-month follow-up, is to examine the efficacy of a brief behavioral counseling intervention
      alone or in combination with a drug already approved for the long-term management of obesity
      (orlisat)and compare both interventions to a drug alone condition.
