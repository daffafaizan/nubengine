      repeat revascularization compared to using bare metal stents (BMS). Therefore, DES
      implantation has been default strategy in the treatment of coronary artery disease. However,
      despite use of DES, the restenosis, subsequent repeat revascularization, and associated
      cardiac events (stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction) remain significant clinical problem
      in routine practice, especially complex lesion subsets.

      2110 patients who received successful dug eluting stent implantation will be enrolled at 21
      centers in Korea. Patients meeting inclusion criteria without any exclusion criteria and
      agree to participate in this trial will be randomized 1:1 to a) triple therapy
      (Aspirin+Clopidogrel +Cilostazol) or b) dual therapy group (Aspirin+ Clopidogrel +Placebo).
      All patients will be blindly assigned to cilostazol 100mg (1tablet bid) or matching placebo
      (1tablet bid) as 1:1 ratio and are prescribed for 1 year.
