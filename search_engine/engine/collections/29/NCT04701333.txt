      leakage following second-trimester perinatal loss and abortion can cause both physical pain
      and emotional distress. Dopamine agonists have previously been shown to be effective in
      lactation inhibition for third-trimester fetal/neonatal loss or contraindications to
      breastfeeding. In a head-to-head trial, cabergoline was more effective with a better safety
      profile than bromocriptine and has thus emerged as preferred treatment for term lactation
      inhibition internationally. Despite the frequency of breast symptoms after second-trimester
      abortions, there are no current guidelines for this population.

      The investigators are conducting a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, superiority trial of
      participants undergoing abortion or experiencing intrauterine fetal demise between 18 and
      28-weeks gestation at Stanford Health Care. Participants will be randomized to either
      cabergoline 1mg or placebo the day of procedure. Participants will complete the Bristol
      Breast Inventory, a survey to assess symptoms and side-effects at baseline and Day 2, 3, 4,
      7, and 14 after the procedure. A score of zero means no symptoms, a score of five reflects a
      participant that is highly symptomatic.

      The primary outcome is breast symptoms on Day 4 as reported on the Bristol Breast Inventory.
      Secondary outcomes include satisfaction, acceptability, and side-effects. Investigators
      hypothesize that cabergoline is superior to placebo for preventing breast engorgement after
      second-trimester abortion or loss. A sub-study of 10 participants will return for serum
      prolactin levels on Days 2, 4, 7, 14.
