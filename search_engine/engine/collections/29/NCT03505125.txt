      Phenylalanine levels in adults with Phenylketonuria (PKU). Because these individuals often
      exhibit inattention and mood difficulties, and blood Phe concentration affects cognition and
      mood, life-long blood Phe control with pegvaliase may improve cognitive abilities and
      emotional and mental health in patients with PKU. In order to adequately quantify potential
      pegvaliase treatment impact on cognition and mood, it is necessary to employ clinical outcome
      assessments (COAs) that are fit for purpose and that comprehensively address concepts
      important, relevant, and meaningful to PKU patients. This is an observational study to
      identify symptom, function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) concepts of interest
      (COIs) to patients with PKU and to seek additional patient, observer, and expert input on the
      appropriateness of concepts of BioMarin's proposed COAs for use in future efficacy trials in
      PKU.
