      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of dasatinib combined with lapatinib.

      II. To describe the toxicities associated with this treatment combination. III. To assess the
      pharmacokinetic interaction of lapatinib and dasatinib. IV. To assess the effect of the
      lapatinib and dasatinib combination on circulating tumor cells and on osteoclast precursor
      activation.

      V. To study the association of clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) with the
      pharmacokinetic parameters, and/or biologic (pharmacodynamic) results.

      VI. To describe the responses of this treatment combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study. COHORT I: Patients receive
      oral dasatinib and oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-28.

      COHORT II: Patients receive oral dasatinib once daily on days 1 and 9-28 and oral lapatinib
      ditosylate once daily on days 2-28 of course 1. In all subsequent courses patients receive
      oral dasatinib and oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-28.

      In both cohorts courses repeat every 28 days, in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 3 months.
