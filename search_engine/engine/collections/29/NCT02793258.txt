    
      Methods: 40 subjects with major depression (20 active treatment and 20 placebo) will receive
      ten 30-minutes sessions of active two milliamps or sham tDCS (anode over left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex and cathode over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), twice a day for 5
      consecutive days. Psychometric assessment of depression (MADRS,Beck Depression Inventory ,
      CGI) and a neuropsychological assessment will be conducted before and after the treatment.

      A facial emotion recognition task and an attentional emotional task with measurement of
      eye-tracking, heart rate, respiratory frequency and skin conductance will be conducted before
      and after the first session, and after the last session.

      The investigators hypothesize that active tDCS will improve emotional processing in major
      depression, and that this will be observed after 1 and 10 sessions of tDCS.

      Conclusions: Studying the impact of transcranial direct current stimulation on emotional
      processing in major depression could allow to better understand its antidepressant mechanisms
