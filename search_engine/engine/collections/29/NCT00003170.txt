      related diarrhea in patients receiving pelvic external beam radiation therapy as adjuvant or
      primary treatment of malignancy. II. Determine whether glutamine can reduce chronic treatment
      related enteropathy following completion of therapy. III. Determine whether glutamine causes
      any toxicity in this situation. IV. Provide initial reliability and validity data for a
      patient bowel function questionnaire.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Patients are
      stratified by history of anterior resection of the rectum (yes vs no); total planned
      cumulative dose, including boost fields of external beam radiotherapy (4500-5350 cGy vs
      5350-6000 cGy vs greater than 6000 cGy); use of fluorouracil (none vs bolus vs continuous
      infusion); and primary site (rectal cancer vs prostate cancer vs gynecological cancer vs
      other). Beginning the first or second day of radiotherapy, patients receive either oral
      glutamine or a placebo twice daily, including the days that they do not receive radiotherapy.
      Patients continue on treatment throughout radiotherapy and continue 2 weeks postradiotherapy
      or until grade 3 diarrhea occurs. Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks, then at 12
      months, and then at 24 months after radiotherapy.
