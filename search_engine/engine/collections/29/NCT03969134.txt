    
      This study is a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial designed to assess the
      therapeutic efficacy and safety of CHAd63-KH, a new candidate Leishmania vaccine, in patients
      with persistent PKDL. 100 participants will be randomly assigned (50 participants in each
      arm) to receive placebo or ChAd63-KH 7.5 x10(10)vp intramuscular injection into the deltoid
      region. Doses will be administered at a single time point. Volunteers aged between 12-50
      years with persistent PKDL will be recruited at Professor El-Hassan's Centre for Tropical
      Medicine, Dooka, Gedarif State, Sudan, and will be followed up for 120 days after the dosing
      visit. The trial is planned to run for 24 months.

      Secondary objectives are as follows:

        1. To compare the humoral and cellular immune responses generated by the candidate vaccine
           in patients with persistent PKDL.

        2. To observe any clinical changes in the cutaneous PKDL disease over a 120 day period
           following vaccination
