    
      This open label study is to evaluate the ability of a wrist-worn accelerometry device to
      detect scratch and sleep quantity changes in patients with Atopic Dermatitis (AD) receiving
      Standard of Care (SOC) treatment. Subjects, age 2 to 75 years, with symptomatic AD will be
      recruited.

      The study will be comprised of an initial screening/baseline clinic visit when subject will
      be diagnosed with symptomatic AD, screened and enrolled in the study after signing an
      informed consent (or parents/guardians and assent when appropriate). The subject will start
      or modify a SOC treatment course at the physician's discretion, and thereafter will be
      followed up for a total of 2 weeks for the purposes of the study. During those 2 weeks, the
      subject will wear two wrist worn accelerometry devices. The subject will also have to
      complete daily PRO/ObsRO related to itch, sleeping habits, quality of life, and device
      comfort questionnaires (parent/guardian will complete as appropriate) and may also
      participate in an optional daily photography taken of a single lesion (optional and for adult
      subjects only 18-75 years of age). The subject will also be asked to come and stay overnight
      at the sleep clinic for an overnight between Days 1-3, for thermal video recording overnight.
      An optional additional night (immediately following the first clinic overnight; between days
      2-4) with video and polysomnography (PSG) may occur (subjects must be 18-75 years of age to
      participate in this aspect of the study). The subjects will be asked to return to the clinic
      on days 8 and 15 for clinician-based assessments. At the completion of the study, Day 15 (+3
      day) the subjects will return the devices, and will complete PRO/ObsRO questionnaires.
