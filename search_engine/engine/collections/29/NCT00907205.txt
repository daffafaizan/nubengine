    
      SF1126 is a conjugate containing a vascular targeted pan-PI3K inhibitor that selectively
      inhibits all PI3K class I isoforms and other key members of the PI3K superfamily, including
      mTORC1/2, DNA-PK, PLK-1, CK2, ATM and PIM-1. SF1126 is designed to inhibit both angiogenesis
      and cell proliferation by targeting and binding to specific integrins such as αγβ3 that are
      expressed on the surface of new tumor vasculature and within the tumor compartment. In
      preclinical xenograft models SF1126 has demonstrated broad activity as a single agent;
      synergy with commonly used chemotherapy agents, targeted agents, and radiation; and has been
      shown to reverse resistance mediated through the PI3K/PTEN pathway.
