      metastases using stereotactic radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiotherapy is referred to as
      "targeted therapy". It uses special equipment to position the patient and guide the focused
      beams of radiation toward the cancer and away from normal surrounding tissue. This higher
      dose technique may work better to kill cancer cells with fewer side effects than standard
      radiation therapy.
