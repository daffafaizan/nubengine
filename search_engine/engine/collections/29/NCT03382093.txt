      personalized computer-delivered transdiagnostic intervention (PFI) that addresses smoking and
      anxiety sensitivity (AS) to reduce smoking, increase quit attempts, reduce perceived barriers
      to cessation, reduce AS and negative affective symptoms, and increase adaptive coping skills
      compared to a smoking information only control. To address this aim, we will implement a
      randomized controlled trial that will employ a longitudinal experimental design and involve
      three stages: (a) phone-screener (pre-screener); (b) baseline appointment consisting of a
      pre-intervention assessment (eligibility), random assignment to a one-session
      computer-delivered intervention (PFI versus smoking information control with no personalized
      feedback), and a post-intervention assessment; (c) 1-month follow-up. Assessments will
      include a multi-method approach, including biological, behavioral, and self-report methods.
