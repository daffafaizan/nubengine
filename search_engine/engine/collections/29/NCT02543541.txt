    
      Primary Objective(s): To assess symptoms, adverse events, duration on study, reason for study
      discontinuation, and quality of life among patients participating in phase I clinical trials
      who receive structured palliative care, and those who receive standard supportive care.
      Duration on study will serve as the primary objective for sample size determination.

      Secondary Objective(s):

      1. To describe the quantity (e.g. hours), type, and cost of palliative care personnel
      services used by patients and caregivers receiving structured palliative care.

      Exploratory:

        1. To compare adverse event profiles, duration on study, and quality of life between
           patients who receive structured palliative care and those receiving standard supportive
           care.

        2. To compare caregiver burden and quality of life between the study arms.
