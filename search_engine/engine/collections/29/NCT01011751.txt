      and venlafaxine. Cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and venlafaxine are being
      tested to treat men who suffer from hot flushes due to androgen suppression treatment for
      prostate cancer. This study will look at the frequency and severity of hot flushes caused by
      leuprorelin in participants who will take cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate or
      venlafaxine. The study will randomize approximately 311 participants. All participants will
      receive 2 injections of leuprorelin 11.35 mg at Months 0 and 3 along with flutamide tablets
      in the first month of treatment to prevent flare-up. After 6 months, eligible participants
      will receive third injection of leuprorelin and will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the
      study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Cyproterone acetate (Androcur® 50 mg)

        -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Gestoral® 10 mg)

        -  Venlafaxine (Effexor® LP 37.5 mg) All participants will be asked to take 2 capsules in
           the morning and 1 capsule in the evening for 10 weeks. All participants will be asked to
           complete the self-evaluation hot-flushes (HF) questionnaire daily for 12 weeks from the
           start of treatment for hot flushes.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in France. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 9 months. Participants will make 5 visits to the clinic during the
      study.
