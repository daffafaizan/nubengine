      China. Only a few days later, Chinese health authorities confirmed that this group was
      associated with the coronavirus and that the disease caused by it was named Coronavirus
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. Confirmed by comparative homology analysis, COVID-19 is
      closely associated with the bat-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus
      (bat-SL-covzc45 and bat-SL-covzxc21, with 88% identity), but it is a far cry from coronavirus
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) (about 79%) and coronavirus from respiratory
      syndrome of the Middle East (MERS-CoV) (about 50%). The National Health Commission of the
      People's Republic of China reported a total of 77,658 confirmed cases, including 9,162 with
      serious illnesses and 2,663 deaths as of February 25, 2020.ç

      The new pathogen β-coronavirus was initially named as the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but on
      January 12, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) named it coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
      Epidemiological reports demonstrated high infectivity from person to person in social,
      family, and hospital settings. Given this rapid increase in new cases worldwide, the WHO
      declared a pandemic state 13 The results of a meta-analysis showed that the most prevalent
      clinical symptom was fever (91.3%, 95% CI: 86-97%), followed by cough (67.7%, 95% CI:
      59-76%), fatigue (51.0%, 95% CI: 34-68%) and dyspnea (30.4%, 95% CI: 21-40%). Comorbidities
      included hypertension, diabetes, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease. For
      the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, a suspected or probable case is
      defined as a case that meets: (1) three clinical criteria or (2) two clinical criteria and
      one epidemiological criterion. The clinical criteria are: fever; radiographic evidence of
      pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome; and low or normal white blood cell count or
      low lymphocyte count. Epidemiological criteria are: living in Wuhan or history of travel to
      Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; contact with patients with fever and
      symptoms of respiratory infection within 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; and a link
      to confirmed cases or groups of suspected cases. Defining a confirmed case, for the first
      case in a province, is a suspected or probable case with detection of viral nucleic acid at
      city CDC and provincial CDC. For the second case and all subsequent cases, the definition is
      a suspected or probable case with detection of nucleic acid from the virus at CDC City. We
      defined the cases as symptomatic individuals, which could be detected by means of a control
      temperature across international borders, or who had a disease severity requiring hospital
      admission, or both, plus travel history to Wuhan. 14 In Ecuador in the city of Guayaquil, the
      Minister of Health, on February 29, 2020, confirmed the presence of the first "imported" case
      of Covid-19 in Ecuador. It was an Ecuadorian citizen who arrived from Spain on February 14 at
      the Guayaquil airport, who had no symptoms. Later days she presented discomfort and fever,
      reasons for which she was hospitalized and the respective tests were performed for Covid-19
      disease, which was positive.

      On March 11, 2020, the WHO, the world health organization, officially declares the pandemic
      caused by the SARS VOC-2 virus and in Ecuador the Emergency Operations Committee is
      activated, in relation to this committee the following is detailed. The Emergency Operations
      Committees are components of the Decentralized National Risk Management System, which are
      responsible for planning and maintaining joint coordination and operation between different
      levels and functions of the institutions involved in the response and attention to
      emergencies and disasters in a field territorial defined. On March 12, 2020 two new people
      tested positive. In total, 19 cases of COVID-19 are registered in Ecuador, the following day
      the first person died from the coronavirus (COVID-19) occurred in Ecuador. On March 31, 2020,
      there were 2,240 positive cases for COVID-19, 3,257 suspected, 2,485 discarded from a total
      of 7,982 samples, 75 confirmed deaths; 61 probable deceased and 54 with hospital discharge.
      At the beginning of April 2020, the Minister of Public Health, Juan Carlos Zevallos, in a
      virtual press conference, announced that 100,000 rapid tests and 100,000 PCRs arrived in our
      country that will serve to expedite the results of the exams for COVID-19.

      Until the closing of this project, the records of the MSP indicated that on April 23, 2020,
      there were 11,183 confirmed cases and 560 people dead. The city of Guayaquil with a
      population of more than two million inhabitants with the increase in more positive and
      suspicious cases, became the epicenter of the pandemic at the national level, in this
      framework, the Teodoro Maldonado Carbo Specialty Hospital located at In the south of the
      city, it is a third level hospital, since the aforementioned health crisis began with a high
      influx of patients suspected of covid-19. Current treatment for COVID-19 is supportive, and
      respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of
      mortality. Ruan Q et al. Studied the predictors of mortality in a recent retrospective,
      multicenter study of 150 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, including elevated
      ferritin (mean 1297.6 ng / ml in non-survivors versus 614.0 ng / ml in survivors; p <0 · 001)
      and IL-6 (p <0 · 0001), suggesting that mortality could be due to viral hyperinflammation.
      There is an urgent need for effective treatment. The current focus has been on the
      development of new therapies, which include antivirals and vaccines. Accumulated evidence
      suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 may have cytokine storm syndrome.

      Objectives:

      Determine the safety and efficacy of Viusid + Asbrip in hospitalized patients with COVID-19
      diagnosis.

      Keep security through identification, proper and timely management of adverse events and
      evaluation of biochemical parameters.

      Measure efficacy through clinical improvement: evaluation of radiological signs and blood
      analysis estableshed in this study.
