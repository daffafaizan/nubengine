      oil, measured by blood lipids. Especially the amount of the long chain omega 3
      polyunsaturated fats EPA and DHA will be tested. An omega 3 score for whole blood will be
      measured. The omega 3 score is the percent sum of omega 3 fats in the blood.

      The hypothesis is that 5 grams of fish oil will increase the amount of EPA and DHA in a
      person's blood to a protective level, and that 30 grams (2 tablespoons) of flax oil will not
      change the blood levels of EPA significantly and not change the blood concentrations of DHA
      at all, even for a person consuming a low omega 6 oil diet and following a vegan diet high in
      fruits and vegetables.

      Most of the testing of flax and fish oil has not been done in vegans. This trial will extend
      this testing to this subpopulation.
