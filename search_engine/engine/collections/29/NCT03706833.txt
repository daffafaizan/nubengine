      effectiveness of transcatheter mitral valve repair with the Edwards PASCAL Transcatheter
      Valve Repair System compared to Abbott MitraClip in patients with degenerative mitral
      regurgitation (DMR) who have been determined to be at prohibitive risk for mitral valve
      surgery by the Heart Team, and in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) on
      guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT)

      Patients will be seen for follow-up visits at discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and annually
