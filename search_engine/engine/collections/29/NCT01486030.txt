    
      This is a prospective, single-center study. This protocol is a pilot study to investigate the
      effects of "acute" exercise (by exercise stress testing; modified Bruce protocol) on
      peripheral gene expression (PGE) levels as measured by Corus CAD score (Age/Sex/Gene
      Expression score - ASGES). Subjects will have blood sampling at baseline, at peak exercise,
      within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise, at 24-36 hours post-exercise. The study will be
      stratified by presence of CAD and gender. An equal number of subjects with known CAD and
      normal controls will be enrolled. Equally, an equal number of men and women will be included.
      A screening CBC and HgbA1c will be performed to ensure the subject meets the intended use
      instruction for Corus CAD (ASGES). Data collection will include presence or absence of ECG
      ischemia with testing, as well as heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise with
      other ECG and dynamic variables. There will be four blood samples taken per subject as shown
      in the figure below.
