      severe, unilateral head pain with associated autonomic symptoms. The goal of acute therapy
      for cluster headache is fast, effective and consistent relief.

      In the currently recommended dosing strategy of continuous flow 100% oxygen given via a
      non-rebreather face mask at 7-15L/min, the time to improvement can sometimes take upwards of
      20-30 minutes and is not effective for all cluster headache sufferers.

      An alternative method of oxygen delivery (versus continuous flow) uses a demand valve which
      is controlled by the respiration rate, allowing increased oxygen flow in response to
      increased demand. This delivery system may be better at stopping a cluster headache attack
      than the continuous flow model as it can support hyperventilation which can enhance cerebral
      arterial vasoconstriction via a state of hyperoxia and hypocapnia. Arterial vasoconstriction
      is one hypothesized method by which oxygen can abort a cluster headache attack.

      This proof of concept trial will evaluate if oxygen delivered via demand valve with a
      specific breathing technique is effective as a cluster headache acute treatment and is more
      effective than the traditional continuous high flow oxygen treatment with a non-rebreather
      face mask.
