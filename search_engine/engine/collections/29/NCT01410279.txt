      of diseases and processes, such as the progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance,
      right heart failure and early death. Frequently patients with PH have reduced functional
      capacity, quality of life and survival. It was demonstrated recently that patients with HP
      also have inspiratory muscle weakness, possibly further increase the fatigue and dyspnea
      during exercise. To meet this need, inspiratory muscle training can lead to significant
      improvement in respiratory muscle strength, exercise tolerance and dyspnea, thus resulting in
      reduction of discomfort during activities of daily living, increase in exercise capacity and
      improved quality of life in different situations.
