      Atopic Dermatitis affecting both sides of the body. Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled to
      participate.

      Subjects will undergo a 2 week washout period prior to the Baseline procedure. Follwoing the
      Baseline visit assessments, subjects will be asked to apply "AO+ Mist" or placebo to the
      affected area of the arm twice a day (morning and night) for 30 days.

      After the 30 day initial study period, subjects will automatically be rolled over to
      participate in the extension of the trial for another 30 days using only AO+Mist on the body
      parts affected by Atopic Dermatitis.
