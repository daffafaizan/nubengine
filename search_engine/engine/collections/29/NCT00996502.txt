    
      In this Phase I/Phase II study, the primary objectives are to establish the maximum tolerated
      dose of docetaxel, erlotinib, bevacizumab, and prednisone in patients with metastatic hormone
      refractory prostate cancer and to determine the efficacy of this regimen for treatment of
      metastatic HRPC. In the phase I portion of the study, eligible patients will be enrolled and
      treated using a "3+3" design. Docetaxel will be started at 55 mg/m2 every cycle (21 days) and
      dose escalated by 10 mg/m2 at each cohort level. The dose of bevacizumab will be held
      constant at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks and erlotinib will be provided at 200 mg PO daily from
      days 216 as described in previous safety studies. All patients will receive prednisone 5 mg
      PO bid. Eighteen patients will be treated in the phase I portion. The phase II dose for this
      combined treatment will be defined as either the highest dosage cohort in which 6 patients
      are treated and there are less than 3 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs); or the combination of
      docetaxel, erlotinib, and bevacizumab at the cohort 3 dose level, whichever is the lower
      dose. Another 37 patients will be enrolled for the phase II study. All patients will receive
      the phase II recommended dose as determined by the phase I portion of the study.
