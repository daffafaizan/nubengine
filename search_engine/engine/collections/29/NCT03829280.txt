      that exceeded $155 billion dollars in fiscal year 2013 alone. Despite existing medication and
      community treatment, many individuals with this diagnosis continue to have poor outcomes and
      struggle toward recovery. CAT is a psychosocial treatment using environmental supports such
      as signs, alarms, pill containers, checklists, technology and the organization of belongings
      established in a person's home or work environment to bypass the cognitive and motivational
      difficulties associated with schizophrenia, and support habits for functional behavior to
      promote recovery. In a series of efficacy studies, CAT improved social and occupational
      functioning, symptoms, and adherence to medication, and reduced rates of readmission. The
      investigators propose a cluster randomized effectiveness trial comparing Cognitive Adaptation
      Training (CAT) to existing community treatment (CT) for individuals with schizophrenia in 8
      community mental health centers across multiple states including 400 participants. This would
      be the first large-scale effectiveness study of CAT for improving functional outcomes for
      those with schizophrenia seen in community mental health centers (CMHCs) where the majority
      of those with schizophrenia are followed for outpatient care and to study the purported
      mechanisms of action based on an integrated theoretical model. Participants will be assessed
      at baseline and 6 and 12 months on measures of functional and community outcome, medication
      adherence, symptoms, habit formation and automaticity, cognition and motivation. CAT
      treatment will be weekly for 6 months, biweekly for 3 months and monthly for the remainder of
      the trial. Purported mechanisms of action for CAT including bypassing impairments in
      cognitive function to improve functional outcome and bypassing motivational impairments to
      create automatic habits to improve functional outcome will be examined.
