    
      Fabry disease is a rare disease and part of the group of lysosomal storage disorders. Natural
      history of Fabry disease has proven poor survival to ages >50 years outlining the importance
      to evaluate cardiac symptoms and outcomes of patients with Fabry disease.

      This study is a prospective cohort study and observes patients since 2001. Through this
      long-term experience and the relative high number of patients this study is suggested to help
      estimating the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) as well as death or
      heart transplantation due to terminal heart failure.

      All patients in treatment in the Fabry Center Wuerzburg (FAZiT) are included in this study if
      informed consent is provided.
