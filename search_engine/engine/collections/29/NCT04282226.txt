      psychophysiological traits including personality and anxiety/depression inventory, each
      subject will have a nasogastric tube inserted with the attached distensible balloon
      positioned in the distal oesophagus. Painful oesophageal stimulation will be achieved by
      inflation of the balloon to a pain threshold pre-determined in each subject, defined as the
      point at which subject describes the transition from sensation to pain. The MR-safe tVNS
      probe will be attached to the neck for cervical vagal nerve-directed tVNS, and subjects will
      then be positioned in the MRI scanner. Real-time activity of the ANS will be monitored by
      heart rate variability as described in the previous study, which has been adapted for use in
      the MR-environment. All subjects will undergo MRI. For each visit, there will be two scanning
      periods. High-resolution structural imaging will first be required, and subsequently resting
      fMRI data will be acquired whilst subjects are asked to relax in the scanner, and their
      baseline autonomic tone is monitored, using validated methods of acquiring ANS data. This
      will illustrate a brain signature of real-time brain activity mapped to their parasympathetic
      tone.

      Subjects will then be randomised to either the active-tVNS paradigm or sham and a second fMRI
      data acquisition will then be performed so as to acquire brain activity in conjunction with
      active and sham-tVNS. Following this, painful oesophageal stimulation will be repeated 20
      times while active or sham tVNS continues. Following a two-week washout period, subjects will
      be crossed over and re-examined to receive the intervention they did not receive in visit 1.
