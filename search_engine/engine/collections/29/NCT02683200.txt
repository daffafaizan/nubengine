      I. To assess the feasibility of utilizing an MRI-guided tri-60Co teletherapy system for liver
      SBRT, as determined the treating radiation oncologist's ability to accurately visualize and
      align to the target lesion(s).

      II. To assess the feasibility of using a three versus five fraction scheme, for one versus
      multiple (i.e., =< 5) target lesions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tumor local control (LC), disease specific survival (DSS), and overall
      survival (OS).

      II. To gather biomarkers that may elucidate differential immunogenic responses from the three
      versus the five fraction SBRT regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MRI-guided Tri-60Co teletherapy SBRT 3-5 fractions over 1-2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 4-6 weeks, and
      then every 3 months for 2 years.
