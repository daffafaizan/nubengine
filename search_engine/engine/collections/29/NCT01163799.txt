      efficacy of Alefacept in combination with Alemtuzumab induction and Myfortic with rapid
      steroid and calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal in de novo Kidney transplant recipients.
      Induction therapy involves single dose Alemtuzumab and steroids peri-operatively. Tacrolimus
      will be administered for the first 30 days post-transplantation. Alefacept will be
      administered IV for the first two doses followed by subcutaneous injections weekly until 12
      weeks post-transplant followed by monthly injections for the rest of the duration of the
      study. The primary outcomes are safety and efficacy outcomes, including biopsy proven acute
      rejection episodes, infectious complications or other serious adverse events. Secondary
      outcomes include T-helper differentiation, cytokine production and T regulatory cell
      generation assessed by immune monitoring assays.
