    
      Specific Aims and Research Questions Aim 1: To compare adolescents' levels of reporting of
      their own reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors using three survey
      methodologies: (1) Face-to-face interview (2) Audio-CASI (Computer Assisted Self Interview)
      and (3) a culturally appropriate interactive methodology.

      The following hypothesis will be tested:

      â€¢ Overall, adolescents will be more likely to divulge their own reproductive knowledge,
      attitudes and behaviors with Audio-CASI and the interactive method as compared to
      face-to-face interviews. Levels of knowledge, attitudes and behaviors will vary by education,
      age and gender.

      Aim 2: To compare respondents' levels of comfort, accuracy and honesty with the survey
      methodologies (i.e. face to face, audio-CASI and interactive methodology) to their reporting
      of knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to sexual and reproductive health.
