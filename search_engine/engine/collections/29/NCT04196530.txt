    
      This clinical trial is a study of an experimental drug called BDB001. BDB001 is a Toll-like
      receptor (TLR) agonist that activates the immune system.

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BDB001 in
      combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq) in subjects with unresectable or metastatic solid
      tumors who have relapsed or are refractory to standard treatment or for whom there is no
      approved therapy.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation/dose expansion Phase 1 study of BDB001 in
      combination with atezolizumab.

      The study will be conducted in two separate but independent parts: a dose escalation part
      with BDB001 and atezolizumab and a dose expansion part of BDB001 in combination with
      atezolizumab.
