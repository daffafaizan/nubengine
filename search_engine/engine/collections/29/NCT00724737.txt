      preoperative decision making for patients who have brain tumors. Before a patient has brain
      surgery to have the tumor removed, functional mapping of the brain takes place either
      intra-operatively or post operatively after a subdural grid implant has been placed. Mapping
      helps the surgeon determine which areas of the brain are responsible for different important
      body functions. During this mapping procedure the surgeon determines if they can safely
      remove all or part of a brain tumor. The investigators are hoping to show that fMRI is just
      as accurate in mapping out different areas of the brain, without having to utilize an
      invasive form of brain mapping.
