      have PSA rising disease only, are asymptomatic, with no evidence of metastatic disease. There
      is no standard of care in this patient population. A standard treatment in this population
      has been the addition of a non-steroidal anti androgen such as bicalutamide. PSA response
      rate (defined as a 50% decrease) have been reported in 20% range with bicalutamide.

      Even in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) and metastases that have no
      cancer related symptoms, initiation of chemotherapy is controversial given the palliative
      nature of chemotherapy and potential for serious toxicity.

      These patients are generally well enough to to undergo trials of novel agents and achieve
      adequate drug exposure, such that any cytostatic effect will be apparent.
