      with the influenza A H5N1 virus, and the mortality is near 60 percent. Optimal therapy is not
      known, and failures of and resistance to currently available anti-virals have been reported.

      The primary purpose of this Protocol is to determine the optimal vaccination schedule that
      creates a pool of hyper immunized individuals with high titer anti-influenza A (H5N1)
      antibodies. The Protocol will consist of a dose escalation study to determine the optimal
      vaccination dose and number of vaccinations. There are stopping rules based on the number and
      severity of adverse events that occur between the doses and between the cohorts. The optimal
      vaccination schedule that is determined could then be used in a larger population to develop
      a high titer anti-influenza A (H5N1) intravenous hyper-immune globulin (IVIG).

      After all vaccinations have occured, and if an adequate antibody titer is reached in this
      study population, subjects will begin apheresis. Each subject will be asked to participate in
      3 apheresis sessions, but may participate in up to 10 apheresis sessions.
