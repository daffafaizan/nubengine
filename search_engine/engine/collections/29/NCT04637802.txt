      acute and chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP), with 80% of youth reporting intense acute pain
      after hospital discharge, and up to half reporting CPSP up to one year after spine surgery.
      Interventions to improve recovery and reduce pain after surgery have potential to interrupt a
      negative trajectory of suffering and disability associated with chronic pain. Our specific
      aims are: Primary: (1) Determine effectiveness of a pre-operative mHealth psychosocial
      intervention to improve acute pain outcomes in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal
      surgery, (2) Determine effectiveness of a post-operative mHealth psychosocial intervention to
      improve chronic pain outcomes at 3 months in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal
      surgery, (3) Determine the combined effects of pre- and post-operative psychosocial
      intervention on chronic pain outcomes. Secondary: (1) Determine effectiveness of
      pre-operative psychosocial intervention to reduce opioid use during the 14 days following
      hospital discharge, (2) Determine effectiveness of psychosocial intervention to improve
      health-related quality of life following surgery.
