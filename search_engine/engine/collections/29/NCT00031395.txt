      methylphenidate (MPH)-used alone or in combination to treat ADHD in children. MPH is
      FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in children, and clonidine is FDA-approved
      for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Stimulant medications such as MPH are known to
      be safe and effective for the treatment of many ADHD symptoms. Such medicines, however, do
      not cure the condition or improve all of the symptoms of ADHD, and the long-term
      effectiveness of these medications is not well-known. In this study the participants will be
      randomly selected to receive one of four treatments: 1.) clonidine; 2.) MPH; 3.) clonidine
      and MPH; or 4.) a placebo (which is not an active medication, but a substance that is thought
      to have no biological effect). The time participation in the study is 16 weeks.
