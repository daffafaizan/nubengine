      glioma is BEV. Additional treatment options are needed for these subjects. Published
      literature indicates that targeting the proteasome in glioma cells has shown significant
      anti-tumor activity.

      MRZ is a novel, second generation proteasome inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of
      proteins involved in signal transduction which blocks growth and survival of cancer cells.
      In-vitro studies of multiple glioma cell lines were highly sensitive to MRZ. MRZ had
      relatively little effect on neural stem/progenitor cells suggesting minimal neurotoxicity
      while significantly affecting both malignant glioma stem cells and glioma cell lines.

      Parts 1 and 2 of this trial have been completed with the Recommended Part 3 (Phase 2) Dose
      established at 0.8 mg/m2. Part 3 of this trial is enrolling at the MRZ RP2D determined in
      Phase 1 to assess the combination of MRZ and BEV activity and safety.

      Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this trial have been completed with the Recommended Dose established
      at 0.8 mg/m2. Part 5 of this trial is enrolling.
