    
      This study is a randomized, sequential group, double-blind study. The first 60 subjects
      enrolled will be randomized to either 0.1% NVC-422 or 0.5% NVC-422. Randomization is 1:2
      where 20 subjects will receive 0.1% NVC-422 and 40 subjects will receive 0.5% NVC-422. If
      there are no safety issues regarding the first 2 doses tested, the next 60 subjects will be
      randomized to either 0.1% or 1.5% NVC-422 with 20 subjects receiving 0.1% and 40 subjects
      receiving 1.5% NVC-422.

      The lesion most representative of the subject's infection will be identified as the target
      lesion. This target lesion will be photographed, graded clinically, and its location
      recorded. At Visit 1, Screening and/or Baseline, a Gram stain will be performed to assess
      presence of Gram-positive cocci. If Gram-positive cocci are present, a swab for culture and
      sensitivity will be obtained. Treatment will began immediately after randomization.

      Treatment will be 3 times per day (TID) for 7 consecutive days, following a morning,
      afternoon, and evening schedule.

      After the start of treatment (Day 1), subjects will be assessed for safety on Day 4 (± 1).
      Clinical and bacteriological assessments of the target lesion will also occur on Day 8 (+1)
      and Follow-up on Day 15 (± 2).
