      mechanisms.

      Acipimox is an anti-lipolytic drug and increases growth hormone release by decreasing free
      fatty acids levels and that Acipimox may exert to a negative feedback of growth hormone on
      ghrelin.

      Physical exercise is a potent physiological stimulus for growth hormone release. As ghrelin
      has a stimulatory effect on growth hormone secretion, growth hormone may inhibit circulating
      ghrelin levels via a feedback loop. Growth hormone stimulates lipolysis and resultant free
      fatty acids may suppress ghrelin secretion.
