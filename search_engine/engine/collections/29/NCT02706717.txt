      significant change in sCD14 after 24 weeks of probiotic Visbiome Extra Strength (ES) therapy,
      and to determine the safety and tolerability of this agent in HIV-infected participants on
      stable antiretroviral therapy (ART). Participants were randomized 1:1 to Visbiome ES and
      placebo arms. Both arms initiated study treatment at Week 2 and took 1 sachet per day for the
      first 2 weeks and then 1 sachet twice daily for the next 22 weeks. All participants were
      followed for an additional 12 weeks off study product.

      The study clinic visits included Entry (Week 0), and Weeks 2, 6, 14, 25, 26, and 38. Plasma
      for the primary outcome was collected at Weeks 0, 2, 25, and 26. The evaluations of safety
      (clinical assessment for signs and symptoms, diagnoses, and laboratory tests) were done at
      Weeks 2, 6, 14, 26, and 38.

      Currently, the results are entered for the primary outcome measure and select secondary
      outcomes only. The results on the remaining secondary outcomes will be posted when they
      become available.
