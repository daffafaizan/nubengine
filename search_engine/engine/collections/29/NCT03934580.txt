      Hypnosis has been successfully used to modulate gastrointestinal functions, by imagining
      eating food.

      In the present pilot trial, the investigators search to investigate the effects a
      hallucinatory meal by hypnosis on subjective appetite and appetite hormone blood levels.
      Hence, two different breakfast meals are randomly administered to eight healthy
      postmenopausal women, in a crossover design, consisting of i) a hallucinatory breakfast meal
      (HB) and ii) a real breakfast meal (RB). On each test day, participants undergo baseline
      measurements, including appetite sensation and blood sample, then the test meal is
      hallucinated or served. Subjective appetite is assessed each 30 minutes for 4 hours and half,
      while blood samples are taken at 20', 60', 90' and 180 minutes. At the end of each session,
      participants are instructed to fill in a food record for the following 3-days.
