      real current; G2: Sham - participants who will receive simulated stimulation. Participants
      will be included in the study using the eligibility criteria and will be randomly allocated,
      with exchange in blocks at the rate of 1: 1. Participants will receive 10 tDCS sessions, for
      20 minutes, on days alternate (3 times a week). The neurostimulator TCT-Research will be used
      for stimulation. The electrodes will be positioned according to the international
      classification system of the electroencephalogram 10/20, in which the anode will be applied
      in the primary motor area (C3 / C4) ipsilateral to the lesion and the cathode in the
      contralateral supra-orbital region. The current intensity will be defined based on
      computational modeling, using the patient's magnetic resonance as a basis, in order to
      estimate and individualize the dosage to be administered.

      The SimNIBS software will be used for computational modeling, it is a free and open source
      package for the simulation of the electric field induced individually by tDCS in the brain.
      The modeling will be performed from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images in order to build a
      high resolution head model for each individual. These images are segmented into the main
      tissues of the head (white and gray substance, cerebrospinal fluid, skull and scalp). From
      the segmentations, a volume conductor model is created and used to perform the electric field
      simulations. The estimated distribution of the cerebral electric field is obtained by placing
      simulated electrodes on the head model and defining the intensity of the electric current
      according to the stimulation protocol.
