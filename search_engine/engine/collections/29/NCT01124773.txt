      the long-term impact of random assignment to postmenopausal hormone therapy (equine estrogen
      alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone versus placebo) among women who were aged
      50-54 at the time of randomization into the WHI hormone trials. Secondary objectives relate
      to the consistency of any treatment effects across unopposed or opposed therapy and whether
      there exists evidence of graded relationships between cognitive effects and age of
      administration, years from menopause, and baseline risk factors for cognitive impairment.
