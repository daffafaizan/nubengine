      military personnel served in the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War (GW1). Migraine like HA and
      diffuse body pain were detected in 64% of Gulf War Veteran (GWV) diagnosed with Gulf War
      Illness (GWI). Unfortunately, conventional pharmacological treatments for GWI-related pain
      has not been shown to be effective and drugs such as narcotics contain many long term
      untoward psychosomatic and abusive side effects. This study is assessing the effectiveness of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), non-invasive treatment option, in
      alleviating headaches, muscle, and joint pain symptoms of GWI.
