    
      This study consists of 3 distinct aims:

      In Aim 1, the investigators will evaluate clinical acceptance of the GaitBetter solution by
      subjects and therapists. To do so, the investigators will run a pilot study to gather
      feedback from stakeholders (not reported here).

      In Aim 2, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of using the GaitBetter solution to
      improve motor-cognitive function of chronic stroke survivors. To do so, the investigators
      will run a single-arm, non-randomized study to test the hypothesis that the GaitBetter
      training is effective in improving gait and cognition in individuals with chronic stroke.

      In Aim 3, the investigators will explore the efficacy of using the GaitBetter solution for
      improving rehabilitation outcomes in sub-acute stroke survivors. To do so, the investigators
      will run a randomized, controlled study to evaluate the effects of using the GaitBetter
      system in patients with subacute stroke on recovery trajectory.
