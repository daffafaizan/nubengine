      improve patient's quality of life, symptom management, depression, and anxiety.

      This study aims to evaluate the effect of the introduction of early palliative care services
      to advanced cancer patients. Eligible patients are 20 years or older, and has an advanced
      cancer diagnosis (histologically or cytologically confirmed) due to a solid tumor, a European
      Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, an estimated life expectancy of 12
      months or less. The primary goal of an integrated early palliative care program is to improve
      the overall quality of life of patients and their families. Secondarily, it is to help
      understand the disease, resolving conflicts in the decision-making process, improving the
      crisis coping capacity, and further determining the patient's and family's advanced care
      planning. At last, it is desired to evaluate the effect of the program on overall medical
      cost savings and 1 year survival.

      Participants of the study will be allocated in the intervention group and the control group
      equally. Within three weeks from the time of randomization, the first meeting with a
      palliative care team will be held. In the time of baseline questionnaire, patients will be
      provided with self-study education materials and videos on the early palliative care and
      advance care planning. Once in every three weeks for six months, which is the duration for
      one treatment course, palliative care for advance care planning, symptom control, and other
      mental, social and spiritual problems will be provided. After the first meeting with the
      palliative care team, telephone coaching will be performed once a week for the first 12 weeks
      and then every two weeks until the end of the study.
