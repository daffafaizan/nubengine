      disease, it has become a disease of the adult, with the emergence of new issues, such as
      becoming a parent. Parent patients still face the risk of complications and death while their
      child is still young. However, there is very little data in the literature on parenting in
      cystic fibrosis. In a first study which is ongoing (43 patients out of the 50 planned have
      been included), we intended to study parenting, considering the sick parent's point of view.

      However, this question does not only concern parents and their spouses. It is also
      fundamental to take into account the experience of the children, to understand their
      experiences and their own needs in this context of serious illness of a parent with limited
      life expectancy.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore and collect the perceptions, expectations
      and needs of children whose one parent has CF. Children are eligible from the age of 6 if
      their parents agree.

      Children will have semi-structured individual interviews or will participate in focus groups
      with the study psychologist in order to express their feelings, difficulties, expectations
      and needs in living with a parent who has CF.

      Thematic analysis of the content will first be done separately for individual interviews and
      focus groups, and a global synthesis will be carried out.
