    
      Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 2% of all cancers and its incidence is
      increasing with worldwide deaths of over 100,000 patients per year. About 50% of RCC patients
      have inoperable or metastatic disease that surgery cannot be performed on. RCC is also
      considered to be resistant to both radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of E7070 by assessing progression free
      survival, tumor response rate, duration of response/stable disease, and survival time. E7070
      will be administered as a single iv infusion over 60 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. Patients
      will continue treatment with E7070 until they no longer have clinical benefit and have
      disease progression, or toxicity leads to patient withdrawal.
