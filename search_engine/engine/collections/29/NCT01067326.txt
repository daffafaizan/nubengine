      endothelium, similar to other antihypertensive therapies targeting the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The current study was designed to test the
      hypothesis that aliskiren improves endothelial function and increases the number of
      endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in normotensive patients with early atherosclerosis.
