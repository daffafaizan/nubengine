      involving immune system dysregulation, leading to fibrosis. Inflammatory and autoimmune
      aspects of this disease overlap systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease shown clearly
      to respond to MMF. Activated T-cells, the probable target of MMF in SLE, likely also play an
      important role in SSc pathogenesis. Evidence for this includes the similarity of SSc skin
      disease to chronic graft versus host disease, a disease in which T-cells play a critical
      role. MMF has proven one of the most effective medications to date for SLE and associated
      nephritis [1]. It also appears to be active in polymyositis and dermatomyositis, disease that
      also show significant overlap with SSc [2]. Myositis can also be a feature of SSc, suggesting
      that his disease manifestation might be particularly likely to respond to MMF. MMF inhibits
      inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of guanosine
      nucleotides. It blocks the type II isoform found in activated lymphocytes more potently than
      the type I isoform inhibiting both T- and B-lymphocytes [3]. In SSc, mycophenolate has been
      tried after anti-thymocyte globulin in one small open label study with efficacy with a
      significant improvement in skin score [4]. However, MMF has not been tried alone inSSc and
      has not been tried in muscle disease associated with SSc. In this study, we will test the
      safety and efficacy of MMF in SSc. In this study all study patients will receive the
      medication.
