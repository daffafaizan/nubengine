      COVID-19: a retrospective clinical study.

      The medical frontline staffs have the high risk to be infected during working. The stress and
      load were acuminated, especially when they got the similar symptoms as COVID-19. NHM has been
      used to early prevention for thousands of years9-12. It was well accept to take NHM for early
      prevention in many Asia-Pacific countries. Although many NHM remedies of COVID-19 treatment
      or prevention were reported, but the related study were lacking. To understand the pressure
      and the satisfaction of frontline medical staffs after taking JGF for early prevention we
      conducted this retrospective clinical study to explore the relationship in different groups.
