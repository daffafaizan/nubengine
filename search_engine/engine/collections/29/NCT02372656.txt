      intrabony defects in chronic periodontitis subjects and compare it with placebo gel.

      Methods: Ninety subjects were categorized into three treatment groups: 1.2% Simvastatin
      (SMV), 1% Metformin (MF) and placebo gel after Scaling and root planning (SRP). Clinical
      parameters were recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months; they included plaque index (PI),
      modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), pocket probing depth (PPD), and clinical attachment
      level (CAL). Radiologic assessment of intra bony defect (IBD) and percentage defect depth
      reduction (DDR%) was done at baseline, 6 months and 9 months interval using computer-aided
      software

      Results: Mean PPD reduction and mean CAL gain was found to greater in SMV group than MF and
      placebo group at all visits. The DDR% was greater in SMV group as compared to MF and placebo
      group.

      Conclusion: There was greater decrease in mSBI and PPD and more CAL gain with significant IBD
      depth reduction at the sites treated with SMV and MF as an adjunct to SRP in chronic
      periodontitis subjects with intrabony defects as compared to placebo. The effect was greater
      in case of SMV group, however there was no significant defect depth reduction as compared to
      MF.
