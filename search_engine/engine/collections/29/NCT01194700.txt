      can reduce respirable dose delivery especially when used brand new "out of the box". Breath
      actuated integrated vortex spacer (Synchro-Breathe) is a compact palm sized antistatic device
      with a vortex chamber which is designed to be more patient friendly and free from the effects
      of electrostatic charge. The systemic bioavailability from the lung of inhaled fluticasone
      and salmeterol is dependent on respirable dose delivery, and hence the performance of inhaler
      devices can be quantified by measuring the degree of adrenal suppression and fall in serum
      potassium(K) as surrogates for delivered lung dose. This study attempts to compares the
      systemic bioavailability from the lung in real life conditions for Fluticasone/Salmeterol
      combination (measured in terms of relative adrenal suppression and fall in serum K) via the
      breath actuated Synchro-Breathe device, pMDI( Seretide Evohaler), and Aerochamber Plus &
      Volumatic spacer used brand new "out of the box" in healthy volunteers.
