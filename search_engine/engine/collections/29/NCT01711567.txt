      (65%) of the patients receiving TDF, and one-fifth (20%) of the patients receiving ETV, would
      achieve virologic response. We also assumed a 15% drop-out rate; thus, 22 patients were
      needed in each group to achieve 80% power to demonstrate a difference between the groups with
      a 5% level of significance.

      The primary efficacy end point will be analyzed on a per-protocol basis, including only those
      patients who had completed the treatment schedule of study. In contrast, the
      intention-to-treat analysis will include all randomized subjects, even those dropped-out from
      the study before 12 months, as cases of treatment failure.
