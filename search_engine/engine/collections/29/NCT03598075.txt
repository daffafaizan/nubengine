      originally found in the pancreas (Beta Cell of Islets of Langerhans) but also shown to be
      present in the trigeminal ganglion, hind horn ganglia and perivascular nerve fibers.

      Amylin has many similarities with CGRP. Amylin and CGRP share 16 out 37 amino acids. Both
      peptides can activate the amylin 1 subtype (AMY1)receptor with high affinity and reported to
      have more similar physiological and pharmacological effects.

      In addition, both peptides increase the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP)
      which has a central role in migraine pathophysiology.

      The aim of the study is pin point the role of amylin and amylin receptor compare to CGRP in
      migraine pathophysiology.
