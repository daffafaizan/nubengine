    
      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to compare the difference in change
      in retinal blood vessel density (peripapillary and macular) between latanoprostene bunod
      (LBN) ophthalmic solution 0.024% dosed once daily (QD) and timolol maleate 0.5% dosed twice
      daily (BID) in subjects with OAG or OHT and in normal subjects.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the change in
      retinal blood vessel density (peripapillary and macular) between treatment groups after 4
      weeks of treatment (Visit 4 [Week 5] and Visit 6 [Week 11]).

      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoint for this study is change in
      best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

      Safety Endpoints The safety endpoint for this study is the incidence of ocular and systemic
      adverse events (AEs).
