      compared to placebo (isovolumic normal saline) among patients with acute ischemic stroke. All
      patients will have a baseline stroke severity measured as NIH Stroke scale score > 5.
      Patients will treated according to the best standard of care including concurrent treatment
      with intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis where appropriate. The primary outcome will
      be determined at 3 months. The primary hypothesis is that, using the composite outcome of a
      modified Rankin score 0-1 or NIH stroke scale score 0-1 at 3 months (or both), the proportion
      of patients with improved outcomes will be greater by 10% or more in the active treatment
      group. [The current trial is termed "Part 2" and incorporates revisions to the initial
      protocol that were instituted after the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) suspended subject
      recruitment because of a safety concern after 434 subjects had been enrolled. The protocol
      revisions of Part 2 resulted from the study team's thorough review of the Part-1 safety data
      and were designed to optimize safety going forward.]
