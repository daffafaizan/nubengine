    
      All 12 patients enrolled into this Early Feasibility Phase I clinical trial will receive the
      same treatment of Hemopurifier plus Pembrolizumab (i.e., 2 rounds of Hemopurifier plus
      Pembrolizumab followed by Pembrolizumab only up to 2 years). Prior to initiation of the
      Hemopurifier treatment on Day 1, each subject will undergo phlebotomy to provide a baseline
      EDTA anti-coagulated blood sample, 30ml (< 3 tablespoons of blood) for the assessments of
      total exosome protein (TEP) levels and exosome profiles. The kinetics of exosome depletion
      will be evaluated in the study participants using serial blood samples (5ml) collected hourly
      during the 4h-depletion period by the Hemopurifier on Day 1. In addition, to evaluate
      kinetics of exosome recovery, 30ml of blood will be collected just prior to Pembrolizumab
      infusion (day 1) and on days 7 and 14 after Hemopurifier plus Pembrolizumab treatment during
      cycle 1 and 2. Exosome recovery after Hemopurifier + Pembrolizumab therapy will be evaluated
      and used to determine the rate of TEP recovery for each patient. Serial monitoring of TEP
      during Hemopurifier treatment (hourly during the 4h-depletion period), before Pembrolizumab
      infusion and after the second round of Pembrolizumab (days 7, and 14) will be done as for the
      first treatment. Only 2 Hemopurifier treatments will be given. For third and later rounds of
      Pembrolizumab, the investigators will continue to draw 30mL blood prior to Pembrolizumab
      infusion for the assessments of TEP levels and exosome profiles.
