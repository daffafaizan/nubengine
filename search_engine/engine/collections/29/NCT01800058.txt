    
      Prospective analysis of biologic samples from peripheral blood of 65 patients with localized
      high-risk PCa (NCCN 2011) treated with RTC-3D-IMRT combined with AD.

      Following the sign of the informed consent of the patient, the blood samples will be analyzed
      for CTCs using an immunomagnetic method based on the CellSearch system (Veridex), in 4
      periods of time:

        1. prior to any treatment;

        2. following AD and prior to RT; and

        3. following the end of RT (1-3 months afterwards).

        4. six to twelve months following the end of RT in those patients with 0 CTCs in the first
           determination and positive CTCs in the second or third determination

      Comparison between the expression of CTCs in peripheral blood before and following AD and RT
      will be performed. The quantification of the CTCs obtained in these phases of treatment will
      be correlated with the treatment results in terms of biochemical failure according to Phoenix
      definition, distant metastasis rate and overall survival to identify a significant prognostic
      relationship and to determine the potential effect of the treatment in the number of CTCs Our
      working group will include 65 patients because the amount is based on routine clinical
      activity can be safely enrolled in the project development time by the participating centers.
