      cytologically confirmed small cell lung cancer or small cell cancer from other organs or
      poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors that are treated like small cell cancer. This
      study is for patients with metastatic or recurrent disease. Eligible patients will receive
      Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane), 100 mg/m2, IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle
      followed by Gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2, IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
      Participants can continue receiving Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from the study. Tumor measurements will be done every 2
      cycles.
