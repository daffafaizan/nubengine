      gastric cancer. However, present guidelines such as the updated Sydney System require
      multiple biopsies whereas reveal an unsatisfactory yield considering the detection and
      surveillance of these lesions. Confocal laser endomicroscopy is a newly developed endoscopic
      device that enables microscopic view of the digestive tract. Previous study has showed high
      sensitivity and specificity for in vivo diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia using
      confocal laser endomicroscopy. This study aims to assess the real number of biopsies that can
      be reduced for the detection of gastric intestinal metaplasia using confocal laser
      endomicroscopy.
