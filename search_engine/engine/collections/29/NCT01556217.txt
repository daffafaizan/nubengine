    
      This is a single-centre, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the
      assigned treatment), single dose study of JNJ-39393406 or placebo (a treatment identical in
      appearance to JNJ-39393406 but does not contain active drug) in healthy adult volunteers. The
      study consists of an eligibility screening examination (between 21 and 2 days prior to dose
      administration), a double-blind treatment period, and a follow-up examination (minimally 7
      and maximally 14 days after the dose administration). For each volunteer, the maximal study
      duration will not exceed 6 weeks. JNJ-39393406 or placebo will be administered as a single
      200-mg dose on Day 1 as a liquid nanosuspension (a formulation used to improve the solubility
      of the drug) with 240 mL (approximately 8 ounces or 1 cup) noncarbonated water between 8:00
      AM and 10:30 AM after a standard breakfast has been consumed (following a fast [not eating
      food] of at least 10 hours). Volunteers will then fast until approximately 4 hours after
      taking JNJ-3939406 or placebo after which lunch will be served.
