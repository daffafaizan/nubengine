        -  Determine whether the administration of 5 years of exemestane after 5 years of tamoxifen
           therapy is more effective than 5 years of prior tamoxifen therapy alone in prolonging
           disease-free survival, overall survival, and time to treatment failure in postmenopausal
           women with resected stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer.

        -  Determine the effect of tamoxifen withdrawal on bone, in terms of height, fractures, and
           total alkaline phosphatase in these patients and on bone mineral density and bone
           biochemical markers in a subset of patients.

        -  Determine the effect of exemestane on bone loss after tamoxifen withdrawal in these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of a subset of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral exemestane daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II (closed as of 10/15/03): Patients receive an oral placebo daily for 5 years.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 6 months for 5.5 years.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 6 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years
      and 4 months.
