      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of MS-275 and azacitidine in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or acute myeloid leukemia.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and optimal phase II dose of MS-275 when combined
      with azacitidine in these patients.

      III. Determine, preliminarily, the potential therapeutic activity of this regimen in these
      patients.

      IV. Correlate MS-275 pharmacokinetics with clinical response and laboratory correlative
      endpoints in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of MS-275. Patients receive azacitidine
      subcutaneously on days 1-10 and oral MS-275 on days 3 and 10.

      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. Patients receive adjusted doses of azacitidine based on clinical
      response. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 9 additional patients are treated at the MTD.

      [Note: Patients who do not achieve hematologic improvement or partial or complete response
      but who have stable disease after 4 courses of therapy may receive an additional 4 courses of
      therapy at a higher dose than what was originally assigned]
