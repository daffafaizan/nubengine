      will be randomly assigned to two groups: perturbation training group and balance exercises
      group. Both groups will receive standard physiotherapy treatments. No gender based
      differences are expected so we will be able to pool male and female individuals for this
      analysis. Each subject of the experimental and of the control groups will be trained on 12
      occasions over a period of 10-12 weeks (15 minutes, 2-3 times/week) in addition to standard
      care physiotherapy. Gait, balance function and fear of falling will be tested in both groups
      before, immediately after, 3 and 6 months after completion of the training period to explore
      the benefit of training.
