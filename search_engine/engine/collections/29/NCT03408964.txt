      planned antitumor treatment at time of study entry.

      Group 0 (set-up): blood sampling and rectal swab will be collected at a single time-point
      during the PC treatment. No follow-up is required.

      Group 1a (control): the first blood sampling will be performed within 4 weeks since the
      negative biopsy; subsequent samplings will be done according to a schedule comparable to that
      of Group 1 up to 1 year or evidence of tumor, whichever occurs first.

      Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3: the first blood sampling will be performed before radical
      treatment or HT start or CT start, on the basis of the planned antitumor therapy; subsequent
      sampling will be done after radical intervention at 4 weeks (only for Group 1) and then every
      3 months (or more frequently if clinically indicated), up to 3 years or evidence of tumor
      recurrence/progression (radiological or biochemical), whichever occurs first.

      At the time of recurrence/progression, patients of Group 1 could become part and could be
      followed as per Group 2, and patients of Group 2 could become part and could be followed as
      per Group 3.
