      nutritional deficits linked to a clinical disease. A range of population and clinical
      research has now implicated less severe vitamin D deficiency as a potential risk factor for
      several chronic diseases [Melamed, et al. J Am Soc Nephrol 2009;20:2631-9; Michos et al.
      Future Cardiol, 2009;5:15-8; Reis et al. Diabetes Metab, 2005;31:318-25] and all-cause
      mortality [Melamed et al. Arch Intern Med, 2008;168:1629-37; Durazo-Arvizu et al.
      International Workshop on Statistical Modeling(IWSM);2010] is significantly increased at the
      low end of the 25(OH)D distribution among blacks and whites in the follow-up data from NHANES
      III. One out of 2 adults in the US has a 25(OH)D serum level < 30 ng/ml [Ginde et al. Arch
      Intern Med, 2009;169:626-32], currently considered the threshold for health-promoting levels
      [Howe et al. N Engl J Med, 2007;357:1981-2]. Light skin facilitates formation of 25(OH)D and
      consequently only 3% of US blacks have "optimal" levels, with very low levels (<10 ng/mL)
      found in 29% of blacks, compared to 5% of whites and10% of Mexican Americans [Ginde et al.
      Arch Intern Med, 2009;169:626-32]. Concern exists therefore that low serum levels of 25(OH)D
      may contribute to the disproportionately high risk for some chronic diseases in US blacks
      (eg, obesity, hypertension and CVD) [Pilz et al. Nat Rev Cardiol, 2009;6:621-30; Wang et al.
      Circulation, 2008;117:503-11]. At the present time the most convincing body of data on
      25(OH)D and risk of chronic disease exists for obesity; the study proposed here will be
      conducted as an extension of a major international project on determinants of weight gain in
      Afro-origin populations.

      25(OH)D has regulatory functions in several physiologic systems. Paradoxically, while US
      blacks have relatively lower serum 25(OH)D they have higher bone mineral density (BMD) and
      lower fracture rates, suggesting important variation in metabolic set points across
      populations [Aloia, Am J Clin Nutr, 2008;88:545S-550S]. However, it is not known if US blacks
      are at increased risk from the non-skeletal effects of low 25(OH)D. The overall health
      consequences of this shift in 25(OH)D levels and the threshold of "normal" for US blacks are
      thus unknown. The primary aim of this study is therefore to define the optimal level of
      25(OH)D and the appropriate threshold for supplementation in the multi-ethnic US population.
      These data could have an important impact on public health recommendations regarding
      health-promoting levels of 25(OH)D.

      Vitamin D levels in West Africans are similar to US whites, and much higher than in US blacks
      (see preliminary data). These cross-population contrasts represent one of the most
      significant known examples of a gene-environment interaction. By sampling Afro-origin
      populations across a range of latitudes, Ca++ intake, diet patterns, and lifestyles the
      investigators will model the determinants of 25(OH)D and related health effects. This
      research will incorporate 3 novel aspects. First, data on 25(OH)D will be standardized and a
      set of key determinants of 25(OH)D levels from 5 geographically separated populations of
      African descent will be available. Second, the study will generate precise covariate measures
      for obesity and other CV traits to test prospectively the association with 25(OH)D. Third,
      the investigators will have DXA measurements to examine 25(OH)D - PTH - bone density
      relationships and address a fundamental question about regulation of mineral metabolism and
      bone health. A major strength of this study will be state-of-the-art measurements of
      covariates for obesity, including doubly labeled water, activity monitoring, body composition
      and dietary intake. The role of 25(OH)D in obesity risk can therefore be evaluated with
      control for all of the key determinants of energy balance.

      This study will utilize existing data and fasting samples from an ongoing NIH-funded study
      [Modeling the Epidemiologic Transition Study (METS; DK080763)]. METS began recruiting 2500
      adults of African ancestry ages 25-45 from 5 countries (500 each from the US, Jamaica,
      Seychelles, South Africa, and Ghana) in October 2009. This study extends the follow-up period
      currently funded by METS to 6.2 years and uses a combined cohort-ecologic design to examine
      within-person and between-group associations.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Measure serum 25(OH)D and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels in 500 adults from
           the 5 METS sites (total N=2,500) at baseline and determine associations with latitude,
           diet, physical activity, adiposity, blood pressure (BP), and biochemical risk factors
           for CVD (eg, insulin, glucose, adiponectin, leptin, cholesterol).

        2. Examine the association between baseline serum 25(OH)D and iPTH levels and changes in
           body composition and blood pressure over 6.2 years of follow-up.

        3. Repeat measurement of serum 25(OH)D and iPTH at third follow-up examination
           (approximately 3.5 years after baseline) and measure BMD using DXA in the available
           cohort.
