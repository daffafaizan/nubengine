      inhibitor therapy as an intervention for recurrent ischemic priapism, a disorder of
      non-willful, excessive penile erection, in patients with SCD. Although precise prevalence
      figures are not available, priapism in SCD is highly prevalent and thought to afflict
      approximately 40% of males, based on available literature. Additionally, the disorder exacts
      devastating consequences, including erectile tissue necrosis, erectile dysfunction, and
      psychological distress. Management of this disorder remains challenging because the
      mechanisms underlying priapism are incompletely understood.
