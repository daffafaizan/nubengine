      the first half. Patients receiving active drug will be started at one dose and it can be
      increased at the second visit. Those patients randomized to placebo will also have their dose
      adjusted by the investigating physician. The physicians will be blinded as to whether the
      patient is receiving drug or placebo. In the second half of the study, patients will receive
      the opposite treatment.

      Patients will have complete detailed questionnaires regarding their fatigue, sleepiness, and
      overall quality of life.

      They will have sleep studies done at the start and after each half of the study to determine
      the effect of therapy on sleepiness.
