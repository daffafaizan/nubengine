    
      Infantile spinal muscular atrophy is a common disease (the second most common fatal autosomal
      recessive disease after cystic fibrosis), neurodegenerative disorders of childhood causing
      severe motor impairment and a risk to life through respiratory failure in the most severe
      forms.

      Innovative therapies (gene therapy or pharmacogenetics) have recently proven their
      effectiveness on survival criteria. Nevertheless, the motor benefit of these therapies must
      be evaluated more precisely.

      Currently, the reference methods for motor development assessment are fairly robust
      semi-quantitative motor scales that lack sensitivity and do not reflect function (CHOPINTEND,
      HINE, BAYLEY SCALE, MFM and CGI-scale).

      Advances in recent techniques have enabled the emergence of non-invasive, secure, easy-to-use
      inertial sensors in routine clinical practice that allow quantification of infant movements.

      The aim of the study is to propose a method for quantifying motor function in infants with
      spinal muscular atrophy treated with innovative therapies using inertial sensors.
