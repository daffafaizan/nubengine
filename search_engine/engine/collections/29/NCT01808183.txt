      Supracondylar humerus fractures account for 60% of the elbow fractures in children. Some
      supracondylar fractures injure the brachial artery and a small percentage of children present
      with an absent radial pulse after supracondylar humerus fracture, and these injuries may
      result in insufficient blood flow to the ipsilateral forearm. This can lead to compartment
      syndrome and/or ischemic contracture of the forearm muscles, and may result in permanent
      disability. Currently, physicians do not have objective data to determine whether or not the
      forearm muscles below a supracondylar humerus fracture are receiving adequate blood flow and
      must rely on the clinical exam of the wrist and hand distally. The purpose of this study is
      to use near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to compare the blood flow in the forearm muscle
      compartments of an injured arm compared to an uninjured arm. This will provide data to
      establish normal readings for this device for a child's forearm, and may then help clinicians
      detect children with insufficient perfusion of the forearm muscles after supracondylar
      humerus fracture.
