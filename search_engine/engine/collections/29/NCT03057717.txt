    
      Women with a singleton pregnancy in the twenty-forth to thirty-fourth week of gestation who
      are at risk for preterm labour, requiring the administration of Betamethasone twelve
      milligrams intramuscularly every twenty-four hours for two doses will be included in this
      study along with an equal number of gestational-age matched controls not at risk for preterm
      delivery and therefore not requiring the administration of Betamethasone. A 2-D ultrasound
      assessment of the fetal thymus size with measurements of the maximum transverse diameter and
      thymus perimeter in the three-vessel view will be performed as a baseline measurement within
      36 hours of the administration of the first dose of corticosteroids. For each patient
      enrolled, a gestational-age matched control will have a similar ultrasound assessment. These
      measurements will be repeated 2 weeks after the first baseline ultrasound, and then only
      patients who received corticosteroids will have subsequent ultrasound measurements every 2
      weeks until delivery.
