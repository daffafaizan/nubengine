      linear stapler during rectal anterior resection and perform an end-to-end anastomosis by
      circular stapler. But the so-called 'dog ears', two stapled corners of the rectal stump after
      laparoscopic linear transection of rectum, are very common. The lateral intersections of
      double-stapled anastomoses are structural weak spot area, and they are considered to be the
      potential ischemic areas leading to anastomosis leakage and the possible sites occurring
      local recurrence. Previous study reported a modified technique for rectal reconstruction
      during open surgery, and they could use circular stapler to eliminate the staple line on the
      rectal stump and cut off the 'dog ears'. But because of the narrow pelvic cavity, it is very
      difficult to perform this technique in laparoscopic rectal surgery and there is no related
      report on laparoscopic application. In this study, we evaluates the feasibility and advantage
      of modified laparoscopic double-staple anastomosis technique, to eliminate the "dog ears" in
      laparoscopic rectal anterior resection by laparoscopic suturing on the staple line.
