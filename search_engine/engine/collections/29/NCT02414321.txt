      The Fontan circulation is a palliation for patients with a functionally univentricular heart.
      The Fontan circulation is characterized by impaired exercise capacity and gradual attrition
      over time. To date treatment options are extremely limited. It has been proposed that
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is the controlling and limiting factor of cardiac output
      in the Fontan circulation. Remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and increasing PVR are
      possible key factors in the long term failure of the Fontan circulation. Optical Coherence
      Tomography (OCT) is an intravascular imaging modality used for structural characterization of
      blood vessels. Nitric oxide is a pulmonary vasodilator used in pulmonary vascular response
      tests, aimed at lowering PVR which may improve cardiac output in the Fontan circulation.
      These two diagnostic procedures are tools to study the structural and functional
      characteristics of the pulmonary vasculature in the Fontan circulation. The results of this
      study could identify the pulmonary circulation as a future treatment target in Fontan
      patients and may provide clues for new therapeutic treatment strategies to improve the long
      term outcome of these patients.

      Study procedure:

      The study protocol will be performed during a clinically indicated cardiac catheterization.
      In the context of this study additional measurements will be performed which will include a
      pulmonary vascular response test, trans-thoracic echocardiography and pulmonary artery OCT
      measurements.
