      on the Dexcom G6 CGM system and the InPen and Clipsulin smart insulin pens. Subjects will use
      these devices for the next 14 days at home. Subjects will return to OHSU at the end of the 14
      days for a training on using the DailyDose system. Subjects will then return home to use the
      DailyDose system for 8 weeks. Sensor glucose, exercise, insulin and meal data will be
      collected during the DailyDose portion of the study in order to produce recommendations for
      insulin dosing. Subjects will receive up to 4 recommendations every 7 days. Subjects will
      also receive recommendations for exercise based on the PEAK exercise guidelines.

      Subjects will wear the Dexcom G6 and an Apple Watch physical activity monitor for the entire
      study. Insulin data will be collected using the InPen for aspart insulin and Clipsulin for
      the long acting insulin. Subjects will complete a 30 minute aerobic exercise video at home
      once per week. Subjects will also be asked to complete two additional exercise sessions on
      their own at home, one aerobic session and the other whatever type of exercise they would
      normally do (aerobic, resistance etc.). Subjects will use the bolus calculator within the
      DailyDose app. Subjects will be instructed to test capillary blood glucose (CBG) after
      exercise, for symptoms of hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia alerts and again 15 minutes after
      rescue carbohydrate treatment until CBG >70 mg/dl.
