      physiological rationale, rapidly expanding use internationally, and promising results in
      early small RCTS, a definitive RCT to establish the impact of HFO versus current conventional
      ventilation on mortality is needed. We have completed a pilot multicentre RCT in preparation
      for this trial, with goals of investigating patient recruitment, protocol acceptance, and
      crossover rates. The pilot study met all objectives including recruitment that exceeded
      expectations (94 patients), and very good adherence to protocol. Results of the multinational
      OSCILLATE Trial will establish the impact of HFO versus conventional ventilation on mortality
      rates among adults with severe ARDS.
