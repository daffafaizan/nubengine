      was effective and safe for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib
      in overall survival in untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and programmed cell death
      protein-1 (PD-1) antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has compared HAIC plus lenvatinib and PD-1 antibody with
      HAIC plus lenvatinib. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control
      study to find out it.
