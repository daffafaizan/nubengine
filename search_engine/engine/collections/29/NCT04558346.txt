    
      All consenting participants will be screened for eligibility. This includes a screening
      period of one week, where symptoms will be monitored, including any improvement.

      Consenting and eligible participants will either be randomized to receive study drug
      (OXE-103) or placebo. The study team will also be blinded to the assigned treatment, so they
      will not know which treatment participants have been assigned to take.

      Consenting participants must be willing to commit to the following:

        -  give themselves subcutaneous injections twice a day

        -  attend several study visits, which require both in-person and phone-only visits

        -  complete various questionnaires and testing

        -  have blood drawn

        -  have ECG's performed

        -  undergo a pregnancy test (if of childbearing potential) and use contraception while on
           study

        -  tell the study team about any side effects they might experience from the study drug
           during study participation

      Total participation will last about 8 weeks, which includes 7 days for screening, 14 days of
      taking the study drug, and 4 weeks of follow-up.
