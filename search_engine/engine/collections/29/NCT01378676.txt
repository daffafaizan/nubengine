    
      In Part A, approximately 24 patients will be randomized to one of four different treatment
      groups. After a 7-day washout of riluzole, patients in each treatment group will receive
      daily oral doses of placebo, 125 mg, 250 mg, or 375 mg of CK-2017357 for 14 days. Patients
      will take daily doses of CK-2017357 or placebo (Day 1 through Day 14) and will return to the
      study site on Day 2, Day 8 and Day 15. All patients will return for a follow-up visit 7 days
      (Â± 2 days) after their last dose.

      In Part B, approximately additional 24 patients will be randomized to one of four different
      treatment groups as in Part A. Patients in Part B will be required to decrease their riluzole
      dose to 50 mg once a day (QD) for 7 days prior to randomization. After this 7 day period,
      patients will take riluzole at 50 mg QD concurrently with their morning dose of blinded study
      drug.
