      understood condition with limited treatment options. Recent evidence has established small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and alterations in fecal microbiota as potential
      etiologies in the pathogenesis of IBS-D. Current therapies, including a nonabsorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin or diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP), show efficacy in 50% or less of patients [1-4]. It has
      been postulated that limited responses to therapies may stem from failure to identify
      distinct subgroups in IBS-D stratified by gut microbial profiles. In this proposal, we will
      randomize IBS-D patients to receive either rifaximin or low FODMAP dietary intervention. We
      will then longitudinally follow the results of fecal microbiota-derived data as well as
      hydrogen breath tests to define SIBO. We will use these methods to test the hypotheses that:
      (i) distinct IBS-D phenotypes can be generated by defining fecal microbial populations as
      well as delineating the presence or absence of SIBO; and (ii) longitudinal analyses using
      microbe-derived metrics and SIBO status may relate to response to treatment with rifaximin or
      low FODMAP dietary intervention.
