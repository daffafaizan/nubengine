      and healthy individuals of similar age and sex to patients will be included in the study. The
      balance, gait, lower extremity position sense, and foot sole sense will be evaluated.

      The researchers will use t-tests to compare for quantitative variables and chi-square for the
      categorical variables between groups. In addition, the researchers will examine the
      correlations between balance, gait, lower extremity position sense, and foot sole using by
      Pearson bivariate correlations.
