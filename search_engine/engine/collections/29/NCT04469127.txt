      with HER2 Positive Breast cancer tumors. Eligible participants will undergo baseline
      assessments at enrollment. Study participants be administered therapeutic doses of AIP-303 up
      to four treatments spaced 8 weeks apart and a CT scan immediately after. An AIP 301 Ga-68
      PET/CT scan will be performed four weeks before and four weeks after the initial dose of the
      AIP-303. An IEC will review the protocol and any amendments and advertisements used for
      recruitment. The IEC will review the patient information sheet and the informed consent form,
      their updates (if any), and any written materials given to the patients. A list of all IECs
      to which the protocol has been submitted and the name of the committee chairmen will be
      included in the clinical trial report.
