      assessed. Two different weaning methods were used and randomization was performed to choose
      one of the following sequences (baseline, PSV, rest, TT; or baseline, TT, rest, PSV). HRV was
      assessed by heart rate spectral analysis during MV, PSV, and TT. Each intervention lasted 30
      minutes and there was a 30-minute rest period between the interventions. At the end of each
      period of time, the following cardiorespiratory variables were analyzed: respiratory rate
      (f), minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), rapid shallow breathing index (f/VT),
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR) and blood pressure. In the HRV, the
      total spectral power (TP), the low frequency (LF) and the high frequency (HF) components, and
      the ratio between the low/high frequency (LF/HF) components were calculated.
