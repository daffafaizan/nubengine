    
      The clinical study is monocentric, interventional, non randomized, with minimal risk and
      constraints.

      All patients going to the nuclear medicine department for a DaTSCAN exam will be able to
      participate in this study if they understood study informations given by the physician and if
      they signed the inform consent.

      In first, patients will have a DaTSCAN™ SPECT on a conventional camera and after, they will
      have DaTSCAN™ SPECT on VERITON-CT™ camera with two records: one in focus striatum mode and
      the second in focus brain mode.

      The attenuation correction will be made with the computer tomography (CT) recorded at the
      same time as the SPECT (SPECT/CT)
