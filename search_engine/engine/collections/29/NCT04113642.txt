      be enhanced using thoracolumbar fascia for this stability.

      Core, also called 'power house', is a muscular box built from abdominal muscles in the front,
      paraspinal, and gluteal muscles at the back, diaphragm at the top, and pelvic floor muscles
      at the bottom. Deep core muscles control intersegmental motion and respond to postural and
      extrinsic load changes and consist of transversus abdominis, internal oblique, multifidi and
      pelvic floor muscles.

      Myofascial system links latissimus dorsi and gluteus maximus through thoracolumbar fascia
      causing tensegrity-like network in the whole body.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the thickness of abdominal muscles
      during activation of thoracolumbar fascia through contracting the gluteus maximus and
      latissimus dorsi muscles. The hypothesis was that the thickness of transversus abdominis and
      internal oblique would show greater increase when abdominal contraction was performed with
      simultaneous contraction of gluteus maximus and latissimus dorsi (bridge with arm extension)
      than that of abdominal contraction alone (abdominal hollowing) or abdominal contraction with
      simultaneous activation of only gluteus maximus (bridge).

      Thirty healthy subjects (15 women, 15 men) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.
      Thickness of transversus abdominis, internal oblique and external oblique muscles were
      evaluated using ultrasound at rest and during three exercise positions: abdominal hollowing
      in neutral spine, bridge, and bridge with isometric arm extension using ultrasound device
      equipped with 55 mm convex array transducer.
