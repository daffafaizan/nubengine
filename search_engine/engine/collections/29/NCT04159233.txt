      Harvard Football Players Health Study cohort from across the US via email and telephone
      invitations. Following screening, if the participant is eligible and interested, they may
      consent to enroll in the study. Participants will receive evidence-based 'Brief Behavioral
      Therapy for Insomnia' (BBTI), tailored to meet the needs of former football players. BBTi is
      a brief, efficacious treatment that focuses on modifying behaviors, rather than cognitive
      domains. The treatment emphasizes education, motivational tools, and specific behavioral
      recommendations (e.g., restricting time in bed). BBTI has been previously delivered remotely
      and this intervention will be delivered by phone by sleep interventionists including trained
      social workers, psychologists, and nurse practitioners. Participants will complete an intake
      session with their interventionist followed by a 'treatment session' a week later wherein the
      interventionist will provide education about sleep regulation and create an individualized
      schedule of sleep/wake times for the participant. This will be followed by 3 brief weekly
      check-in calls to review progress, address questions and concerns, and adjust the behavioral
      treatment plan as the participant progresses. The participant will complete a daily sleep
      diary throughout the intervention to inform the treatment. Participants will also complete
      baseline, endpoint and follow-up questionnaires to assess outcomes and intervention
      acceptability and feasibility. Participants will receive compensation for their
      participation.
