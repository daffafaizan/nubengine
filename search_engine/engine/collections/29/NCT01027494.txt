      Treatment, i.e., patients with signs of otic infection, to be treated with CIPRODEX; or 2)
      Healthy, i.e., patients without signs of otic infection, to receive no treatment.
      Microbiological specimens were collected from four areas (ear canal, skin, nose, throat)
      during three study visits (Day 1, Day 8, and Day 42), and the specimens collected from the
      Healthy group served as a comparison (control) group for identifying fluoroquinolone (FQ)
      resistant bacterial strains.
