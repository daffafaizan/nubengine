    
      This is a prospective, active-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel, and
      multi-center study. To target 150 evaluable subjects, approximately 200 Taiwanese patients
      with primary hypercholesterolemia or combined dyslipidemia will be enrolled in this study.

      After providing the written inform consent, patients will undergo a complete physical
      examination, vital sign (brachial BP / HR), medical history, and lab assessment, including
      fasting serum LDL-C, TC, HDL-C, TG, and non-HDL. They should not take any hypolipidemic drugs
      for at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment. All eligible subjects will be
      randomized into 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 2 mg 1PC002 or 10 mg atorvastatin
      once daily for 12 weeks.

        -  Study Group: 1PC002 1 cap. q.d. p.o.

        -  Control Group: Atorvastatin 1 cap. q.d. p.o.

      After entering the baseline visit, lipid profiles (including fasting serum LDL-C, TC, HDL-C,
      TG, non-HDL, Apo A1, Apo B and Apo B / Apo A1 ratio), hs-CRP, eGFR, spot urinary albumin /
      creatinine ratio (ACR) and central BP values will be obtained at baseline, Week 4 and Week 12
      for evaluating the effectiveness of study drugs and for any possible changes in laboratory
      data. Non-HDL value will be calculated by subtracting HDL-C from TC. Moreover, serum Cystatin
      C, another biomarker of renal function, will also be assessed at baseline and Week 12.

      For monitoring the safety, biochemical and hematological assessment will be performed at
      baseline, Week 4 and 12. Additional liver function and CK test will be conducted at Week 8.
      The occurring AE(s) and SAE will be followed until resolution or the event is considered
      stable.
