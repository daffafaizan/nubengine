      psychosis patients, that will show a bad response to treatment. Furthermore, automatic
      learning methods were recently successfully applied to neurological data, but never for the
      first episode psychosis patients. These powerful methods are based on multivariate analyses
      allowing the prediction at an individual stage. The possibility to identify more precisely
      the population of non-answering patients would allow the adaptation of the support in first
      attention for these patients, and consequently to perform appropriate cares.

      Researchers propose in this project to evaluate predictive factors of non response. It is
      defined by the lack of symptomatic remission at month 3, for patients presenting a first
      episode of psychosis. It will be performed on objective markers taken from imagery
      techniques. The link between evolution of these markers and clinical measures will be
      studied.
