    
      The investigators propose a randomised, multi-centre strategic biomarker trial of rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) patients with failure to methotrexate or leflunomide to one of the four
      current biological modes of action: targeting TNF (infliximab); co-stimulation (abatacept);
      IL-6R (tocilizumab); and B cells (rituximab); all agents are licensed for RA and have
      evidence for efficacy in this indication. Predictors of response to therapy after 24 weeks
      will be analysed, and include baseline and follow up assessments of clinical, functional,
      structural, laboratory tests (routine, autoantibodies, cytokines, gene expression, and
      susceptibility genes). In a second phase, patients not achieving LDA/REM will be randomised
      to one of the remaining MoA. Two hundred patients, who are started on a new biological
      therapy will be enrolled over an estimated period of 5 years; 50 patients per group will be
      included, and studied for a period of 12 months.
