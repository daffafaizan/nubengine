      secondary eligibility criteria, they will be randomized to receive the IUD immediately
      postpartum or at the 6-week postpartum visit. Women will be followed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks
      after IUD insertion, and be assessed at those time points for satisfaction with the method
      and IUD expulsion.
