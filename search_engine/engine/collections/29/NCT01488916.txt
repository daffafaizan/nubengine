      observational studies. However, the influences of vitamin D concentrations on postprandial
      glucose in type 2 diabetes (DM) are less studied. The purposes of the study are to study the
      effects of vitamin D inadequacy on postprandial glucose excursion and metabolic responses in
      patients with type 2 DM. This is a cross-sectional study. About 150-180 patients will be
      screened for serum levels of 25(OH)D. A total of 45 eligible patients will be grouped into
      three groups by different vitamin D status: vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D insufficiency,
      and the controls. The patients will receive a mixed meal test for postprandial glucose
      excursion and metabolic responses. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be applied to compare
      the differences in clinical characteristics among the three groups. Univariate analyses of
      general linear models will be used to compare the differences in meal-derived metabolic
      indexes among the three groups, showing effects of confounding variables including age, sex,
      obesity, and DM-related clinical parameters. Repeated-measures ANOVA will be used to assess
      the differences in post-challenge glucose and metabolic response in the meal test, with or
      without adjustments of the above covariates. Pearson and partial correlation procedures will
      be used to test the correlations of 25(OH)D with clinical parameters including lipid profile,
      HbA1c, and meal-derived metabolic indexes. Multiple linear regression models will be used in
      an attempt to compare the degree to which 25(OH)D concentrations is associated with the
      meal-derived metabolic indexes in these patients. The investigators hope the study can
      explore the relationship between vitamin D and glucose excursion in patients with type 2 DM.
