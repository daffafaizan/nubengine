      with high risk hematological malignancies whenever feasible. To further improve the outcome
      of transplantation patients with high risk hematological malignancies, the investigators
      developed a modified Bu/Cy conditioning regimen intensified by Ruxolitinib and Decitabine. In
      this study, the investigators tested the efficacy and feasibility of the modified Bu/Cy
      conditioning regimen intensified by Ruxolitinib and Decitabine in Patients with high risk
      hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
