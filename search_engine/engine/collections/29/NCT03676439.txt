    
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a chronic and non-progressive morbid disease that affects psychomotor
      development, with multiple etiologies that share a common condition of acquired perinatal
      anomalies during development.

      The manifestations are multiple and varied, with more frequent motor disorders, speech
      disorders, mental retardation, spasticity, dystonia, etc.. About a third of these patients
      have a normal IQ, for whom those signs are more disabling than for others, and for refractory
      speech problems there is no therapy available These subjects have generally been
      unsuccessfully treated with medications, botulinum toxin injections, rehabilitation or
      kinesic orthosis, maintaining their abnormal stable conditions at the end of childhood or
      early adulthood.

      The rational for this clinical trial is that the author has demonstrated the reduction of the
      excitability threshold of the nociceptive response by electrically stimulating the lateral
      spinal cord in an animal model, therefore, its possible beneficial action on abnormal muscle
      tone, somatic motor functions and improvement of speech, by this method.

      Spastic Cerebral Palsy has been chosen as a targeted population, because it use to be a
      chronic and irreversible condition with few therapeutic options, ineffective and frequent
      complications.

      It is of ancient knowledge that electric currents can alter the functions of the Nervous
      System In the last decades there was a refinement of these techniques of stimulation, being
      able to emphasize especially the Transcranial or Spinal Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). This
      therapeutic method, developed in the eighties, is able to modulate brain activity, through
      the stimulation of limited cortical or spinal areas, with minimal side effects, which is
      applied through a coil that produces an alternating electrical current.

      The constant change of orientation of this alternating current generates a powerful
      electromagnetic field, capable of crossing the cranial scalp and the skull bone or the
      osteo-ligamentary structures and originating an electric current restricted to small areas of
      the brain, cerebellum or spinal cord The objective of the present clinical trial is to
      demonstrate the therapeutic effect of focal stimulation of the spinal cord in speech and
      motor function assessed by Modifyied Aschworth sacale and speech, evaluated through
      Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Scale, selected cases of spastic CP The rational is to
      focus the magnetic impact on the lateral surface of the spinal cord, trying to stimulate the
      spinocerebellar tracts, because of its superficial location, therefore, more accessible.
