      effects include hemolysis (the break down of red blood cells), blockages in the blood
      vessels, and damage to the organs systems of the body. Hydroxyurea, which is given by mouth,
      is used to effectively prevent blockages in the blood vessels of patients with sickle cell
      disease. The hydroxyurea dosage varies and the responses of the body to this drug are not
      well understood.

      This study will follow sickle cell patients being treated with hydroxyurea for a long period
      of time to evaluate the long-term cellular and molecular effects of the drug on the patients'
      body. This study will consist of two patient groups. One group will be made up of patients
      who have received hydroxyurea therapy before entering the study (Old Cohort). The second
      group will be made up of patients who have not received hydroxyurea before study entry (New
      Cohort).

      This is not a therapeutic drug trial. Subjects for this study will receive hydroxyurea
      therapy for accepted clinical indications, and will be treated per best clinical management
      using treatment algorithms established at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and other
      pediatric sickle cell programs across the United States. Hydroxyurea therapy data (such as
      dosing and duration of therapy) will not be dictated by this study, but will be collected to
      correlate with long-term outcomes. Hydroxyurea dose escalation to a stable MTD will occur
      according to published guidelines.
