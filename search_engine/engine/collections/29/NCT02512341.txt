      Computer aided auscultation in the differentiation of pathologic (AHA class I) from no- or
      innocent murmurs (AHA class III) would be of great value to the general practitioner and
      potentially also to the specialist. This would allow objective screening for structural heart
      disease, standardized documentation of auscultation findings, and may avoid unnecessary
      referrals to pediatric cardiologists. Our goal was to further develop and assess the quality
      of a novel computational algorithm that automatically classifies murmurs of phonocardiograms
      (PCGs) acquired in a pediatric population.

      Methods:

      Patients with no-, innocent-, and pathologic murmurs were recruited from the general
      pediatric cardiology clinic. Using an electronic stethoscope, PCGs were acquired by the
      pediatric cardiologist from each patient. The PCGs were analyzed by the algorithm and
      diagnoses were compared to findings by the pediatric specialist and echocardiography as the
      gold standard.

      The following registry procedures and quality factors have been implemented in this
      preliminary clinical study:

        -  Quality assurance plan, including

             -  data validation

             -  proper registration procedures

        -  Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of
           registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (medical records and paper
           case report forms).

        -  Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities,
           including patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis.
