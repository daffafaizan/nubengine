      game. Recently the effect of a new technique, deep transverse friction massage (DTFM), on
      muscle extensibility, strength and agility and injury occurrence has been examined, as
      compared to traditional stretching techniques.

      Hypothesis/Purpose: To compare the effect of DTFM vs static and dynamic stretching techniques
      on hamstrings extensibility, agility and strength among Lebanese and Syrian football players.

      Study Design: This study is a single-blinded prospective longitudinal randomized control
      trial (RCT).

      Methods: Football players were randomized into three intervention groups. Straight leg raise
      (SLR), T-drill, and 1 repetition maximum (RM) tests were used to measure extensibility,
      agility and maximal muscle strength respectively.
