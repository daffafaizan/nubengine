      cancer and 1-5 radiographically visible metastases treated with radical prostatectomy (and
      post-operative fractionated radiotherapy for pT 3a, pN1, or positive margins), metastasis
      directed SBRT, and complete ADT with LHRH analog leuprolide, abiraterone acetate with
      prednisone, and apalutamide (ARN-509) for a total of six months of systemic therapy. The
      primary endpoint of our study is the percent of patients achieving a serum PSA of <0.05 ng/mL
      six months after recovery of serum testosterone.
