      the community environment on physical activity among rural residents. The multilevel
      intervention consists of community, interpersonal, and intrapersonal aspects. The community
      level intervention consists of community events. The interpersonal level intervention
      consists of walking group formation. The intrapersonal level intervention consists of cues
      provided by short message service messages (i.e., text messaging). A dose response
      relationship is expected in the intervention communities.
