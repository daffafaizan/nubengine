      therapy brings huge economic burden to many countries. According to the report of 2015 United
      States Renal Data System (USRDS), the incidence rate of ESRD is 458 people per million
      populations. And the prevalence rate is 3,138 people per million populations, which is the
      highest one in the world. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be classified into five stages
      according to glomerular filtration rate. Whatever the stage it is, patients should keep
      healthy habits about diet and exercise and good adherence to medication. If patients are able
      to monitor their lifestyle, it not only promotes health, but also reduces the cost of health
      care.

      Aim: By application of wearable devices and health management platform to build
      self-management model in CKD patients and analyze the cost of healthcare.

      Material and Methods: The investigators plan to recruit 60 CKD patients as trial subjects.
      The intervention group is composed of 30 participants, and the control group 30 participants.
      The intervention group received intervention with wearable devices and health management
      platform for 90 days. Patients record their own diet diary by a smartphone application, and
      their exercise-related data are collected by wearable devices. Then, all the collected
      information will be upload to health management platform. The investigators also create a
      LINE group to encourage exercise in the experimental group. The investigators compare the
      scores of self-management sheet and physical and laboratory examinations before and after the
      intervention. The investigators also analyze the cost of healthcare within 180 days.
