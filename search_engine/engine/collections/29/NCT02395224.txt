      updated clinical guidelines for diagnosis, staging and treatment. The guidelines represent
      the basis for oncology care in Norway, and health care providers are expected to follow these
      guidelines. Current guidelines are derived from studies where patients are highly selected
      and not representative for the whole cohort of patients with metastatic disease. One can
      speculate if the results of trials conducted in regional centers can be generalized to whole
      populations in a region. In this respect it will be valuable to study advanced colorectal
      cancer in the whole population of Middle-Norway, with both one regional center and all other
      hospitals in the area. More knowledge is needed for the optimal selection of treatment for
      individual patients. In relation to symptom relief, physical and psychological functioning
      and overall quality of life, there is clearly a lack of high quality research.

      A longitudinal follow-up of a large number of metastatic colorectal cancer patients with
      regular assessments has not been previously launched. The existing infrastructure in Norway
      makes the study feasible and will provide high internal and external validity related to
      clinical outcomes. The study will constitute a unique platform for comprehensive research
      aimed at this patient group. It also provides a concept that can be transferred to other
      major diseases, and it can be extended to other health regions of Norway.
