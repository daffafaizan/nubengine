      Nevertheless, in early and late stage of T2DM, lifestyle intervention is mostly substituted
      by pharmacological intervention, although lifestyle modification and dietary treatment would
      be favourable.

      The researchers therefore investigate dietary strategies such as low-carb and very-low calory
      diets regarding their potential to improve metabolism and body weight in (mostly) long-term
      T2DM patients. This core comparison is dealt with in the DiNA-D study (published elsewhere).

      POLYPHEM targets specific dietary approach to preserve the achieved metabolic improvements
      from DiNA-D phase 1. Nutritional factors for the maintenance period within DiNA-D (11 months)
      will be PUFAs and BCAAs, provided by walnuts and custom-made muffins containing walnuts,
      sunflower oil and isomaltulose.
