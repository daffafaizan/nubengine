    
      This is a prospective observational study performed on critically ill patients. Inclusion
      criteria are a severe infection on admission requiring the use of meropenem and CRRT.

      Both medical and surgical patients will be included. Any type of infections can be included
      (pulmonary, abdominal, urinary tract, etc.) Antibiotics regimen includes one-hour infusion of
      meropenem (1.0 gram) intravenously every 8 hours.

      Blood samples (2 mL) will be collected at the 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 480
      minutes after each dose of meropenem for 3 consecutive days. The standard arterial canula
      will be used to obtain samples.

      30 minutes after each sample collection, blood will be centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000
      rpms. Subsequently, supernatant will be collected and frozen.

      Serum meropenem concentration will be measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.

      Each patient's hemodynamic parameters will be recorded with the use of transpulmonary
      thermodilution technique (PICCO). Other therapies, i.e. ventilatory support, sedation, an
      antifungal agent will be given as required.
