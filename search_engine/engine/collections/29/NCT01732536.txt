      study in 100 chronic sinusitis patients who had prior endoscopic sinus surgery and presented
      with recurrent nasal polyps. The objective of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy
      of the S8 Sinus Implant, a steroid-eluting sinus implant, consisting of a bioabsorbable
      self-expanding sinus implant coated with 1350 mcg of mometasone furoate (MF) and a single-use
      delivery system. Implant is placed in-office in the ethmoid sinus under local anesthesia. The
      coating on the S8 implant provides controlled release of MF to the sinus mucosa over 90 days,
      with the majority of drug released within 60 days.
