      with early stage high risk endometrial cancer can be improved then the majority of women
      could avoid a complete systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is
      associated with many intraoperative and postoperative complications such as hemorrhage,
      lymphocyst formation, nerve injury and chronic lower extremity lymphedema. If less invasive
      techniques to assess regional lymph node involvement, such as SLN mapping, replaced routine
      pelvic lymphadenectomy the complications associated with more extensive pelvic surgery could
      be avoided.

      This will be a prospective cohort study. The population to be studied will be patients with
      newly diagnosed early stage high risk endometrial cancer who will undergo primary surgical
      intervention that includes hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic and inframesenteric para-aortic
      lymphadenectomy via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic-assisted. Patients will be taken to
      the operating room for their planned procedure. After initiation of general anesthesia,
      fluorescent dye (indocyanine green, ICG) will be injected into the patient's cervix. The dye
      will be visualized by excitation with an infrared light (an attachment on the Novadaq
      Pinpoint system for laparoscopy). The surgery will proceed and all lymph nodes that are
      "green" will be removed surgically and their anatomic location and laterality documented.
      These "green" sentinel nodes will be assessed by a study pathologist by frozen section and
      the result read out intraoperatively. The hysterectomy and complete lymphadenectomy will then
      be performed. The SLN status will be compared to the status of the other nodes removed at
      complete lymphadenectomy. All data on these patients will be prospectively collected.
