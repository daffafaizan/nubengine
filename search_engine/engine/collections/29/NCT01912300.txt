      composition and a submaximal exercise to evaluate their aerobic capacities.

      They will have then to enter the laboratory on three different occasions in a randomized
      order from 8am to 730pm: At 8am they will receive a calibrated breakfast. then, at 1045; they
      will have to complete one of the experimental condition: 1) one hour of passive video game;
      2) one hour of active video game; 3) a cycling exercise. at 1215 and 0630pm, they will be
      offered ad libitum meals. At regular intervals through the day, their appetite feelings will
      be assessed using Visual analogue scales.

      Energy expenditure will be assessed thanks to cardiofrequencemeters during the 1h PVG and and
      by indirect calomitery (K4b2) during the active video game.

      Ad libitum energy consumption will be assessed by investigators and recorded for each
      participants.
