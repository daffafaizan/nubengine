      Ethicon) with an innovative fixation SIS (Ophira, Promedon) in randomized controlled trial on
      patients undergoing their primary surgery for urodynamic SUI.

      A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) is performed in one tertiary referral
      urogynecology center from January 2015 thru December 2015. Study included women with pure or
      predominant urodynamic SUI confirmed during cystometry by positive standardized cough stress
      test (CST) with urinary bladder filling of 250 ml in lithotomy position. Study was carried
      out on a Caucasian Czech (central European) population. A study power analysis was calculated
      with an expected objective cure rate of minimum 80 % for both patient groups, false non-match
      rate (alpha) of 0.05, and false match rate (beta) of 0.10. A minimum sample size of 80
      patients was required for each group.
