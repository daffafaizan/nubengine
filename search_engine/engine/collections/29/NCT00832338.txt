      whether you receive it before or after surgery. Receiving chemotherapy before surgery, rather
      than after surgery, may allow you to have less extensive surgery by shrinking the size of
      your cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess if docetaxel and cytoxan can shrink the
      size of your breast tumor and allow you to preserve your breast or have less extensive
      surgery on your breast. Additionally, by receiving chemotherapy before surgery, we will be
      able to determine if your cancer is responsive to chemotherapy. Prior to entering this study,
      a special test, called the Oncotype DX assay, will be performed on a small amount of your
      cancer from the biopsy you had at the time you were diagnosed with breast cancer, to
      determine the likelihood that your cancer will benefit from and shrink with chemotherapy. You
      will only be eligible to enter this study if the recurrence score determined using the
      Oncotype DX assay is 25 or greater. Patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancers
      with recurrence scores greater than or equal to 25 have been previously demonstrated to
      obtain a significant benefit from chemotherapy given after surgery.

      In addition, researchers would like to examine proteins present in your blood and proteins
      present in your breast tissue. These additional parts of the study are voluntary and are NOT
      required to participate in this study.
