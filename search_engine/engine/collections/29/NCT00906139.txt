      hypertension complications. Current data suggests that propofol sedation may have advantages
      over benzodiazepines. However, there are few reports comparing propofol versus midazolam in
      patients with liver cirrhosis. The study's objective is to compare propofol associated with
      fentanyl versus midazolam plus fentanyl for sedation during diagnosis or therapeutic UGE in
      cirrhotic patients. A prospective randomized study will include cirrhotic patients (Child A,
      B or C and ASA 2 or 3), referred for diagnostic or therapeutic UGE, randomized for group I:
      propofol (0,5 mg/kg up to 400 mg) and fentanyl (0,05 mg); or group II: midazolam (0,1 mg/kg)
      and fentanyl. Sedation was performed by an exclusively dedicated gastroenterologist. Efficacy
      (completion of procedures), complications (hypoxemia, hypotension, arrhythmias) and recovery
      time (elapsed from the end of the procedure and discharge) will be studied.
