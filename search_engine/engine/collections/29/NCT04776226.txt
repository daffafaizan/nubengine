      chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, stroke and particularly coronary heart
      disease. Post stroke depression (PSD) may develop as a result of vascular disease. A previous
      meta-analysis showed that depression significantly increased the risk of development of
      stroke, and this increase was probably independent of other risk factors, including
      hypertension and diabetes.

      Clarifying this issue has important implications; if depression increases the risk of
      development of recurrent stroke, so treating PSD might decrease the occurrence of recurrent
      stroke. To our knowledge there is no study attempting to clarify the relationship between PSD
      treatment and stroke recurrence. To fill these gap, we systematically conducted a study to
      assess whether PSD is associated with recurrent stroke, cardiovascular events or death. Thus,
      in the current study, three different arms of follow-up of patients with first-ever stroke,
      were used to predict the outcome over 52 weeks.
