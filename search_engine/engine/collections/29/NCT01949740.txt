      I. Determine the stability of Head and Neck Priorities Scale (HNPS) ranking between pre- and
      post-treatment assessments.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Use patient-interviews to refine and modify the HNPS for use in a larger scale trial.

      II. Pilot the Head and Neck Patient Outcomes Survey (HNPOS) as a potential tool to identify
      priorities most important to quality-of-life outcomes.

      III. Use the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H&N) and
      EurolQoL-5D to determine the validity of the HNPOS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in a 45-minute interview comprising assessment of priorities and quality
      of life at baseline, 1, 6, and 12 months.
