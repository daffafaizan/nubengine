    
      This is a randomized, open-label, single centre, Phase 2 trial of RTS,S/AS01 in healthy Thai
      adults.

      Screening and eligibility assessment (Screening visit)

      All potential volunteers will have a screening visit, which may take place up to 30 days
      prior to enrolment. Once informed consent is given, a screening number will be assigned in
      sequential order. Screening numbers will be issued consecutively (e.g. A-01, A-02, A-03…).

      Enrolment, baseline assessment, regimen allocation, and first vaccination (Month 0 / Day 0
      visit; Baseline visit) All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked before enrolment
      in the study. Physical examination will be performed. Any new medical issues or symptoms that
      have arisen will be assessed. Blood will be collected for baseline parasite microscopy,
      haemoglobin and biochemistry. Participants with parasitaemia or anaemia will be treated
      according to national guidelines. Blood will be collected and stored for measurement of
      antibodies against P. falciparum circumsporozoite (anti-CS antibody) until shipment to the
      reference laboratory. Urine will be collected from women of child-bearing age for immediate
      pregnancy test.

      If all inclusion criteria are fulfilled and none of the exclusion criteria apply, the patient
      will be enrolled into the study and a CRF specific to each participant completed. Regimen
      allocation and administration of the vaccine(s) will be on Day 0. The randomization lists
      will be prepared by MORU.

      Randomization numbers will be generated in blocks, for the 7 intervention arms in a ratio of
      20:20:30:30:30:30:30, as follows:

      Each participant will be randomized into one of the following study arms Group 1: RTS,S/AS01B
      Fractional dose group Month 0 and Month 1 will receive RTS,S/AS01B full dose Month 2 will
      receive RTS,S/AS01B fractional dose (1/5th dose)

      Group 2: RTS,S/AS01E Fractional dose group Month 0 and Month 1will receive a double dose of
      RTS,S/AS01E full dose Month 2 will receive a double dose of RTS,S/AS01E fractional dose
      (1/5th dose)

      Group 3: RTS,S/AS01E Full dose group Month 0, Month 1 and Month 2 will receive RTS,S/AS01E
      full dose

      Group 4: RTS,S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Full dose group Month 0, Month 1 and Month 2 will receive
      RTS,S/AS01E full dose + DHA-PIP+PQ

      Group 5: RTS,S/AS01E Fractional dose group Month 0 and Month 1 will receive RTS,S/AS01E full
      dose Month 2 will receive RTS,S/AS01E fractional dose (1/5th dose)

      Group 6: RTS,S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Fractional dose group Month 0 and Month 1 will receive
      RTS,S/AS01E full dose + DHA-PIP+PQ Month 2 will receive RTS,S/AS01E fractional dose (1/5th
      dose) + DHA-PIP+PQ

      Group 7: RTS,S/AS01E + DHA-PIP+PQ Fractional two-dose group Month 0 will receive RTS,S/AS01E
      full dose + DHA-PIP+PQ Month 2 will receive RTS,S/AS01E fractional dose (1/5th dose) +
      DHA-PIP+PQ

      RTS,S/AS01B = Standard dose RTS,S/AS01B: 50µg RTS,S + standard dose AS01B RTS,S/AS01E =
      Standard dose RTS,S/AS01E: 25µg RTS,S + standard dose AS01E DHA-PIP =
      Dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine PQ = Primaquine

      Study participants will be assigned the next available randomization number on the list, and
      thus will be randomly allocated to Group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7.

      Subsequent vaccination visits (Month 1 / Day 0 and Month 2 / Day 0 visits) Subsequent
      vaccination visits will be done according to the schedule of procedures. Physical examination
      will be performed. Any new medical issues or symptoms that have arisen will be assessed.
      Blood will be collected for parasite microscopy, haemoglobin and biochemistry. Participants
      with parasitaemia or anaemia will be treated according to national guidelines. Blood will be
      collected and stored for measurement of antibodies against P. falciparum circumsporozoite
      (anti-CS antibody) until shipment to the reference laboratory. Urine will be collected from
      women of child-bearing age for immediate pregnancy test.

      Before vaccination, the on-going eligibility of the volunteer will be reviewed. All
      participants will attend the clinic for vaccination visits, will be observed closely for at
      least 30 minutes following the administration of each study vaccine, and will receive a paper
      diary card for recording solicited AEs, as described above. Information will be recorded in
      the CRF for subsequent vaccination visits.
