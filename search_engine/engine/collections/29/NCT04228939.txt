      treatment is common with relapse rates ranging between 9 and 52% and being highest within the
      first year following treatment particularly as early as 3 months posttreatment. Even if
      weight restoration is achieved, it is quite difficult for patients to sustain improvements
      after treatment, so aftercare and relapse prevention are essential research topics. There is
      a recent review on internet- and mobile-based aftercare and relapse prevention in mental
      disorders that concludes that there is some evidence that such interventions are feasible
      instruments for maintaining treatment gains for some mental disorders, including eating
      disorders (EDs). However, the authors claim for further high quality, large-scale trials that
      are needed to expand research fields. So, the aim of this study is to prove the efficacy of a
      guided smartphone-based aftercare intervention for inpatients with AN. Our primary hypothesis
      is that at the end of aftercare intervention (T1), the intervention group shows a
      significantly lower eating disorder symptomatology than the control group.

      Eligible patients with AN who are discharged from inpatient treatment are randomized either
      to receive a 4-month smartphone-based aftercare intervention with therapist feedback as an
      add-on element to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Assessments include structured
      interviews as well as online questionnaires and are taken at baseline (discharge, T0), end of
      the aftercare intervention (T1) as well as 6-month follow-up (T2).
