    
      The chosen methodology is a randomised clinical trial where participants are allocated into
      one of two conditions; Contingency Management and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CM+), or
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy alone (CBT) for the treatment of disordered gambling.
      Participants will experience a battery of tests pre- and post-treatment examining clinical,
      psychological, and behavioural issues, including co-morbid substance use. Alberta Rural
      Development Network (ARDN) affiliates will be provided with information regarding how
      participants can access the Qualtrics study site (e.g., an on-line survey hosting company)
      and will be individually directed to the study site by the principal investigator to complete
      the consent form and the base-line assessments. Counselling will be provided free of charge
      using Skype or Facetime video-conferencing internet applications. Participation in each
      condition will last 14 weeks: 12 weeks for treatment, and 2 weeks of assessments (one week
      prior to treatment and one week post treatment). Pre-treatment assessments (including
      demographic information) will take approximately 30-45 minutes, as will the post-treatment
      assessments. The progress check-ups by the Principal Investigator will take 5 to 10 minutes.
      A subset of treatment seekers, counsellors, and community/project stakeholders (e.g., ARDN
      affiliates) will also be chosen to participate in qualitative interviews to explore their
      experiences as well as their perceptions regarding the utility of the program for residents
      of rural and remote areas. The qualitative interviews will take approximately 30-60 minutes.
