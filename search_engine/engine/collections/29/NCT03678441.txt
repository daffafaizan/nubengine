      I. Evaluate feasibility of the electronic batteries, measured by the completion rate and time
      to completion of the batteries.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison of the completion rate and time to completion between the written and
      electronic batteries.

      II. Comparison of the scoring distribution between the screening tools.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess if a history of mental or cognitive illness or ongoing treatment with
      neuropsychiatric medications impact the ability to complete written and/or electronic
      neurocognitive screening.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive the BrainCheck cognitive assessment over 15 minutes followed by the
      paper and pen cognitive assessment within 2 months prior to surgery and within 2 months after
      surgery.

      GROUP II: Patients receive the paper and pen cognitive assessment followed by the BrainCheck
      cognitive assessment over 15 minutes 2 months prior to surgery and within 2 months after
      surgery.
