      will study the impact of clinic-based financial coaching on parent health-related quality of
      life, child developmental risk, and social needs.We will conduct a clinical randomized
      controlled trial of financial coaching for low-income families. Parents of infants in a large
      pediatric primary care safety-net clinic will receive either 1) financial coaching from
      trained coaches plus social needs screening and resource navigation at all well child visits
      (intervention) or 2) social needs screening and navigation alone (active control) and will be
      followed for two years. Aims include:

      1a) Examine parent outcomes of overall health-related quality of life (primary parent
      outcome);

      1b) Examine child outcomes of developmental risk scores (primary child outcome) and
      well-child visit adherence;

      1c) Examine family social needs outcomes including incidence of any food insecurity, housing
      instability, transportation or utilities interruptions (primary family outcome any one or
      more); and financial metrics.
