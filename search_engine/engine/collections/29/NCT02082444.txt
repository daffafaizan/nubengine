      variations of nutrient supply. Therefore, an optimised composition of meals at favourable
      mealtime should be considered for optimal cognitive performance. The increasing
      implementation of all-day schools in Germany requires the children's catering for lunch at
      school. However, the number of 'meal skippers' is increasing among children and adolescents.
      Thus, the effect of skipping lunch at school on cognitive functioning is examined in this
      experimental cross-over trial. As prior intake of food can have an influence on the
      physiological effect of test meal, the children's dietary intake in the mid-morning is
      standardized. The intervention is integrated in everyday school life:

      9.15 a.m. standardized snack within the frame of the regular break, 9.45 a.m. to 12.25 p.m.
      everyday school life, 12.25 p.m. either lunch (control) or water as a beverage (intervention
      of 'skipping meal'), 12.45 p.m. to 1.15 p.m. regular lunch break, 1.15 p.m. computerized
      tests of executive cognitive functioning, 2 p.m. lunch for the 'skipping meal'-group.
      Parameters of cognition with relevance to everyday school life are measured by a computerized
      test program developed by the Institute of Working Learning and Aging (Institut f√ºr Arbeiten
      Lernen Altern, ALA). Usual eating behaviour, sleep behaviour, physical activity and parental
      education were determined as control variables by questionnaires for children, parents.
      Migration background was requested from teachers. Body Mass Index was calculated based on
      measured height and weight.
