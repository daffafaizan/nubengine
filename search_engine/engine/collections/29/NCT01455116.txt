      The patients have a high risk of dying and therefore rapid treatment is of crucial importance
      for survival of the patients.

      Septic shock is mainly due to a collapse in the blood circulation (the capillary system) due
      to blockage by blood cells - a process initiated by substances from the cells of the immune
      system via activation of coagulation. The normal function of the smallest blood vessels is to
      transport oxygen, nutrients and drugs to organs and tissues, and lead waste products away.
      While the offer of oxygen and nutrients to the organs decreases, the consumption of oxygen
      and nutrients increases due to fever and immune reactions.

      When the capillary system collapses, the organs and tissues suffer, and various forms of cell
      death in the organs begins including "programmed cell death" ("apoptosis"). This leads to
      organ damage, for example brain damage or kidney damage and ultimately to multiple organ
      dysfunction which is the direct cause of the patient dies.

      Mild induced hypothermia (cooling to 32 0C-34 0C) affects at least 5 core areas in the
      pathophysiology of septic shock: 1) inhibition of inflammation 2) inhibition of apoptosis
      ("programmed cell death"), 3) antithrombotic, 4) decreases the metabolism and 5) inhibits
      bacterial growth and production of toxins.
