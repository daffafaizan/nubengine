      who suffered a clearly documented ACS (acute myocardial infarction [MI] or unstable angina
      with objective evidence of plaque rupture) or those who underwent significant lesion
      progression in angiography and treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and had
      undergone CCTA from 6 months to 3 years prior to the coronary events.

      CCTA images were screened for plaque characteristics and CFD analysis at core laboratories in
      Elucid Bioimaging, Inc, MA, USA and Shanghai Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Shanghai,
      China, respectively. Lesions with diameter stenosis (DS) > 30% based on CCTA evaluation were
      included analysis. The presence of conventional CCTA-HRPC (minimum lumen area<<4 mm2, plaque
      burden≥70%, low-attenuation plaque, positive remodeling, napkin-ring sign, and spotty
      calcification) and parameters from tissue characterization using VascuCAP software will be
      assessed in each lesion by an independent observer blinded to the clinical data and CFD
      results. The hemodynamic parameters from CFD will include 1) per-vessel FFR derived from CCTA
      (FFRCT); 2) change in FFRCT across the lesion (△FFRCT); 3) FFRCT pullback pressure gradient
      (PPG) index (FFRCT-PPG index); 4) Fractional myocardial mass (FMM) of the target stenosis.

      Using the occurrence of ACS or PCI for the progressed lesion as clinical endpoint, prognostic
      implications of CCTA-derived HRPC or hemodynamic parameters will be analyzed.
