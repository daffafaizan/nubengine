      subject serving as their own control. The study will confirm device efficacy, safety, comfort
      and compliance with the system.

      Subjects who meet the protocol specified eligibility criteria and provide documented informed
      consent will be considered for study participation. There are three phases in the study:
      Screening/Baseline Phase, Trial Phase, Permanent Implant Phase. On confirmation of
      eligibility during the screening/baseline phase, subjects will enter the Trial Phase where
      they will undergo a trial with the Nalu Neurostimulation System. Trials will be done per
      standard clinical practice and per system IFU. Subjects receiving at least 50% reduction in
      their back pain, during the trial phase, will continue to the permanent implant phase.

      Eligible subjects will receive the Nalu Neurostimulation System per standard surgical and
      medical practices and will be programmed for stimulation with one or more therapies to
      optimize pain reduction. All subjects receiving a permanent implant will be followed for
      3-months post device activation. They will visit the clinic at 1 month and 3-months follow-up
      and programming, as required. Adverse Event data will also be collected to support a safety
      endpoint.

      Multiple outcome domains will be captured throughout the study to confirm system performance
      and subject response to the device. These include Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain,
      Numeric Rating Scales for pain, EQ-5D (QoL), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), PROMIS
      Sleep Disturbance SF, Beck's Depression Index (BDI), pain and paresthesia maps, pain and
      wearability diaries.

      At study completion, subjects will return to standard clinical practice.
