      to determine environmental mechanisms that contribute to variation in taste sensitivity.
      Significant controversy surrounds the possibility that consumption of artificial sweeteners
      (AFS) leads to weight gain. Given that the five FDA approved AFSs are found in thousands of
      foods (Yang 2010) this marks a clear and significant gap in knowledge. Our preliminary data
      demonstrate a 3-fold decrease in sweet taste sensitivity following consumption of a beverage
      sweetened with two packets of Splenda for just 10 days. These data provide strong evidence
      that repeated exposure to sucralose reduces perception of sweet taste intensity, most likely
      by down-regulation of the sweet taste receptor. Therefore, it is imperative that we gain a
      greater understanding of the physiological consequences of AFS, since alterations in sweet
      taste perception, metabolism and brain reward that occur in response to AFS exposure may
      promote weight gain.
