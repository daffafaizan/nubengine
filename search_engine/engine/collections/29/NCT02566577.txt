      storage time of units of packed red blood cells, affects cardiovascular function in patients
      receiving transfusions. Transfusion of red blood cells is often used clinically in patients
      with low red blood cell counts in order to prevent disease progression and death. Recent
      studies suggest that the use of "aged" versus "fresh" red blood cells is associated with
      worse clinical outcomes, but there is no clear understanding on how this happens. The
      investigators want to determine the most ideal way of storing and processing blood, and learn
      how transfusion affects the ability to exercise in the study subjects and assess the
      relaxation and contraction of the blood vessels.
