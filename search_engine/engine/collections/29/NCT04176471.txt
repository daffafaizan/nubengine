      (33.5°C ± 0.5° for 72 hours) versus normothermia using targeted temperature management,
      initiated within 6 hours after birth in term neonates with Mild Hypoxic-Ischemic
      Encephalopathy (HIE). Mild encephalopathy will be identified using the 6 component modified
      Sarnat exam as in the Neonatal Research Network of the National Institute of Child Health and
      Human Development trials of TH for moderate-severe encephalopathy and will be expanded to
      include features of mild encephalopathy. Eligible subjects must demonstrate ≥ 2 exam
      abnormalities (mild, moderate, severe) but without evidence of moderate-severe encephalopathy
      (≥ 3 moderate or severe features). The primary outcome is neurodevelopmental outcome at 12-14
      months of age. Secondary outcomes include evaluating the safety profile of therapeutic
      hypothermia in patients with Mild HIE. Therapeutic hypothermia is well tolerated and did not
      demonstrate serious safety concerns when evaluated in multiple large studies of neonates with
      moderate-severe HIE. It is now being applied by some practitioners to neonates with Mild HIE
      without systematic evidence of benefit or potential harm. This data will be necessary in
      order to develop and larger trial of efficacy to be determined at 2 years of age.
