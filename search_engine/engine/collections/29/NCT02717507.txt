    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the impact of a two-year course of low-dose carvedilol on surrogate
      echocardiographic indices of heart failure (HF) risk, including: Left ventricular (LV)
      posterior wall thickness-dimension ratio (LV T-D); LV systolic and diastolic function, and
      afterload; Natriuretic peptides, troponins, and galectin-3.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish safety and tolerability of this two-year course of low-dose carvedilol,
      assessing both objective measures (hepatic function) and patient reported outcomes.

      II. To examine the modifying effect of demographic, clinical, and molecular characteristics
      on the risk: benefit ratio from this two-year carvedilol intervention.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the long-term efficacy of carvedilol in preventing cardiomyopathy and/or heart
      failure in high-risk childhood cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive low-dose carvedilol orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID)
      for 24 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD or BID for 24 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
