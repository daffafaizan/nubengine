    
      52 Week Open-Label Safety Study of cenobamate adjunctive therapy for subjects who complete
      double-blind study YKP3089C025. Subjects will have a 12 week double-blind conversion phase
      where subjects who received placebo in the double-blind study will be converted to
      cenobamate. Subjects who received cenobamate in the double-blind study will continue to
      receive their daily dose of cenobamate. Subjects switching from placebo to cenobamate will be
      titrated starting at 12.5 mg and increase their dose over the course of 12 weeks as followes
      12.5 mg for 2 weeks, 25 mg for two weeks, 50 mg for two weeks, 100 mg for two weeks, 150 mg
      for two weeks, and 200 mg for two weeks. All subjects will receive 200 mg for the last two
      weeks of the conversion phase to preserve the blind. After completing the doubl-blind
      conversion phase, subjects will have 40 weeks of open-label, flexibly dosed cenobamate. The
      dose range is 50 mg - 200 mg. Primary endpoints are all safety measures.
