      sildenafil in women with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant-associated sexual
      dysfunction (SRI-AASD) following the same protocol which previously established efficacy in
      men with SRI-AASD. Women (n=100) with MDD-remission and SRI-AASD were randomized to receive
      sildenafil (50-100mg) or placebo for 8 weeks, followed by 8-weeks open-label extension.
      Sexual function was assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Sexual Function (CGI-SF),
      with positive response defined as a score <3, and UNM-SFI, ASEX, SFQ-FSD sexual function
      questionnaires. Depression was monitored using the HAM-D17.
      Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-gonadal hormones were measured at baseline and DB-endpoint.
