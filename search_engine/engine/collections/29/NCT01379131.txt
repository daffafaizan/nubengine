      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

      Using data from GPRD, MINAP, ONS mortality data and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), this
      study will identify patients with a first MI (STEMI and non-STEMI). Information from
      in-patient hospital visits, general practice data and self-reported data in MINAP, this study
      will allow the quantification of the level and timing of cardiovascular disease before first
      MI. It will also measure the levels of cardiovascular risk factors and chest pain occurring
      before MI.
