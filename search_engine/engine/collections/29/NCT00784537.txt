    
      This study is composed by two phases:

        1. A phase II multi-centre study evaluating in patients with advanced stage Hodgkin
           lymphoma the efficacy of an early salvage treatment with high-dose chemotherapy followed
           by stem cell transplantation in patients FDG-PET positive after two courses of ABVD
           (PET-2 positive).

        2. A phase III randomised study comparing the efficacy of radiotherapy to the areas of
           initial bulky disease versus no further therapy in PET-2 negative patients in complete
           remission (PET-6 negative) at the end of six courses of ABVD.
