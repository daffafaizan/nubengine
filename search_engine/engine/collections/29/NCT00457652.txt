      reduction in cardiovascular events. Apart from it's cholesterol lowering action, rosuvastatin
      may also increase tolerance against ischemia-reperfusion injury. In dogs rosuvastatin
      increases the endogenous concentration of adenosine, by enhancing the activity of the enzyme
      ecto-5'-nucleotidase, which converts adenosine monophosphate into adenosine. We hypothesize
      that rosuvastatin increases tolerance against ischemia-reperfusion injury by induction of
      ecto-5'-nucleotidase and thereby increasing adenosine activity. This protective effect of
      rosuvastatin can be abrogated by using the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine.
