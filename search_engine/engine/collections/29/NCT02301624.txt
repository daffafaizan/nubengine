    
      ECU-MG-302 was an extension study designed to provide the participants who completed Study
      ECU-MG-301 an opportunity to receive eculizumab and collect clinical data to provide
      long-term safety and efficacy information on eculizumab in participants with refractory gMG.

      After receiving blinded study treatment (eculizumab or placebo) in Study ECU-MG-301 for 26
      weeks, participants were eligible to enroll in the ECU-MG-302 extension study. Participants
      were to enter Study ECU-MG-302 within 2 weeks after completing their Week 26 visit in Study
      ECU-MG-301.

      Study ECU-MG-302 consisted of a 4-week Blind Induction Phase to preserve the blinded nature
      of Study ECU-MG-301, an Open-Label Maintenance Phase (up to 4 years), and a Safety Follow-up
      visit 8 weeks after the last dose for participants who withdrew from the study or
      discontinued eculizumab treatment at any time and for any reason after receiving any amount
      of eculizumab.
