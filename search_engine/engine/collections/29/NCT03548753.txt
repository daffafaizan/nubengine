    
      Prospective, blinded multicenter study evaluating the diagnostic performance of coronary
      computed tomography angiography (CCTA) including functional flow reserve derived from CCTA
      (FFR-CT) for the detection and exclusion of significant obstructive coronary artery disease
      (CAD). The reference standard vil be invasive coronary angiography (ICA) including functional
      flow reserve (FFR). Patients referred for elective CCTA because of suspected stable CAD are
      considered. If the initial routine non-enhanced CT scan shows an Agatston score > 399, the
      patient is eligible for study inclusion. Four sites in the region of Southern Denmark will
      participate (Odense University Hospital, Svendborg Hospital, Vejle Hospital and Esbjerg
      Hospital). A total of 278 patients will be included.
