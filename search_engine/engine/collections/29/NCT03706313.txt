      a nerve block. The investigators have developed an effective protocol for pain control after
      knee replacement, but know that many patients still experience pain around the knee after
      knee replacement. There are nerves around the knee that carry pain impulses from behind the
      knee. The investigators believe that placing numbing medicine around these nerves can help
      with pain in front of the knee after surgery, in addition to the standard nerve block placed
      for knee replacement surgery. This may result in taking less pain medication by mouth,and
      having less pain with movement. For this study, before the operation, either a placebo
      solution or the local anesthetic bupivacaine (a numbing solution) will be placed at three
      sites around the knee where these nerves reside. The investigators will evaluate how
      participants feel in recovery after surgery, during the stay in the hospital, and call at
      home one week after surgery. Knowing if numbing these nerves helps with pain after surgery
      will help us further refine our postoperative care plan for patients.
