    
      Men and women who regularly engage in >10,000 steps per day, age 18-45 years, body mass index
      < 30 kg/m2, and with no history of chronic disease will be recruited. Subjects who are
      eligible will undergo an acute period of physical inactivity (10 days) coupled with increased
      fructose consumption (6 cans/day). Physical activity levels will be assessed via a pedometer
      to quantify if individuals achieve <5000 steps/day. Vascular and metabolic function measures
      will be performed before and after the 10-day intervention.
