    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the
      safety and the immunogenicity of two doses of a replication defective HIV-1 vaccine (HIVAXâ„¢)
      in subjects receiving stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) who have an HIV-1
      RNA <50 copies/ml and CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm3. Following the randomized
      placebo-controlled vaccination phase subjects who received active vaccine and who meet
      eligibility will undergo a 12-week analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption followed
      by reinstitution of antiretroviral therapy (or continued interruption) with follow up through
      week 48.
