      congenital heart disease (CHD) with intracardiac or extracardiac communications. In children
      with moderate to severe PAH, the risk of serious complications following the surgical repair
      of shunts (including right cardiac failure and death) is 15-20% or even higher, and the risk
      of late, postoperative residual PAH is ~25%. We therefore intend to conduct a study aimed at
      reducing the risk of severe immediate postoperative complications and the risk of residual
      PAH at six months following surgery to less than 10% in children with moderate PAH (primary
      objective). The study is also aimed at promoting a statistically significant reduction in
      pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance at six month after surgery,
      compared with baseline in children with moderate or severe PAH (secondary objective). We
      hypothesized that these goals could be achieved by treating patients preoperatively and for
      six months postoperatively with sildenafil, either singly or combined with bosentan. Both
      drugs have been approved for treatment of PAH on the basis of randomized clinical trials.
      Preoperative and postoperative (on treatment) hemodynamic evaluation will be based on
      noninvasive and invasive diagnostic procedures. As an additional objective, we intend to
      analyze possible abnormalities in genes that have been shown to be associated with PAH-CHD,
      and inflammatory mediators as well. The idea is to investigate whether changes in these
      markers correlate with the clinical profile and response to treatments.
