      smartphone intervention to increase adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy in
      newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients treated at the Mayo Clinic Arizona
      Center for Sleep Medicine and associated outpatient clinics. This app, called SleepWell24,
      will include PAP adherence behavior change strategies (drawn from the evidence-based Sleep
      Apnea Self-Management Program), cloud-based linkages to a consumer-based PAP machine and
      wearable sensor that provides nightly feedback on PAP adherence and sleep and activity
      metrics, and a component to enhance patient-provider communication. The investigators will
      embed SleepWell24 within usual patient care at the Mayo Clinic Arizona Center for Sleep
      Medicine and associated outpatient clinics for app design/development, patient recruitment,
      and treatment feasibility/satisfaction. This design will ensure the best opportunity for
      clinical adoption. The primary aims are:

      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of SleepWell24 from patient and provider
      perspectives.

      Aim 2: Determine the extent to which SleepWell24 improves PAP adherence over the first 60
      days of use relative to usual care.

      As an exploratory aim the investigators will explore the effect of SleepWell24 on treatment
      outcomes (weight, daytime sleepiness, cognitive performance, health-related quality of life)
      and putative social cognitive and behavioral mediators of PAP adherence (e.g., self-efficacy,
      sleep quality, sedentary behavior, physical activity).

      The investigators will test the feasibility, acceptability, initial efficacy and outcomes of
      SleepWell24 compared to usual care during the first 60 days of PAP use among 94 patients
      newly diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea.
