    
      Background:

        -  Indolent B-cell malignancies are associated with frequent disease relapse

        -  Standard frontline therapy includes a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody with or without
           chemotherapy; novel targeted therapies have changed the treatment landscape and are
           preferred therapy for some patients with high-risk molecular features

        -  Targeted therapies given indefinitely add to drug resistance, treatment-emergent
           toxicities, and non-compliance

        -  CD47 is a rational target for indolent B-cell malignancies; CD47 expression is higher in
           tumor cells than normal B-cells, and blocking CD47 results in phagocytosis of tumor
           cells

        -  Magrolimab is an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody with activity in refractory indolent
           lymphomas when combined with rituximab (a first generation anti-CD20 monoclonal
           antibody)

        -  Obinutuzumab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc
           receptor that may improve antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and
           phagocytosis, when combined with magrolimab

        -  We aim to test the safety and efficacy of venetoclax when added to the backbone of
           magrolimab and obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell
           malignancies

        -  Treatment duration will be response-adapted and time-limited in all patients

      Objective:

      -To determine the safety of the triplet combination of venetoclax, magrolimab and
      obinutuzumab in relapsed and refractory indolent B-cell malignancies

      Eligibility:

        -  Follicular lymphoma (FL) (grades 1-2, or 3a), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mantle cell
           lymphoma (MCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with greater than or equal to 2
           prior therapies, with at least one of those therapies containing an anti-CD20 monoclonal
           antibody

        -  ECOG performance status 0-2

        -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function

      Design:

        -  Phase 1 study with expansion cohorts of up to 76 patients with relapsed or refractory
           FL, MZL, MCL or CLL

        -  The safety profile of magrolimab, venetoclax, and obinutuzumab will first be determined
           in a dose-finding phase of up to 24 patients (6-12 patients with FL and 6-12 patients
           with MZL, MCL or CLL). Patients without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will receive an
           additional 5 cycles (total 6 cycles) of the triplet combination.

        -  After dose-finding is completed, expansion cohorts of each histology will first receive
           magrolimab and obinutuzumab for 2 cycles in a window for translational research. After
           the window, venetoclax will be added and patients will receive 6 cycles (total 8 cycles)
           of the triplet combination.

        -  Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) (after a total of 6 cycles of the triplet
           combination) will stop treatment and initiate active monitoring with radiologic imaging
           and assays for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA); if these patients relapse, they can be
           retreated with an 6 additional cycles. Patients who achieve partial response (PR) after
           6 cycles of the triplet will continue for an additional 6 cycles; then, will initiate
           active monitoring.
