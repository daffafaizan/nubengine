      if a constipation action plan had any impact on improved adherence in management. Children
      are eligible to participate in the study if they are otherwise healthy children whose primary
      language is English with no conditions that would predispose them to develop constipation,
      between the ages of 3 and 8 years of age and if they meet the ROME IV criteria for functional
      constipation. The primary objective is to assess compliance in pediatric patients with
      functional constipation that have been provided a constipation action plan plus educational
      information. The secondary objectives are to assess improvement of constipation symptoms in
      pediatric patients with functional constipation that have been provided a constipation action
      plan and educational information and to assess the perceived effectiveness of the
      constipation action plan from the viewpoint of the family. The proposed study hypothesizes
      that patients diagnosed with functional constipation will have improved adherence to
      medication treatment plan, to fiber intake, and to toilet sit time and have improved
      constipation symptoms overall when provided with both a constipation action plan and
      educational information regarding dietary changes, toilet sit time, and medications as
      compared to education information alone.
