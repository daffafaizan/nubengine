      culture for the diagnosis of genital CT and GC in both males and females. NAAT assays have
      the greatest potential for detecting CT and GC in the rectum; however, no NAAT is currently
      cleared for use with extragenital specimens by the US Food and Drug Administration.

      In order to comply with CLIA regulations, laboratories must perform in-house validations to
      use NAATs with rectal and pharyngeal specimens. There are multiple studies in the literature
      evaluating NAAT assays in diagnosing CT and GC in rectal and pharyngeal specimens using
      expanded reference standards, which includes positive culture result and secondary
      confirmatory NAAT assays. The proposed validation study is intended to provide data to
      support the use of NAAT for rectal and pharyngeal specimens.
