      I. To determine if a gluten free diet (GFD) modulates the rate and severity of bacteremia and
      gastrointestinal toxicity (measured by total parenteral nutrition [TPN] or nothing by mouth
      [NPO] order) in patients undergoing standard acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerance of, and compliance with, a GFD in patients undergoing standard
      AML induction chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive GFD prepared by the hospital per dietary/nutrition pharmacy
      standards from the initiation of induction chemotherapy until hospital discharge
      (approximately 30 days). Patients also complete a daily food intake diary. A stool sample is
      collected from patients at baseline, day 14, and on the day of hospital discharge for gut
      microbiome analysis.

      GROUP II: Patients receive a standard diet for from the initiation of induction chemotherapy
      until hospital discharge (approximately 30 days). Patients also complete a daily food intake
      diary. A stool sample is collected from patients at baseline, day 14, and on the day of
      hospital discharge for gut microbiome analysis.
