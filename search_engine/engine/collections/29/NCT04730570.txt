      into either the intervention or a control group, stratified by parity. No changes to
      in-person care will occur.

      Mothers in the intervention group will receive daily text messages from enrollment after
      birth until six-weeks postpartum.

      Mothers in the control group will receive no content messages.

      Mothers will be recruited both antenatally and postnatally through social media and study
      posters. All recruitment and participant engagement will occur remotely via text message.
      Women who are 37+ weeks pregnant up to 10 days postpartum will be eligible to send a text to
      a study specific number and complete an eligibility screening. If determined eligible once
      they deliver, the participant will be randomized into the intervention or control group and
      they will be asked to complete an electronic consent form and the baseline survey.
      Participants in the intervention group will start receiving the Essential Coaching for Every
      Mother program based on their delivery date up to six weeks postpartum. Mothers in the
      control group will only receive reminder texts to complete the follow-up surveys. Both groups
      will be asked to complete an online survey at enrolment, six-weeks and six-months postpartum.

      The investigators aim to recruitment 140 participants in total, 70 per group.
