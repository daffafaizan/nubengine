    
      52 patients with metastatic or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial. After initial screening,
      patients will attend clinic for baseline examination. Subjects will then be randomly
      allocated to carboplatin and gemcitabine or cisplatin and 5-FU combinations in a ratio of
      1:1. Study visits will occur depending on which arm the patient is on.

      An economic evaluation of the costs and benefits of gemcitabine-carboplatin will be
      implemented within this protocol.
