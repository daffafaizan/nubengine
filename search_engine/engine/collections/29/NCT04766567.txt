      adhesions , uterine rupture (complete/incomplete), impaired uterine healing (partial or
      complete dehiscence/poor/good), placental abnormalities, and perinatal complications in
      subsequent pregnancy are may be associated with cesarean myomectomy. In this study, patients
      who underwent cesarean myomectomy during cesarean section in our institute were analyzed in a
      retrospective manner. Patients were divided into three groups as those receiving serosal
      myomectomy, endometrial myomectomy and those who only underwent cesarean section. The groups
      were compared with respect to the presence of adhesion formation, time to achieve pregnancy
      (fertility), morphology of the myomectomy scar, presence of uterine rupture and placental
      abnormalities.
