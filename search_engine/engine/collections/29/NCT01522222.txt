      receive mechanical ventilatory support during CBB, which consists of a preset/predetermined
      tidal volume, respiratory rate, positive pressure at the end of expiration and FIO2. The
      control group will receive CPB without additional mechanical ventilatory support during
      surgery, which at present is the standard of care.

      The difference between the study and the control group will occur during the time the heart
      is arrested and the lungs, under present standard of care, are no longer ventilated. It is at
      this point in time that those in the study group will continue to receive ventilation,
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation, while their heart is arrested. The subjects will
      have their lungs ventilated six times per minute with a tidal volume equal to 7-10
      milliliters per kilogram. This range, when combined with a consistent PEEP of 5cm of water
      pressure, will allow for the peak inspiratory pressure to be maintained at or below 40cm of
      water pressure. In addition, the FIO2 will remain consistent at the same level that was
      needed to maintain the pulse oximetry at 94% as well as the end-tidal CO2 at 35mmHg. The
      values mentioned for this study have been chosen based on not only investigator preference,
      but also on what is considered "minimally necessary" to prevent atelectasis. Multiple studies
      have been done utilizing PEEP at 5 and 10 cm of water pressure. With the exception of the
      potential for mechanical ventilation during the CBP, the care of the subject, regardless of
      the group randomized into, will be the same. We will in all other aspects continue to utilize
      the current standard of care.
