      of biannual mass distributions of either azithromycin or placebo (i.e, the first two years of
      the trial). All communities were subsequently treated with 2 rounds of biannual mass
      azithromycin (i.e., the fifth and sixth rounds, during the third year of the trial).

      Present trial design: The present trial enrolls all communities previously enrolled in the
      Niger site of MORDOR, and re-randomizes communities to biannual mass distributions of either
      azithromycin or placebo (i.e., the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth rounds of mass drug
      administration since randomization for the original MORDOR trial, occurring in the fourth and
      fifth year since randomization). This results in four patterns of community-based treatment:
      four years of azithromycin (AAAAA), three years of azithromycin followed by one year of
      placebo (AAAPP), two years of placebo followed by two years of azithromycin (PPAAA), and two
      years of placebo followed by one year of azithromycin and then one year of placebo (PPAPP).
      The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality in children aged 1-59 months,as determined by
      biannual census. The mortality rate following re-randomization (i.e., the seventh, eighth,
      ninth and tenth rounds of mass drug administration) will be compared between the two
      re-randomized groups.
