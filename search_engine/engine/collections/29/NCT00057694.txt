      personal or familial medical information because of laws and practices that prevent
      disclosure. A body of research has suggested however that adopted individuals are interested
      in obtaining this information regarding their biological families. The proposed study broadly
      aims to explore adult adoptees' perceptions regarding the potential value of genetic and
      family history information. Specifically it will investigate adoptees' motivations for
      obtaining the information, their perceptions regarding the influence of genetics on health,
      and their experiences with healthcare providers related to adoption and medical information.
      These objectives will be addressed in telephone interviews with English-Speaking adult
      adoptees (over the age of 18 years) that were placed in unrelated adoptive families. A
      semi-structured guide for the telephone interviews consists of a series of open-ended
      questions that explore the objectives of the study. We hope to collect data on about 40
      individuals. The data will be subject to coding for thematic analyses to identify recurring
      trends and themes. This study has implications for genetic counselors as the findings may
      guide the development of appropriate educational messages and counseling recommendations for
      adopted individuals related to their genetic and family history information.
