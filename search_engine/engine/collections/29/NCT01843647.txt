      whose primary tumors are too large to allow for surgery. Reduction in size of the primary
      tumor with neoadjuvant therapy has made it possible for those patients. Moreover, the goals
      have expanded to include: determination of the sensitivity of the tumor so that subsequent
      therapy can be modified accordingly; to prolong disease free survival; to prolong survival.
