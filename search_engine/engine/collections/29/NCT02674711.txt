      several standard self-report questionnaires related to medical history, social demographic,
      and psychosocial variables that are related to low back pain, and often used in clinics that
      manage patients with low back pain. They will then be randomized to either receive the
      education, or only usual care (which is the typical information the surgeon provides the
      patient verbally during the pre-operative appointment). All patients will receive the usual
      care education from their surgeon.

      Education Group:

      The educational video is a whiteboard style patient-centric video. The content of the
      education focus on providing a historical perspective for opioid prescription from the time
      when the risk of dependence was highly underestimated. The video discusses the current
      evidence for the effect of opioid medications in non-cancer on-acute pain. It also discusses
      some of the dangers of long-term opioid usage.

      All Subjects:

      All subjects will receive the usual care education that is typically given by their surgeon.
      That will be left up to the discretion of each surgeon.

      All patients will proceed with the surgical procedure as planned. Each week during the
      1-month period after the surgery, patients will be contacted, and then again at 6 months to
      ask history of prescription opioid utilization.
