      ICU are eligible for participation in this study. Patients will be randomized to receive 1 of
      3 treatments. One treatment is standard of care, a propofol infusion. The other two treatment
      arms are infusions of GPI 15715 (AQUAVAN), one with a bolus and one without.

      Patients will be treated for up to 8 hours and monitored for eight hours post treatment. If
      there are signs of agitation during the up to 8 hour treatment period, the infusion of the
      sedative medicine will be increased according to protocol.

      Blood samples will be obtained periodically during the course of the study for safety
      evaluation and pharmacokinetic assessments. When the patient is ready for extubation or the
      end of the 8 hour study period has been reached, the infusion of the sedative agent will be
      discontinued and the patient will be monitored for 8 hours post treatment.
