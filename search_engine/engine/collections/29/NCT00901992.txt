      as a group program comprising 10 lessons of 90 minutes each. MEDIAS 2 ICT is designed to help
      patients perform multiple-injection insulin therapy and adjust their insulin doses depending
      on carbohydrate consumption, physical exercise, and pre-prandial glucose levels. In addition,
      MEDIAS 2 ICT focuses on controlling metabolic risk factors (elevated lipids and blood
      pressure), coping with the risk of late complications, and reducing the emotional burden of
      diabetes and its treatment.

      The active comparator condition (ACC) consist of a combination of two previously established
      and evaluated education programs - a diabetes education program to initiate mealtime insulin
      and a hypertension education program for the treatment of hypertension. These education
      programs were developed in the 1980s and 1990s and were more didactic-oriented, focusing
      primarily on the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and information about the correct
      treatment of diabetes and hypertension.

      Both treatment arms (MEDIAS 2 ICT and ACC) consisted of 10 lessons, which were conducted as
      group sessions.
