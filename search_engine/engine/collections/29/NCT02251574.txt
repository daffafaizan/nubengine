      The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which occurs when the muscles in your
      throat relax and block your airway during sleep. The most noticeable sign of OSA is snoring.
      OSA is a risk factor for other chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
      disease, and high blood pressure.

      Although anyone can develop OSA, it commonly affects people who are obese. The more someone
      weighs, the more likely the OSA is to be severe. Weight loss is typically recommended for
      overweight individuals to help improve OSA. However, not enough research has been done for
      doctors to be able make specific recommendations to their patients.
