      and embryo quality markers.

      To correlate bioavailable Vitamin D values in follicular fluid from large size follicles with
      embryo euploid status as our main objective. Secondly, looking at morphokinetics and
      mitochondrial content of these embryos.

      Taking into account that most of UAE patients have deficiency or insufficiency of Vitamin D,
      if there is a correlation found we will understand better the underlying mechanism by which
      bioavailable Vitamin D levels may be affecting embryo quality, therefore IVF outcomes.
