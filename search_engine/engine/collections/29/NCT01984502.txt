      toxicities as well functional voice analyses. Adequate waiting periods will be used to ensure
      that fraction reduction does not proceed prior to observing toxicity. The purpose of the
      study will be either to determine the maximal fraction reduction possible until a dose is
      reached where a dose-limiting toxicity occurs. The initial dose and fractionation will be 50
      Gy in 15 fractions with the goal to reduce number of fractions to a dose of 42.5 Gy in 5
      fractions. The rationale for using 5 fractions is that it is tolerated in centrally located
      lung tumors at a dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and thus, is likely to be tolerated in large
      calliber airways.
