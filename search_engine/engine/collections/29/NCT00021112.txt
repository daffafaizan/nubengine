        -  Determine the incidence of radically resected disease in patients with stage IIIB
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with induction cisplatin, etoposide, and radiotherapy
           followed by surgical resection.

        -  Determine the toxicity (morbidity and mortality) of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response rate and pathological response rate in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV on day 1 and etoposide IV on
      days 1-3. Chemotherapy repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Beginning on day 2 of the second
      course of chemotherapy, patients undergo induction radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for
      5-7 weeks. Chemoradiotherapy continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      At 3-6 weeks after completion of the last dose of induction radiotherapy, patients undergo
      lobectomy or pneumonectomy.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and 4 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-62 patients will be accrued for this study.
