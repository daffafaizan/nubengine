    
      This is a phase I/II, controlled, open label, dose escalation study to determine the
      tolerance, toxicity, and clinical effect of the administration of interferon-gamma on the
      clinical condition and immune function of patients with multiply drug resistant M.
      tuberculosis infections (MDRTB). The study drug (interferon gamma) will be administered
      subcutaneously three times a week at three dose levels (0.025 mg/m(2), 0.05 mg/m(2), 0.1
      mg/m(2)) for one year in addition to anti-tuberculous medications, as determined by in vitro
      sensitivities.
