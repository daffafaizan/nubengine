      enrolled in this clinical trial. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the usefulness of the
      liver cancer markers AFP, AFP-L3% (subfraction of AFP) and des-y- carboxyprothrombin (DCP)
      after TACE therapy. Some authors could have shown that AFP-L3% is rising in small tumor
      nodules under 2 cm and so the markers which should decrease after TACE can give a hint for
      the therapeutic response after the intervention. So the important aim of this trial is to
      improve the early detection of tumor recurrence after TACE.

      Furthermore the quality of life measured by the EORTC QLQ C30 before and after TACE is
      evaluated.
