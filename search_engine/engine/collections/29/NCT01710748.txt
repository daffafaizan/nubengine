      associated with greater neointimal suppression than bare-metal stents. However, there is an
      ongoing debate on the optimal drug-eluting stent in diabetic patients.

      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multicenter
      clinical evaluation.

      Diabetic patients (n=112) with de novo coronary artery disease will be randomized to one of
      the 2 treatment arms: 1) Reservoir-Based Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent or 2)
      Polymer-Based Everolimus-Eluting Stent.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent
      implantation is effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia as compared to Polymer-Based
      Everolimus-Eluting Stent in diabetic patients, using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) as
      the primary imaging modality.
