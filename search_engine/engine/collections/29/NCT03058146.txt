      settings) with older adults have consistently shown improved cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular health and improved cognitive function. What is lacking is the development of
      interventions that take place in real world environments and that take advantage of new
      technologies to help objectively track real time physical activity behaviors. Real world
      physical activity interventions have the potential to reach a larger segment of the
      population and to enhance maintenance after the intervention period ends. This study will
      develop a novel physical activity intervention using mobile health technologies to promote
      physical activity levels likely to affect cerebral blood flow and cognition in real world
      environments in cognitively normal older adults. A randomized controlled trial will be
      conducted with 30 participants being assigned to the mobile health physical activity
      condition (walking in free-living environments tracked via mobile health technologies) and
      another 30 to an education control condition (at home reading about healthy aging materials)
      for 3 months.
