      functional autonomy of elderly women with impaired muscle-skeletal system depending on the
      normal IGF-1 level. The target-population was composed by elderly women aged between 60 and
      75 years (age: 67.79 ± 5.11 years, BMI: 28.01 ± 5.4), residents of an asylum, with IGF-1
      levels within the normal values for the age (normo-IGF-1). Evaluations of the muscle strength
      (1-RM test) and the functional autonomy (GDLAM Protocol) in the performance of activities of
      daily living (ADL), and a measurement of basal serum levels of IGF-1 (Chemiluminescence
      method) were performed.
