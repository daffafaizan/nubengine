      drops are thought to temporarily deswell the cornea.

      During morning hours, patients with Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) typically
      report poor vision and disturbing glare because of corneal edema. To improve vision in
      advanced stages of the disease, corneal endothelial transplantation has become the treatment
      of choice. Many patients with Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) use hyperosmolar
      eye drops before transplantation. At present, it is unclear, how much hyperosmolar eye drops
      help reducing corneal edema in Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). Based on our
      previous work that determined the amount of additional corneal edema in the morning in
      patients with Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), the investigators will assess if
      hyperosmolar eye drops speed up the deswelling process.
