    
      Kabuki Syndrome (SK - OMIM 147920 and 300867 ORPHA: 2322) is a rare genetic disease with a
      prevalence of approximately 1/32 000 and responsible for a malformation syndrome with mild to
      moderate intellectual impairment. SK is due to mutations in the KMT2D and KDM6A genes. As
      part of a national PHRC (AOM 07-090, clinicaltrial NCT01314534, The investigators were able
      to perform psychometric tests type WISC4 and MRI type VBM). Disability in SK is characterized
      by a heterogeneous cognitive profile with strengths and weaknesses when calculating IQ. Brain
      MRI reveals small hippocampi compared to controls. These 2 data are partly contradictory
      because the strengths of the patients with SK are a working memory and a verbal comprehension
      index high compared to the other indices of the tests WISC-IV.

      The objective of the research is to better understand the mnesic function of children with
      SK.

      25 children aged 6 to 16 will be recruited. The diagnosis of SK will have been authenticated
      by the demonstration of a mutation in the KMT2D or KDM6A gene.

      The memory assessments will be conducted in one visit for each child, who will perform a
      memory assessment with a neuropsychologist, using the CMS scale.
