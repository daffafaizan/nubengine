      intervention, added as a component to normal early childhood education, in supporting the
      development of executive functioning in 3-5-year-old children in comparison to early
      childhood education without such a component. 12 day care centers in Finland have been
      randomized to intervention (n = 6) and control (n = 6) groups. The children in the
      intervention group will receive the intervention in the spring of 2021, and the children in
      the control group will be on the wait list and receive the intervention in the fall of 2021
      after measurements. In the day care centers belonging to the intervention group, play
      sessions supporting the development of children's executive functioning will be arranged as a
      part of normal early childhood education. The pre-selected games target children's executive
      functions and self-regulatory abilities, e.g. inhibition, attention, working memory and
      emotion regulation. The first phase of the intervention (6 weeks) includes play sessions for
      all children as well as a parents' evening. In the second phase (8 weeks), more
      individualized play sessions are arranged for the children that exhibit difficulties in
      executive functions after the first phase. Also, a parents' group is arranged in this phase,
      which will expand the daily play activities to homes. Day care education personnel and
      parents fill out questionnaires concerning children's behavior at 4 time points, and the
      children participating in the second phase (small group activity) will complete two iPad
      tasks before and after the small group activity. The study takes place in Finland.
