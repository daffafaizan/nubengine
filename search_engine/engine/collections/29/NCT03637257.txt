      as central and/or obstructive apnea resulting in hypoxemia. Various factors such as patient
      comorbidities, medication and inconsistent physiologic monitoring are known to contribute to
      or facilitate adverse events during sedation. Therefore, monitoring of breathing by
      capnography is recommended and has become common standard e.g. by the use of a CO2/O2 nasal
      cannula.

      However, capnography derived from CO2/O2 nasal cannulas may be impaired and these impairments
      are exaggerated in infants based on their physiologic characteristics (small tidal volumes,
      high respiratory rates).

      To overcome these impairments, the investigators developed a modified CO2/O2 Guedel airway
      including a CO2 sampling port at the tip of the airway. In a previous study, significantly
      more accurate capnographic signals resulted compared with measurements derived from a nasal
      cannula when using a modified CO2/O2 Guedel airway in a model of a breathing 6-month-old
      manikin.

      The aim of the study is to examine the accuracy of capnographic measurements of the modified
      CO2/O2 Guedel airway in comparison with measurements from a CO2/O2 nasal cannula in sedated
      children aged 4 - 24 months.
