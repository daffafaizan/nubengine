      annually. Interventions designed to educate patients to seek treatment sooner when a stroke
      occurs may increase low rates of treatment with thrombolysis (current rates 3% national
      average). Thrombolysis can increase the odds of minimal to zero disability from stroke if
      emergency medical system response times and in-hospital response times are optimized (maximum
      time from symptom onset to intravenous thrombolysis is 4.5 hours). Black and Hispanic
      Americans have higher stroke incidence compared to Whites and are less likely to receive
      thrombolysis for acute stroke. The latency to hospital arrival is largely dependent on
      patients' recognition of stroke symptoms, and immediate presentation to the emergency
      department. The investigators have found very low stroke literacy rates among Blacks and
      Hispanics compared to Whites, which may, in part, be responsible for disparities in acute
      stroke treatment.
