    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if near-infrared fluorescence imaging of panitumumab-IRDye800 can identify
      metastatic disease in regional neck lymph nodes of patients with head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if panitumumab-IRDye800 can identify sentinel nodes with the same accuracy as
      technetium Tc 99m-labeled tilmanocept (Lymphoseek).

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 2-5 days before surgery, patients receive panitumumab IRDye800 intravenously (IV)
      over 60 minutes. On the day before surgery, patients also receive technetium Tc 99m-labeled
      tilmanocept via injection and undergo lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed
      tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.
