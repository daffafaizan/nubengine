      Chinese adults. To investigate the clinical predictive value of p16 methylation diagnostic
      reagents in the early diagnosis of oral cancer, the investigators carried out the prospective
      multi-center double-blind cohort study.

      Methods:180 patients with histologically confirmed mild or moderate OED were included in the
      present study. The investigators using p16 methylation diagnostic reagents to analysis of the
      p16 methylation status in these patients. Building two follow-up queue by p16-methylated and
      p16-unmethylated. The Statistical analysis used SAS6.12 software. All P-values were
      two-sided. P<0.05 was considered to test for statistical significance difference.
