      platelet reactivity (HPR) in one hundred patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI), at the
      Keck Hospital of USC and Los Angeles County Medical Center (LAC+USC). Platelet inhibition to
      aspirin will be evaluated with the VerifyNow® aspirin (ASA) test. Clopidogrel platelet
      inhibition will be evaluated with two different tests: the vasodilator-stimulated
      phosphoprotein (VASP) and the VerifyNow® purigenic receptor P2Y12 (VN-P2Y12) assays. All
      platelet function analyses will be performed once after a minimum of one week of
      uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. High on-treatment
      Platelet Reactivity on aspirin treatment (HPRA) group will be defined as aspirin reaction
      units (ARU) ≥550 by the VerifyNow® ASA assay. High on-treatment Platelet Reactivity on
      clopidogrel (HPRC) group will be defined as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) ≥208 by the VerifyNow®
      assay and Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI) ≥50% by
      the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay. All other patients will be assigned
      to the adequate platelet reactivity on therapy (APR) group. Prevalence of high on-treatment
      platelet reactivity will then be calculated for aspirin and/or clopidogrel
