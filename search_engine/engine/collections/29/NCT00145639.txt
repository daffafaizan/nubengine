    
      This study has multiple research objectives:

        -  To compare the response rate of pre-surgical chemotherapy comprised of ifosfamide,
           doxorubicin, and carboplatin to that obtained with ifosfamide and carboplatin in the St.
           Jude OS-91 trial for patients with non-metastatic resectable osteosarcoma

        -  To continue the evaluation of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
           (DEMRI) in predicting tumor response and accurately assessing the degree of response
           (continued from OS-91).

        -  To determine the feasibility of delivering outpatient-based chemotherapy for
           osteosarcoma using ifosfamide-doxorubicin-carboplatin.

        -  To determine whether resection of the primary site may be satisfactorily performed with
           a 3 cm margin of normal bone (rather than 5 cm).

        -  To study biologic and biochemical characteristics of the tumor cells that may be of
           prognostic significance

        -  To study the patients' and parents' perspectives of the patients' quality of life during
           and after treatment.

      Description of Treatment Plan:

      This study employs the following treatment strategy: neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by
      definitive surgery for local control and adjuvant chemotherapy after tumor resection.

      Pre-operative chemotherapy phase (weeks 0-12): Three courses of ifosfamide/carboplatin given
      every 3 weeks followed by one 3-week course of doxorubicin.Disease evaluation is performed
      after 3 courses and after 4 courses of chemotherapy.

      Weeks 0, 3, and 6 - Ifosfamide-Carboplatin Ifosfamide: 2.65 gm/m2 IV daily over 15-30 minutes
      x 3 (Days 1, 2, 3) with MESNA. Carboplatin: dose based on GFR and targeted to an AUC of 8
      mg/mL/min, given IV over 1 hour (Day 1 only)

      Week 9- Evaluation, followed by Doxorubicin Doxorubicin: 25 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour, daily x 3

      Week 12 Evaluation followed by definitive Surgery Local control by amputation or limb-salvage
      procedure

      Post-operative chemotherapy (Weeks 14-35) Ifosfamide, carboplatin, and doxorubicin in
      two-agent pairs for approximately 35 weeks.

      Week 14 - Ifosfamide-Doxorubicin Ifosfamide: 2.65 gm/m2 IV daily over 15-30 minutes x 3 (Days
      1, 2, 3) with MESNA, Doxorubicin: 25 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour, daily x 2 (Days 1 and 2)

      Week 17 - Ifosfamide-Carboplatin Ifosfamide: 2.65 gm/m2 IV daily over 15-30 minutes x 3 (Days
      1, 2, 3) with MESNA, Carboplatin: targeted to an AUC of 8 mg/mL/min given IV over 1 hour (Day
      1 only)

      Week 20 - Carboplatin-Doxorubicin Carboplatin: targeted to an AUC of 8 mg/mL/min given IV
      over 1 hour (Day 1 only), Doxorubicin: 25 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour, daily x 2 (Days 1 and 2)

      Week 23 - Evaluation, followed by Ifosfamide:

      Doxorubicin. Ifosfamide: 2.65 gm/m2 IV daily over 15-30 minutes x 3 (Days 1, 2, 3) with
      MESNA, Doxorubicin: 25 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour, daily x 2 (Days 1 and 2)

      Week 26 - Ifosfamide-Carboplatin Ifosfamide: 2.65 gm/m2 IV daily over 15-30 minutes x 3 (Days
      1, 2, 3) with MESNA, Carboplatin: targeted to an AUC of 8 mg/mL/min given IV over 1 hour (Day
      1 only)

      Week 29 - Carboplatin-Doxorubicin Carboplatin: targeted to an AUC of 8 mg/mL/min given IV
      over 1 hour (Day 1 only), Doxorubicin: 25 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour, daily x 2 (Days 1 and 2)

      Week 32 - Evaluation, followed by Ifosfamide-Doxorubicin. Ifosfamide: 2.65 gm/m2 IV daily
      over 15-30 minutes x 3 (Days 1, 2, 3) with MESNA, Doxorubicin: 25 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour, daily
      x 2 (Days 1 and 2)
