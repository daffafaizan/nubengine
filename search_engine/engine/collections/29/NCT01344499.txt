        -  to evaluate whether the clearance rate of peritoneal fluid is exponential or linear over
           time. (absorption rate expected for Adept ~30-60 ml/h)

        -  to evaluate the role of the mesothelial barrier in this clearance rate.

      Knowing that diffusion to and from peritoneal fluid decreases with increasing molecular
      weight (MW), our hypothesis is that clearance rate will decrease following peritoneal
      conditioning. Indeed a decreased mesothelial trauma (either through hypoxia or through
      denudation) and retraction will expose less the basal membrane

      Secondary endpoints:

      -To confirm the decrease in post-operative pain as measured by VAS-score and inflammation as
      measured by CRP and leucocytosis with the full conditioning of the pneumoperitoneum.
