      colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) in combination with interleukin-2 and vinblastine on the
      response rate of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. II. Assess the potential
      toxicities of this treatment combination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a single arm, nonrandomized study. Patients receive vinblastine as an IV
      bolus once every 2 weeks. Interleukin-2 is administered by subcutaneous injection on days 1-5
      each week for 9 weeks. Sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor;
      GM-CSF) is administered by subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 each week for 9 weeks. Each 9
      week cycle is followed by 3 weeks of rest. Patient may continue treatment for a maximum of 5
      cycles in the absence of disease progression. Patients are assessed every 12 weeks for the
      duration of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20-35 patients will be accrued into this study.
