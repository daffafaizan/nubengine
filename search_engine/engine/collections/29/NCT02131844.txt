    
      The primary research question of this study is: to what extent does postoperative
      facilitation of early mobilization impact on recovery of functional walking capacity at 4
      weeks after surgery in comparison to standard care (preoperative education).

      The hypothesis is that, by 4 weeks after surgery, facilitated early mobilization will result
      in a greater proportion of participants returning to preoperative levels of functional
      walking, as measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT).
