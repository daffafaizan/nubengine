        -  To generate a translational ovarian cancer model using tumor tissue and cells from
           patients with stage III-IV ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube epithelial cancer
           for drug response and development.

      OUTLINE: Tissue and fluid samples are collected at the time of surgery or paracentesis and
      used in laboratory experiments and in animal models. Health data is collected from patient
      medical records before, during, and after surgery.

      After surgery, patients are followed up for 5 years.
