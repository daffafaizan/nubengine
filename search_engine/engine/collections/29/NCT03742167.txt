    
      In the United States, the current standard of pre-hospital (out-of-hospital) emergency care
      for children with life-threatening illnesses in the community includes remote physician
      medical direction for paramedics providing life-saving therapies while transporting the child
      to the hospital. Most pre-hospital emergency medical service (EMS) agencies use radios
      systems for audio communication between paramedics and physicians. This communication
      strategy is inherently limited as the remote physician cannot visualize the patient for
      accurate assessment and to direct treatment.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether use of a 2-way audiovisual connection
      with a pediatric emergency medicine expert (intervention = "telemedical support") will
      improve the quality of care provided by paramedics to infant simulator mannequins with
      life-threatening illnesses. Paramedics receiving real-time telemedical support by a pediatric
      expert may provide better care due to decreased cognitive burden, critical action checking,
      protocol verification, and error correction.

      Because real pediatric life-threatening illnesses are rare, high-stakes events and involve a
      vulnerable population (children), this pilot randomized control trial will provide early data
      on the efficacy of this intervention in simulated cases of pediatric medical emergencies. The
      primary outcome is "paramedic resuscitation performance" measured by a checklist of
      observable critical actions by independent reviewers during live observation and video
      review. The results of this study will provide important pilot data to estimate the clinical
      effect of this intervention and the sample size needed for a future definitive trial with
      children, a vulnerable population.
