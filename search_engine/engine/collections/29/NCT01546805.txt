      dystonias such as blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. It has also gained widespread use for
      cosmetic purposes. The efficacy and duration of its effect is not constant amongst all
      patients. Some patient respond very well, while others have no clinical benefit or the
      clinical benefit does not last as long as expected. Zinc is known to be an important
      co-factor in the molecular effects of Botox. The investigators hypothesize that one of the
      many factors that may contribute to the variability in the response to Botox may be the level
      of Zinc available within the neuromuscular junction of those patients. The investigators plan
      to to test whether or not giving patients supplemental Zinc with their Botox injections would
      help improve the magnitude and duration of the intended clinical effect.
