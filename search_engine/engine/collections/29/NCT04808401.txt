      factors for CAD undergoing elective or non-emergent non-cardiac vascular surgery will be
      recruited. Three blood samples for levels of myocardial biomarkers will be obtained at
      different perioperative time points (before anaesthesia induction, 2 hours after skin closure
      and 24 hours after the end of the surgery). The three myocardial biomarkers investigated are
      high-sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT), N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) and heart-type
      fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP). In the timeframe shortly after the induction of
      anaesthesia and prior to the start of surgery, myocardial strain as a marker of cardiac
      function will be measured by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Echocardiography
      measurements will be acquired at two different oxygen states for each patient.The fraction of
      inspired oxygen (FiO2) will be adjusted to reach a normoxaemic state (FiO2=0.3) and a
      hyperoxic state (FiO2=0.8). Patients will be randomized to which oxygen level is investigated
      first. Thereafter, the patients are again randomly assigned to either the normoxaemic or the
      hyperoxic state for the remainder of the perioperative treatment until 2 hours after skin
      closure. Surgery will be performed as planned by the treating team. Differences in the
      perioperative levels of myocardial biomarkers at the different time points and their dynamics
      will be assessed. Echocardiography images will be analyzed in a blinded manner for cardiac
      function and systolic and diastolic strain parameters. The results will help
      anaesthesiologists to better weigh risks and benefits when selecting an inspired oxygen
      fraction in such patients, and will help to evaluate hyperoxia as a risk factor for
      myocardial injury.
