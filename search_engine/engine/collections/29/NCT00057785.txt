        -  Determine the transportability of IMRT to a multi-institutional setting.

        -  Determine the rate of late xerostomia in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer treated
           with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy.

        -  Correlate reduction of side effects on salivary flow with compliance in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Determine the rate of local-regional control, distant metastasis, and disease-free and
           overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the acute and late toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine chemotherapy compliance in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo daily intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for
      approximately 6.5 weeks (total of 33 fractions) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with stage T2b or greater and/or node-positive disease receive cisplatin IV over
      20-30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 concurrently with IMRT followed by cisplatin IV over
      20-30 minutes and fluorouracil IV over 96 hours starting on days 71, 99, and 127.

      Quality of life is assessed through saliva measurement at baseline and then at 3, 6, and 12
      months after IMRT.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 64 patients will be accrued for this study within 36-40 months.
