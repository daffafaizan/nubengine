    
      The study is a randomised controlled trial with a crossover design conducted at several
      international study centres.

      The study population is early and continuously treated patients with PKU that are adhering to
      their prescribed diet.

      The participants will be given both a CGMP based protein substitute and a free AA based
      protein substitute as their main protein source on two different 12-week periods in a
      crossover design. The two periods will be separated by a 4 week wash out period.

      The protein substitutes will be consumed daily together with the patient's regular low
      protein diet during the intervention periods.

      Primary Objective The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effects of a CGMP
      based formula compared to an AA based formula upon mean plasma Phe levels after 12 weeks of
      daily intake in patients with PKU.

      Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of the study are to investigate if a CGMP based
      formula compared to an AA based formula in PKU patients provides any long-term health
      benefits concerning gut health, inflammation, oxidative stress and product acceptability.
