    
      The qualitative studies will explore use of OCT Angiography (OCTA), Swept Source OCT
      (SS-OCT), Ultra-Wide Field Fluorescein Angiography (UWF-FA), Adaptive Optic Scanning Laser
      Ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO), Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Ophthalmoscopy (FLIO), Retro Mode
      Imaging (RMI) and other novel technologies for the retinal diagnosis. Morphologic qualitative
      IBs described in the literature like macular neovascularization pattern, retinal tubulations,
      choriocapillary preservation, retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, drusen patterns, etc as
      well as other IBPAMD original IBs classified in morphopathogenic categories like IBs
      related-to-MNV, IBs related-to-atrophy, IBs related-to macular chorio-retinal architecture,
      etc are analyzed in granular fashion by multi-modal imaging approach before and after
      different treatments for AMD.

      The quantitative IBs assessment will be done in dual mode - classic and original to the
      IBPAMD trial. The lesions are quantitatively assessed on one hand, by using the classic
      measurements of the greatest diameter, total lesions area, vessels density, fractal
      dimension, etc, based on the classic concept of measurements expressed in absolute values
      (mm, mm2 or pixels). The same lesions are quantitatively assessed by using the original
      IBPAMD algorithm and software (SITE-app) that introduce a new concept in the quantification
      of the retinal lesions, the assessment of differences reported to the baseline.
