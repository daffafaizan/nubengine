      different materials in partial pulpotomy treatment. 50 patients with 54 asymptomatic,
      cariously exposed young permanent mandibular molar teeth were included to the study. The
      teeth were randomly divided into three main groups which were; calcium hydroxide, MTA and
      BiodentineÂ® and finally restorated with stainless steel crowns. Pain, percussion sensitivity,
      palpation sensitivity of soft tissue around the tooth, root development, presence of lesion,
      integrity of lamina dura were evaluated clinically and radiographically during 12 months and
      recorded for each. Also, Image J Program with Turbo-Reg plug in was used for standardization
      of the radiographs and to determine the increase in root length.
