      sepsis by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and by susceptible Escherichia coli in
      rabbits where clarithromycin was administered intravenously. Data from these latter studies
      suggest that administration of clarithromycin extended survival and attenuated systemic
      inflammatory response. Their major endpoint was successful immunotherapy achieved when
      clarithromycin was administered on presentation of symptoms of sepsis-induced pulmonary
      edema; on the contrary, former clinical trials for immunotherapies of sepsis were based on
      animal studies where the under evolution immunomodulator was administered before bacterial
      challenge. The efficacy of administration of clarithromycin upon presentation of septic
      syndrome in animal studies, renders its application promising in the clinical field.
