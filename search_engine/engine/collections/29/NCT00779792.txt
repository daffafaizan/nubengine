      disease. One way to study ICD is to expose healthy volunteer skin to chemicals and evaluate
      the skin response. Because different chemicals act differently on the skin, the use of
      different skin irritants may provide more information than relying on one irritant only. In
      this study the two commonly used irritants sodium lauryl sulphate and nonanoic acid are
      exposed to the skin in a cumulative wash test. Treatment of ICD has classically involved
      topical steroids and/or emollients. However, the outcome is variable with some patients being
      very refractory to this regimen. This study was designed to investigate the relative efficacy
      of the steroids triamcinolone acetonide and clobetasol, the topical immune modulator
      tacrolimus, a 20% Glycerol ointment compared with an inert ointment vehicle on experimentally
      induced irritated skin.
