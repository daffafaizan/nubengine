      continues into adulthood.The main two symptoms are inattention and hyperactivity.

      As epilepsy is one of the commonest comorbidity with ADHD to about (40%), there are many
      overlap symptoms between both disorders for example:

        -  Behavioral features which are shared in both frontal lobe epilepsy with ADHD such as
           impulsivity, disinhibition, and irritability

        -  The electroencephalogram: there is an increase in the rate of spikes in children with
           ADHD with no epileptic symptoms, which supports the theory of presence similar mechanism
           about central nervous system dysfunction.

      These reasons lead to increase obstacles for diagnosis, assessment, and treatment for both
      disorders.

      As this comorbidity duplicates the complications (i.e. drop the school, financial cost,
      stress on families, negative effect on academic, vocational, social relations and self-esteem
      ) so there is a great need to study this comorbidity to give a proper care for these
      patients.

      In this study, all participants will be enrolled over a period of 12 months from Assiut
      outpatients clinic .All participants will be assessed in the psychiatric interview by using
      prepared child and adolescent psychiatric sheet include (psychiatric and neurology history,
      physical examination and mental state examination). After that electroencephalogram(EEG) will
      be done to diagnoses epilepsy and identify different types of seizures.

      All participants will be categorizing into 4 groups ( ADHD, epilepsy, ADHD,and epilepsy,
      healthy) according to EEG and the psychiatric sheet. Each group will be assessed by different
      psychometrics scales to evaluate cognitive, social, economic and behavioral outcome. The
      results of all groups will be analysed by using Stata version 15 to evaluate the effect of
      ADHD and epilepsy in children and adolescent and identify the possible risk factors to
      improve outcome
