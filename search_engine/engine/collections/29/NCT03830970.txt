      examine the effects of consuming varying doses of canned mixed beans on fasting serum lipid
      profiles in hypercholesterolemic adults. In a randomized order, all participants will
      complete three 4-week study treatments consuming daily amounts of 1 cup canned mixed beans, Â½
      cup canned mixed beans and 1 cup of white rice separated by a 4-week washout period. At the
      start and finish of each treatment period, fasting blood will be collected and analyzed for
      lipids, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), alipoproteins, glucose and insulin. Fecal samples
      will also be collected and analyzed for bile acids, SCFA and gut microbiota. The effect of
      mixed bean consumption on height, body weight and blood pressure will also be examined.
