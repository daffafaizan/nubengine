        1. To study biology of wound derived inflammatory cells and fluid from diabetic versus non
           diabetic wounds.

        2. To characterize mechanisms that are responsible for dysregulated wound inflammatory cell
           function in individuals with diabetes.

        3. To characterize differences in the biology of normal peripheral blood derived cells
           versus wound derived cells.

      The long-term goal of this study is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired
      wound healing in diabetics.
