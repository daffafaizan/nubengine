      development of a novel ultra-brief intervention for anxiety-related psychiatric disorders
      such as panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Building off innovative
      work in the basic neuroscience of fear memory interference (see Stern et al., 2018 for a
      review), this experiment will be the first to evaluate whether cannabidiol (CBD) can
      interfere with the reconsolidation of naturally acquired pathological interoceptive fear
      memory in humans.

      Participants who meet DSM-5 criteria for panic disorder or subthreshold elevated concerns
      about having additional panic attacks will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions:
      (1). Memory reactivation + CBD, (2). Memory reactivation+ Placebo, or (3). CBD alone.

      NOTE: Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic all study procedures will occur online and over
      videoconference with study staff. Additionally, CBD or placebo oil will be mailed to the
      participant's location.
