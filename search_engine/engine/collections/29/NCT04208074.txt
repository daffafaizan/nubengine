      lower recurrence than women with weaker and smaller muscles. However, the mechanism for this
      association is currently unknown. A recent study from the investigators has shown that there
      is an association between the frequency of immune cell types that kill cancer and higher
      muscle mass and strength, with higher muscle mass and strength correlating with a higher
      frequency of cancer killing, effector memory, T cells. The investigators thus propose that
      increasing muscle mass and strength can improve overall survival and reduce recurrence by
      increasing the number of cancer killing immune T cells.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will recruit 30 breast cancer survivors to an
      exercise program designed to increase their muscle mass and strength. The program will be
      optimized to each participant's level of fitness and strength and will be designed by experts
      in the field. Personal trainers will teach the participants how to exercise and use muscle
      resistance training equipment using the correct technique and will monitor progress to avoid
      injuries and to maximize training benefits.

      The investigators will collect blood (to study immune cell subsets) and measure muscle
      strength and body composition (to measure muscle mass) for participants before and after the
      study.

      The duration of the exercise training protocol is 4 months and participants will be asked to
      exercise 4 days a week; 2 days at the gym and 2 days at home.
