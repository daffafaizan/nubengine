      alternate fractions of ABC-assisted and VisionRT-assisted DIBH. Residual motion during
      breath-hold will be quantitatively assessed using MV fluoroscopy from the treatment beam
      itself (i.e., no additional radiation dose). The dosimetric impact of residual motion on
      organs at risk (heart and lung) will be assessed by applying rigid and/or deformable
      displacements to the planning CT images, computing the 3D dose map and comparing with the
      original planned dose map.
