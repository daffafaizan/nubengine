      will be conducted at a single site in the United States, in which at least 18 young (18-45
      years, inclusive) male subjects in Cohort A and 14 elderly (65 years or older) males in
      Cohort B will be enrolled and dosed to achieve a total of at least 14 completed young
      subjects and 12 elderly subjects. Seminal fluid and plasma will be collected from Cohort A,
      whereas only plasma samples will be collected from Cohort B.
