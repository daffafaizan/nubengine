    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multicenter study. A total of at
      least 50 patients will be recruited to achieve 40 evaluable patients required to assess the
      safety and efficacy of escalating doses of extended-release Nidadd in hyperlipidemic
      patients.

        1. The trial begins with measurement of baseline lipid levels. Fasting blood samples will
           be collected at screening and each treatment visit (except visit 3) for lipid analysis
           and safety monitoring. Chemistry laboratory tests and hematological testing are
           performed periodically. Patient's diet education will be given by dieticians or
           appropriately trained counselors at visit 1 and 2.

        2. Patients who are taking any lipid-modifying drugs will be required to go through a
           4-week washout / diet-controlled period prior to randomization (visit 2).

        3. Treatment duration is 16 weeks in total: Patients randomized to treatment with Nidadd
           will receive 500 mg for the first 8 weeks of the medication period. For another 8 weeks,
           the dose is then increased to 1000 mg and is maintained to the end of the study. The
           patients in control group will take placebo in a same fashion as that of Nidadd group
           throughout entire 16 weeks.

        4. The primary measure of efficacy is the change from baseline in serum HDL-c level.
           Secondary measures of efficacy are changes from baseline in serum total cholesterol,
           LDL-c, and triglycerides.

        5. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated from adverse events, number of patients who
           prematurely discontinue the trial because of adverse events, and laboratory measures.
