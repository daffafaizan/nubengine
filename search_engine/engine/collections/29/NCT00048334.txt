      Romidepsin (NSC 630176, FR901228, FK228, formerly referred to as depsipeptide) is a histone
      deacetylase inhibitor with potent cytotoxic activity against human tumor cell lines and in
      vivo efficacy against both human tumor xenografts and murine tumors (1-3).

      Laboratory studies suggest that longer exposure to non-toxic doses of romidepsin can enhance
      its molecular effects to a greater degree than short toxic doses that rapidly cause cell
      death.

      NIS is responsible for enabling uptake of RAI in thyroid cancer, with decreased levels in
      tumors resistant or refractory to RAI therapy.

      Our group has demonstrated that NIS expression is upregulated by romidepsin, resulting in
      increased sensitivity to RAI.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To determine the MTD of romidepsin when administered on days 1, 3 and 5.

      To examine the effect of a multi-day regimen of romidepsin on surrogate markers and the
      expression of molecular targets.

      To determine whether thyroid cancers that do not have detectable uptake of RAI will have
      detectable uptake after treatment.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Age 18 and over

        -  Evaluable disease

        -  Performance status ECOG 0-2

        -  Excluding patients that are pregnant, HIV positive, have CNS metastasis, or acute
           leukemia

        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction within normal limits. Additional cardiac criteria are
           noted in protocol

      DESIGN:

        -  Phase I

        -  Romidepsin administered as a 4-hour intravenous infusion on days 1, 3 and 5

        -  Dose escalation

        -  Enrollment of additional cohort of 10 patients with thyroid cancer at MTD
