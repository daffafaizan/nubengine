      risks during anesthesia.

      Using high-resolution solid-state manometry the investigators aim to study esophageal
      pressures and measure the incidence of regurgitation of gastric contents during anesthesia
      induction in obese patients. The investigators aim to include 16 obese patients, with BMI >
      35, undergoing laparoscopic gastric by-pass.
