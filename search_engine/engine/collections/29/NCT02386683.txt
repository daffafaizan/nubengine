      complications,360 patients undergoing elective neurosurgery are randomly assigned to two
      groups, lung-protective ventilation (L) and traditional ventilation(T).Patients are
      mechanical ventilated with either a tidal volume of 10-12 ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW,T) or
      6-8ml/kg IBW with 6-8 cm H2O PEEP(L),both with recruitment maneuver (RM).Each RM consists of
      applying a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cmH2O for 30 seconds. Postoperative
      pulmonary complications are compared between groups.
