      by a palliative care-trained social worker or b) usual care + written information regarding
      advanced directives. The intervention group will be enrolled in the hospital and then be
      followed longitudinally for 3 months by a palliative care-trained social worker who will
      shepherd a conversation around prognosis, expectations, and goals of care. The results of
      these conversations will be documented in the electronic medical record and shared with the
      clinical team. Clinical symptoms that are identified during these conversations will be
      evaluated by a Palliative Care Physician who will relay suggestions regarding management to
      the primary treating clinician. Baseline surveys will assess prognostic awareness, symptom
      burden, anxiety, depression, and quality of life for both groups. At the conclusion of the
      study, an individualized follow-up plan will be devised for each patient based on a needs
      assessment by the study social worker.

      Patients assigned to the control/usual care arm will complete the same series of
      questionnaires as those assigned to the intervention group and will undergo usual in hospital
      and post-discharge treatment as directed by their care team. All control subjects will
      receive written Advanced Care planning and Heart Failure education materials as provided
      routinely to inpatients at Brigham and Women's Hospital. At the 6 month visit following
      hospitalization, these patients will be asked to complete follow up questionnaires and then
      will be given the option to participate in the above verbal intervention and guided "Goals
      and Values" conversation that was provided to the intervention group.
