      each patient. The same anatomic areas will be imaged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and
      111In-penteoctreotide Scintigraphy to ensure relevant comparison of lesion detection. Because
      of confluence and inability to clearly delineate single liver lesions in some cases, liver
      metastases will be classified as 1 organ metastasis, independent of the number of liver
      metastases present. Lymph nodes smaller than 1 cm on CT or MRI and showing marked avidity for
      68Ga- DOTATATE and 111In-penteoctreotide will be labeled as positive for disease. The
      presence of lesions will be confirmed by cross-sectional imaging of all patients with CT or
      MRI.
