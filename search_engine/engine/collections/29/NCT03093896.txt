      with 1.5 or 3 ounces of almonds or 3 ounces of snack mix a day on cognitive function in older
      adults. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Secondary outcomes
      include plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Participants will be
      recruited from community-dwelling men and women aged greater than of equal to 50 yr and less
      than or equal to 75 years and potential participants will be screened to meet cognitive and
      functional criteria. Participants will be pre-screened by telephone; those who appear to meet
      criteria will undergo further screening.
