      (SGLT-2) in the kidney.On the market empagliflozin is approved for the treatment of type 2
      Diabetes. The mechanism of action can be described as follows: SGLT-2 is responsible for 90%
      of the reabsorption of Glucose in the kidney. If this Transport System is inhibited the
      secretion of glucose via the urine is increased. Therefore the blood glucose concentration
      will be lowered.

      It has been noted that the SGLT-2 drugs are lowering the blood pressure as well, but the
      specific characteristics of the durg leading to this effect have not been examined in
      adequate clinical trial up to now.

      To evaluate the central sympathic nervous activity a microneurography will be performed in
      this study; this examination will provide Information if empagliflozin dose decrease the
      sympathic nervous activity. If this is the case new effects of empagliflozin have to be
      discussed, Otherwise it can be assumed that the blood pressure decrease is a result of an
      increase of urine volume. In this case the sympathic activity should be increased.

      This study will be performed in parallel groups who will receive a double-blind, randomised
      treatment, either empagliflozin or hydrochlorothiazide. The hypothesis that empagliflozin -
      in contrast to hydrochlorthiazide - does not increase the sympathic nervous activity in
      obese, hypertensive subjects with type 2 Diabetes treated with metformin will be tested.
