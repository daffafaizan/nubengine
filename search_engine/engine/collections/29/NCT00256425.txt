      deficits, which have a sustained, negative impact on daily functioning and quality of life.

      Adult patients with a low-grade glioma, either histologically proven, or suspected (1), as
      well as adult anaplastic glioma patients with favorable prognostic factors (2), who are
      clinically stable for at least 6 months, will be recruited from 9 hospitals in the
      Netherlands. Consenting patients with both subjective cognitive symptoms and objective
      deficits will be randomized to either the cognitive rehabilitation program (N = 75) or a
      "waiting-list" control group (N = 75). Upon completion of the study, those patients assigned
      to the control group will be given the opportunity to undergo the cognitive rehabilitation
      program.

      The cognitive rehabilitation program incorporates both retraining of impaired cognitive
      functions, and teaching of compensatory strategies. Rehabilitation will be directed towards
      attention, memory and executive functioning. The intervention will consist of 6 weekly,
      individual, 2-hour sessions plus two hours of homework.

      To evaluate the efficacy of the rehabilitation program, objective neuropsychological
      functioning, self-reported cognitive symptoms and health-related quality of life will be
      assessed before rehabilitation, directly following rehabilitation, and at 6-month follow-up.
