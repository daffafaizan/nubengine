      unresectable/multifocal. This is Phase II study where up to 41 subjects will receive up to 4
      cycles of Avastin & Temozolomide. Avastin administered at 10 mg/kg every 14 days beginning a
      minimum of 7 days after biopsy/28 days after craniotomy. Temozolomide dosed at 200 mg/m2
      daily for 5 days in 28-day cycle. Patients will receive up to 4 cycles of Avastin &
      Temozolomide, then proceed with standard XRT. Study will use 2-stage "minimax" study design
      in which 21 subjects are accrued during 1st stage, with possibility that additional 20
      patients accrued during 2nd stage. In initial Phase I & II trials, 4 potential
      Avastin-associated safety signals were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic
      events, & hemorrhage. Avastin-associated adverse events in Phase III trials include
      congestive heart failure, GI perforations, wound healing complications, & arterial
      thromboembolic events. Most common toxicity associated with Temozolomide has been mild
      myelosuppression.
