    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of an occupational therapy
      intervention to counseling by a clinical pharmacist (current usual care) compared to
      counseling by a clinical pharmacist only, will affect three-month medication adherence rates
      among community-dwelling adults with uncontrolled hypertension and/or diabetes.

      To meet this purpose, the following objectives will be addressed:

        1. to determine if the addition of the delivery of an occupational therapy intervention
           (specifically the Integrative Self-Management Intervention) to usual care improves
           three-month medication adherence rates, as measured by the Adherence to Refills and
           Medication Scale (ARMS-7), pill count, blood pressure and/or hemoglobin A1c.

        2. to determine whether the administration of the occupational therapy intervention in
           addition to usual care influences an individual's readiness for change as measured by
           the stages of change measure; and

        3. to explore whether participant demographics (e.g., gender, age, race/ethnicity, assist
           at home, co-morbidities, and number of medications) impact three-month medication
           adherence rates.
