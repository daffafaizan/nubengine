    
      Aim 1: To assess the efficacy of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in the treatment of
      moderate or severe fatigue in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).

      Hypothesis: MBI is feasible in PBC patients with fatigue and will result in improvement in
      symptoms of fatigue.

      Aim 2: To assess the impact of MBI in physical activity levels, daytime somnolence, autonomic
      symptoms, functional status, cognitive dysfunction and anxiety and depressive symptoms of
      patients with PBC with moderate or severe fatigue.

      Hypothesis: MBI will result in an improvement in physical activity levels, daytime
      somnolence, autonomic symptoms, functional status, cognitive dysfunction and anxiety and
      depressive symptoms in patients with PBC who have moderate or severe fatigue.

      Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of MBI on candidate markers and/or cytokines of fatigue and
      physiological stress, including hepatic panel, antimitochondrial (AMA) titers, IL-1β, IL-6,
      TNFα, cortisol, leptin, CRP, BDNF, MIF, and CD74 levels and other relevant markers.

      Hypothesis: MBI will result in a decrease of levels of above mentioned markers of fatigue and
      physiological stress in patients with PBC who have moderate or severe fatigue.
