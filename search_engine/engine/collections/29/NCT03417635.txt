      attention and electrical signals in the brain in older adults. Investigators will recruit
      older adults who are living in the community. Participants will be assigned to one of two
      groups: 1) guided focused attention group, or 2) music group (control group). All
      participants will complete three in-person sessions per week and then be encouraged to
      practice independently on the other days in the week, for a total of four weeks.The current
      study focuses on focused attention meditation strategies, as it is recommended for
      beginner-level meditators. This will include training to be able to focus on one's breathing
      for 20 minute sessions. Focused attention meditation has been found to increase levels of
      executive functioning and attention. Participants will complete mobility and cognitive
      assessments at both the beginning and end of the intervention. These will be completed in the
      retirement homes for convenience. Participants will also attend an in-lab session to complete
      electroencephalogram (EEG) testing at both timepoints.
