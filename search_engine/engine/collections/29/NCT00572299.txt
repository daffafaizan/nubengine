      (1-6). Treatment with these drugs leads to decreases in bone resorption and biochemical
      markers of bone turnover and progressive increases in bone mineral density (BMD). The
      increase in BMD in response to bisphosphonate therapy in glucocorticoid-treated patients is,
      however, less than half that measured in women and men with osteoporosis unrelated to
      glucocorticoid drugs even though the patients with osteoporosis are usually older. The goal
      of this objective is to determine the contribution of increased osteoclast survival to the
      diminished response to bisphosphonate therapy in patients receiving excess glucocorticoids
      compared to patients with osteoporosis.
