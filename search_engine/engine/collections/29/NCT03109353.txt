      destruction of transformed/activated hyper-proliferative T-cells through an endogenously
      selective production of the potent photosensitiser, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) from ALA via
      heme biosynthetic pathway; (2) ALA/PpIX only targets membranous structures outside of the
      cell nucleus thus causing no risk of carcinogenesis and (3) induces systemic anti-tumour
      immunity.
