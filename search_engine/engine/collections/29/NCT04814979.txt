      functional disability in patients with lumbar spondylolysis. Thirty four (29 males & 5
      females) diagnosed subjects of lumbar spondylolysis with symptomatic low back pain since four
      months aged between twenty to forty years were recruited. This randomized controlled trial
      was a part of PhD Physical Therapy project conducted at Department of Physiotherapy,
      University of Lahore Teaching Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from June 2020 to March 2021 by
      using non probability purposive sampling technique. Subjects were divided randomly into two
      equal groups (Group-A and Group-B). Lottery method was used to randomly assign patients into
      two groups. Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was utilized to measure pain intensity and
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) to measure functional disability. Data was analyzed by using
      SPSS 21.
