      fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin calcium in patients with solid tumors. II. Determine the
      side effects and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of paclitaxel. Patients receive paclitaxel IV on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive oral fluorouracil-uracil and leucovorin calcium
      twice daily on days 2-6, 9-13, and 16-20. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses
      in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 months and then for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
