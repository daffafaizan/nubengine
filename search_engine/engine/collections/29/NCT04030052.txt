      factor VIII (FVIII) which leads to bleeding correlated with severity. Management is focused
      on FVIII replacement in reaction to a bleed or preventive as prophylaxis. Effective treatment
      is complicated by the: (1) difficulty to administer standard replacement therapy via
      intravenous injection especially in infants and young children; and (2) development of
      inhibitors (FVIII neutralizing antibodies). Inhibitors can increase morbidity and mortality
      and exponentially raise the cost of health care. Although inherited and environmental risk
      factors for inhibitor formation have been identified, there is no effective strategy to
      prevent inhibitors from developing. Emicizumab (HEMLIBRA®) was recently approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) in infants, children, and adults with congenital hemophilia A,
      with and without inhibitors, and offers hemostatic efficacy while reducing the burden of
      administration since it is given weekly, biweekly (every 2 weeks), or monthly via
      subcutaneous (SQ) route compared to the intravenous (IV) route of FVIII.

      This study prospectively investigates the safety, FVIII immunogenicity, and hemostatic
      efficacy of prophylactic HEMLIBRA® given with a concomitant low dose recombinant factor VIII
      (rFVIII) known as NUWIQ®, in HA infants and children <3 years old who have had little to no
      previous exposure to FVIII. In addition, the study investigates the safety and efficacy of a
      novel FVIII ITI regimen in children <21 with existing low and high titer inhibitors (LTI and
      HTI).
