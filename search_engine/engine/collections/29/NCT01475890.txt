      function, growth, muscle, bone, and inflammatory status in children, adolescents and adults
      with HIV/AIDS. The impact of vit D supplementation will be evaluated for safety and efficacy
      using clinically important outcomes, and this will overcome the critical barrier for use of
      vit D supplementation in research and clinical care. Inexpensive and easy to administer, vit
      D supplementation may prove to be an effective and feasible treatment for symptoms and
      prevention of side effects for people of all ages living with HIV/AIDS in the US and around
      the world.

      The study is a 12-month randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of vitamin D3 (vit
      D) supplementation using 7000IU/day based on evidence from the Vit D Dose Finding Study-IRB
      09-007332 in 58 subjects with both Perinatally Acquired (PA) and Behaviorally Acquired (BA)
      HIV/AIDS to assess the long-term safety in terms of serum calcium and 25OHD concentrations,
      and efficacy in terms of the effect of vit D supplementation on 25OHD, cathelicidin, growth
      (pre- and peripubertal participants), body composition, bone, muscle, immune and inflammatory
      status and HIV/AIDS disease severity and progression.

      Primary Hypotheses:

      H1: Vit D supplementation is safe and does not result in an increased incidence of elevated
      serum calcium (above age-specific range) associated with elevated serum 25OHD (>160 ng/mL) in
      treated subjects compared with the subjects receiving placebo.

      H2: Vit D supplementation is significantly associated with both increased 25D and
      cathelicidin in treated subjects compared with subjects receiving placebo.
