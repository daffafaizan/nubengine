      minor gynecologic procedures. The primary objective of this trial is to determine if the use
      of 5% EMLA cream at the time of pessary removal and insertion reduces pain when compared to
      the use of placebo cream.

      Participants will be randomized to receive either 10 grams of 5% EMLA cream (4 mL) or 4 mL of
      placebo cream (aqueous cream BP). Cream will be applied in office at the time of pessary
      removal and insertion.
