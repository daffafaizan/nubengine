    
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating the long term safety
      and tolerability of PBI-4050 in subjects with Alström Syndrome who have completed the
      end-of-treatment (EoT) visit in a preceding ProMetic-sponsored Alström Syndrome study with
      PBI-4050. This study will also evaluate the efficacy and pharmacological effects of PBI 4050
      in this multi faceted disorder. Approximately 20 to 30 subjects will be enrolled to receive
      800 mg PBI-4050 once daily for 96 weeks or until product licensing or study termination by
      the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.
