        -  Determine the progression-free survival rate in patients with low-risk embryonal
           rhabdomyosarcoma treated with intensive chemotherapy comprising vincristine,
           dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide followed by vincristine and dactinomycin.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vincristine IV, dactinomycin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive vincristine IV and dactinomycin IV on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41 patients will be accrued for this study.
