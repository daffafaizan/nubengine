      autologously transplanted, and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible to enter
      the study. The only change to the standard of care is the addition of plerixafor to a
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization regimen on the day prior to
      apheresis. Participants will undergo mobilization with G-CSF (10 mcg/kg each day) and will
      receive plerixafor (240 mcg/kg) in the evening prior to apheresis. Participants will undergo
      apheresis for up to 5 consecutive days in order to collect the target number of CD34+ stem
      cells (â‰¥ 5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for either single or tandem transplant). After apheresis, all
      participants will be treated with high-dose chemotherapy in preparation for transplantation.
      Participants will be transplanted with cells obtained from the G-CSF and plerixafor
      mobilization regimen. The increase in CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood from the time of
      the plerixafor dose to just prior to apheresis and the number of CD34+ cells in the apheresis
      product will be measured. Success of the transplantation(s) will be evaluated by the time to
      engraftment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). A subpopulation will have pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic analysis done.
