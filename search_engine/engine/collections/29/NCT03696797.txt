      of which will predispose to diabetes. Investigators will therefore study normal individuals
      who have higher than average iron levels in tissues, test your glucose control through
      standard blood tests like the hemoglobin A1c and by placing a continuous glucose monitor
      before and after participants have donated blood to determine if decreasing iron levels had
      any effect.

      In addition, iron may also play a role in the progression of fatty liver to scarring and
      cirrhosis. Since 75% of people with diabetes have some degree of fatty liver, investigators
      would also like to study how the liver reacts to the lowering of iron.

      There will be two optional sub studies conducted only at Wake Forest University Health
      Sciences they are: 1) Liver substudy that will look at liver complication of diabetes and the
      role it plays in the progression of fatty liver to scarring and cirrhosis. Investigators will
      look at how liver reacts to the lowering of iron. 2)Glucose Tolerance Mechanism substudy that
      will look at the mechanism the body uses to regulate blood sugar levels by insulin, this will
      require the frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT).
