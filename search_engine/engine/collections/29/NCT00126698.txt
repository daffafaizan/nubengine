      all). The researchers undertake a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the
      efficacy of single-dose therapy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin, versus
      placebo therapy in selected groups of surgical patients who had bladder drainage scheduled to
      last longer than 3 days.
