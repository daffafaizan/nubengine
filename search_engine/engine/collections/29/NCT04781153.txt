      informed consent will undergo a clinical screening to determine eligibility for study entry.

      The study participants will be randomized into two groups. Half of the study participants
      will after baseline move directly into an active periodontal treatment phase including oral
      hygiene instructions and professional tooth cleaning by a full mouth disinfection protocol
      (intervention 2). New data will be collected after 6-8 weeks of healing.

      The second study group will after baseline receive prophylactic periodontal treatment by oral
      hygiene instructions and supragingival plaque removal (intervention 1). New data will be
      collected after 3-4 weeks. This group will now receive the active periodontal treatment phase
      (intervention 2) like the first study had initially. New data will be collected after 6-8
      weeks of healing.

      Both groups will receive supportive periodontal treatment every 3 months in 12 months after
      intervention 2.
