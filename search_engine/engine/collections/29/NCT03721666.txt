    
      Ten individual interviews with medical dispatchers who had previously handled an emergency
      call concerning OHCA captured on closed-circuit television (CCTV) were conducted. First, the
      medical dispatcher listened to the emergency call and described their perception of the
      scenario. Afterward, the CCTV recording was shown to the dispatcher, who was then
      interviewed. The interviews were videotaped, and the audio files were transcribed verbatim.
      Thematic content analysis was conducted.
