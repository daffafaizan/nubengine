      prognosis essentially depend on earlier diagnosis. Gastric monoclonal antibody MG7 has been
      validated as a specific antibody in gastric cancerous tissue. Conventional evaluation of MG7
      antigen expression is immunohistochemistry, which is time-consuming, and the immunoreactivity
      can be affected by storage and fixation of tissue. Confocal laser endomicrosopy enables
      visualization of the cellular and subcellular structures in vivo. Thus this study aims to
      achieve molecular imaging of MG7 antigen in gastric cancer in vivo using confocal laser
      endomicroscopy.
