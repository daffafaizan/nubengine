      open-label, single dose Phase I/II study involving transplantation of allogeneic HuCNS-SC
      cells into 12 subjects with thoracic spinal cord injury.

      Subjects will be monitored at routine intervals for safety and preliminary efficacy for four
      years. The LTFU study will commence following the one year post-transplantation termination
      visit of the Phase I/II investigation.
