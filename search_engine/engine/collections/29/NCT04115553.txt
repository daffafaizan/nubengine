      compared to the circulation observed in healthy volunteers considered as the reference. The
      research will focus on adult patients referred to the imaging department for intracranial
      hypertension assessment. MRI support is common for this type of request The reference will be
      established in a population of healthy volunteers for whom MRI blood flow measurements will
      be performed. In addition to the primary objective, the investigators assess the impact of
      IIH on CSF dynamics The study does not present any risk for the subject, any contraindication
      to MRI examination being respected. The subjects will undergo MRI examination including
      morphological and flow sequences without contrast injection. The flow sequences, in planes
      located at the C2-C3 and aqueductal levels, will be used to measure vascular flows (venous
      and arterial) and CSF oscillatory volumes. Image post-processing will be performed on a
      semi-automatic software allowing to extract fluid dynamics parameters.
