    
      This is a 2-part multicenter Phase 1b study designed to test the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of single agent oral icapamespib in patients with recurrent brain lesions.

      Part 1 of the trial will be a standard 3 by 3 dose escalation design where different doses
      are examined. Part 2 will be a dose expansion cohort to further evaluate the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The RP2D is defined as the dose level recommended for further clinical
      study, or the highest dose tested. The RP2D may be the same as the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) or modified from the MTD based on assessment of overall exposure, safety experience in
      Cycle 2 and beyond, and clinical benefit data in the study. The RP2D will be determined in
      the dose expansion phase of the study.

      Part 1: Up to 30 patients with 1st, 2nd or 3rd recurrence of IDH wild type glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) or grade 3 or 4, Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant astrocytoma will be
      enrolled to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and MTD of single
      agent oral icapamespib administered daily.

      Icapamespib will be administered orally once daily for each 28-day cycle. The initial dose in
      this trial will be 20 mg in Cohort 1. Dose escalation will proceed as follows:

        -  100% increment until the first drug-related Grade 2 adverse event (AE) occurs, then

        -  50% increment until the first drug-related Grade 3 event occurs, then

        -  33% increment until the first Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) occurs, then

        -  20% increment until RP2D is declared.
