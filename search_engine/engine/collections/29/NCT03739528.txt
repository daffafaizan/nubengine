      using a combination between an antibiotic and a corticosteroid to promote patient adherence
      to therapy and to obtain both prevention of infection and treatment of post-surgical
      inflammation.

      The combination of tobramycin and dexamethasone is among the most widely used combinations,
      however, treatment duration and the need for tapering posology over several weeks may favour
      the development of bacterial resistance. The study treatment associating a broad-spectrum
      antibiotic with a highly effective corticosteroid that can be used for a short period of time
      (one week) is therefore of considerable interest.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of the study treatment, used for a
      limited period of time and followed by dexamethasone alone, compared to standard treatment in
      preventing and treating ocular inflammation and in preventing post-operative infection while
      limiting the emergence of antibiotic resistance.
