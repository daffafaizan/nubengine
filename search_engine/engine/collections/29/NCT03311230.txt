    
      This is a four-arm randomized, controlled trial with a 24-week intervention period and
      12-week follow-up period. Participants are considered ready to be randomized once they have
      completed all surveys, established a baseline step count, and selected a step goal
      increase.Participants in the control arm will receive no other interventions during the
      24-week intervention period or the 12-week follow-up period. Participants randomized to the
      one of the three intervention arms will have a 4-week ramp up towards their step goal. The
      participant will then be asked to maintain their goal during the 20-week "maintenance period"
      and the 12-week "follow-up period." Participants in arms 2-4 will be entered into an
      intervention approach that has points and levels designed to incorporate insights from
      behavioral economics. Participants in the supportive social incentive arm will be asked to
      identify a family member or friend to be their support sponsor. This sponsor will be
      encouraged to support the participant in their progress during the study. Participants in the
      competitive social incentive arm will be in a group of three total participants.At the end of
      each week the participants will receive notification that ranks them on their cumulative
      points in the study thus far and also displays their level.This feedback may help to induce
      participants to compete for the top spot among the group. Participants in the collaborative
      social incentive arm will be in a group of three total participants as a team. Each day one
      of the members of the group will be randomly selected to represent their team for that day.
      In this design, each person is accountable to the others on the team and this may induce a
      collaborative effort to meet their daily goals.
