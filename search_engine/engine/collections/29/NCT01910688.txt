      300,000 related deaths per year. The most commonly performed bariatric surgical interventions
      are Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric band placement.
      Despite the overall initial success of RGB to induce significant EBWL in the majority of
      patients, significant weight regain occurs in about 25% of patients at 2+ years following
      surgery. Given the preliminary success of endoscopic, non-surgical salvage interventions for
      the failed (uncomplicated) RGB patient, the present study will assess the feasibility of
      using endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat the gastric pouch and stoma with the
      intent to cause tissue contraction and decreased compliance. A reduction of size and
      compliance may, as others have reported, result in re-establish weight loss and achieve an
      acceptable EBWL with minimal patient morbidity.
