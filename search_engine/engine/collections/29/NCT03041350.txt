      arriving at the scene. Upon the arrival at the scene of the two activated paramedic teams,
      they rapidly switch to ALS under teamwork-based BLS and video medical control. Using this
      video medical control, high-quality CPR, cardiac arrest rhythm confirmation, defibrillation,
      proper drug administration instructions, advanced airway insertion, etc. are performed. The
      medical director then decides on patient transfer if the asystole and pulseless electrical
      activity findings are persistent even after more than 20-minutes of ALS. After initiating the
      transfer, the medical director contacts the hospital where the patient is to be transferred
      to after completing the video medical control. The medical director provides an explanation
      of the treatment to the caregiver via video. After returning to the fire station, the EMS
      personnel who had completed the patient's transfer the enters the information by hand on the
      separate form, takes a picture of the document, and uploads it to SNS within 24 hours.
      Through this information shared via SNS, the research staff the provides a direct feedback to
      the EMS personnel, and further discussion performed within the SNS. All the incident cases of
      OHCA during the before and during interventional periods were registered using an EMS run
      sheet for basic ambulance operation information, the EMS cardiac arrest registry for the
      Utstein factors, and the OHCA registry for the hospital care and survival outcomes. The EMS
      run sheet and EMS cardiac arrest registry were collected by the EMS providers. The medical
      records for hospital care and outcomes were abstracted by the trained reviewer for this study
