      functioning and biomarkers of inflammation among overweight and obese women; and to determine
      the degree to which acetaminophen moderates the stigma-related effects. Participants will
      provide blood spot and saliva samples upon arrival, and then be randomly assigned to consume
      either 1,000mg of acetaminophen in liquid form, or a placebo solution. Participants then will
      complete a series of questionnaires assessing a variety of relevant psychological and
      behavioral constructs. After this participants will be randomly assigned to read one of two
      shorts stories and answer a series of questions about their reaction to the story. Finally,
      participants will answer another series of questionnaires and provide a second saliva sample.
      Participants will first be adult women in the Columbus, Ohio and surrounding areas with body
      mass indices considered overweight or obese. A smaller cohort of women with normal weight
      will be recruited at a later time for purposes of comparison.
