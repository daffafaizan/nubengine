      and, caused by respiratory viruses. Although several medications and interventions studied
      for bronchiolitis treatment, hydration and oxygenation are the main treatments. High-flow
      nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNCOT) has been widely used to provide respiratory support in
      children with acute respiratory diseases.

      Patients had earlier improvement with HFNCOT to decrease the respiratory rate and respiratory
      effort than patients with standard low-flow oxygen therapy (SOT).

      HFNCOT therapy reduced more effective in heart rate, respiratory effort, and length of
      supportive oxygen treatment (LOOT) compared with SOT. However, the length of hospital stay
      (LOS) and feeding ability had better consequences in patients with moderate and severe
      bronchiolitis treated with HFNCOT.

      Another published study shows that in infants with acute bronchiolitis, which required oxygen
      therapy, there was no significant difference between therapy groups in terms of LOOT, LOS,
      and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). HFNCOT was more efficient than SOT and
      reduced the rate of intubation/invasive ventilation in severe bronchiolitis management.
      Despite these beneficial effects of HFNCOT, it was not recommended by international
      guidelines yet. However, well designed, prospective randomized controlled trials are still
      needed to use this therapy in the wards.
