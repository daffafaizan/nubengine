      volunteer peers. The initial weight loss session will be conducted by the peer leaders with
      oversight by the PI. This session will serve to introduce the program and give an overview of
      program. The remaining sessions, conducted by co-peer leaders, will utilize an adaptation of
      the Diabetes Prevention Program. This adaptation allows for use in a group setting and
      facilitation by a lay individual.

      Control Condition: Participants in the control condition will be given written information at
      the baseline visit from the NIH website "Aim for a Healthy Weight" to provide a basic
      understanding of weight loss and access to basic online resources. We expect that use of the
      website may result in some weight loss. However, similar information-only interventions have
      had a very small effect, which is accounted for in the sample size calculation.
