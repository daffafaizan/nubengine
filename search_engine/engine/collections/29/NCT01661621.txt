      1.1.General Study Design This study is a prospective randomized, open label, controlled,
      double arm, post-marketing study to compare the treatment efficacy of first-line
      antimuscarinics and α-blockers monotherapy for men with moderate to severe LUTS (IPSS-T ≥8)
      and IPSS-V/S ≤1.

      1.2. Study Visits and Evaluations

      1.2.1 Screening Visit (Baseline, 1 day to 1 week of the first treatment day).

      1.2.1.1 Explain the nature of the study and have patients to read and sign an Informed
      Consent Form.

      1.2.1.2 Screen patients for inclusion/exclusion criteria. 1.2.1.3 Medical History of lower
      urinary tract symptoms and previous treatment modalities.

      1.2.1.4 Vital signs monitoring, general physical examinations of all systems (including
      digital rectal examination), serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA), and urinalysis.

      1.2.1.5 Record Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), IPSS (IPSS-T, IPSS voiding
      (IPSS-V), and IPSS storage (IPSS-S)), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OAB-SS), and quality
      of Life index (QoL-I)scores.

      1.2.1.6 Obtain maximum flow rate (Qmax), voided volume, postvoid residual volume (PVR), total
      prostate volume (TPV), and transitional zone index (TZI).

      1.2.1.7 Randomized assigned patients into 2 groups; men in one group received Doxazosin 4 mg
      QD, and those in the other group received Detrusitol 4 mg QD.

      1.2.2 First Evaluation Visit (2 weeks after the initial treatment) 1.2.2.1 Vital signs
      monitoring and record adverse events. 1.2.2.2 Record PPBC, IPSS (IPSS-T, IPSS-V, IPSS-S),
      OAB-SS and QoL. 1.2.2.3 Check urinalysis for urinary tract infection if patient has symptoms
      suggestive of urinary tract infection.

      1.2.2.4 Check Qmax, voided volume, and PVR.

      1.2.3 Second Evaluation Visit (4 weeks after the treatment). 1.2.3.1 Vital signs monitoring
      and record adverse events. 1.2.3.3 Check urinalysis for urinary tract infection if patient
      has symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection.

      1.2.3.4 Check Qmax, voided volume, and PVR.

      1.2.4 Third Evaluation Visit (3 months after the treatment). 1.2.4.1 Vital signs monitoring
      and record adverse events. 1.2.4.2 Record PPBC, IPSS (IPSS-T, IPSS-V, IPSS-S), OAB-SS and
      QoL. 1.2.4.3 Check urinalysis for urinary tract infection if patient has symptoms suggestive
      of urinary tract infection.

      1.2.4.4 Check Qmax, voided volume, and PVR.

      1.3. Withdrawal Criteria

      Patients with any of the following conditions may be withdrawn from the trial:

      1.3.1. Patients decide to withdraw their consent. 1.3.2. Patients indicate the status of lack
      of efficacy which is of clinical significance judged by the investigators that may lead to
      permanent damage to the patients.

      1.3.3. Investigators consider that there is of safety concerns for the patients to remain in
      the trial (such as development severe medical disease).

      1.3.4. Lost of follow-up or death. 1.3.5. PVR≥300 mL

      1.4. Concomitant Treatments Investigator will try to minimize the concomitant medications for
      the patients during the trial duration. However, patients are allowed to continue taking
      stable medication in stable dose for diseases other than genitourinary system.

      1.5. Prohibited medication

      Patients are not allowed to take any of the following medications during the study:

        1. Anticholinergics other than test drug

        2. Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers

        3. Tricyclic anti-depressants

        4. Calcium channel blockers

        5. Skeletal muscle relaxant

        6. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors
