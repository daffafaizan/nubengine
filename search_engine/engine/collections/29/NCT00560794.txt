      defined as minimal residual disease (MRD). If no MRD is detectable (< 10^-4 = less than 1
      leukemia cell per 10^4 bone marrow cells) a complete molecular remission is reached. In the
      last years a series of retrospective studies has shown that MRD in adult ALL is an
      independent prognostic factor as already demonstrated for childhood leukemia. Diagnostic
      tools for MRD are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or flow cytometry. PCR analysis can
      detect fusion transcripts such as bcr/abl and individual clonal rearrangements of
      immunoglobulins (IgH) and/or T-cell receptor genes (TCR). About 25% of patients with MRD
      defined by rearrangement comprise a high-risk group with a 94% relapse rate within 3 years.
      In general for patients with MRD, who are not eligible for allogenic stem cell
      transplantation, curative treatment is not available. This accounts for MRD defined by the
      Philadelphia chromosome translocation as well as for MRD defined by rearrangement. The
      current study is set up to address the question of treating MRD positive ALL with the
      bispecific anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19 x anti-CD3 antibody derivative blinatumomab
      (MT103).
