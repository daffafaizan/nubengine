      therapy, which is radiation given outside the body, or prostate seed implant, which is
      placing radioactive seeds directly into the prostate. For external beam radiation therapy,
      treatment can last up to 9 weeks. Treatment is given daily, Monday through Friday. This may
      not be the most convenient option for some patients.

      One way to potentially overcome this challenge is to deliver a more intense dose of radiation
      treatment to the tumor over a shorter amount of time. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
      (SBRT) is a technique that treats the prostate with fewer treatments and can decrease the
      effect of radiation to the surrounding tissues. This study is a Phase I research study, which
      means that it will look at the safety of the dose of the SBRT. While SBRT itself is a
      standard of care method to administer radiation therapy, there has not been a specific dose
      outlined in the past. The aim of this study is to determine the dose that will treat the
      prostate cancer but cause the least amount of side effects.
