      which predominantly affects women of childbearing years. Treatment options for SLE remain
      relatively limited. Regardless of the specific therapy chosen, the majority of patients
      continue to require long term immunomodulatory or cytotoxic therapy, resulting in long-term
      morbidity and mortality. Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting
      of: 1) the chimeric immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30, 2) the
      microtubule disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and 3) a protease-cleavable
      linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10. Since CD30 and/or CD30-expressing immune cells
      may play significant key roles in the pathogenesis of SLE, brentuximab vedotin may be an
      efficacious therapy. This study intends to explore the potential for brentuximab vedotin as a
      therapy for SLE.
