      investigational intervention and also tries to find the best dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved CUDC-907 as a treatment
      option for any disease.

      This is the first time that CUDC-907 will be given to children.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating a new drug, CUDC-907, as a potential
      new treatment for children with solid tumors, lymphomas and brain tumors. CUDC-907 is an oral
      drug that blocks certain proteins in tumor cells. These proteins may be important in the
      growth of some cancers. Laboratory experiments and results from adult studies demonstrate
      that CUDC-907 may stop tumor growth and, in some cases, cause tumor cells to die. CUDC-907
      has been tested in adults with cancer to find out about side effects and dosing in adults.
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate side effects of CUDC-907 and find the best dose
      of CUDC-907 when used in children. Other goals of this study are to determine whether this
      drug may have benefits against the types of cancer seen in children and to measure the
      effects of CUDC-907 in the blood.
