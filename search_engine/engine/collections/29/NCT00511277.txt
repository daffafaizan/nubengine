      patients with schizophrenia. However, it is still uncertain whether depressive symptoms have
      a prognostic value, having previously been associated with both favorable and poor outcome.
      In addition, treatment of affective symptoms in patients with schizophrenia is difficult.
      There is some evidence that atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine may contribute not
      only to a reduction in psychotic symptoms but also that these agents may produce an
      antidepressant effect in schizophrenia and may reduce suicidality. Most of these studies
      suffer from methodological limitations as the efficacy on affective symptoms has not been the
      primary target parameter. Concerning the prevalence of affective symptoms in first-episode
      psychosis knowledge is still poor. This is why we have developed a study design for a
      pilot-study on 60 patients with first-episode schizophrenia aiming to demonstrate that a
      treatment with quetiapine over the period of 6 months shows clinical efficacy on affective,
      particularly depressive symptoms
