      with localized prostate cancer. Some of these men are choosing to manage their prostate
      cancer with radiation therapy. The radiation therapy delivers minimal dose exposure to
      adjacent organs. We hypothesize that when patients are treated with radiation therapy for
      localized prostate cancer, decreased fertility can occur due to damage of seminiferous
      tubules, which may affect sperm quality. This study will assess the impact of radiation
      therapy on semen and seminal fluid.
