      results in small vessels. Moreover, the available data suggest that DEB are a promising new
      technique for the treatment of de-novo stenoses in small vessels if pre-dilatation is
      performed and geographical mismatch is avoided.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that DEB is non-inferior to DES in a real-world
      population with respect to the combined clinical endpoint Major adverse cardiac events
      (MACE), defined as cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and target vessel
      revascularization after 12 months.
