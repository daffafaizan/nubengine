      least two hospital admissions in the previous 12 months to receive rifaximin 550 mg twice a
      day for a total of 12 months. The investigators will measure changes in the annual rate of
      hospital admissions due to vaso-occlusive crisis and the annual rate of hospital days. The
      investigators will also determine the annual rates of uncomplicated crises and acute chest
      syndrome. Quality of life due to the disease and to treatment will be determined using a
      questionnaire. This study will be complemented with exploratory laboratory studies to
      determine changes in the number of circulating activated neutrophils, intestinal microbiome
      diversity, urinary 3-indoxyl sulfate levels and serum biomarkers of intestinal permeability
      (lipopolysaccharides; zonulin, citrulline, and fatty acid binding proteins).
