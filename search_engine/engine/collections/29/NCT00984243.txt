      States and continues to be a major problem in several other countries in the world.
      Detection, localization, and surgical treatment at an early stage, provides the best
      opportunity for long-term survival for patients with non-sma11 cell lung cancer at this time.
      Studies examining the utility of screening patients at high risk for lung cancer with sputum
      cytology and chest roentgenograms showed that, despite a higher frequency of detecting and
      resecting early cancers in the screened group, there was no difference between the screened
      group and the control group in overall cancer mortality.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an alternative to
      surgical resection in patients with early stage) roentgenographically occult squamous cell
      carcinoma of the lung who are candidates for surgery. If PDT is successful, it would remove
      the indication for surgery and eliminate the need for an operation. The specific goals are to
      evaluate the impact of PDT on these patients by determining the percentage of patients who
      are spared surgery as wel1 as the following: morbidity, overall mortality, lung cancer
      mortality, the rate of subsequent lung cancer, the relative cost of PDT and surgery, the
      change in pulmonary function over time, the effect on quality of life, and the patient
      preferences for PDT and surgery.
