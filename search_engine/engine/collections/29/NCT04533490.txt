      cancer, the long-term therapeutic effect is not satisfactory.About 50% of patients
      experienced relapse in the first year after treatment. The 5-year survival rate of esophageal
      cancer patients treated by surgery is still less than 30%. Although the effect of
      preoperative treatment is relatively clear, the effect of postoperative treatment, especially
      postoperative chemotherapy, is still controversial and no consensus has been reached.The
      basic reason is that the postoperative trauma of esophageal cancer is large, and the
      patients' tolerance to chemotherapy is poor. The efficacy of immunocheckpoint inhibitors in
      metastatic ESCC has been recognized.We plan to conduct a phase II multicenter, single arm,
      open phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of humanized anti PD-1
      monoclonal antibody SHR-1210 in adjuvant treatment of resectable esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.
