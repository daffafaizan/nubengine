    
      This open-label study will assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of IMM-101 with
      nivolumab in patients with unresectable stage III, or stage IV melanoma who are either
      treatment-naive (cohort A) or whose disease has progressed during PD-1 blockade (cohort B).
      Ipilimumab may be used as a subsequent treatment in place of nivolumab alongside IMM-101 for
      patients in cohort B if their disease progresses on study. Eighteen patients will be enrolled
      into cohort A and 8 patients into cohort B.
