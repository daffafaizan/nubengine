        -  Determine the feasibility of tirapazamine, cisplatin, and etoposide concurrently with
           radiotherapy in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to one of two induction therapy arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of low-dose tirapazamine IV
           over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV over
           1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33. Patients also undergo radiotherapy concurrently with
           chemotherapy 5 consecutive days a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of high-dose tirapazamine,
           cisplatin, etoposide, and radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Patients with stable or responding disease then receive consolidation therapy consisting of
      tirapazamine IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 11 and 14 and
      etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks 11 and 14.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
