    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate INFUSEÂ® Bone Graft as an alternative to autograft
      for alveolar ridge bone formation in the posterior mandible prior to dental implants. A
      subject must have a defect behind the canine of 2-4 teeth for at least 2 months and be a
      candidate for dental implants.
