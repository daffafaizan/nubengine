      therapy (DBT) for adolescents with bipolar disorder, in collaboration with investigators at
      the University of Pittsburgh. During the conduct of that initial study (the DITO study; REB
      PIN 042-2018), compelling questions have been raised by the investigators, study therapists,
      and participants/patients about what will happen following participation in the initial
      study: Which DBT outcomes are sustained over time? Will patients request and/or require
      additional booster sessions? Will study therapists remain adherent to the treatment model?
      There is sparse knowledge regarding what happens after a course of DBT is completed, and this
      study seeks to advance our understanding of what happens in the year after DBT by addressing
      these questions. This study provides a unique opportunity to examine the frequency, dose, and
      indications for ongoing DBT treatment for participants who have completed one year of DBT at
      the Centre for Youth Bipolar Disorder (CYBD). In the spirit of the original dissemination and
      implementation study, this study is focused on "real-world" issues routinely faced by study
      therapists and patients, and anticipated findings will inform future randomized controlled
      trials on this topic.
