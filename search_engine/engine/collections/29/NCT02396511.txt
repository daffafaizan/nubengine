      inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor
      types. TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody to CD105, an angiogenic target highly expressed on the
      tumor vessels and the tumor cells in choriocarcinoma. Together, these antibodies may be
      efficacious in metastatic and refractory choriocarcinoma, a tumor type that is highly
      vascular and expresses endoglin. The purpose of this study is to determine whether TRC105 in
      combination with Bevacizumab is effective in the treatment of two patients with metastatic
      and refractory choriocarcinoma.
