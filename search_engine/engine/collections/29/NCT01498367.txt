      perception and satisfaction of home telemedicine support system for diabetes management
      versus standard (usual) care. In the intervention group the patients will be provided with a
      blood glucose meter and a mobile phone and their data will be transferred via the mobile to
      the regional database and will be assessed by the allocated care team. Appropriate counseling
      on treatment and symptoms or problems related to diabetes will also be provided.

      Measurements of HbA1c will be taken to assess glycaemic control while the dietary and the
      exercise habits will be assessed by the use of questionnaires. In addition the patients'
      satisfaction from the use of the telemedicine service will be studied. A Cost-Effective
      Analysis and Cost Utility Analysis will be applied to evaluate the tele-health service
      compared with the usual care from the health and social perspective. The effect of the
      tele-health service in the organization structure of the outpatient hospital department will
      be evaluated with a qualitative study.
