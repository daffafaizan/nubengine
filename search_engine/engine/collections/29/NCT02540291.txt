      RP2D of E7046, and a cohort expansion part with 6 to 16 participants to better characterize
      safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) at the RP2D. In the dose
      escalation part, increasing doses of E7046 will be administered to cohorts of 6 participants,
      at dose levels ranging from 125 mg to 750 mg.
