      warnings "Stay at home! Wear a mask! Keep social distance!". The aim of this descriptive
      study is to determine the risk factors that affect the Covid-19 infection in Turkey.

      The majority of the lands within the Republic of Turkey cover Anatolia, while a minor part
      covers Thrace, the southeast extension of the Balkan Peninsula. The population of Turkey is
      83,154,997. Based on the natural, human and financial characteristics, the country consists
      of seven regions: Mediterranean, Eastern Anatolia, Aegean, Southeastern Anatolia, Central
      Anatolia, Marmara, and Black Sea. The majority of the population lives in the Marmara Region.
      The online link of the form created on Google forms was sent to the participants' phones
      between 18.10.2020 and 18.11.2020 and participants' informed consent was obtained.

      A 43-item questionnaire form which had two sections and was prepared by the researcher in
      line with the literature was used in data collection. The first section questioned
      participants' personal characteristics (first letters of participants' names and surnames,
      date of birth, profession, employment status, risk of Covid-19 infection, family type, etc.),
      while the second section questioned the practices of following 14 rules declared by the
      Turkish Ministry of Health to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic (using a mask, observing the hand
      hygiene and social distance, etc.) and whether participants were diagnosed with Covid-19.
      Identity details that could help identify the participants were not questioned.
