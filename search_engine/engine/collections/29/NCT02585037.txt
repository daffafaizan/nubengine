      technique; G2: muscle inhibition technique; G3: Placebo Effect) aged over 18 years male or
      female, where it will be initially measured the strength of grip with a dynamometer Jamar速
      pressure. Then the Kinesio Taping速 bandage will be applied in an "I" format in the wrist
      flexor muscles of a dominant and non-dominant limb in G1, G2, and G3 groups. Investigators
      will follow the application protocol suggested by method of technical. To provide the
      facilitation of muscle activity (G1 group) a Kinesio Taping速 bandage will be applied to the
      muscle starting at its origin up to the location of muscle insertion. For inhibition of
      muscle activity (G2 group), the bandage will be placed over the muscle starting at the
      insertion location and ending at the muscle origin. For the control group (G3 group) the
      bandage will be placed from the lateral extremity to the medial axis. The measurement of grip
      strength was carried out in four stages: immediately before placing the Kinesio Taping速, 24
      h, 48 h, and 72 h after its application. After collecting the data statistical Investigators
      will held the analysis of the data.
