    
      Primary objective:

      To assess the effect of repeated PCT measurements in critically ill patients with clinically
      suspected or microbiologically documented sepsis on duration of antimicrobial use and to
      compare this strategy to standard clinical practice, by using an improved PCT assay with a
      sensitivity of 0.06 ng/ml.

      Secondary objectives:

      To determine the impact of repeated PCT measurements on patient outcome (morbidity,
      mortality, emergence of antibiotic resistance and nosocomial super-infections).

      Main measures:

      Primary:

        1. Exposure to systemic antimicrobial treatment (in duration of antibiotic treatment and
           total antibiotic exposure)

           Secondary:

        2. Cure and failure rate of infection (in N recurrent infections per 100 patients)

        3. 28-day case-fatality rate (in N deaths per 100 patients)

        4. Length of hospital stay (in days)

        5. Costs of antimicrobial therapy (in CHF)

        6. Rate of nosocomial super-infection (in N super-infections per 100 patients)

        7. Isolation of multi-resistant microorganisms (in clinical isolates per 100 patient-days)
