    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the iStent trabecular
      micro-bypass stent in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) in subjects with open-angle
      glaucoma or ocular hypertension and co-existing cataract. Pre-operative unmedicated baseline
      pressures will be compared with post operative values in both study arms.
