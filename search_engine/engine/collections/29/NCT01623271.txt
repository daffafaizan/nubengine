      Regional Pain Syndrom Type I (CRPS I) without causing too many side effects. CRPS I is one of
      the most common conditions of neuropathic pain (pain that results from damage to nerves in
      the peripheral nervous system). Gralise is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) to treat postherpetic neuralgia (a complication of the disease Shingles, which is
      caused by the chickenpox virus), but is not approved to treat CRPS I.
