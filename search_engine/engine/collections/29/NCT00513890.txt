           for respiratory distress with bronchiolitis but not requiring mechanical ventilation are
           randomized in two groups: group "A" is treated with a non-invasive ventilation
           device(Infantflow) during 6 hours, group "B" is treated conventionally by inhalation of
           a Air/O2 mixture during 6 hours.

        2. Outcome: Primary outcome: clinical score of respiratory distress at H0 and H6. Secondary
           outcome: respiratory and cardiac frequency, average blood pressure. Manometric:
           Variation of esophageal pressure at H0, H6. Gasometric: Minimal FiO2 necessary to reach
           an oxygen saturation between 94 and 98%, transcutaneus PCO2, PaO2/FiO2

        3. Analyze results: Intention to treat analysis after having checked the randomization by
           comparing clinical gravity in the two arms (clinical score).

        4. Calendar of the study: October 2006 at April 2008

        5. Follow-up of the patients: the study proceeds during the hospitalization of the infants
           during 6 hours and will not impose any specific follow-up.
