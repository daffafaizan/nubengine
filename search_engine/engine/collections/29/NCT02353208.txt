    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded controlled trial.

      Subjects ages 19 years and older referred for capsule endoscopy (CE) at the GI Clinic, St.
      Paul's Hospital will be invited to participate in the study. We will be recruiting 122
      subjects and will randomize them into 2 groups: control group and treatment group. Control
      subjects will undergo the standard capsule endoscopy procedure. Subjects in Treatment group
      will undergo sham feeding in addition to the standard capsule endoscopy procedure. Both
      control and treatment subjects in this study will be required to swallow a capsule (the size
      of a large pill) named Given Imaging SB3Â® Capsule.

      The investigator and the video reader will be blinded (single-blinded study). Times will be
      recorded at: first gastric image, first duodenal image and first cecal image.

      The diagnostic yield for controls and subjects will be calculated. The clarity of the images
      will be graded according to the ICCE 2005 consensus regarding bowel preparation and
      prokinetics in capsule endoscopy.
