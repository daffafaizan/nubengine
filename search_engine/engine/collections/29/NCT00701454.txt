      Approximately 1500 participants were enrolled. Study staff interviewed participants on basic
      demographic data, health status, physical activities, food frequency and 24-hour recall.
      Anthropometry (body weight, height, hip and waist circumference) and physical assessment
      (blood pressure)were measured. Ten milliliters of venous blood was drawn by venipuncture
      after a 12 h overnight fast for determination of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and blood lipid
      concentrations (total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol). FPG was measured by
      the enzymatic colorimetric method with glucose oxidase.21 Total cholesterol was determined by
      the cholesterol oxidase method and serum triglycerides concentration was determined by
      standardized enzymatic procedures using glycerol phosphate oxidase assay.22, 23 HDL-
      cholesterol was measured by enzymatic assays.24 LDL cholesterol was calculated according to
      the method of Friedwald et al.25 All samples were analyzed when internal quality control met
      the acceptable criteria. Intra-and inter-assay CVs were 2.01% and 3.01% for FPG, 1.87% and
      4.24% for total cholesterol, 0.93% and 11.6% for triacylglycerols, and 0.99% and 1.49% for
      HDL cholesterol, respectively.
