      through social support and behavioral education. One popular social media platform is
      Instagram. However, there is limited data on whether participants trust the content delivered
      through this platform. There is also limited information on whether the social-media account
      holder plays a role in the acceptance of the content. The purpose of the proposed study is to
      determine participants perceptions of physical activity related information and social media
      account. The design for this study is a 3-arm randomized intervention through Instagram.
      Participants (n=60) will be randomized to one of three Instagram accounts (control, student,
      and scientist). Recruitment will be on a rolling basis for 2 months; once participants are
      deemed eligible, they will be enrolled for 4-weeks and will receive a weekly questionnaire to
      determine their perceptions. Participants will also be encouraged to participate in follow-up
      questionnaires at 2 and 3 months.
