      as having a direct negative effect on day to day function. A growing body of evidence shows
      that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) reduces perfectionism and Axis I disorders, with
      medium to large effect sizes. Given the increased desire for online interventions to
      facilitate access to evidence-based therapy, web-based CBT self-help interventions for
      perfectionism have been designed. Existing interventions have not included personalised
      guidance which has been shown to improve outcome rates.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of CBT based online guided self-help
      intervention for perfectionism at reducing symptoms of perfectionism and Axis I disorders
      post-treatment and at six-month follow-up.

      A randomised controlled trial method is employed, comparing the treatment arm (online guided
      self-help) with a waiting list control group. Outcomes are examined at three time points, T1
      (baseline), T2 (post-intervention at 12 weeks), T3 (follow-up at 24 weeks). Participants will
      be recruited through universities, online platforms, and social media, and if eligible will
      be randomised using an online automatic randomiser.
