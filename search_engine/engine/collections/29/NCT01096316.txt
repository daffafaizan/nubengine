      disproportionate percentage of low-income and minority women. For many of these women,
      OG-GYNs are the only provider they see on a regular basis. OB-GYNs take care of women across
      their lifespan, addressing gynecologic, health care maintenance, pregnancy and primary care
      concerns in their everyday practices. There are multiple aspects of OG-GYN care that are
      uniquely suited for detection and treatment of depression, but there are also significant
      barriers to such care that must be addressed.

      In this randomized controlled trial, we are testing this depression care management program
      for women attending two OB-GYN clinics in the University of Washington health care system.
      Our research aims to test the hypothesis that a depression care management intervention,
      integrated into the OB-GYN clinic setting, will improve treatment outcomes for depression,
      functional outcomes, and satisfaction with depression care. The results of our research will
      greatly impact clinical care by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services
      for women seen in OB-GYN clinical settings.

      The study compares a depression care management intervention, delivered by a depression care
      manager, to usual care for depression in the clinics. The primary aims of the study are to
      evaluate, compared to usual care, a depression intervention consisting of enhanced education,
      engagement, and depression care management (with a choice of antidepressant medication
      monitoring and/or provision of brief psychotherapy).
