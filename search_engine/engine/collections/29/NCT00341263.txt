      periods may be important in influencing risk of breast, prostate and testicular cancers later
      in life. In particular, evidence is accumulating for associations with several maternal,
      perinatal and pregnancy characteristics, including twining. The effect of these factors may
      be mediated through alterations in hormone levels such as the estrogens and other steroid
      hormones, to which the embryo and fetus are exposed during pregnancy. Differences in maternal
      hormone concentrations by maternal and perinatal factors have been noted, though data for
      most factors are sparse. Furthermore, less is known about the relationships of pregnancy
      factors to hormones in cord blood, the proximal exposure to the fetus, since most work thus
      far has been based on hormones in the maternal circulation. In collaboration with
      investigators at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, we are collecting maternal and cord
      blood samples from monochorionic twin, dichorionic twin and singleton pregnancies of similar
      gestational age to quantify differences in concentrations of several hormones and other
      pregnancy products. The purpose of the study is to assess the consistency of these data with
      hypotheses regarding the altered cancer risk daughters of twin pregnancies experience. All
      data collection is completed. We are currently analyzing the data for development of
      manuscripts to be submitted for publication.
