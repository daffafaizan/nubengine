      general, and the therapeutic morbidity. Surgery alone can cure only one out of two patients,
      radiochemotherapy improves the local control but the metastatic risk remains about 30% with
      enhanced postoperative morbidity and poor functional results. The tumor response to
      preoperative treatment is the major prognostic factor which revealed the aggressiveness of
      the tumor. To this day, there are no biologic predictive markers for tumor response.

      The purpose of this trial is to tailor the management according to the early tumoral response
      after short and intensive induction trichemotherapy. MRI volumetric tumor response will be
      used to distinguish between good responders and bad responders.

      "Very good" responders will be randomized to either immediate surgery or radiochemotherapy
      followed by surgery (Standard arm: Cap 50). "Good or bad" responders will be randomized
      between two arms: intensive radiochemotherapy (Cap 60) or the standard arm (Cap 50).

      This tailored management should result in a better oncologic prognosis with a lower rate of
      post therapeutic functional disorders.
