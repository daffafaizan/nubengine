      postinflammatory hyperpigmentation present in phototypes IV to VI. Previous reports have
      described increased intensity of Masson-Fontana, anti-tyrosinase and/or anti-TRP1 staining,
      indicative of melanocyte stimulation and increased melanin production, but the exact
      mechanism is unknown. The hair plucking, the rubbing of clothes on skin and physical
      stimulation from washing and drying the underarm are factors implicated. The objective of our
      study is evaluate the depigmenting effect of topical niacinamide versus desonide in axillary
      hyperpigmentation through the histochemistry and immunohistochemistry staining.

      The study population will include at least 30 axillas with hyperpigmentation in a population
      with phototype III-V and aged 18-50 years old. Informed consent will be obtained from the
      patients, under approval by the local ethical committee (Institutional Review Board). The
      patients are going to be randomly assigned to receive 4% niacinamide, 0.05% desonide or
      placebo daily once at night. None hygienic habit is going to be modified. Volunteers will be
      evaluated at baseline and 9 weeks later, with histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis
      (biopsies), colorimetric value axis L*, a*, b* (Chromameter CR-300, Minolta, Osaka, Japan),
      Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) by means of an evaporimeter (Dermalab, Cortex Technology,
      Denmark), clinical assessment and photography control.

      Statistical analysis was performed using t student, the level of significance was set at 5%.
      And clinical evaluation will be analysed by means of chi square test.
