    
      Open-label prospective trial to study efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) once monthly for 6 months in children and adolescents with PANS
      (including the subgroup PANDAS). Number of subjects: 10. Age range: 4-17 years.

      Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) is a recently defined research
      diagnosis describing an abrupt, dramatic onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms including
      obsessions/compulsions and/or food restriction in children. Immunologic mechanisms are
      suspected, but treatment trials are few.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIG), 2 g/kg given every 4 weeks for 6 months, to patients with post-infectious
      PANS/PANDAS, in improving neuropsychiatric symptoms and impairment.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate changes from baseline to follow-up at
      3 months, 6 months and 12 months in:

        -  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms

        -  adaptive functioning

        -  quality of life

        -  cognitive functioning

        -  for patients with baseline inflammation signs on cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging
           (MRI) to evaluate changes in these measures after IVIG therapy after 6 months.

        -  number of days of work/school/daily activities missed per subject year due to
           PANS/PANDAS before and after IVIG therapy

        -  parental care load, e.g. need for sick leave, before and after IVIG therapy

        -  Immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM and IgA) levels at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months

        -  sustainability of any improvement at 12 months after initiation of IVIG measured with
           the PANS scale, CGI-S and CGI-I

      To assess the safety and tolerability of high dose IVIG therapy

        -  Clinical signs and symptoms (nausea, headache, local reactions)

        -  ALAT

        -  Hemoglobin, complete blood count including leucocyte differential

      Investigational product: Intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG (Privigen), 2 g/kg BW every 4th week
      for 6 months (= 6 infusions).
