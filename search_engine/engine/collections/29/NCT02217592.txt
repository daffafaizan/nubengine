      NE Thailand.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To define the clinical outcome of community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in NE
           Thailand.

        2. To determine factors associated with inflammatory response, organ failure, and mortality
           in community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in NE Thailand, including causes of
           sepsis, sepsis resuscitation, antimicrobial treatment and genetic factors.
