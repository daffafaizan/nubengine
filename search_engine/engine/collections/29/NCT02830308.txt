    
      This is an observational protocol designed to collect data from adult subjects with known or
      suspected endocrine or metabolic disorders.

      OBJECTIVE: The overall purpose of endocrine evaluations under this protocol is to increase
      knowledge of endocrine or metabolic diseases. Adults with known or suspected endocrine or
      metabolic-related condition(s) may be evaluated under this protocol for:

        1. Collection of data for endocrine related conditions (case reports, case series)

        2. Collection of data for future research

        3. Collection of samples, including leftover samples from clinically indicated tests, for
           future research (including genomics)

      METHODS: Patients will undergo a history and physical exam, anthropometrics, vital signs and
      endocrine laboratory studies.
