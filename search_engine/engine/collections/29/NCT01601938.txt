      After the diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock, enrolled patients will be randomized.
      Then, selenium or placebo will be intravenously administered to them for 7 days. Hemodynamic
      and laboratory data will be recorded for 7 days and additional serum samples will be obtained
      at 0, 24, 72, and 168 hours post-treatment and stored. Mortality will be observed for 28
      days.

      An interim analysis will be conducted by the independent data safety monitoring board.

      Serum selenium levels will be measured from the stored serum samples after the study
      completion.
