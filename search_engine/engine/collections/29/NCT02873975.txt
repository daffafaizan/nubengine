      inhibitor prexasertib (LY2606368) in patients with advanced solid tumors exhibiting one of
      the following:

        1. Replicative stress, including MYC amplification, CCNE1 amplification, Rb loss, or an
           FBXW7 mutation

        2. An HR deficiency, including tumors with genomic or somatic mutations of BRCA1, BRCA2,
           PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, ATR, ATM, CHK2, or the Fanconi anemia pathway genes

        3. A CCNE1 amplification
