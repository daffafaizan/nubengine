      closure device compared to manual compression (standard of care) to achieve hemostasis after
      endovascular procedures requiring access within a severely diseased CFA.

      This study will be a retrospective single center review of 200 patients undergoing
      endovascular procedures utilizing vascular access within a severely diseased CFA between 2018
      and 2020 at Yale New Haven Hospital. A random selection of patients undergoing hemostasis
      with manual compression (n = 100) and VASCADE vascular closure system (n = 100) will be
      conducted. The two groups will then be statistically compared with respect to 48-hour and
      30-day safety and efficacy outcomes.
