      comes in for 1 screening visit (3 hours long). Cognitive/problem solving tests, computerized
      tasks, CPT, questionnaires and functional measures are administered along with a screening
      blood lab. If a participant is eligible, he/she comes back for 1 full study day visit (9-10
      hours long). A testing battery (similar to the one done during the screening visit) is
      completed at baseline and again at three timepoints following medication administration.
      Blood draws, vital signs, and pupil measurements are taken throughout the day. A follow-up
      phone call is completed within a few days of the full study day visit, during which a
      questionnaire is given.
