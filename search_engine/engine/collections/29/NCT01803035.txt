      will be enrolled to three treatment groups who will receive 1 % LTX-109, 2 % LTX-109 or
      placebo three times daily (TID) for 5 days. Patients will be randomized to receive LTX-109 or
      placebo at a ratio of 1:1 at each of the doses.

      Patients â‰¥2 years with non-bullous impetigo will be enrolled in the study. Study candidacy
      will be determined by a dermatological examination, medical history, clinical diagnosis of
      non-bullous impetigo and a positive Gram-stain. Patients meeting eligibility will be
      randomized to one of the treatment groups.

      A safety visit will be performed at Day 4. Clinical response will be evaluated by clinical
      success, clinical improvement or clinical failure according to definitions in the protocol at
      one or more of the visits - Day 4 (-1), Day 6 (+2) and Day 12 (+2), and will be derived from
      the Skin Infection Rating Scale (SIRS) score of the target lesion.

      Bacteriological response will be evaluated by culture of swabs collected from the target
      lesion. Success or failure will be defined by presence or non-presence of the causative
      pathogen (bacteria isolated at baseline considered being the causative pathogen: S. aureus or
      S. pyogenes). Bacteriological swabs will be collected if pus/exudate is available at Day 4
      (-1), Day 6 (+2) and Day 12 (+2), if there is exudate/pus available from the target lesion.
      No pus/exudate will be considered as elimination of the causative pathogen, and will be
      considered as bacteriological success.
