      involving inflammatory and apoptotic cellular response. Erythropoietin (EPO) has shown
      neuroprotective effects via activation of anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, and anti-apoptotic
      pathways. The safety and feasibility of EPO in children were proven in previous clinical
      trials. In addition, the efficacy of EPO is actively being investigated and some reports have
      shown potential benefits in cerebral palsy. To confirm the safety and efficacy of multiple
      injections with expected effect, retrospective review on medical records was performed.
