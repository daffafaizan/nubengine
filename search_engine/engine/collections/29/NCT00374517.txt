    
      The purpose of this Phase II clinical trial is to establish whether pulmonary tuberculous
      lesions are hypoxic or contain hypoxic microenvironments using an in vivo hypoxia-imaging
      marker, pimonidazole hydrochloride, in subjects undergoing lung resection surgery for
      treatment-refractory pulmonary tuberculosis.

      The study population will be drawn from subjects undergoing treatment at the National Masan
      Tuberculosis Hospital (NMTH), Masan, Republic of Korea. Subjects who are scheduled for
      partial lung resection surgery for treatment refractory TB will be eligible for this study.
      Selected subjects will be those who demonstrate one or more radiographic abnormalities
      associated with pulmonary tuberculosis (e.g., cavities, nodules, consolidation, fibrosis, or
      calcified lesions).

      Subjects undergoing elective pulmonary resection will receive a single preoperative IV dose
      of pimonidazole 0.5 g/m(2) in 100 mL of normal saline, infused over 20 minutes 18 to 24 hours
      prior to surgery. The resected tissue will be analyzed to look at the following: 1) the
      degree of pimonidazole-adduct formation in tissue specimens with different histopathologic
      presentations; 2) the number of acid-fast bacilli in tissue sections, smears, or cultures
      prepared from homogenized lesions from distinct gross anatomic and histopathologic types in
      relation to the extent of tissue hypoxia, and; 3) comparison of lesions labeling with
      pimonidazole with the presence of human cellular and bacterial markers expected to be
      expressed under oxygen-limiting conditions. NIAID study investigators will have no input of
      any kind in selecting subjects for surgery, or in determining the kind or extent of surgical
      resection. Subjects will be on study from a few days before surgery until approximately 8
      weeks after their surgery.
