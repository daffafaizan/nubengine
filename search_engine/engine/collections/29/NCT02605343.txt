      patients and poor pain management is a significant risk factor for early readmission. In
      addition, the rate of non- response to certain analgesics is double in patients who are poor
      metabolizers as demonstrated by mutations in both CPY26D alleles. There is a growing body of
      literature that indicate that ineffective acute pain management contributes significantly to
      the risk of chronic pain syndromes. Genetics and drug interactions can alter both the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a multitude of drug compounds and in turn influence
      both the safety and efficacy of selected therapeutic regimens.

      Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection can enhance patient response by facilitating the
      selection of the most appropriate medication at the most effective dose in the shortest
      possible time.

      In this prospective, observational, single-blind study, the investigators will evaluate the
      clinical impact of pharmacogenetics-guided treatment on patient well-being as determined by
      post-op pain assessments and the frequency of changes in analgesics predicted by testing
      results. Additionally, the impact of PGx-guided treatment on narcotic consumption, time to
      mobilization, number of adverse events, length of stay, and re-admission rates compared to
      historical data will be evaluated during the duration of the study.
