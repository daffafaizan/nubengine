      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of tumor
           vasculature-targeted tumor necrosis factor alpha (NGR-TNF) in patients with advanced
           solid tumors.

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the mechanism of action of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive tumor vasculature-targeted tumor necrosis factor alpha (NGR-TNF) IV over 1
      hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of NGR-TNF until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 12 patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression or the start of a new
      anticancer treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
