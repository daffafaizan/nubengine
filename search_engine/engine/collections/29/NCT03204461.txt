      by the Rotterdam and the NIH-criteria, as well as in healthy control subjects. In addition
      1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Imaging was used for the assessment of the ectopic
      lipid content in the liver, heart and skeletal muscle. The aim of the present study was to
      compare the glucose metabolism and the ectopic lipid conent in the liver, heart and muscle
      between women with the PCOS defined by the NIH-criteria, Rotterdam-criteria and healthy
      control subjects.
