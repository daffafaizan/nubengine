      levels of FP-045 for 28 days to determine safety and tolerability. Once safety evaluation at
      highest dose is complete, 3 cohorts of 6 pediatric subjects will receive one of 3 escalating
      dose levels of FP-045 to determine safety and tolerability. Subjects tolerating FP-045 well
      may go on to receive a total of 3 months of treatment.

      In expansion, 20 additional subjects, adolescent and pediatric, will be enrolled and treated
      at the recommended phase 2 dose of FP-045 for their age group, for up to 6 months to study
      effects on hematologic parameters. All subjects will be followed closely with serial
      hematology and chemistry laboratory assessments, physical exams, and monitoring for adverse
      events. Samples for pharmacokinetics will be obtained, and multiple pharmacodynamic markers
      will be assessed periodically.
