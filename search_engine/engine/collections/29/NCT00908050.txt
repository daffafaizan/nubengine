      clenching. Generally it occurs during sleep, but occasionally can be present during the day,
      so called awake bruxism. Bruxism is a common condition, affecting approximately 8% of all
      people. It is not known what causes bruxism but it may result in tooth damage, jaw pain,
      headaches, poor quality sleep and may bother your partner's sleep at night due to the tooth
      grinding noise. There is no generally accepted treatment for bruxism. Mouth guards and
      several medications have been tried, but they generally did not work or caused side effects.

      Botulinum toxin "Botox" is a natural toxin, which weakens the muscles when injected in very
      small amounts. It is currently approved and used for the treatment of various conditions
      involving abnormal muscle spasms, such as neck twisting (torticollis), twitching of the face
      (hemifacial spasm) or eyes (blepharospasm), headaches, muscles stiffness following strokes,
      and it has also been used cosmetically for wrinkle removal.

      Since bruxism is caused by involuntary spasms of the jaw muscles, botulinum toxin has been
      tried, initial results showing that it is safe and effective. The injections generally take
      one week to start working and 2 weeks for a full effect, which lasts on average 12-16 weeks,
      and slowly wear off. The injections are generally repeated every 3-4 months.
