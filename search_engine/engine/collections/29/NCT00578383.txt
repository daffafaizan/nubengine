      Participants will be asked to complete several questionnaires about their mood during both
      visits. The treatment visit will involve use of the LFMS device. Participants will place the
      top of their head inside the device for approximately 20 minutes. Participants will receive
      either the actual treatment or a sham treatment and will not know which they receive. This
      device produces weak electromagnetic fields. There is no discomfort or even sensation caused
      by the device. The device has been declared to be a "non-significant risk device" by the FDA,
      and there are no known risks associated with its use.
