      management includes inpatient administration of either oral or intravenous antibiotics with
      resumption of oral intake as symptoms improve. Recent literature has however questioned both
      inpatient and antibiotic treatment. Indeed, both inpatient and antibiotic treatment are
      associated with non-negligible risks to patients. The aim of this trial is to assess the
      feasibility of a randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether nonantibiotic
      treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe in the outpatient setting. It is designed
      as a pilot non-inferiority blinded randomized controlled trial. The estimated length of this
      pilot trial is 1 year. The target population is capable adults of who have a CT-diagnosed
      episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis who present to the Jewish General Hospital Emergency
      room.
