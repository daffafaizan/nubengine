      completion of a 3-day diary for baseline evaluations, including urodynamic testing. The clean
      intermittent catheterization (CIC) frequency remained constant throughout the Dose Titration
      Period. The dose was adjusted every two weeks during the Dose Titration Period by increasing
      one dose level, at the investigator's discretion, based on the patient's symptoms. If a
      patient achieved complete continence and reported tolerable or absence of side effects, the
      patient was continued at that dose for the duration of the 8-week Titration Period. If a
      patient reported unacceptable side effects, the dose was reduced by one level. This reduced
      dose was considered the maximum tolerable dose for the patient and the patient continued at
      that dose for the duration of the 8-week Titration Period. The dose levels evaluated were 3.9
      mg/day, 7.8 mg/day, 9.1 mg/day, and 11.7 mg/day. Of the 22 subjects in the modified
      intent-to-treat population evaluated for efficacy, 0 were in the 3.9 mg/day dose group, 3
      were in the 7.8 mg/day dose group, 8 were in the 9.1 mg/day dose group, and 11 were in the
      11.7 mg/day dose group.
