      world. Recently In a multicenter, randomized clinical trial performed in China, which aimed
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of compound Î±-keto acid tablet in combination with low
      protein diet (LPD+KA) in delaying the progress of type 2 diabetic nephropathy(T2DN). In that
      study it was found that LPD+KA was associated with amelioration of proteinuria, better
      reduction in the loss of kidney function compared with LPD alone meanwhile nutrition status
      remained well in both group(Role of Ketoanalogs in diabetic nephropathy-China study, to be
      submitted for publication). However, in that study the mechanisms underlined these effects
      were not been elucidated This research proposal is a part of the continuation of that study.
      Restriction of Protein intake, strictly control blood pressure, particularly using
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade have been shown to ameliorate proteinuria and
      progression of CKD. Podocyte damage has been know to play critical role for proteinuria and
      renal function loss A recent study showed that the mRNA expression of podocyte markers in
      urinary sediment is increased in patients with T2DN, and this effect can be inhibited by ACE
      inhibitor and ARB, which indicates the important role of local renal RAS to involve in the
      damage. Urinary angiotensinogen level is a good marker of the situation of renal RAS.
      Consequently the investigators are proposing to study the effect of LPD+KA on podocyte as
      well as on local RAS in the kidney.
