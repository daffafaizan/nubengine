    
      This is a longitudinal, randomized, crossover study with patients with CKD on hemodialysis
      and in non-dialysis patients.

      Both groups will receive 4g of sulforaphane per day for 2 months and the placebo group will
      receive 4g of corn starch colored with chlorophyll for 2 months. Peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) are being isolated for expression of Nrf2, NF-kB, and NADPH quinone
      oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), HO-1, VCAM-1, E-selectina, NLRP3, IL-1B, IL 18, PGC1-Î±, Sestrina,
      NRF2, NRF-1 e TFAM mRNA expression by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
      Antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase-CAT and glutathione peroxidase-GPx), high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) will be assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA).The serum concentration of other cytokines and growth factors will be detected by
      means of a multiparametric immunoassay based on magnetic microspheres marked with XMap
      (Luminex Corp, USA) before and after supplementation.
