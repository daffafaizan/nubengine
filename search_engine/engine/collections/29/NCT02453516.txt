      anesthesia has the potential to provide superior pain relief with fewer side effects compared
      to standard systemic opioid therapy. The search for a regional anesthesia technique for
      breast surgery has been ongoing as this technique needs to be time efficient, relatively
      risk-free and also practicable in an out-patient setting. The serratus block is a promising
      technique that may combine these advantages.
