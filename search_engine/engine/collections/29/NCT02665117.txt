      subsequent studies suggested that CTD - induced side effects were independent from
      hypokalemia. On the other hand, magnesium depletion has been linked to increased
      Renin-Angiotensin- Aldosterone (RAA) system, the development of metabolic syndrome and
      insulin resistance with magnesium supplementation ameliorating these effects.

      Participants will participate in a double-blinded, parallel design study. After baseline
      evaluation participants will take Chlorthalidone (CTD) alone for 2-3 weeks. They will then be
      randomized to two equal groups to take KMgCit powder or Potassium Chloride (KCl) powder along
      with CTD for 4 months.

      We speculate that Mg depletion is responsible for hepatic fat deposition, which then produces
      insulin resistance. Co-administration of KMgCit powder would avert magnesium (Mg) depletion,
      block hepatic fat deposition by restoring normal Mg status and direct intestinal binding of
      fat, thereby ameliorating insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis, we shall quantitate
      muscle Mg status and hepatic fat content by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) before and
      after KMgCit. Change in fasting glucose, insulin resistance, serum potassium, FGF23, and
      aldosterone will be compared between KCL and KMgCit groups after 4 months.
