      non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the activity and toxicity of the combination of
      gemcitabine and vinorelbine in these patients. III. Compare the survival rate and quality of
      life of these patients treated with combination chemotherapy versus single agent
      chemotherapy. IV. Compare objective response and time to progression of these patients
      treated with these chemotherapy regimens. V. Compare the toxicities of these three regimens
      in these patients. VI. Compare the number of hospitalizations, palliative radiation
      therapies, antibiotic therapies, corticosteroid therapies, analgesic therapies, and
      hematopoietic growth factor therapies needed for these patients treated with these
      chemotherapy regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, stage of
      disease (IIIB vs IV), and performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to one of
      three treatment arms. Patients receive either vinorelbine IV, gemcitabine IV, or both on days
      1 and 8 of each 21 day course. Patients who achieve an objective response or stable disease
      after 3 courses receive 3 more courses (for a total of 6 courses). Quality of life is
      assessed before treatment, after course 4 (or 3 weeks after course 3, if therapy is stopped),
      and at 21 days after course 6 (or 12 weeks after course 3).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 630 patients (210 patients per arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
