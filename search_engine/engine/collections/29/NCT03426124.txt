      the treatment of pulmonary embolism. The APT treatment and follow-up assessments are per
      clinical judgement and institutional standard of care which may vary at each clinical site.

      For the retrospective arm of the registry, the investigators will gather data from
      consecutive cases of individuals who received the APT treatment for pulmonary embolism.
      Specific baseline, treatment, and long-term health information is collected and
      de-identified.
