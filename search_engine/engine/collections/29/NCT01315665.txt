      will activate Nrf2, reduce oxidative metabolites and reduce neutrophils in the oral mucosa
      after 5 days of therapy in healthy volunteers and CF subjects.

      The study requires 6 brief outpatient visits over 8 days. Study procedures include medical
      history, height, weight, vital signs, blood and urine collection, nasal curettage, saline
      mouthwash, and ingestion of broccoli sprouts (100 gm of 3 to 5 day old raw broccoli sprouts
      once daily for 5 consecutive days).
