      hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. The appropriate interface is necessary to
      provide comfort and lead to the success of NIV.

      Helmet continuous positive airway pressure (hCPAP) is an NIV interface that allows the
      provision of high airway pressures with a minimal leak.

      HFNC which delivers heated humidified high flow oxygen provides a good alternative to the
      conventional NIV in terms of comfort
