      devastating effects on the mental and physical well-being of cancer patients. This study will
      determine whether healing touch and relaxation therapy are effective in minimizing the side
      effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients.

      Participants in this study will receive weekly chemotherapy and daily radiation treatments
      for 6 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either standard care (SC), SC
      plus relaxation therapy, or SC plus healing touch therapy. The relaxation therapy consists of
      progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery. The healing touch therapy involves an
      energy-based modality in which health care practitioners stimulate the energy fields
      surrounding the patient. A physician-completed assessment and measures of immune function
      will be used to assess the well-being and overall quality of life of participants.
