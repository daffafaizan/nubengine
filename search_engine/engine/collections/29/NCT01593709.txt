      Testing of vaccines, antiviral medications, or live virus challenge studies in volunteers may
      requires knowing whether the subject has been previously infected by the virus. We will
      recruit healthy persons for this study and screen them for their eligibility to participate
      in clinical trials of investigational vaccines or antiviral products, investigational studies
      of licensed products, or live virus challenge studies. In most cases this will involve a
      medical history, physical examination, and obtaining blood to test for antibodies to the
      virus being studied in a vaccine or antiviral therapy trial or live virus challenge study. In
      some cases blood may be tested for viral DNA or RNA and urine, stool, saliva, nasal swab, or
      nasopharyngeal wash secretions may be tested for viruses or antibodies to the virus.
      Additional testing, such as an electrocardiogram (EKG), chest radiograph (CXR), and pulmonary
      function tests (PFTs) may be done. Samples will also be stored for future research. This
      study should help us to identify a group of volunteers that will be eligible, based on
      testing for their prior exposure to viruses, to participate in vaccine or antiviral therapy
      trials, or live virus challenge studies, .conducted by the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases,
      NIAID at the NIH Clinical Center.
