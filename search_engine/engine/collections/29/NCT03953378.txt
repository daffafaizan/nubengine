      harmful CD4+ effector T cells (Teff) than classical Th17 as they co-produce interferon-γ
      (IFN-γ) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A). For this reason, Th1.17 rise increasing interest in RA
      and PsA since they seem involved in their pathophysiology. Hyper activation of Teff in RA and
      PsA results partly from a deficiency in regulatory mechanisms of Teff's pro-inflammatory
      functions. The ecto-nucleotidase CD73 delineates Teff enriched in Th1.17 features and acts as
      a regulatory mechanism for these pro-inflammatory cells. Considering that MTX, usually used
      as first line treatment of RA and PsA, increases extracellular concentrations of adenosine
      monophasphate (AMP) and immunosuppressive adenosine, the investigators hypothesized that
      CD4+CD73+ T cell effector population enriched in Th1.17 and Th17 cells may participate in the
      pathogenicity of RA and PsA but also in the resistance to MTX treatment through the specific
      expression of CD73 essential for Ado generation and which is down-regulated on proliferating
      T cells.
