      patients with localized smack cell bronchopulmonary cancers, or not to small cells not
      metastatic but not operable. Radiation therapy results in changes in respiratory function, as
      measured by respiratory function tests and represented primarily by spirometry, total body
      plethysmography, and the diffusion capacity of the alveolar-capillary membrane.

      Although these tests are minimally invasive, few studies have investigated the implications
      of radiation therapy on lung function in patients treated for pulmonary neoplasia, while
      these patients are often already carriers of respiratory diseases and will receive further
      chemotherapy during their illness, subject to their general good condition, including
      respiratory. No method has been recognized as superior for measuring the consequences of
      radiation therapy on respiratory function. After chest radiotherapy alone, the decline in
      diffusion capacity is estimated at 10-34%. New irradiation techniques have emerged over the
      last decade, in particular dynamic arc therapy. This innovative technology, combined with
      image-guided irradiation processes, ensures high-precision, short-term treatment, but exposes
      virtually all of the lungs to irradiation, although at very low doses, the objective
      consequences of which on respiratory functional explorations have never been reported.

      The aim of this study is therefore to assess the consequences of low doses of radiation
      delivered by this recent technology, volumetric therapy, on the respiratory capacity of
      patients treated with radiotherapy within the framework of of bronchopulmonary carcinoma.
