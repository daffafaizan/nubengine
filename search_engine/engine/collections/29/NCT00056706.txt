      stroke. We recently found that transient deafferentation of one hand in healthy subjects
      enhanced performance in corticomotor excitability and a tactile discriminative task,
      targeting muscles in the opposite non-deafferented hand. The purpose of this protocol is to
      test the hypothesis that transient deafferentation of the intact hand in chronic stroke
      patients will improve functions in the paretic hand. We plan to study patients with chronic
      strokes dating back at least one year, and either predominantly motor or somatosensory
      deficits.

      Primary outcome measures are (a) in patients with predominantly somatosensory deficit,
      deafferentation-induced improvement in a tactile discrimination task (grating orientation
      task GOT and (b) in patients with predominantly motor deficit, deafferentation-induced
      improvement in pinch muscle strength.

      Modified primary outcome measure will be the decrease in interhemispheric inhibition
      targeting the paretic hand during deafferentation of the healthy hand (chronic stroke
      patients, motor deficit group).

      Secondary outcome measure will be the decrease in interhemispheric inhibition targeting the
      non-deafferented hand in healthy control subjects.
