      the study as follows: FST I-II, at least 5 subjects; FST III, at least 10 subjects; FST IV,
      at least 5 subjects. Additionally, up to 20 training subjects will be enrolled that will be
      excluded from efficacy analysis, but will be included in safety analysis.

      Standardized baseline and follow-up images will be taken using the sites' preferred camera
      system. No pre-treatment medication prior to study treatment.

      Phase I: Study subjects will receive up to three treatments with the PicoPlus with the 595nm
      on one hand and the 660nm on the other hand. Subjects will receive the same wavelength for
      all treatments on each specific hand; treatments will alternate by subjects between the left
      side getting treated with the 595nm and the right side getting treated with the 660nm
      depending on enrollment. Treatments will be 30+7 days apart up to three treatments until
      desired clearance has been achieved.

      Phase II: Up to 2 balancing treatments may be done if needed based on the investigator's
      discretion to achieve equal clearance on each hand utilizing the wavelength of the
      investigator's choice. Phase II will not be considered for efficacy endpoints.
