      peripheral vasculature. Because of the unique design of the catheter, with its six expandable
      infusion limbs, the Bashir™ Endovascular Catheter has the ability to: 1. Create a much larger
      central channel for blood flow, thereby utilizing the body's own endogenous fibrinolytic
      agents to lyse the clot, and 2. Greatly enhance the radial dispersion of a
      catheter-administered thrombolytic agent throughout the thrombus. Expansion of the multiple
      arms of the basket in the infusion catheter causes fissuring of the clot. The net result is
      that a greater surface area of clot is exposed to both endogenous and exogenously
      administered lytic agents, thereby promoting clot dissolution.
