      and falls risk assessment with health education/promotion and appropriate referral) in
      partnership with Hamilton Paramedic Service, City Housing Hamilton (CHH), and the Community
      Care Access Center (CCAC) that focuses on issues experienced by older adults that often lead
      to EMS calls. CHAP-EMS is based on the Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program (CHAP) model,
      which combined individual- and population-level strategies for primary prevention and 'closed
      the loop' by linking participants to follow-up care. Literature demonstrates that the CHAP
      program resulted in a significant 9% relative reduction in admissions due to stroke, heart
      failure, and heart attacks in people aged 65 and over.

      The original CHAP program was run by trained volunteers. This modified program will be run by
      accommodated paramedics (unable to assume traditional paramedic duties due to personal
      limitations such as pregnancy or injuries). Subsidized housing buildings house frail,
      seriously ill and potentially unstable individuals who may require immediate assistance.
      Paramedics are an excellent fit to deal with these emergent situations since their training
      prepares them to accurately assess the patient's health status and the environmental context,
      and connect patients with primary care physicians, visiting nurses, and community services
      including falls prevention; these skills can be expanded to provide non-urgent health care
      services and health promotion work. EMS administrators indicate that there is no shortage of
      accommodated staff at the Hamilton Paramedic Service and work considered as light duties is
      scarce.

      The objectives are to evaluate whether a weekly 8-hour CHAP-EMS program is associated with
      changes in (1) number of emergency (911) EMS calls from the seniors' residence building, (2)
      mean blood pressure (BP) of participants and (3) diabetes risk profile of participants after
      one year of implementation.
