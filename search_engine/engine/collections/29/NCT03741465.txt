      clinical study. Six parameters were evaluated in each position; subcutaneous tissue (ST),
      skin to spinous process (S-SP), transverse diameters of bilateral paraspinal muscles (left
      paraspinal muscle [LPM] and right paraspinal muscle [RPM]), interspinous gap opening (ISGO),
      mean of bilateral paraspinal muscles (MPM). The change of every measurement recorded via
      ultrasonography (USG) according to the positioning techniques (the Anatolian Sitting Position
      [ASP] could also be named as "sitting fetal cross-legged position" and the Sitting Fetal
      Position [SFP] which is a traditional sitting position) were also calculated. The
      calculations are explained briefly in primary outcomes (including the change of ASP-SFP in
      ST, S-SP, LPM, RPM, MPM, ISGO). Stretcher comfort (SC), position comfort (PC), lumbar comfort
      (LC), and abdominal comfort (AC) were evaluated by the participants with the 5-point
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).
