      Unit (NICU) over the past 10 years to eliminate waste and reduce harm in healthcare. POKE is
      a combination of a unique culture and process, with a supporting database, that is designed
      to guide and inform care decisions while minimizing POKEs. The program utilizes an
      implementation framework, educational materials, electronic health records (EHR), and
      decision support analytics. POKE's initial deployment showed extremely promising results for
      Intermountain, which included: (1) eliminating 11,000 POKEs per year (a 50% reduction in
      overall POKEs), (2) realizing $940,000 per year in cost savings (a 28% reduction of overall
      cost), (3) reducing length of stay by 2 weeks per average stay (a 21% reduction in length of
      stay), and (4) eliminating Hospital Acquired Infections (i.e., Central-line Associated
      Bloodstream Infection and Ventilator-associated Pneumonia), translating into 10 lives saved
      and a $5.2M savings over a decade. POKE will now be deployed and routinized within all
      Intermountain Healthcare NICUs and be developed as a commercial product for external
      customers. To assess the impact of POKE on babies, the investigators will longitudinally
      track several outcomes before and after implementation at Intermountain NICUs. Process
      outcomes will include the number of total POKEs per baby and the number of painful POKEs per
      baby, each measured at both the patient-level and NICU-level. Clinical outcomes will include
      hospital acquired infections, length of stay, and mortality. Financial outcomes will include
      total variable costs and backfill rate.
