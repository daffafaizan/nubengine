      hemodynamics making it an attractive option for treating post operative pulmonary
      hypertension in the cardiac surgical patients. It is inexpensive and feasible to administer.
      Intravenous as well as oral doses have been shown to reduce the mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in animal models as well as in
      clinical trials with adults with primary pulmonary hypertension and children after cardiac
      surgery . However, no data exists to support the safety and efficacy of Sildenafil citrate in
      the adult cardiac surgical population. The purpose of this study is to further investigate
      the potential role of Sildenafil citrate to treat post operative pulmonary hypertension in
      the cardiac population.
