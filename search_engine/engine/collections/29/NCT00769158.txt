    
      Eight (n = 8) alcohol-dependent research volunteers, not seeking treatment, will complete a
      placebo-controlled, within-subject cross-over design in which alcohol-related and control
      cues are presented as stimuli to induce alcohol-seeking behavior under controlled laboratory
      conditions after repeated dose (chronic) treatment with double-blind doses of placebo or
      topiramate + naltrexone.Subjects will reside in an inpatient environment for two separate
      9-day blocks interspersed by a 1-week washout period. During separate blocks, topiramate +
      naltrexone and placebo doses will be administered orally on a twice-daily regimen (08:00 h
      and 20:00 h) for 8 days.Doses will start the evening of day 1 and the last dose will be given
      the morning of day 8. No doses will be given the evening of day 8 or the morning of day 9. On
      Days 7 and 8 of the dosing regimen, subjects will receive alcohol and alcohol-related cues or
      the corresponding control cues.
