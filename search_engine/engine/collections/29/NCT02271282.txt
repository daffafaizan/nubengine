      (IGFBP-3) decline in healthy aging men and women. Relative sex-steroid deprivation
      accentuates GH and IGF-I depletion, since Te stimulates GH and IGF-I production in older men,
      hypogonadal males of all ages, and patients undergoing (genotypic female-to-male) gender
      reassignment. The estrogen-receptor antagonist, tamoxifen, blocks this effect of Te,
      suggesting involvement of E2 in GH's stimulation at least in young men. E2 alone stimulates
      GH secretion in young and older women. Because Te is converted to E2 by aromatization in the
      body, we postulate that E2 is the active moiety in both men and women. Moreover, we
      hypothesize that the decline of E2 in older men and women contributes to the fall in GH
      output. These basic concepts will be tested here.
