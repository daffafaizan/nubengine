      of their radiation-induced wound. The remaining untreated area will serve as an irradiated
      control.

      The donor tissue will be collected from normal skin in the upper thigh area. In addition to
      their primary screening visit, patients will be followed up closely in a series of 9 study
      visits. During these sessions, photographs will be taken and patients will be asked to fill
      out questionnaires.
