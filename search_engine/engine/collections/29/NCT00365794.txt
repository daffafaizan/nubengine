      of supplemental testosterone (gel formulation) to increase testosterone levels to the upper
      normal range in 12 older hypogonadal (testosterone levels less than 300 ng/dL) men with
      abdominal obesity and elevated fasting insulin levels. Subjects will be assigned to receive
      10 g of transdermal testosterone (Androgel) every morning to achieve levels in the upper
      normal physiologic range (similar to men in the 3rd and 4th decades) for 20 weeks.

        -  For the primary objective, regional adipose tissue, namely DEXA measures of abdominal
           and appendicular fat mass and hepatic fat, and IMCL will be quantified by
           1H-spectroscopy at baseline (study week 0) and at study week 20 (completion of study
           therapy).

        -  For the secondary objective, insulin sensitivity (peripheral Rd, hepatic glucose output
           [HGO]) and hepatic gluconeogenesis will be measured directly during a two stage
           hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp at baseline and study week 20.

        -  Indirect markers of lipid (adiponectin, ApoB 100) and carbohydrate metabolism (Fasting
           blood sugar, HOMA-IR) at study week 10, and study week 20.

      All components of the study will be conducted in the USC NIH-funded (NCRR), General Clinical
      Research Center.
