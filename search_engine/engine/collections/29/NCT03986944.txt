      efficacy and safety of linzagolix administered orally once daily at doses of 75 mg alone and
      200 mg in combination with low dose ABT (E2 1 mg/NETA 0.5 mg) versus placebo in the
      management of moderate to severe EAP in 450 women.

      Eligible subjects who have completed the 6-month treatment period may enter a separate
      extension study for 6 additional months of active treatment (no placebo control). Subjects
      who do not continue in the extension study will enter a 6 month treatment-free follow-up
      phase.
