      disorders ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, in the absence of other known
      causes of liver steatosis. NAFLD is a highly prevalent disorder which is directly linked to
      patients' lifestyle and is accompanied by severe co-morbidities. Although there is a wealth
      of studies on NAFLD's pathogenesis, natural course and treatment, few investigations have
      focused on patients' quality of life (QoL) and even fewer have evaluated the impact of
      therapeutic interventions on patients' quality of life and psychosocial functioning. In this
      context, there is a significant literature gap, given that modern research and clinical
      practice should aim at meeting patients' subjective physical and psychosocial needs and
      improving their overall quality of living.

      Aim-Methods: In this context, the aim of the present study is to assess the effect of
      systematic counseling on NAFLD patients' quality of life, psychological distress, fatigue and
      lifestyle habits.

      The current study will be conducted at the Gastroenterology Department of the University
      Hospital of Patras with the collaboration of the Department of Psychiatry. NAFLD patients
      will be invited to enrol to the study after being thoroughly informed about its aim and
      methods. Eligible patients will be assessed at baseline and then will be randomized to
      receive either systematic counseling based on the principles of Motivational Interviewing or
      care as usual. All participants will be re-evaluated at 6 months after study initiation. In
      addition, all patients will be submitted to laboratory tests including complete blood count,
      serum albumin, hemoglobin, gamma-globulin, ALT, AST, Î³GT, ALP, bilirubin, PT, INR, urea,
      creatinine, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides both at baseline and at study
      completion
