      I. Determine the activity of CCI-779 in patients with relapsed, refractory, or transformed
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (relapsed or refractory chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] vs transformed CLL).

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients achieving an objective response may receive 3 consolidation courses of therapy.
