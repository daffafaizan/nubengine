      deformity requiring surgical correction will be enrolled in a prospective multicenter
      international study. Spinal deformity will be defined as any coronal or sagittal plane spinal
      deformity in patients who have not undergone any previous spinal surgery (with the exception
      of prior decompression of a maximum of 2 levels) necessitating at a minimum a 5-level spinal
      fusion procedure. Standard radiographs and cross sectional imaging will be performed
      preoperatively, postoperatively, at 24 months and 5 years after surgery. Preoperative disease
      specific and general health questionnaires will be completed by all patients (EQ-5D, ODI,
      SRS-22r, NRS for back and leg pain). Follow up visits with questionnaires will be performed
      at 10 weeks (± 6 weeks), 12 months (± 2 months), 24 months (± 2 months) and 5 years (±6
      months) post-operatively. All treatment-related AEs will be documented.

      Regression analyses will be used to evaluate the association between patient demographics,
      comorbidities, treatment history, spinal deformity characteristics, surgical characteristics,
      treatment-related AEs and pre-surgical status to self-reported and radiographic outcomes
      after surgery.
