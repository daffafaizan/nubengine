      albumin-bound nanoparticle form of paclitaxel designed to avoid problems associated with
      solvents used in Taxol. And albumin-bound paclitaxel was characterized with high tolerated
      doses with greater efficacy, and with greater concentration in tumor tissue compared with
      normal tissues. A multicenter randomized controled trial (coded as CA031) showed that
      nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin had higher response rate than traditional
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin, especially in squamous lung cancer. This is a single center,
      non-randomized, open-label Phase II clinical study to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in previously treated advanced or metastatic
      squamous lung cancer after failure of platinum-based doublet therapy.
