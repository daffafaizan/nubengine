      Primary

        -  Improve median progression-free survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular
           cancer treated with bevacizumab and transarterial chemoembolization therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab once in weeks 1, 3, and 5. Beginning in week 3,
      patients also receive transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy. Treatment repeats
      approximately every 8 weeks for up to 3 courses. Patients achieving < 100% necrosis by MRI
      after the first course receive 2 additional courses of bevacizumab and TACE.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
