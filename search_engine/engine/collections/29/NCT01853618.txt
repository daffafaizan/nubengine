      Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy with a median
      survival of 6-9 months. For patients with advanced disease sorafenib is the only approved
      drug and this has limited benefit.

      Tremelimumab is a monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4
      (CTLA4). Anti-CTLA4 therapy has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immunity by blocking
      tumor-induced immune suppression of cytotoxic T cells.

      Various tumor ablative procedures and techniques have been shown to result in immunogenic
      cell death and induction of a peripheral immune response. Both transarterial catheter
      chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have been shown to do this, as
      well as cryoablation and external beam radiation.

      The underlying hypothesis of this study is that the effect of anti-CTLA4 treatment can be
      enhanced by TACE or RFA in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. We will also
      evaluate this in the context of cryoablation and radiation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      and RFA in cholangiocarcinoma.

      Objective:

      To assess the safety and feasibility of combining Tremelimumab with trans-arterial catheter
      chemoembolization (TACE) radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or cryoablation in patients with
      advanced HCC.

      Eligibility:

      Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC.

      Childs-Pugh A/B7 cirrhosis only is allowed. If patient does not have cirrhosis, this
      limitation does not apply.

      Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Stage B and C patients.

      Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection,
      radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation.
