      coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). The plan is to include 1000 patients prior
      to CCTA at two centers.

      Blood samples for biomarker measurement will be obtained prior to the procedures. The
      diagnostic results of the imaging tests will be compared to the levels of circulating
      troponins. Patient will be followed for a minimum of 12 months and the incidence of
      cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndromes, revascularization, heart
      failure, stroke and cardiac arrhythmias requiring rehospitalization. Symptoms of angina
      pectoris according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading of angina pectoris and
      symptoms of chronic heart failure according to the New York Heart Association classification
      of chronic heart failure will be recorded.
