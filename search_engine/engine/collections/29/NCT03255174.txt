    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness
      of EVARREST in controlling mild or moderate bleeding in hepatic parenchyma or soft tissue for
      which standard methods of achieving hemostasis are ineffective or impractical.

      Eligible subjects will be treated with EVARREST. Subjects will be followed post-operatively
      through discharge and at 30 days (+/-14 days) post-surgery.

      Enrollment will be staggered by age. The first group will include 31 subjects ≥1 years to <18
      years of age and the subsequent group will include 4 subjects from 1 month (≥ 28 days from
      birth) to <1 years of age. Ongoing safety assessment will ensure adequate safety monitoring
      occur during the staged enrollment.

      At least thirty-five (35) qualified pediatric subjects with an appropriate mild or moderate
      bleeding TBS will be enrolled in this study.
