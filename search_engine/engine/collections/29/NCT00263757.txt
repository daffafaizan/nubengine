      cardiovascular disease. Observational data suggest that sleep apnea may play a role in the
      development of atrial fibrillation (AF), and may even predispose to recurrence of AF
      following electrical cardioversion (DCCV). Because of biases and confounders inherent to
      observational studies, we propose a randomized clinical trial to assess the effects of
      treatment of sleep apnea in subjects with AF treated with DCCV. Following polysomnography,
      subjects with sleep apnea will be randomized to positive airway pressure (PAP) or usual
      medical care and followed for up to one year to compare a primary outcome of AF recurrence
      rate.
