      like to evaluate a new supraglottic airway named Baska mask. We would like to monitor certain
      parameters (time to and ease of insertion, failure rate, seal pressures, complications etc)
      as regarding the performance and safety profile of this device. This is a descriptive case
      series of patients undergoing airway management under general anaesthesia.
