    
      Patients with stage III melanoma with palpable disease, na√Øve for CTLA-4/PD-1/PD-L1
      immunotherapy, will be treated either post-surgery for 12 weeks with the combination of
      ipilimumab+nivolumab or in a split design for 6 weeks upfront surgery and for 6 weeks
      postsurgery. It is a two-arm Phase 1b feasibility trial consisting of 20 patients, 10 in each
      arm.

      At different timepoints tumor biopsies and blood for PBMCs will be taken for translational
      research. Also scans will be done on specific timepoints.

      The study will be held to determine safety, feasibility, and the immune-activating capacity
      of short-term combined neo-adjuvant and adjuvant ipilimumab + nivolumab. And to determine
      relapse free survival (RFS), any late adverse events, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and
      the correlation between RFS and changes in neo-antigen specific T cell response.
