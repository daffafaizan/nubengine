      and design preliminary surgery plans. Secondly, three-dimensions resin skull models were
      produced by rapid prototyping technology. Model surgeries were performed to determine the
      location, reduction direction and shift distance of osteotomy. Based on the surgical
      simulation, the preliminary surgery plans were validated and optimized. Then, the titanium
      plates and mesh were preshaped on the models. Finally, according to the final surgery plans
      the operations were performed. The operation time, therapeutic effects and complications were
      observed. The follow-up periods were 1-12 months.
