    
      THE GOAL OF OUR STUDY IS TO

        1. Quantify the amount of bone remodeling 24 months after total knee arthroplasty using
           sequential dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the proximal tibia in younger and more
           active patients (less than 60 years of age).

        2. Evaluate the evolution of functional outcome over a 24 months period using sequential
           subjective and objective clinical evaluations using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and
           Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Sf-12 v2 in this cohort of
           patients.

        3. There is also an interest in looking at the activity level before and after the surgery
           (by using the Tegner Activity Level Scale and the UCLA Activity Level Scale) and to
           determine the ability to return to an active lifestyle and the impact on implant
           survival.

      Two groups will be created:

      Group 1: NexGen cemented modular metal-backed tibial implant (Titanium) Group 2: NexGen
      uncemented Trabecular Metal(TM) modular tibial implant A total of 88 patients will be
      recruited
