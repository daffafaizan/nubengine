      tablet, over 78 weeks as a treatment for subjects (50-80 years old) with Early AD who are
      homozygous for the Îµ4 allele of the apolipoprotein gene (APOE4 homozygous or APOE4/4). The
      primary efficacy outcome assessment is a measure of cognition (ADAS-cog 13). Additional
      measures of global and functional impairments will also be assessed. Imaging and soluble
      biomarkers of AD and neurodegeneration will be measured and a sub-study to evaluate
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers is also included.
