      selenoproteins. The liver converts dietary selenium to a form that can be used to make
      selenoproteins. Patients with cirrhosis have much lower selenium levels than healthy
      individuals. We hypothesize that patients with cirrhosis are unable to utilize dietary
      selenium for selenoprotein synthesis. These patients may benefit from another form of
      selenium: selenate.

      We will compare the effects of two supplemental forms of selenium on plasma selenium levels
      in patients with cirrhosis. Patients will be randomized to receive either a placebo, 200 µg
      selenomethionine, 200 µg selenate or 400 µg selenate, daily, for 8 weeks. We will measure
      selenium levels in the blood at baseline, week 4 and week 8. We will determine which forms of
      selenium, if any, increased plasma selenium levels of the cirrhosis patients.
