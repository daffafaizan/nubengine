      Intravenous normal saline, 2) Intravenous normal saline and intravenous bicarbonate, 3) oral
      hydration, and 4) oral hydration and oral bicarbonate. The primary endpoint was the
      occurrence of contrast-medium-induced nephropathy defined as greater than 25% increase in
      serum creatinine from baseline or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL from baseline at 72 hours
      following exposure to radiocontrast. Secondary endpoints include the length of
      hospitalization and in-house mortality.
