      circle including infection, inflammation and airway repair. Today's principle of treatment is
      to break the cycle of inflammation and infection. Nowadays, most clinical trials are
      anti-infective treatment by antibiotics trying to break this cycle by reducing the bacterial
      load, which may cause bacterial resistance. There were still some anti-inflammation trials by
      using inhaled corticosteroids(ICS). Tsang and Martínez-García showed that inhaled
      corticosteroids reduced IL-1,IL-8 levels and sputum inflammation cells, and improved sputum
      volume as well as quality of life, though the corticosteroid must be high dose or medium dose
      combined with long-acting ß2 adrenergic agonists. As described in asthma and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), theophylline can improve the activity of histone
      deacetylase (HDAC) and then enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of steroids. We hypothesis
      that theophylline may have the same effect in subjects with bronchiectasis. Theophylline plus
      inhaled low-dose formoterol-budesonide may improve quality of life and reduce airway
      inflammation.
