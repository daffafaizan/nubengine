    
      This is a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, randomized controlled trial
      investigating the impact of sirolimus on ketamine's antidepressant effects in participants
      with antidepressant-resistant depressive symptoms.

      Prior to this, there was a phase 1 which included monitoring 3 subjects over the course of 7
      days after a single dose of sirolimus and ketamine in order to inquire about side effects or
      interaction effects.
