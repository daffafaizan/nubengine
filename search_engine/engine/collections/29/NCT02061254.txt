      called elastograph.

      The first pilot step will be on 8 patients (4 with lymphedema and 4 with venous
      insufficiency). The main objective is to assess the feasibility of measures by high
      resolution transient elastography on these pathologic skins, and to define 3 areas for
      measures.

      The second step will be on 136 participants (48 healthy volunteers, 48 with venous
      insufficiency and 40 with unilateral lymphedema of a limb). The main objective is to
      quantify, by high resolution transient elastography, the dermal and hypodermal cutaneous
      fibrosis in limbs with lymphedema and venous insufficiency, and to compare it to healthy
      skin.
