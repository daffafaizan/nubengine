      an acute, closed Weber C-type ankle fracture. The ankle syndesmosis will be fixed using the
      new medical device (antibiotic containing bioabsorbable screw) or the routinely used device
      (metal screw). The investigational antibiotic containing bioabsorbable screw for ankle
      syndesmosis repair (the thread diameter 4.5 mm) will be made of bioabsorbable
      poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) 80:20 and ciprofloxacin, which is a bactericidal
      antibiotic. The main purpose of the screw is to prevent syndesmosis widening after Weber
      C-type of ankle fracture. The secondary function of the screw is to reduce the risk for
      colonization of the implant with bacteria and subsequently prevent biomaterial-related
      infection. In the control group, a stainless steel screw will be used. All patients will
      receive the standard of care for concomitant fractures and other injuries of the ankle.

      The key variables in the assessment will be radiostereometric (RSA) measurements of the
      syndesmosis width, CT imaging of the ankle mortise and standard radiographic evaluation of
      the syndesmosis width and ankle mortise. Clinical outcome of the ankle fracture treatment
      will be measured using standardized outcome questionnaires (RAND-36, AAOS Foot and Ankle
      Outcome Instrument, Olerud and Molander score, VAS pain scale). The follow-up of the patients
      will be 52 weeks. The metal screw will be removed 8 weeks after fracture surgery. The
      expected mechanical integrity of the bioabsorbable screw is 6 - 8 weeks, while the complete
      absorption time of the bioabsorbable screw in human body is expected to be approximately two
      years
