    
      This exploratory Phase IIa study aims to investigate the preliminary efficacy in terms of
      parasite reduction and clearance in malaria patients, and the tolerability of OZ439
      administered as single dose regimen at 3 different doses in parallel cohorts of patients with
      either acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria mono-infection
      (10 patients per plasmodium species per dose level).

      Treatment with OZ439 will be given as a single dose on Day 0, starting in the first cohort at
      a dose of 800 mg. Established antimalarial therapy will be given at the latest at 36 hours
      post dosing.

      The primary endpoint will be the derived parasite reduction rate (PRR) at 24 hours after
      study drug administration.

      A review of each individual study cohort (dose/species) will be conducted with the Principal
      Investigator and the Sponsor and a decision will be reached on whether the dose for the next
      cohort should increase or decrease (within 200mg-1600mg range). This decision will be based
      on parasite reduction rate over the first 24 hours following administration of OZ439,
      tolerability and exposure.
