      receive up to 20 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression over 16 weeks.
      Participants will complete clinical measures (interviews, questionnaires, and computer-based
      tasks) and biological measures (blood tests, physiological measurements,
      electroencephalography ) before, during, and after treatment.
