      preparations and the comparators will be tested observer-blind. Treatments will be randomly
      assigned to the test fields. All subjects will receive all treatments, with intraindividual
      comparison of the treatments.

      Altogether six test fields will be examined per subject (three active AN2728 ointments of
      different concentrations: 5 %, 2 % and 0.5 %, the active ingredient-free vehicle, a marketed
      corticoid preparation and a marketed topical immunomodulator). The test fields will be
      treated occlusively over a study period of 12 days. A topical application of approximately
      200 uL of each assigned intervention will be administered per treatment, for a total of 10
      treatments over a 12-day treatment period.
