      emotions can impair cognitive abilities and decrease clinical performance. The beneficial
      effect of positive communication on patients' emotions has widely been studied. However, the
      emotional and cognitive impact of positive communication between caregivers remains
      uninvestigated. The primary purpose of this trial is to study the impact of positive
      communication between anaesthetic teams during medical transmissions on clinical performance
      for managing a subsequent stressful unexpected adverse event. Secondary outcomes are to study
      the impact of positive communication on physiological (heart rate variability) and
      psychological (psychometric scales) levels of stress.
