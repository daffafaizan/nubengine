      diseases with a significant impact on quality of life. DLE is currently treated with potent
      topical steroids, antimalarials, and immunosuppressants. Recent research has determined that
      DLE is a Th1 mediated disease. There is increasing evidence that JAK inhibitors such as
      tofacitinib can treat the Th1 mediated diseases such as alopecia areata. Therefore the goal
      of this study is to determine if JAK inhibitors can successfully treat DLE. Tofacitinib has
      not previously been studied in DLE. This will be a pilot study that is descriptive for early
      clinical impressions and molecular mechanisms in order to obtain initial information to
      potentially design an appropriately -powered phase 2 or 3 study for efficacy of JAK
      inhibitors that could take place in the future
