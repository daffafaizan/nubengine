      of questionnaires and diagnostic guidelines for KD will be sent to 50 hospitals providing
      pediatric medical care in Shanghai, China. Medical records of participants with KD diagnosed
      from January 2013 through December 2017 will be retrospectively analyzed. Data are collected
      by pediatricians, including demographic information, clinical manifestations, prognosis,
      laboratory indexes, treatment and echocardiographic findings.

      Age and seasonal distribution at onset, treatment and cardiac abnormalities wil be described.
      Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to identify risk factors for coronary
      artery lesions.
