      itraconazole therapy (Lozanoc 50mg capsules or Sporanox 100mg capsules) on the morning of Day
      1, and commence therapy with Lozanoc 65 mg capsules for 21 days from the evening of Day 1.

      The number of Lozanoc 65mg capsules to be taken by the participant will be 2 capsules (130mg)
      morning and evening OR the same number of Lozanoc 50mg capsules that the participant received
      in study MPG010, if applicable. That is, if the participant received 3 x 50mg Lozanoc
      capsules morning and evening on study MPG010 he/she will receive 3 x 65 mg Lozanoc 65 mg
      capsules, morning and evening in study MPG011

      The dose of study drug (Lozanoc 65mg) may be dose-reduced or ceased for toxicity at the
      discretion of the investigator.

      Participants will undergo the following assessments during the course of the study:

        -  Concurrent medication(s)

        -  Clinical adverse events

        -  Measurement of vital signs (weight, blood pressure, temperature)

        -  Targeted physical examination

        -  Documentation of any evidence of systemic fungal infection

                rate [eGFR], sodium, potassium, chlorine, bicarbonate)

             -  Liver function tests (bilirubin, albumin, total protein, alanine aminotransferase
                [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST])

        -  Pharmacokinetic testing

             -  pre-morning dose (0 h sample) at Baseline (Day 1), and at Days 8, 15, and 22
