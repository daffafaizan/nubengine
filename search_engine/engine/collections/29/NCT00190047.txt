      Follow-up Period. During the Screening Period, subjects will be selected for the study on the
      basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below). A screening computed tomography scan
      to exclude brain bleeding will be performed. The patient's informed consent will be obtained.
      The patient will be randomly allocated to DP-b99 or placebo. Immediately after this
      randomization and baseline assessments (lab tests and ECG), subjects will be given a 2-hour
      intra-venous infusion of DP-b99 or placebo. Additional 3 such infusions will then be given
      daily to a total of 4 consecutive treatment days, which make up the "Treatment Period".
      Throughout the 4-day Treatment Period the treatment's safety and the National Institutes of
      Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score will be evaluated daily. (The NIHSS assesses certain
      abilities of the patient, e.g. strength, speech, vision and coordination). If their condition
      requires, patients may have to stay in hospital more than these 4 days, regardless of their
      participation in the study.Subjects will be further assessed for NIHSS score changes and
      safety (lab tests and ECG) during the Post-treatment Follow-up Period, with data collected 30
      and 90 days after the stroke. Other outcome scales (Barthel Index and Modified Rankin Scale)
      will be also used in the Day 30 and Day 90 visits
