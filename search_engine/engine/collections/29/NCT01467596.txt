      US-SCB from middle age population can not be applicable to the elderly population since our
      preliminary data, presented at Euroanesthesia meeting in Amsterdam, 2011, and published in
      abstract form in the European Journal of Anaesthesiology, showed that involutional changes of
      brachial plexus in elderly, assessed by measuring the cross-sectional area (CSA) of brachial
      plexus at the first rib, allowed a 35% reduction in local anesthetic volume for an effective
      US-SCB for surgical anesthesia in elderly patients in comparison with the younger patients.
