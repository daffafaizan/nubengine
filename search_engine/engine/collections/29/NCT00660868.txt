      concentration of adenosine 3´,5´-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). In the cilia of olfactory
      sensory neurons (OSN) cAMP is degraded by phosphodiesterase 1C2 (PDE1C2). Inhibition of
      PDE1C2 could result in an increased response of OSN to chemical stimuli. Aim of the present
      prospective post-marketing surveillance study was to investigate the impact of
      pentoxifylline, an unspecific phosphodieasterase inhibitor, on olfactory function.
