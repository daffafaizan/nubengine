      with a technique developed by the laboratory. The second group of antioxidants received a
      combination of antioxidants monthly for three months. Both groups were compared to assess the
      results in terms of ovarian response (number of astral follicles, AMH levels, FSH, LH), and
      egg quality, embryo development, implantation rate, and successful pregnancy with healthy
      live birth.
