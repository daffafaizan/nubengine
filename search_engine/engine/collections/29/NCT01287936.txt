      therapy. SB623, a modified stem cell preparation, has been shown to improve motor function
      when administered in animal models of stable stroke. Safety studies in animals have shown no
      adverse events attributed to SB623. Patients who meet the entry criteria for this study will
      have regular examinations, radiological evaluations (CT, MRI, PET), and be followed for two
      years. Regular neurological evaluations will also be done using standard questionnaires, with
      occasional video recording if improvements are evident. Key entry criteria for this study, in
      addition to 6-60 months post-ischemic stroke, include moderately severe symptoms--e.g.,
      difficulty standing or walking, and/or difficulty using arms or hands, and/or speech
      impediments.
