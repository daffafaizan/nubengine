    
      APOLLO study is a pre-market approval (INVICTA leads - devices under investigation - are not
      CE marked), interventional, prospective, longitudinal, international (European), multicenter,
      single arm study.

      The devices under investigation, the INVICTA defibrillation leads, are new quadripolar leads,
      to be used with Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy
      Defibrillators (ICD/CRT-D).

      This clinical study intends to demonstrate safety and electrical performances of the INVICTA
      leads among the different models: active fixation either single coil (model 1CR) or dual coil
      (model 2CR)leads models. The clinical data will be used to support the application to CE
      marking of INVICTA leads.

      The primary endpoints will be evaluated at 3 months post-implantation; secondary endpoints
      will be evaluated up to 2 years post-implantation.

      A total number of 445 patients will be enrolled in the study, in up to 60 centers in Europe.

      The follow-up visits are scheduled at hospital discharge, at 1 month, at 3 months, at 6
      months, at 12 months, at 18 months and at 24 months, post-implant
