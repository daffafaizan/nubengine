      rehabilitation outpatient clinic will be included.

      The data of patients with COPD who are eligible for PR and have been pre-evaluated will be
      scanned. Respiratory function test, arterial blood gas analysis, six-minute walking test
      (6-MWT), mMRC Dyspnea Scale, St George Quality of Life Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety
      Depression Scale will be used in the study. Patients with COPD who smoke will constitute the
      study group, and those who quit smoking will constitute the control group.
