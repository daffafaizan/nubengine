      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of bevacizumab when
      administered with erlotinib in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.

      II. Determine the objective response rate and stable disease/absence of early progression in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bevacizumab followed by a randomized, multicenter
      study.

      Phase I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Phase II: Course 1 is 28 days in length. All subsequent courses are 21 days.

      Course 1: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 15 and oral erlotinib on
      days 1-28.

      Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib on
      days 1-28.

      All subsequent courses: All patients receive bevacizumab as in arm II and oral erlotinib on
      days 1-21.

      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
