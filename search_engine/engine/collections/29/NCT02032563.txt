      ICG 0.25 mg/kg will be given as an iv injection at least 20 minutes before the beginning of
      the operation.

      Optionally, dynamic NIR imaging centered on the tumor bearing breast will be acquired during
      the 15 minutes after injection (in comparison with standards of known fluorescence
      intensity).

      Optionally and in case of tumorectomy, peroperative "in vivo" imaging of the surgical
      dissection will be acquired. The tumour and/or the mammary piece (and the axillary piece) of
      dissection will be directly imaged "ex vivo" using the PDE camera (in comparison with
      standards of known fluorescence intensity).

      In the Laboratory of Pathology:

      The fresh mammary piece will be processed as usual, but the "gross-thick" sections will be
      imaged using the PDE and the fluorescent areas will be defined (and later analyzed in
      comparison with standards of known fluorescence intensity).

      After fixation, the tumoral tissues as well as - if identified - non tumoral fluorescent foci
      will be thereafter processed "as usual".

      All the slides obtained will be analyzed using the NIR fluorescent microscope for the
      presence or not of detectable ICG and the ICG-positive tissues or compartments (vascular
      spaces, interstitial spaces, normal and/or tumoral cells, macrophagesâ€¦) will be determined.

      If fluorescent foci are identified at the level of the axillary piece, they will be isolated
      and analyzed like the other lymph nodes. Using the NIR fluorescent microscope, these isolated
      macroscopically fluorescent structures will be analyzed (lymph node? Other?).

      Additionally, metastatic lymph nodes will also be controlled for their microscopic
      fluorescence or not.
