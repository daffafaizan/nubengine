      genders, were selected, after a medical examination, to participate in the study. In a
      randomized controlled trial, the volunteers were submitted to sessions of muscle relaxation
      (autogenic method), progressive self-focus meditation, and cognitive-behavioral training in
      self-control of negatives feelings. They were also trained to determine goals and to
      determine each step to reach them (plan of action).The volunteers have to apply this strategy
      to control emotional behavior and improve interpersonal relationship. Anxiety and depression
      scores will be determined using the Beck self evaluation scales (BDI and BAI); quality of
      life will be determined using WHO-QOL inventory and the Ryff Scale will be used to measure
      Psychological Well-Being.
