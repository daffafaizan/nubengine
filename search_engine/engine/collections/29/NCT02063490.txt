      interventions are often disappointing. The aim is to test a nurse-led multifactorial
      intervention to enhance phosphate binder adherence.

      Methods In a quasi-experimental clinical trial, phosphate binder adherence was measured
      electronically in 135 hemodialysis patients for one year and phosphatemia measured monthly.
      For all patients, months 1-2 were baseline (no interventions were performed). The
      intervention arm was given 1 "preparatory" intervention and then monthly 8 "maintenance"
      individualized management sessions. The control arm received standard of care.
