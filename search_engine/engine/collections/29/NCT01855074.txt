      (participants are followed over time with continuous or repeated monitoring of risk factors
      or health-outcomes), non-randomized (a clinical trial in which the participants are not
      assigned by chance to different treatment groups), single-center study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of long acting microspheres of risperidone in adult participants with
      schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders. The duration of this study will
      be 12 months and duration of treatment will be 6 months. The study will include 4 visits:
      Baseline, and 3 follow-up visits including Week 4, 12 and 26. All eligible participants will
      be treated with risperidone 25 milligram (mg) intramuscular injection (injection of a
      substance into a muscle) for every two weeks up to 6 months. Participants with persistent
      symptoms and/or requiring higher doses of antipsychotics (agents that control agitated
      psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a
      quieting effect) will be initiated with higher doses of risperidone. Doses will be adjusted
      according to the response of the treatment. Efficacy and safety of the participants will be
      primarily evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS) and Extrapyramidal
      Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), respectively. Participants' quality of life and safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
