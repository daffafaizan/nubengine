    
      Background:

      Patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), as compared with STEMI
      patients, have a higher risk profile, more often MVD and less favourable outcome. Recent
      studies showed that complete revascularization in STEMI patients is feasible and effective.
      However, there is no clear evidence regarding the role of complete coronary revascularization
      by PCI in patients with non-STEMI with MVD.

      Objective:

      To compare FFR guided complete revascularization during the index procedure with usual care
      in non-STEMI patients with multivessel disease.

      Design:

      Prospective, multicentre, 1:1 randomized, investigator initiated study.

      Hypothesis:

      FFR guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all significant stenosis in the
      non-culprit lesion performed within the index PCI procedure will improve clinical outcomes
      compared to the usual care, guided by discretion of the physician.
