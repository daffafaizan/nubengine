      I. To determine a composite end point of alive and severe acute GVHD free at 6 months
      following human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related or unrelated donor hematopoietic
      peripheral blood transplant in patients with hematologic malignancies who receive the
      immunosuppressive combination tacrolimus, bortezomib, anti-thymocyte globulin (TBT) as GVHD
      prophylaxis.

      II. To determine the safety of this combination in the first six months post-transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the cumulative incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD.

      II. To determine incidence and severity of chronic GVHD.

      III. To determine disease relapse or progression overall and disease free survival at one
      year.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) on day -3 through day 180. Patients may
      receive tacrolimus orally (PO) later at the doctor's discretion. Patients receive
      anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -3, -2, and -1 and bortezomib IV on day 0 and day 3.
      Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months and then
      periodically for up to 2 years.
