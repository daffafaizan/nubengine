      to be active in ENKTCL. For several patients with relapsed/refractory or advance ENKTCL,
      hemophagocytic sysdrome (HPS) occurs, and the prognosis is very poor. Studies have found that
      etoposide and dexamethasone may be effective in controlling HPS. Thus, this study aims to
      evaluate the role of gemcitabine, pegaspargase, etoposide, and dexamethasone (GPED) in the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory or advance ENKTCL, wishing to improve the prognosis for
      these patients.
