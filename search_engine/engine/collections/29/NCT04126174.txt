      outcomes after LenSx laser arcuate relaxing incisions utilizing the Woodcock nomogram at 90%
      thickness vs. manual (blade) fixed keratome diamond knife at 600 microns for arcuate relaxing
      incisions utilizing the Donnenfeld nomogram. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively and at
      1 day, 1 month and 3 months post-operatively. Clinical evaluations will include measurement
      of visual acuity, manifest refraction and corneal astigmatism measurement with the Lenstar
      and slit lamp exam.
