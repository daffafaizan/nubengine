      developed in reference to Social Cognitive Theory and includes: (1) enhanced physical
      education classes (2x/week and delivered by a Physical Education teacher), (2)
      break/lunch-time physical activity sessions (the participating girls will encourage younger
      girls to make Physical Activity during break and/or lunch-time. This session will only happen
      after 3 months of enhanced Physical Education classes, so the girls will be able to pass
      their knowledge for the others), (3) Nutrition and Physical Activity handbooks with 10 health
      messages (lessons to be done at home and their family); (4) 4 Parent newsletters; (5) Food
