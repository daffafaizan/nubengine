    
      SMART-AV is a randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, non-significant risk, three-armed
      trial that will investigate the effects of optimizing AV delay timing in heart failure
      patients receiving CRT-D therapy. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio using randomly
      permuted blocks within each center. The study will compare chronic changes in structural and
      functional outcomes in CRT-D patients randomized to AV delay set as fixed, set with
      SmartDelay or determined by echocardiography. Patients will be followed at enrollment,
      implant, post-implant, 3-months post-implant and 6-months post-implant.
