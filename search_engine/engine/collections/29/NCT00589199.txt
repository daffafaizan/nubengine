      respiratory secretions and foreign materials. In patients with chronic bronchitis, previous
      investigations have found that the cough mechanism is the most effective measure to enhance
      mucous clearance from the lung.

      Patients with cervical and thoracic spinal cord injuries have suffered a loss of the major
      portion of their expiratory muscles. Consequently, they are unable to generate significant
      positive intrathoracic airway pressures or airflow and have a markedly increased risk of
      developing pulmonary infections. Mechanical methods have been developed to enhance cough
      production. However, these have resulted in only marginal increases in airway pressure.

      Preliminary studies in our laboratory in animal experiments and those of others in humans
      have suggested that the abdominal muscles can be stimulated directly by surface electrodes.
      The purpose of the present study, therefore, is to assess the utility of abdominal muscle
      stimulation in quadriplegics and paraplegics to simulate cough. A range of stimulus
      parameters and electrode locations will be assessed to determine optimal stimulus paradigms.
      Airway pressure and expiratory airflow will be used as indices of cough effectiveness. If
      successful, abdominal muscle stimulation may be a useful tool to restore cough and hopefully
      reduce the incidence of respiratory complications such as atelectasis and infection in spinal
      cord injured patients.
