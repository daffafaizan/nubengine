      with a real time feed back and hypoglycemic as well as hyperglycemic glucose alerts vs. only
      retrospective analysis of glucose values is able to improve course of glucose with special
      regard to time spent in hypoglycemic glucose ranges. The second objective is to access
      satisfaction with CGMS during both conditions.

      This study is conducted in an inpatient setting with type 1 diabetic patients. Partisans are
      asked to have twice a continuous glucose measurement with the GlucoDay System (Menarini
      Diagnostics). Each measurement period is limited to maximal 48 hours. In one condition the
      have real time access to current glucose values and alerts are given if glucose is dropping
      below 70 mg/dl or exceeding 180 mg/dl. During the other condition the participants are blind
      against their current glucose values and no alerts are given. Glucose course is
      retrospectively analyzed.

      The order of these two conditions is randomized.

      Expected outcome:

      The primary outcome variable is the daily time spent in hypoglycemic range in type 1 diabetic
      patients with and without impaired hypoglycemia awareness or a history of severe
      hypoglycemia. Additionally the patients will also complete questionnaire about satisfaction
      with CGMS, diabetes related distress, treatment satisfaction, depressive and anxiety symptoms
      which belongs to the secondary variables.
