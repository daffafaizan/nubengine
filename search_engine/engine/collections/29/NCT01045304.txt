      patients may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent
      withdrawal, followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up after the last study treatment
      administration.

      In case of discontinuation of study treatment, the patient will be considered as withdrawn
      from study treatment, and will be followed as planned for at least 30 days after the last
      administration of study treatment for safety purpose. In case of study treatment
      discontinuation without disease progression, efficacy data will be collected every 6 weeks
      until disease progression, death or end of study whatever comes first. After disease
      progression, the patient will be followed-up every 12 weeks (3 months) for overall survival
      until death or end of study.

      The patients who benefit from the study treatment can continue until disease progression,
      toxicity or willingness to stop.
