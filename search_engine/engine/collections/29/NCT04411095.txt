      fascia. Before and after, a measurement will be performed with a goniometer, to see if there
      is a difference in thoracic rotation mobility.

      Subjects in the placebo group get a different technique, where the hands of the therapists
      are simply placed on the thorax, but no manoeuvre will be performed. Before and after, there
      is a measurement in thoracic rotation mobility.

      Data will be compared and statistical analyse will be done to see of there is a difference in
      rotation. So the hypothesis that stretching intrathoracic fascia has an effect on thoracic
      rotation mobility, will be accepted or rejected.
