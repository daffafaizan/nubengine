      Forty-five (45) subjects suffering from foot drop and thigh muscles weakness due to upper
      motor neuron injury or disease will be evaluated for this study. Each subject will be in the
      study for six weeks. Clinical benefits will be measured through an assessment of the gait
      performance. In particular it will test the hypothesis that the NESS L300 Plus System which
      involves foot drop correction with thigh muscles activation, may achieve walking enhancements
      not inferior to those gained from using a system that only corrects foot drop (i.e. NESS
      L300).
