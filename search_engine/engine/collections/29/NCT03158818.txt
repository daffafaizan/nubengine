      to other infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Chronic viral
      hepatitis is caused by hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus and these infections are most
      common in low and middle-income countries, notably Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In Zambia
      there are limited data, but from an HIV cohort, the investigators of this study described
      10-12% prevalence of chronic HBV. To raise awareness of viral hepatitis in Zambia and to
      generate local data to guide policymakers, the investigators will recruit 500 adults with
      chronic HBV infection and follow the cohort in an observational cohort study. In the study
      patients would be managed according to standards of care and no experimental or
      investigational drugs would be used. The investigators will carefully describe patient
      clinical characteristics and among those who receive drug treatment, the investigators will
      describe the effectiveness of that treatment in reducing liver disease.
