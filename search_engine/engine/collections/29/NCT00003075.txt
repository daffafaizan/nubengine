    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of fenretinide (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide; 4-HPR)
      at regressing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). II. Document the qualitative and
      quantitative toxicity of 4-HPR in women with CIN.

      OUTLINE: This is a double blinded study. Patients are randomized to receive either
      fenretinide or placebo. Patients are administered fenretinide or a placebo by mouth (PO)
      daily for 6 months with 3 days of rest every month. Patients undergo colposcopy,
      colpophotography, and Pap smears at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients undergo cervical biopsy
      at 6 and 12 months to assess changes.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 84-100 patients will be accrued.
