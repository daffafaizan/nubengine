      Health Research Grant Project (NIH R01) application that will test the utility of continuous
      portable hemodynamic monitoring in a large-scale randomized trial. Two separate post surgical
      hospital units will be randomized to utilize the Sotera ViSi monitoring system or to not
      utilize the Sotera ViSi monitoring system for a 4 week period of time alternating over the
      period of 1 year. The study team will assess the effect of unblinded continuous monitoring
      and the associated alerts on the cumulative duration (min/hour) of each of hypotension,
      tachycardia, and desaturation. The study team will assess the effect of continuous monitoring
      and associated alerts on the ordinal clinical intervention outcome which measures the single
      most extreme/elevated clinical intervention incurred by a patient for any of the 3 outcome
      variables of interest (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia) during the study period with
      response by staff. The study team will assess the treatment effect on myocardial injury after
      non-cardiac surgery (MINS) during the study period
