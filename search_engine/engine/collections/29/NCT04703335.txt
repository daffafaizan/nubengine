      Product #1, Test Product #2, Positive Control, and Negative Control), one per each side of
      the abdomen and inguinal test sites. Subjects will be required to complete a 14-day pretest
      conditioning period. Subjects will complete a 2-day test period, during which time subjects'
      sites will be treated with the test materials and samples taken following treatment. The
      Cylinder Sampling Technique will be performed for baseline and for sampling 10-minutes,
      6-hours, and 24-hours post-test material-application on Test Days.

      The effectiveness criteria are that the log10 recoveries of the two test products (1% and
      1.5%) are non-inferior to the Positive Control (2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate) with a 0.5
      margin (log10 scale) per square centimeter on the abdominal and inguinal sites within 10
      minutes after drying. The determination of non-inferiority will be based on the upper bounds
      of the 95% confidence interval being equal to or less than 0.5. Superiority will not be
      evaluated in this study.
