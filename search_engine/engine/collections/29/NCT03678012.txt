      utilizing 16 subjects. The subjects in this study are lower partial denture wearers who have
      already had a study partial denture made for them as a part of a partial denture panel under
      14-I-098 (IRB # 1407637739) or who will wear their own lower partial denture which was
      previously approved as part of the panel. The study partial dentures or personal partial
      dentures can house the specimen holders in two hollowed out areas of the buccal surface of
      two posterior denture teeth. The subjects will wear the lower partial dentures with enamel
      specimens in place for three consecutive 14-day study periods.
