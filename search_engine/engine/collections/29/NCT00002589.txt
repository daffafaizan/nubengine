        -  Evaluate the ability of autologous lymphocyte therapy (ALT) given as adjuvant therapy
           following nephrectomy and/or complete surgical resection of any metastatic disease to
           delay or prevent metastatic recurrence in patients with high-risk renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Determine the incidence of tumor recurrence and the survival of these patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity/morbidity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Explore the relationship between clinical response and in vitro autologous lymphocyte
           characteristics, including lytic activity, cytokine production, response to cytokines,
           and phenotypic profile in these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess patient immune status before, during, and after therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to postnephrectomy interval (less than 3 months vs
      more than 3 months), extent of lymph node involvement (N1 vs N2-N3), interleukin-1
      concentration in initial autologous lymphocyte culture (less than 500 pg/mL vs greater than
      500 pg/mL), and prenephrectomy treatment.

      Mononuclear cells are collected by apheresis on day 1 and cultured with interleukin-2 and
      monoclonal antibody OKT3. After cellular production, the autologous lymphocytes are reinfused
      over at least 30 minutes. Treatment repeats monthly for 6 months and then every 3 months for
      6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually
      for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-90 patients will accrued for this study within 3 years.
