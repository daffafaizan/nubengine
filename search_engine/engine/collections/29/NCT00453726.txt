      requiring non invasive mechanical ventilation BNP levels at admission and during the
      following 24 hours during non invasive mechanical ventilation (Non Invasive Positive Pressure
      Ventilation or Continuous positive airway pressure).

      Because in patients affected by acute respiratory failure it is often difficult to
      distinguish if the disease precipitating the respiratory failure is a cardiac disease or a
      lung disease, aim of the present study is to evaluate the discriminating role that BNP could
      have in this group of patients; evaluation will be completed, once obtained clinical
      stabilisation, with an echocardiography and respiratory functional test.
