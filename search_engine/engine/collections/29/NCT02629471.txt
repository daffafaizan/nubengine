      exposure to flashing light stimuli by measuring the response time and level of performance of
      healthy human subjects during exposure to light pulsations.

      Study Design and methods:

        1. Overall study design An open prospective study comprising of cognitive tests performed
           during and following exposure to bright flashing light stimuli.

           Pre and post -cognitive test (within 1 month after the test) ophthalmological tests will
           be conducted.

        2. Study Participants A total of 60 subjects will be recruited for this study over a span
           of 3 months.

      The subjects will volunteer to participate in the study. Flash Tests The subject will be
      positioned at a selected distance from a flashing unit and a screen on which different
      scenarios will be projected.

      The subject will be exposed to the flashing light generated by the study device with various
      parameters (Pulse width, Repetition Rate (RR), Intensity). Static and dynamic targets, will
      appear on the screen at random locations and the subject will be instructed to response by
      aiming a narrow light beam at the targets on the screen. A CCD camera will capture the screen
      scenarios.
