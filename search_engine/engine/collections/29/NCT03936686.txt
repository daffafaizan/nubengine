      regarding cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Then the participant was asked eleven
      questions regarding CVD risk factors which tested their knowledge of those factors. Analysis
      was done to evaluate overall knowledge level of each group and compare the knowledge levels
      across age groups. Then analysis was done to see if any method(s) led to better knowledge
      level within and/or between age groups.
