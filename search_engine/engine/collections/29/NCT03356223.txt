      RECIST 1.1) after 8 weeks of treatment.

      The sample size calculation was based on an A'Hern single stage phase II design, with a
      minimum success (non- progression) rate considered of interest of p1=40% and an uninteresting
      rate of p0=15%. Assuming a type I error alpha of 0.05 and 85% power, 23 patients are needed
      to reject the null hypothesis H0: p<=p0 vs the alternative hypothesis H1: p â‰¥ p1 in a
      unilateral situation.

      Based on the assumption that 10% of the patients may be non-evaluable, 25 patients will be
      included in the study.

      DATA ENTRY AND DATA MANAGEMENT All the data concerning the patients will be recorded in the
      eCRF throughout the study. SAE reporting will be paper-based by Fax.

      The sponsor will perform the study monitoring and will help the investigators to conduct the
      study in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and local
      low requirements.
