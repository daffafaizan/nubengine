      for dementing disorders such as Alzheimer disease. Treatment with the recently developed
      cholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine, has demonstrated significant improvement with few
      issues related to tolerability. In addition to inhibiting the activity of
      acetylcholinesterase, galantamine also modulates the activity of nicotinic cholinergic
      receptors by an allosteric mechanism. As a result, galantamine therapy may be beneficial when
      the response to other agents has been limited.

      Cholinesterase inhibitor therapy has been reported to improve motor tics in children with TS
      refractory to more traditional therapies. Symptoms of co-morbid behavioral disorders,
      primarily inattention, were also improved. Cholinergic modulation appears a promising avenue
      for managing tic disorders.

      Men and women (18 - 50 years of age) fulfilling DSM IV criteria for the diagnosis of chronic
      motor tic disorder, chronic vocal tic disorder or Tourette Syndrome and experiencing
      suboptimal control of tics on current therapy will be enrolled into this open label
      evaluation of galantamine. A total of 6 visits will be required over 22 weeks. Participants
      will follow a standard 4 week titration schedule achieving 12 mg bid after 8 weeks. They will
      maintain at 12 mg bid, or the maximum tolerated dose, for a further 8 weeks and then be
      withdrawn from therapy. The difference in tic severity prior to and upon completion of
      therapy will be examined. The impact of treatment upon obsessions/compulsions,
      attention/concentration, depression, anxiety and quality of life will also be determined.
