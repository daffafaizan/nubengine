      administration of ONTAK. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the change in the number of
      Tregs in the peritoneum with the administration of ONTAK. II. To evaluate the change in the
      number of Tregs in the peripheral blood with the administration of ONTAK. III. To assess the
      clinical impact of ONTAK on tumor burden by serial measurements of CA-125. IV. To assess the
      level of circulating cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-beta2, and TNF-alpha in the peritoneum
      and peripheral blood before and after I.P. ONTAK. OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.
      Patients receive intraperitoneal denileukin diftitox over at least 15 minutes on days 1-3.
      Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of denileukin
      diftitox until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After the
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 weeks, monthly for 3
      months, and then at 6 months.
