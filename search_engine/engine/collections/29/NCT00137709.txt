      types. Lamotrigine, a newer antiepileptic drug available since late 1980s, has a similar
      range of action and is approved as first-line treatment for epilepsy in the United States and
      many European countries as well as in Hong Kong. Recently, concern has been raised over the
      association between valproate treatment and polycystic ovarian syndrome, a condition
      characterised by multiple cysts in the ovaries in women and a range of hormonal and metabolic
      disturbances. Cross-sectional studies from Finland suggest that up to 40% of women treated
      with valproate have polycystic ovaries. Lamotrigine substitution for valproate has been
      reported to normalise these parameters in some patients. Elevated serum insulin and androgen
      levels have also been reported in over 50% of male patients taking valproate for epilepsy.
      However, such high incidence of hormonal abnormalities associated with valproate treatment
      has not been reproduced in studies conducted in other western populations. No similar studies
      in Chinese patients have been reported. In addition, these cross-sectional studies suffer
      from many potential confounding factors, such as previous treatment with other antiepileptic
      drugs, variation in duration of treatment, thus limiting the ability to establish a causal
      relationship.

      This phase IV study aims to examine whether valproate treatment is associated with hormonal
      abnormalities in Chinese epilepsy patients. Newly diagnosed patients will be randomised to
      receive valproate or lamotrigine and their hormonal profiles measured prospectively for 12
      months.
