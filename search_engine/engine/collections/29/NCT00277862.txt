      Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. In countries like Egypt, 73 to 90% of cases
      of chronic hepatitis C are caused by genotype 4. Recently, epidemiological reports showed
      spread of HCV-4 infection in Western countries such as France, Italy, Greece, Spain and the
      United States particularly among intravenous drug users.

      Genotype 4 is the least-studied hepatitis C virus genotype and was considered a difficult to
      treat genotype due to the disappointing response of chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 to
      conventional interferon monotherapy. Recent reports showed that pegylated interferon and
      ribavirin combination therapy markedly increased the SVR rate to 55-70%. We have previously
      shown that, treatment patients with chronic HVCG4with PEG-IFN Î±-2b plus ribavirin for 36 or
      48 weeks was more effective (SVR 66% and 69%, respectively) than for 24 weeks.

      It has been shown in previous studies on chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 that individuals who
      achieve an early virologic have a higher chance to achieve a sustained virologic response.
      Peg interferon and ribavirin therapy is associated with adverse events and is expensive;
      therefore, careful determination of the optimal treatment duration is crucial as it spares
      the patient unnecessary or prolonged therapy and enhances the cost-effectiveness of therapy.

      Therefore the main objective of this randomized, multicenter trial is to assess the clinical
      utility of rapid and early virologic response in determining the optimal duration of peg
      interferon ribavirin therapy in chronic hepatitis C.
