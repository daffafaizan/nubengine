    
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the most common peripheral nerve entrapment disorders
      in the upper limb. CTS is common during pregnancy especially in the third trimester as well,
      a significant percentage of females postnatal may still have some complaints up to at least 3
      years postnatal.

      Purpose: To compare the effect of pulsed magnetic field (PEMF) versus ultrasound (US) in
      treating patients with CTS. Forty postnatal female patients with idiopathic CTS were assigned
      randomly into two equal groups. One group received PEMF with nerve and tendon gliding
      exercises for the wrist 3 times for week for 4 weeks. The other group received US plus the
      same exercises. Pain level, sensory and motor distal latencies of the median nerve (MSDL and
      MMDL), sensory and motor conduction velocities of the median nerve (MSCV and MMCV),
      functional status scale and hand grip strength were assessed pre and post treatment
