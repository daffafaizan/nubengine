      I. To evaluate the safety of administering a HER2 cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) peptide-based
      vaccine (HER-2/neu peptide vaccine) to stage IV breast and ovarian cancer patients receiving
      maintenance trastuzumab.

      II. To quantify and characterize antigen specific T cell subsets specific to HER2 in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of patients after vaccination with a HER2 CTL
      peptide-based vaccine while receiving maintenance trastuzumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients who complete a vaccination series with a
      HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine while receiving maintenance trastuzumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine intradermally (ID) once per month for 6 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and
      then yearly for up to 5 years.
