      (ICUs) have been hampered by right-censoring after short observation periods. None have
      reported 30-day mortality rates and the vast majority of studies have substantial proportions
      of undischarged patients at the time of follow-up. The lack of follow-up at least to ICU
      discharge may cause bias in reported mortality rates. Further, national data on critically
      ill patients have not been previously published.

      This is a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients (â‰¥18 years) admitted to Swedish
      Intensive Care Units with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease during the
      first 2 months of the 2020 pandemic. The Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR) collects data
      on patients admitted to all Swedish ICUs, with 100% coverage since 2019. Thus, SIR is able to
      report on outcomes in a national intensive care population without selection. Little is known
      about the epidemiology of COVID-19 infections in Sweden, which has one of the world's highest
      life expectancies and a significant burden of comorbidity. Coupled with Sweden's 'relaxed'
      approach to COVID-19 pandemic management, health care outcomes are understandably under
      question.

      The main goal is to describe demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, treatments
      and outcomes among critically ill patients with COVID-19. A secondary goal is to identify
      independent risk factors associated with increased mortality for these patients.
