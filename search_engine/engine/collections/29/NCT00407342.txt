      population. There are a wide range of local and systemic clinical treatments and agents for
      clearing, or at least reducing the expression of, psoriatic skin lesions. There is a new
      generation of antipsoriatic drugs that specifically target T-cell mediated inflammatory
      pathways and that are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in the
      United States. Alefacept (Amevive) is one of these so-called biologics. Alefacept appears to
      have several advantages over other systemic antipsoriatic agents and is very well tolerated
      by patients. Weekly administration of alefacept for 12 weeks reduced the psoriasis area and
      severity index (PASI) by greater than 75% in 30% of patients. The maximal antipsoriatic
      effect, however, apparently occurs after the 12-week course has ended. In vitro studies and
      previous case reports suggested that alefacept's antipsoriatic effect may be augmented when
      it is administered in combination with UVB. These findings prompted us to conduct a
      prospective randomized half-body comparison study, in which we ask whether the clinical
      response of psoriatic lesions to alefacept could be improved by combining alefacept with
      standard UVB 311nm phototherapy.

      Comparison: Psoriatic patients are treated with intravenous alefacept once per week for 12
      weeks. One randomized chosen body-half (left or right side) is additionally treated with
      narrowband UVB (UVB-311nm) three times per week until complete clearance of psoriatic lesions
      at the UV-treated side. PASI is evaluated before, weekly during, and for 3 to 12 months after
      alefacept +/- narrowband UVB treatment.
