    
      Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis belongs to a group of severe and multi-systemic diseases
      caused by an extracellular accumulation of fibrillar proteins arranged in beta-pleated
      sheets. This pathology can be hereditary (mutations in the TTR gene) or sporadic. Depending
      on the form, various tissues are affected: peripheral nervous system (leading to neuropathy,
      especially vegetative), heart, kidney... While in forms linked to TTR mutations neuropathy is
      the main manifestation, in the sporadic form (also called wild-type), the cardiac impairment
      is predominant. Other organ damages are rarely reported in this second form. In the THAOS
      registry (Coelho T. et al, 2013), a clinical peripheral neuropathy is reported in 28.4% out
      of 67 patients with the sporadic form of the disease, although the authors do not provide a
      precise description of the neuropathy type. We propose to prospectively study patients with a
      wild-type amyloid cardiopathy condition to identify and describe the associated neuropathy. A
      pilot study conducted at the Bordeaux University Hospital demonstrated the feasibility and
      interest of this research: it showed the presence of an undetermined aetiology polyneuropathy
      in 35.7% out of 14 patients followed for senile cardiac amyloidosis.

      Tafamidis is used on familial amyloid neuropathy and a recent study shows an effect on senile
      amyloid cardiopathy (Maurer MS et al., 2018) which strengthens the need to determine the
      frequency of neuropathies associated with wild-type amyloid cardiopathy and to type them more
      accurately.
