      of stent thrombosis for each patient based on:

        -  a functional approach (evaluation of the antiplatelet effect of the antiplatelet regimen
           by multiple tests) and

        -  a pharmacogenomic approach (genetic profile of response to antiplatelet agents) It
           provides advices for specific therapeutics after identification of adverse drug
           interactions, treatment compliance issues and true genetic, functional or mixed
           resistance.

      This individualized strategy allow to adjust the choice of the drugs and their optimal dosage
      considering the best benefit - risk ratio.

      Follow up are regularly made to identify markers of MACE (major adverse cardiac event) or
      bleeding.
