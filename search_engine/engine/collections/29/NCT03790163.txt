      analgesic profile and adverse effects .Spinal anesthesia is the most commonly used technique
      due to its unmatchable reliability,simplicity and cost-effectiveness. It provides a fast and
      effective onset of sensory and motor block, excellent muscle relaxation and prolonged
      postoperative analgesia .

      Bupivacaine is commonly used local anesthetics because of its long duration of action and
      combined motor and sensory blockade. However, it has many drawbacks .It has a high propensity
      to cause hypotension and bradycardia. There is also cardiac toxicity.Levobupivacaine is an
      attractive alternative to bupivacaine because of the lower affinity for cardiac sodium
      channels and reducing the risk of cardiac toxicity.Moreover ,the isobaric levobupivacaine had
      more stability in cerebrospinal fluid and thus lead to more predictable drug spread,
      decreasing the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia. But its main disadvantage is the
      delayed onset .

      A number of strategies have been used to hasten the onset of local anesthesia .The addition
      of fentanyl mixtures of local anesthetics and alkalization of the local anesthetics all
      shorten the onset time of sensory block. Recently the warming of the anesthetic agents
      (namely, lidocaine and bupivacaine) to 37Â° C hastens the sensory block in various surgical
      settings .

      Up till now there is no study suggestive of any appropriate degree of temperature as adjuvant
      .Hence the present study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of different temperature on
      spinal anesthesia characteristics and the incidence its complication
