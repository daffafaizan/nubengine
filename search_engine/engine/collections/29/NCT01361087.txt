      differentiation, and other functions in most cells. TGF-β levels play a major role in the
      pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome, a disease characterized by disproportionate height, long
      extremities, lens dislocation in the eyes and heart complications such as mitral valve
      prolapse and aortic enlargement increasing the likelihood of aortic dissection. While the
      underlying defect in Marfan syndrome is faulty synthesis of the glycoprotein fibrillin I,
      normally an important component of elastic fibers it has been shown that the Marfan syndrome
      phenotype can be relieved by addition of a TGF-β antagonist in affected mice. This suggest
      that while the symptoms of Marfan syndrome may seem consistent with a connective tissue
      disorder, the mechanism is more likely related to reduced sequestration of TGF-β by
      fibrillin.
