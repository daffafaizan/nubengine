      referred to as Parent Responsivity Education-Milieu Communication Teaching (PRE-MCT). This
      intervention is designed to establish and enhance the development of intentional
      communication prior to the onset of spoken language in children with language delays and
      disorders. In the early stages of intervention, clinicians target children's use of gestures,
      vocalizations, and eye contact to produce more frequent and more complex nonverbal
      communication acts. As the children develop, goals shift to the direct teaching of words and
      sentence structures.

      Our preliminary research using randomized experimental designs has tested the effects of the
      intervention when delivered in a very small 'dose', averaging just over one hour per week for
      six months. This standard dose has led to significant but modest effects in the children's
      use of intentional communication and early language, such that it could be adopted by
      speech-language pathologists as part of standard care. Unfortunately, the early benefits have
      not always been maintained 6 and 12 months after the therapy phase ends and have not always
      benefitted all children.

      This research is a test of the hypothesis that a more intensive application of the
      intervention will have dramatically more positive outcomes than the standard dosage.
