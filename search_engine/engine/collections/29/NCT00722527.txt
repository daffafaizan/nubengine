      polycythemia and thrombocytosis. These will be sought for by genetic and cell biology means.
      The purpose of the study is to identify the molecular defect of these disorders.

      5-7 teaspoons of peripheral blood will be drawn on all study subjects. After DNA is obtained,
      linkage analysis and/or mutation analysis will be performed.
