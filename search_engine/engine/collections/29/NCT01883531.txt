      Statistical Methods:

        -  The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be based upon a modified Grizzle model
           for crossover design. Absolute and relative changes from baseline in percentage of
           predicted FEV1 and FVC will be analysed. The absolute change in percentage of predicted
           lung function (FEV1 and FVC) will be the primary focus. Changes in FEF25-75 will also be
           analysed.

        -  Safety data will be analysed descriptively (listings and summary tables).
