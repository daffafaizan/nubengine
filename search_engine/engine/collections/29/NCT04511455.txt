    
      This is a open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial for patients with locally
      advanced and/or metastatic and/or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      Patients who have histologically proven or were clinically diagnosed (by guideline criteria
      in cirrhotic patients) with locally advanced or metastatic and/or unresectable HCC will be
      included to receive cabozantinib peroral 60 mg/day. A stepwise dose de-escalation schedule on
      individual level is available for patients with lower tolerability against cabozantinib.

      The study treatment will be limited to a maximum of 12 months (including temporary
      interruptions).

      Tumor tissue will be collected for accompanying research project. (Participation is optional
      for participant).

      During treatment, clinical visits (blood cell counts, ECG, detection of toxicity) occur every
      four weeks during treatment phase. Safety will be monitored continuously by careful
      monitoring of all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported.

      During treatment, tumor response will be assessed by the Investigator according to RECIST 1.1
      (radiological imaging by CT and/or MRI of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and all other sites of
      disease every 10 weeks until end of treatment (EOT) and every 12 weeks during follow-up (FU),
      in case of EOT due to other reasons than progressive disease. Safety-FU visit and Survival FU
      visits will be assessed 30 days-, and every 12 weeks after EOT.
