      group. Corrected amblyopic logMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity function were
      measured at four-weekly intervals until visual acuity stabilized or amblyopia resolved.
      Improvement in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and the resolution of amblyopia were
      compared between groups.
