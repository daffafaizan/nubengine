    
      COMPASS (Computerized Physical Activity Support for Seniors) was a single-blind,
      cluster-randomized noninferiority parallel trial conducted by investigators from Stanford
      University School of Medicine and Northeastern University. Participants were recruited from
      community centers in Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties, CA which had been randomized in
      pairs based on locale to either Virtual or Human advisors. Allocation concealment was
      accomplished by utilizing staff not directly involved in study enrollment, assessment, or
      intervention procedures. Both arms received a similar 12-month behavioral PA
      instruction/support program at their designated community center based on Active Choices-an
      individually-tailored PA intervention with demonstrated effectiveness and translatability
      across diverse adult populations. The primary outcome was change in 12-month weekly walking
      minutes.

      In addition to the major trial and primary investigation described above, an exploratory
      Substudy was conducted separately to begin to evaluate the initial "proof of concept" of a
      food literacy curriculum in 2 separate community centers that were not part of the major
      trial. This first-generation exploratory Substudy is not part of the major trial and
      therefore is not included in this protocol and trial description.
