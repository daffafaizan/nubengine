      duodenal wall with minimal vertical growth. It has become evident over the last few years
      that rather than being a single entity requiring an accumulation of mutations, Duodenal and
      ampullary cancer is in fact a heterogenous disease forming via multiple distinct genetic
      pathways. It is therefore hypothesised that different polyp types have different genetic
      abnormalities, and potentially form via distinct genetic pathways, although this theory has
      not been widely examined.

      This knowledge would be important in furthering our understanding of the development of
      cancer. There is accumulating evidence that genetic abnormalities may be a better predictor
      of cancer behaviour than histological grade. Additionally, guidelines for endoscopy
      surveillance are currently a one size fits all approach that do not reflect the genetic
      heterogeneity of the disease and the knowledge that only 5% of polyps progress to cancer.
      Genetic studies may assess future cancer risk to a person in polyps once removed and plan
      surveillance endoscopy frequency.
