      in circulation after bariatric surgery in rodents and humans and inhibit food intake in mice.

      Studies in rodents have shown that a GLP-1 receptor agonist and long acting neurotensin
      inhibit food intake.

      This study investigates whether the synergistic anorexic effects of neurotensin and GLP-1
      agonism suggested by animal studies can be translated.
