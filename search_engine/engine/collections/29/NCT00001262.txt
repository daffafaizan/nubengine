    
      Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by defects in a
      gene that encodes an evolutionarily conserved copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7A). Several
      issues must be addressed in configuring therapeutic strategies for this disorder: (a)
      affected infants must be identified and treatment commenced very early in life before
      irreparable neurodegeneration occurs, (b) the block in intestinal absorption of copper must
      be bypassed, (c) circulating copper must be delivered to the brain, and (d) copper must be
      available to enzymes within cells that require it as a cofactor.

      Very early, pre-symptomatic therapy with copper injections has been associated with improved
      overall survival and, in some patients - based on their molecular defects, with vastly better
      neurological outcomes in comparison to the usual natural history of this disorder. The
      purpose of this study is to continue to provide early copper treatment to other newborn
      infants diagnosed as having Menkes disease.
