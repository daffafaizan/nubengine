      Coronary angioplasty with stent implantation in conjunction with an optimal antitrombotic
      therapy as abciximab is now considered current standard therapy However, the incidence of
      stent restenosis in the setting of primary angioplasty remains particularly high, reaching a
      rate of 27%. A high restenosis rate causes a high re-hospitalization rate for target vessel
      revascularization and an ensuing increase in cost.In the last years the introduction of
      drug-eluting stents has drastically reduced the incidence of restenosis in patients not
      requiring urgent revascularization. This reduced incidence of restenosis occurs without an
      increase in adverse clinical events over conventional stents and has a very low rate of stent
      subacute thrombosis. Whether this combination of drug-eluting stents and abciximab might
      constitute the new optimal therapy for patients with an acute myocardial infarction is
      unknown. To be able to answer this question, we designed a one year coronary angiographic
      study in which patients with an acute myocardial infarction eligible for treatment with
      primary angioplasty and abciximab were randomized to receive either a rapamicine-eluting
      stent or a conventional bare stent.
