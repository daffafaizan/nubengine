      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Nintedanib ethanesulfonate soft capsule in the
      treatment of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. The number of
      cases is estimated based on the following:

      This exploratory trial is expected to complete 80 case studies (randomly divided into control
      group and test group each with 40 cases), and the expected drop-out rate is not more than
      20%, so the total number of cases is 96. Placebo control group:

      Empty capsules with the same appearance and ingredients as Nintedanib soft capsules: one
      capsule at a time, twice a day, with an interval of about 12 hours each time. Continuous
      medication for 8 weeks.

      Nintedanib Nintedanib cloth sulfonate soft capsule treatment: According to the drug manual
      recommendation, give Nintedanib cloth sulfonate soft capsule 150mg twice daily with an
      interval of about 12 hours each time, with food. Continuous medication for 8 weeks.
