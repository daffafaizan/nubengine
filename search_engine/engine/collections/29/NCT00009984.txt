      I. Compare the safety and tolerability of thalidomide with or without fludarabine in patients
      with fludarabine-refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      II. Compare the incidence of complete and partial remission in patients treated with these
      regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are stratified according to time to
      relapse from last fludarabine treatment (less than 6 months vs more than 6 months). Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive thalidomide as in arm I and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days
      1-5. Treatment with fludarabine repeats every 28 days for 6 courses. Once fludarabine is
      completed, patients continue to receive thalidomide alone as in arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-70 patients (12-35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 1 year.
