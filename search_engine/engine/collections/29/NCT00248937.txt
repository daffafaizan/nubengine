      study. Specifically, we seek to determine the potential differential impact of positive
      affect induction and self affirmation following the qualitative phase.

        1. Positive affect induction: We will tests two types of positive affect induction. 1)
           sending patients a small gift, and 2) reminding patients of positive thoughts about
           themselves.

           Gift: Prior to a telephone call, patients in the positive affect condition will receive
           a small gift.

           Positive thoughts about themselves: Patients will be asked to describe a time when
           someone was helpful to them, and they felt good about it , and were nice to them in
           return.

        2. Self affirmation: consists of a series of items reminding people of their core values.

        3. Control: Control patients will have neither self affirmation nor gifts.

      Follow-up: At two weeks after enrollment all patients will be called to ascertain impact of
      the pilot intervention.
