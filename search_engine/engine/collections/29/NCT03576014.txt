      and morbidity of kidney transplant recipient, and occurrence of PyVAN in kidney transplant
      recipients.

      BD03 is a DNA vaccine that consists of 3 plasmid DNAs encoding CMV antigens, BKV antigens and
      genetic adjuvant. It is expected to express antigen specific T-cell immune response, and
      ultimately prevent activation of both viruses. Plasmid DNA that encode CMV and BKV antigens
      are fused with tPA and Flt-3L to promote antigen specific immune response.

      Patient scheduled to receive kidney transplant from living donor are enrolled in this study.
      Eligible subjects will receive BD03 intramuscularly by electroporator three times on 6 weeks
      and 2 weeks prior to kidney transplant and 2~4 weeks after the transplant.

      This study will be comprised of 3+3 dose escalation scheme and starting dose is 0.6mg and
      dose will be increased to 2mg and 6mg.

      Occurrence of dose limiting toxicities observed until 1 week after second injection (1week
      before kidney transplant) will guide whether to increase a dose.

      After third injection of BD03, follow up visits are done for 18 weeks.
