    
      This study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, study of healthy term formula fed (FF)
      infants. FF infants will be randomized to receive either a study infant formula, formulated
      for healthy term infants or a commercially available infant formula for healthy term infants.
      Infants will consume the formula for a total of 16-weeks; infant growth, tolerance, stool
      consistency and bone strength will be assessed throughout the study.
