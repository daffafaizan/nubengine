      evaluated with the Structured Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV to confirm diagnosis. They will
      also be administered the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scales. Eligible subjects
      will then complete questionnaires related to their symptoms as well as decision-making and
      risk-taking, including: the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory, and the Flinders Decision-making questionnaire. The Montgomery-Asburg Depression
      Severity scale to assess changes in depression symptom severity and the Young Mania Rating
      Scale to assess changes in manic symptom severity, will be conducted at screening, baseline,
      and endpoint. Patients will also be given the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire at baseline
      visit, to assess for a history of childhood trauma. The subjects will then complete the
      computer-generated decision-making tasks. Upon completion, the study physician will initiate
      standard-of-care treatment with a mood stabilizer (either lithium, valproate, or
      lamotrigine). Standard-of-care laboratory testing and psychiatric follow-up will be performed
      during the patient's study participation. After six weeks of treatment with a mood
      stabilizer, patients will again complete the decision-making computerized assessment.
