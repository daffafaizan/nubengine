    
      National, multi-centre, longitudinal, non-comparative interventional study with minimal risks
      and constraints.

      Two French hospitals and their HHP representatives will participate in the study. A
      recruitment of a total of 35 patients is expected.

      Adult type 1 diabetic patients for whom the investigator prescribes the use of a closed-loop
      automatic insulin delivery system (or artificial pancreas) consisting in an insulin pump with
      a continuous glucose monitoring system combined with a dedicated terminal.

      Patients will be monitored for a period of 3 months, starting from the end of the device
      installation procedure.

      HHP Management comprises three distinct phases: pre-installation, installation and follow-up
      during which number, nature and duration of contacts (visits/telephone calls) may vary
      according to patient's needs, investigator's judgement and practice, and judgement of HHP
      staff.

      Pre-installation and installation phases consist of two patients' visits at hospital, and of
      two to five visits from HHP staff to patients' home (only one visit at hospital). Follow-up
      phase held after installation consists of four patients' contacts (phone contact and/or home
      visit) performed by HHP staff.
