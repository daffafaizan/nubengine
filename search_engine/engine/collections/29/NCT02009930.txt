      members, there are many aspects of the military culture that negatively affect the
      cardiovascular health of military members. Smoking/tobacco use, poor eating habits with Meals
      Ready-to-eat (MRE) and ready access to fast food establishments on base, inconsistent
      exercise, the socioeconomic status of enlisted members and the stress of deployment are all
      factors that contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease during military service.
      Currently the calculation of a patient's Framingham risk score is the most commonly used
      method of calculating a patient's cardiovascular risk, and this calculation is based on age,
      smoking history, blood pressure, and lab values and compares it to a general population's
      risk. By the use of a cardiac computerized topography (CT) scan, a Coronary Artery Calcium
      (CAC) score can be calculated and used to estimate the degree of atherosclerosis already
      present in each patient's coronary arteries, and thus establishing their risk of future
      cardiovascular events. CAC scoring is a more patient-specific way of identifying
      cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of atherosclerosis
      in enlisted military members with at least 10 years of service and one or more cardiovascular
      risk factor and to determine if their risk of a cardiovascular event is higher than predicted
      by the Framingham score. If CAC scoring is demonstrated to be more accurate, particularly if
      it is more likely to detect risk, it may be used in the future to better risk stratify this
      population of the military. The CAC results in patients could also be a motivating factor to
      create changes in the military culture to attempt to mitigate these risks and create a
      healthier fighting force.
