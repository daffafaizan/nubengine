      patients with refractory multiple myeloma treated with dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide,
      etoposide, cisplatin, and filgrastim (G-CSF) with or without thalidomide. II. Compare the
      qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      transplantation (yes vs no), prior treatment failure (resistant vs relapsing), prior
      treatment regimens (1-2 vs 3-4), and prior thalidomide (no vs some). Patients are randomized
      to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral dexamethasone daily and
      cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (DCEP) IV continuously on days 1-4. Patients also
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. Treatment continues every 3-4 weeks for 3 courses. Patients achieving stable
      disease or better proceed to maintenance chemotherapy with DCEP administered every 8 weeks
      for 3 additional courses. Arm II: Patients receive chemotherapy with DCEP as in arm I plus
      oral thalidomide daily. Thalidomide continues with maintenance chemotherapy and then
      continues after chemotherapy is completed until disease progression. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 320 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
