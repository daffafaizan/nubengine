    
      This study includes two parts, a baseline study and a three-week dietary study. The baseline
      study will be performed to test how the body absorbs and stores meal fat after a meal. In the
      three-week dietary study, the subjects will consume only the meals provided by the
      investigators for three weeks before the tests, and then participate in a hospital stay. The
      three-week dietary study is to test the chronic effect of a high fat diet on how body absorbs
      and stores the fat.
