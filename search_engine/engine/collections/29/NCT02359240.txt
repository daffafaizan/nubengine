      wasting has become a severe, frequent, and persistent complication among critically ill
      patients. Multiple factors including ubiquitin-proteasome system, proinflammatory cytokines
      and oxidative stress contribute muscle proteolysis.

      It is known that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) possesses a variety of functions like
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and anti-apoptosis effects. In order to investigate the
      mechanisms under the condition, researchers are going to examine the role of HO-1 in muscle
      atrophy during sepsis.
