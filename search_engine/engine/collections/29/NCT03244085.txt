      be safe and well tolerated. The decision to proceed to the next higher dose level will be
      made by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) based upon review of efficacy and safety data
      including AEs, safety laboratory results, vital signs and ECGs. PK data for up to 12 hours
      post-dose will also be reviewed. The review will be conducted after the last subject in a
      cohort completes the Day 28 visit. The planned dose levels can be modified based on the data
      reviewed.
