      stimulation that produces a perceptible sensation via electrodes attached to the skin. It has
      no risk of infections and can potentially be applied by medical personnel with minimal
      training. Clinical trials have demonstrated that TEAS reduces the consumption of
      intra-operative anesthetics and general anesthesia related side-effects.
