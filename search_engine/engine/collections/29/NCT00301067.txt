      2-8 and 16-22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity. Responding patients continue therapy for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive temozolomide and calcitriol at the MTD as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
