      alleviate nausea as compared to a identically packaged normal saline prep pad for the
      Emergency Department patient with nausea. The study length will be 10 minutes long. The
      subjects will take several deep nasal inhalations at the 0, 2, 5 minute marks. Level of
      nausea will be recorded during these times and at 10 minutes. The investigators will also
      assess satisfaction of the intervention. As in previous post operative unit studies,the
      hypothesis is that there will a significant difference in levels of nausea between the
      alcohol pad group versus the normal saline pad group.
