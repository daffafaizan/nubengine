      resistance (evaluated starting from the body index of mass IMC superior to 28 kg.m-Â², of the
      waist measurement 88 cm). Once included in the study, the volunteers will receive for 4 weeks
      butter, dairy products and biscuits enriched in stearic, elaidic or vaccenic acid. The
      volunteers will undergo a measurement of the body composition by biphotonic absorptiometry as
      well as a complete metabolic assessment (blood and urinary samples, clamp to insulin and
      biopsies).
