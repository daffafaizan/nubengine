    
      2000 suspected Shigella cases will be recruited from International Centre for Diarrhoeal
      Disease Research hospital, Dhaka who are presenting with diarrhea at the hospital. A stool
      sample will be collected from the participants after consenting by the study staff. Stool
      microscopy will be performed to see the white blood cells(WBC) and red blood cells (RBC). If
      WBC > 10 HPF (4) with any RBC present, culture will be performed from this stool to identify
      Shigella. Such patients with invasive diarrhea are treated with azithromycin per local
      standard of care. Enrolled participant will be invited for further follow up when culture
      from the stool is Shigella positive. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing of
      Shigella isolates and Molecular testing of Shigella isolates will be performed from Shigella
      cultures. This is an observational study. This study does not provide any treatment to the
      study participants; they will receive treatment as per International Centre for Diarrhoeal
      Disease Research Dhaka hospital guidelines. We will then examine the effect of the
      azithromycin minimal inhibitory concentration on clinical outcome.
