      or another malignant glioma, which has continued to grow after treatment. The purpose of this
      study is to test the effectiveness of a drug called erlotinib in treating the tumor. The
      study drug, erlotinib (also called Tarceva) is a pill (taken by mouth) that has been approved
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the subjects with other cancers (lung
      cancer or pancreatic cancer). It is not approved for glioblastoma or another malignant
      glioma. Erlotinib blocks a messenger that tells cancer cells to grow. That messenger is
      called Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). This type of tumor contains a form of EGFR
      called variant number 3 (abbreviated EGFR variant III or EGFRvIII for short) that is
      different from the normal form.Research suggests that erlotinib is particularly effective at
      stopping EGFRvIII. Research also suggests that high doses of erlotinib taken once per week
      may be more effective than low doses of erlotinib taken once per day.
