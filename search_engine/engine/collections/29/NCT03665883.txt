      minimise the chance of seroma formation. This study aims at study the effect on seroma
      formation (and pre-peritoneal drain output) by 2 techniques in randomised controlled trial.

      all male and female patients presented with first occurrence, unilateral inguinal hernia
      anticipated for laparoscopic TEP are included into study after informed consent. Patients are
      randomized into "diathermy-preferred" (DP) group and "blunt dissection-preferred" (BDP) group
      just before commence of operation after general anaethesia. Surgeons are instructed to use
      monopolar energy as main dissection method for whole operation if possible (DP), where as
      blunt dissection is the preferred choice in BDP group but it is allowed to use monopolar
      energy if needed. Total energy time is measured by a specially designed device attaching to
      the monopolar pedals as accurate as to millisecond (ms). Pre-peritoneal drains are inserted
      for drainage and removed 23 hours after operation. Energy time, drainage output, ultrasonic
      seroma sizes at day 1, day 6, 1 month post-operations, recurrence are compared between 2
      groups.
