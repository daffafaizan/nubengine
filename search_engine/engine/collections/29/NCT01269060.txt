      widely. As a minimal invasive approach, single Incision (Embryonic NOTES) colon surgery has
      been attempted. Several studies reported the feasibility of single incision colon
      surgery.However, there are not sufficient evidences for single incision colon surgery,
      especially in colon cancer.

      The investigators are researching the efficacy and safety of single incision laparoscopic
      sigmoidectomy in sigmoid colon cancer. Harvested numbers of lymph node will be assessed for
      the efficacy and postoperative morbidity and mortality will be assess for the safety.
