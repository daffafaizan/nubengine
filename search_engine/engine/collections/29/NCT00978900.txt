      used by diabetics as sugar substitutes as well as by consumers as aids for dietary control.
      Despite numerous studies which show mainly no influence of artificial sweeteners on glucose
      metabolism and food intake, discrepancies consist about the real effects of artificial
      sweeteners. Studies by Blundell and Hill in 1986 have however shown that the consumption of
      artificial sweeteners resulted in an increase of appetite ratings; the efficiency of AS has
      therefore been questioned. With respect to the world wide increase in the prevalence in
      obesity, it seems important to clarify whether artificial sweeteners can help regulate body
      weight or not. This study will explore the effect of artificial sweeteners on the release of
      the gastrointestinal satiety hormones PYY, GLP-1, GIP and ghrelin.
