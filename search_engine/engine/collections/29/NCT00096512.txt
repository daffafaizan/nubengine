      I. To evaluate the response probability (confirmed, complete and partial responses) in
      patients with metastatic head and neck cancer who are treated with BAY 43-9006.

      II. To evaluate median progression-free survival and median overall survival. III. To
      evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen. IV. To investigate in a
      preliminary manner the effects of the agent on the Ras signal transduction pathway in tissue
      samples obtained prior to and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.3-8
      months.
