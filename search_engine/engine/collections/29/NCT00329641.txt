      I. Determine the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial response) of
      patients with stage IV uveal melanoma treated with sorafenib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine,
      preliminarily, the relationship between clinical outcomes and baseline microvessel density
      (MVD) in tumor specimens, changes in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in
      plasma and urine, changes in MVD, changes in VEGF receptor-2 phosphorylation in tumor, and/or
      changes in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in stimulated lymphocytes and tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV once on day 1 and oral sorafenib twice
      daily on days 2-19. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses.* After 6 courses,
      patients continue to receive oral sorafenib alone twice daily in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      [Note: *If sorafenib is discontinued prior to course 6, patients may continue to receive
      carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to 6 courses; if carboplatin and paclitaxel are
      discontinued prior to course 6, patients may continue to receive sorafenib alone twice daily
      on days 1-21 of each course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ]

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
