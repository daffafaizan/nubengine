      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant S-1 and irinotecan in patients with locally
           advanced gastric cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the histological response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine postoperative morbidity in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the rate of potentially curative surgery in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral S-1 on days 1-21 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy. After surgery,
      patients resume treatment with S-1 alone as before for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
