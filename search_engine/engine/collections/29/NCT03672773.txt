      I. Evaluate the efficacy of talazoparib in combination with temozolomide as measured by
      objective response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of talazoparib plus temozolomide as measured by progression-free
      survival (PFS), overall survival, duration of response, and time to response.

      II. To evaluate the safety, tolerability of talazoparib plus temozolomide. III. To evaluate
      the pharmacokinetics of talazoparib when given in combination with temozolomide.

      IV. To evaluate patient reported outcomes per the Patient Reported Outcomes version of the
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify potential biomarkers associated with response to study drug treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5 and talazoparib PO once daily (QD)
      on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then up to 1
      year.
