      noninvasive endoscopic examination of the entire small bowel without the need for sedation.
      Its limited battery life of 8+/-1 hours means it is paramount that the Capsule reaches the
      caecum, visualizing the whole of the small intestine, and also that the mucosal views
      obtained are clear, facilitating detection of pathologic lesions.

      So far no optimal protocol for bowel preparation prior to Capsule endoscopy has been
      established. Recently, several studies have shown that bowel preparation with polyethylene
      glycol significantly reduces both gastric and small bowel transit times. Similarly,
      visualization of the small intestine and therefore 'diagnostic yield' have both been shown to
      be improved by both sodium phosphate and polyethylene glycol preparation. A more recent study
      by Selby et al also demonstrates that the prokinetic agent metoclopramide (which is known to
      promote emptying of the stomach) reduced both stomach and small bowel transit time,
      increasing completion rates from 76% to 97%).

      The proposal is to perform a randomised, controlled study using Citramag and Senna bowel
      preparation or Metoclopramide to determine whether test completion rates are improved and
      whether the images of the bowel are of better quality.

      The hypothesis is that the improved wall visibility and increased completion rates will
      improve the diagnostic yield of Capsule endoscopy and therefore improve patient care.
