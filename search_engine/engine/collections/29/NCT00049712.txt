        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of monoclonal antibody anti-alpha V beta 3
           integrin (MEDI 522) in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Demonstrate significant binding of this drug to its molecular target in vivo in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the effects of this drug on angiogenesis in these patients.

        -  Determine antitumor activity of this drug by measuring tumor size and glucose uptake in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine a recommended phase II dose of this drug based on either the MTD or the
           optimal biologic response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody anti-alpha V beta 3 integrin (Medi 522) IV over 30
      minutes weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of Medi 522 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
