      health-related biometrics (e.g., glucose time-in-range, waist-hip ratio) and how providing
      medically tailored meals promotes engagement in diabetes education and drives
      information-seeking behavior. Secondary purposes are to characterize the relationship between
      information-seeking behaviors and glycemic control; to characterize the relationship between
      psychometric survey results and program engagement, biometrics, and information-seeking
      behaviors; and to understand how meal provision and materials influence program satisfaction
      and adherence to healthy diabetes-related behaviors.
