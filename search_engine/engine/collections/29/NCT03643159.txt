      difference between all-cause hospitalizations in participants using Abilify MyCite (for
      Months 1-3, then prohibited for Months 4-6) versus virtual matched controls from baseline to
      Day 180. Virtual matched controls were to receive treatment as usual (that is, any product
      other than Abilify MyCite, which was oral aripiprazole or any other product). Eligible
      participants entered a screening period of up to 13 days. For participants enrolling into the
      study, those not on aripiprazole at screening used the screening period for conversion to
      aripiprazole from other antipsychotics. Virtual matched controls were not to be enrolled into
      the study, but identified from health insurance claims data and matched to the enrolled
      Abilify MyCite participants at the end of the study for analysis.

      After the visit at Day 180, a second, optional interventional period (up to 6 months of
      Abilify MyCite) could have been initiated per the joint decision of the participants with
      their study physician; participants in this second, optional interventional period were to
      have a visit at Day 360. During this second, optional interventional period, participants may
      have started and stopped Abilify MyCite as clinically indicated.

      A parallel exploratory study that would utilize a different set of physicians and
      participants from the main study was planned; however, that study was never initiated.
