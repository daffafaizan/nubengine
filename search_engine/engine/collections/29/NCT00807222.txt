      sleep onset and maintenance problems, in children with ADHD. This analysis evaluated the
      effect of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) on sleep in children with ADHD.

      This single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial enrolled children
      aged 6-12 years with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD. The study included a screening period,
      1-week washout, 3-week open-label LDX dose optimization phase, and a 4-week double-blind
      treatment phase in which subjects were randomized to placebo or active LDX treatment at 30,
      50, or 70 mg/d. Polysomnograph and actigraph measures as well as assessments of subjective
      sleep parameters were performed in all subjects prior to treatment and reassessed after
      treatment with either LDX or placebo.
