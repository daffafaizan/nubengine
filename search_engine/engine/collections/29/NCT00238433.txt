        -  Determine the therapeutic efficacy of a myeloablative preparative regimen comprising
           busulfan, melphalan, and thiotepa followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell
           (PBSC) transplantation in patients with Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this preparative regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Myeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -8
           to -6, melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes on days -5 and -4, and thiotepa IV over 2 hours
           on days -3 and -2.

        -  Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation: Patients undergo PBSC transplantation
           on day 0 followed by filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 30 minutes beginning on day 5 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Intrathecal chemotherapy: Patients with a history of treated Central Nervous System
           (CNS) disease or at high-risk for CNS relapse receive methotrexate and cytarabine
           intrathecally (IT) for 2 doses each within 10 days prior to transplantation and 4-6
           doses each beginning on day 32 post-transplantation.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients with residual bulk disease at 80-100 days
           post-transplantation that is > 2.5 cm by CT scan may undergo local radiotherapy to
           residual scar/disease provided it can be encompassed in a single radiation port and the
           volume of lung to be irradiated is â‰¤ 20%.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly for 1 month, monthly for 6
      months, every 3 months for 6 months, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
