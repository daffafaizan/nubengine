      practitioner students of the Graduate School of Nursing. After being presented an overview of
      the study and informed consent document, those electing to participate will draw a sealed
      envelope indicating whether they are assigned to group A (intervention group) or group B
      (control group). The participant will proceed to the associated room, be provided a brief
      clinical case (appropriate to their training), an iPad device with pre-loaded EBN-Search
      engine, and a questionnaire. The EBN-Search engine for the intervention group will include 9
      research abstracts associated to the case. The EBN-Search for the control group will include
      both the research abstracts and full-text versions of the manuscripts. The participants will
      be provided 20 minutes to complete the questionnaire using the information available to them.
      The questionnaire will require the participant to indicate treatment plan, respond to
      questions regarding the usefulness of research abstracts, questions regarding the usefulness
      of full-text (control group only) and recommendations on improving EBN-Search.
