    
      This is a monocentric, comparative, randomized, open-label trial comparing two methods of
      "seated" positioning of the ICU patient, chair versus natural position in bed, on arterial
      blood oxygenation

        1. Sitting in a Chair position For patients randomized in the chair group, we will perform
           the transfer to the chair immediately after the morning arterial blood gas. The chair
           position will be maintained for 3 hours, if the patient shows no clinical signs of
           discomfort or intolerance.

        2. Semi-recumbent position in bed The patient will benefit from conventional positioning
           techniques in the ICU bed. With the help of the medical monitoring software present in
           the wards, we will note the different nursing care given to the patient during the 3
           hours following the morning arterial gasometry.
