      I. To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates as well as tumor bed recurrence
      rates. Patients will be followed for a period of five years following completion of radiation
      to determine these rates.

      II. To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from breast conserving surgery and breast
      radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there are patient factors which limit a patient's suitability to receive
      breast conserving therapy in the setting of multi-centric disease.

      II. To determine patient satisfaction of breast conserving therapy as it pertains to their
      overall treatment experience as measured by a questionnaire.

      III. To evaluate wound healing and overall complication rate after radiation as a component
      of breast conserving therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery consisting of partial mastectomies followed by
      external beam breast radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, then every 3 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 5 years.
