      comparison to vehicle ointment and 0.9% saline (negative irritant control) under occlusive
      patch conditions, at 3 randomly assigned, adjacent skin sites, 3 times weekly for 3 weeks (9
      applications) during the Induction Phase, and one time during the Challenge Phase (10 times
      in total) for determining sensitization potential.
