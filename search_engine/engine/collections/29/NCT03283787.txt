    
      A three arm, parallel-design, randomized study comparing 2 experimental arms to a single
      control arm. The primary comparison will be Group 1 (MicroMatrix® and ACell Cytal™ Wound
      Matrix 2-Layer vs. Group 3 (NPWT) to determine if Group 1 is superior to Group 3. NPWT is the
      standard of care (SOC) for patients with Stage 3 or 4 pressure ulcers and is the active
      control arm for the study.

      A secondary comparison will be conducted comparing Group 2 (MicroMatrix® and ACell Cytal™
      Wound Matrix 2-Layer plus NPWT) vs. Group 3 (NPWT) to determine if Group 2 is superior to
      Group 3.
