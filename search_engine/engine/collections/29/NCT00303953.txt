      I. Evaluate response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with PXD101.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. II. Estimate the 6-month
      progression-free survival rate in patients treated with this drug.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the major histocompatability complex of class II proteins (HLA-DR, -DP, -DQ),
      TUNEL, and CD8 infiltration status, by immunochemistry on paired pre- and post-treatment
      tumor samples, in the first 20 patients enrolled.

      II. Measure CIITA and HLA-DR mRNA expression using quantitative reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and determine, preliminarily, the associations of
      these markers with progression-free survival.

      III. Evaluate paired pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients
      for histone acetylation status and determine correlation with findings from duplicate
      experiments on pre- and post-needle core biopsies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive PXD101 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Needle core biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from the first 20
      patients pre- and post-treatment for biomarker correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.
