    
      This pilot study aims at comparing the bioavailability of three different formulations of a
      combination of omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
      in a standardized proportion of 460:200. The three formulations are ethyl ester (EE),
      triglyceride (TG) and monoglyceride (MAG) versions of these fatty acids. The formulations are
      prepared in a way to be similar in proportion of EPA/DHA, in dose and in appearance. Thirty
      six (36) subjects will be divided in three groups of twelve subjects each, equally divided in
      two study sites. The study will be randomized and double blinded. Each group will be taking
      one of the three different formulations of EPA+DHA at a daily dose of 1.5g for a period of 12
      weeks. Bioavailability will be measured through omega-3 index (total content of EPA + DHA in
      red blood cell membranes) at baseline and every four weeks during treatment. After
      recruitment, subjects will be seen in clinic every four weeks for a total of four (4) study
      visits during which a blood sample will be taken for analysis of the omega-3 index, the
      investigational product will be returned and dispensed and finally, adverse events will be
      noted and followed. Treatment will be self-administered by subjects at home. They will be
      asked to keep a journal of adverse events, concomitant medication and to note every missed
      dose as well as significant changes in life habits (smoking, alcohol, sports, food diet and
      natural health products intake).
