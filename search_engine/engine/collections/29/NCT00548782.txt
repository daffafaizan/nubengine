      ("hunter-gatherer's diet") on Type 2 diabetic patients. The diet essentially consists of
      fruits, vegetables, nuts, lean meats, excludes dairy products and grains.Subjects will be
      randomized into taking either ADA (American Diabetic Association) recommended diet or
      Paleolithic diet for 21 days. The research kitchen will provide all food items and total
      calories in both groups will be adjusted to maintain baseline weight. Blood and urine test
      will be done in the first 3 days, last 3 days and 1 month after the study period to study and
      compare the effects of the two diets on subjects glucose control, lipid profile and other
      parameters of cardiovascular physiology.

      We hypothesize that a palaeolithic diet in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitis, will
      result in improvement in above parameters and lead to improvement in glucose control with
      less need for diabetes medicines (either lower doses or fewer medications) to a greater
      extent than in subjects fed with ADA diet, without any change in weight. We also expect a
      beneficial effect on blood vessel function, lipid profiles and blood pressure.
