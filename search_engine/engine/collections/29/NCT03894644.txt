      base and skill set. It presents the opportunity to experience a variety of clinical
      scenarios, both common and uncommon, in a safe environment allowing repeated skills training
      and facilitating the transfer of classroom-knowledge to real situations.Research demonstrates
      that simulation can improve student engagement and learning and is being increasingly used as
      an educational strategy for nursing students. This prospective randomized controlled study
      that was undertaken with the following goals:

        1. to investigate the effectiveness of simulation-based training in a large sample of
           perioperative nurses, measured as nurses' learning progress in the simulation
           environment;

        2. to determine whether the learning acquired through this training is transferable to
           recognizing real surgical instruments; and

        3. to evaluate whether simulation-based learning is retained at least one week.
