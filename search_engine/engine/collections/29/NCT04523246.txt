      training of the innate immune system occurs following immunization (2 doses ,3 months apart)
      with the Shingrix vaccine as compared to placebo (normal saline) in older adults residing in
      nursing homes. Two hundred nursing home residents, both men and women, aged >65 years, who
      have not acquired COVID-19 (verified through a screening questionnaire and by both viral
      antigen and antibody testing at the screen and least one week before the first injection)
      will get two intramuscular injections containing either the Shingrix vaccine, and the other
      half, two injections containing a normal saline (placebo comparison) approximately three
      months apart. Blood samples are collected before the baseline injection (day zero), 1 day
      after the second injection (91 days post) and 1 month following the second injection (120
      days). Weekly symptom checks and monthly antibody testing around day 180- will identify
      residents with COVID-19 and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.

      The primary outcome is the difference in immune cell capacity to produce type I interferon,
      interferon associated molecules, and proinflammatory mediators after receiving a 2 injection
      series of the Shingrix vaccine versus normal saline. Secondary outcomes include differences
      in hospitalization, pulmonary infections, and positive COVID-19 cases (via antibody testing
      on days 90, 120, and 180) in the Shingrix and normal saline groups. We anticipate that
      residents receiving the Shingrix vaccine will demonstrate signs of "trained" immunity
      compared to a control group receiving saline injections.
