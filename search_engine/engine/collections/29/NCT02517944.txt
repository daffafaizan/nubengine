    
      To demonstrate the higher prevalence of silent myocardial infarction in a population of
      asymptomatic patients with familial hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk in
      comparison to control patients, the protocol is the following:

        -  to enroll 75 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)

        -  to enroll 35 subjects without FH (control group)

        -  for each subject, to collect data from his medical file (blood test results) and to
           perform a cardiac and aortic MRI in order to evaluate the micro-infarction proportion.

      The study will be performed according to GCPs and with respect with french laws.
