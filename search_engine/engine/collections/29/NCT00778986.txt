      outcomes from this chronic illness, including frequent hospitalization. HF patients require
      close monitoring to detect worsening health and to optimize their treatment. However, many
      patients visit their HF clinicians only once every few months, and perform minimal or no
      self-monitoring.

      Remote patient monitoring is a potential tool to help clinicians and the patients better
      manage HF. A remote patient monitoring system (home monitoring of vital signs and symptoms)
      that has been developed with extensive clinician and patient input and testing, will be
      studied to determine its effects on HF management. Half of one hundred patients from the
      University Health Network Heart Failure Clinic will be randomly placed into the remote
      monitoring (RM) group and the other half will be in the control group. Patients in the RM
      group will monitor their weight, blood pressure, ECG, and symptoms at home for 6 months. This
      information will be automatically sent from the medical devices wirelessly through Bluetooth
      to a mobile phone, which will send the information to the data servers. Both clinicians and
      patients will have access to the data. Patients will get automated reminder telephone calls
      if they do not take the number of measurements prescribed by their doctors.
