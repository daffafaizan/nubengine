      Veterans. The most common and persistent sequelae after TBI are cognitive-behavioral deficits
      in 'executive control' and 'attention' functions. Such abnormalities may directly contribute
      to poor long-term outcomes as well as impede rehabilitation of dysfunction in other cognitive
      and motor domains. Effective treatments would potentially make a major impact in improving
      functional outcomes, but consistently effective treatments are not available. The overall
      goal of this research is to improve the investigators' understanding of plasticity in brain
      function after TBI and to develop improved cognitive neurorehabilitation treatments. The
      intervention involves individual and group-based training in cognitive skills.
