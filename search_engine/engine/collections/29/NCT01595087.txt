    
      Males, diagnosed with CRPC, who fulfil the inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion
      criteria, will be asked to participate in the study. The subject will be informed orally and
      in writing about the study procedures and give written informed consent, prior to study
      start. At the screening visit the following examinations are performed: Physical examination,
      medical history and concomitant medication. Heart rate, blood pressure, weight, body
      temperature and respiratory rate are measured. Blood samples are drawn and urine sample is
      collected. ECG is performed. At the next visit, baseline, the subject is examined physically
      and heart rate, blood pressure, weight, body temperature and respiratory rate are measured,
      ECG is performed, blood samples drawn and urine sample collected. FACT-P questionnaire is
      filled out by the subject. Adverse events and concomitant medication is documented and the
      first dose of the investigational product is given. The subject will be consecutively
      assigned to the dose cohorts, starting with the lowest dose cohort, cohort one out of seven
      cohorts.

      Then the subject is surveyed during 24 hours at the hospital. Prior to discharge from the
      hospital the same examinations are done as described above.

      The duration of the study for the individual subject will be approximately 25 weeks from
      screening to the follow-up visit 3 weeks after the last dose. Each subject will receive at
      least 4 doses and maximum 7 doses of investigational product.

      A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be designated and will be responsible to
      monitor/review all study related safety data. After review of safety data the DMC will
      provide recommendation as to whether the dose escalation can proceed as planned according to
      the protocol.
