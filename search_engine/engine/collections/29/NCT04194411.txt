           (Korean version of Mini-Mental State Exam) is conducted to check the subjects' baseline
           cognitive function.

           From the postoperative day 0 to 7, CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the
           Intensive Care Unit) for mechanically ventilated patients, or 3D-CAM (3-minute
           diagnostic assessment for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method) for extubated
           patients is performed twice a day to assess whether delirium occurs. Records of the
           nurses are also checked.

        2. Measurement of the serum levels of Nfl and Tau Serum concentrations of Nfl and Tau are
           measured after anesthetic induction, and at postoperative 6 hours
