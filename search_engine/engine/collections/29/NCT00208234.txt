      and proven efficacious in the treatment of asthma and other allergic disorders. In moderate
      to severe allergic asthmatic patients, Xolair reduced asthma exacerbations and improved
      symptoms. However, there is limited data on the effects of Xolair on airway hyperreactivity,
      an important component of asthma.
