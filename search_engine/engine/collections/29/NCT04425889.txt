      days or more had passed from their first entrance to contaminated areas were included. They
      were classified as asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic. A COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test was used
      for antibody detection, and selected participants were subject to real time polymerase chain
      reaction (qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2.
