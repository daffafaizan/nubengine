      sessions. Reboxetine (8 mg) or placebo will be administered the night before the experimental
      session and 1 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy
      volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses and plasma samples for pharmacokinetics
      will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments.

      We hypothesize that the highly selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor reboxetine will
      attenuate subjective and especially heart rate and blood pressure responses to MDMA. Such a
      result would indicate that norepinephrine is critically involved in the pharmacology of MDMA
      and may provide helpful in the use and development of treatments for Ecstasy intoxications.
