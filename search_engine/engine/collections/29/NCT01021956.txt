    
      The primary objective of this Phase IIa clinical study is to evaluate the safety of treatment
      with Stakel®-mediated VTP in subjects with neovascular AMD. The secondary objective of this
      Phase IIa clinical study is to explore the effect of treatment with Stakel®-mediated VTP in
      subjects with neovascular AMD. The exploratory objective is to assess whether it is possible
      to delay or reduce the requirement for anti Vascular Endothelium Growth Factor (anti VEGF)
      intravitreal therapy in the first 12 weeks after VTP.

      All subjects will have a 52 weeks safety follow up telephone call. (Not for AEs collection).
