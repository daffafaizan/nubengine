      but also dramatic changes in her body. The Internet's convenience and anonymity provide great
      possibilities for pregnant women to create a social network for sharing personal stories,
      seeking information and asking questions, and expressing own emotions and concerns.

      Although health-related online communities are emerging rapidly around the globe, little is
      known about the impact of a virtual peer community on pregnant women's well-being.

      The study enrolled 138 pregnant women, who were assigned to either the experimental or
      control groups. After obtaining informed consent from participants, we asked them to fill out
      the baseline questionnaires (Time 1). The first and second follow-ups (Times 2 and 3) were
      conducted at 22-24 and 36-38 weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Participants in the
      experimental group received ordinary prenatal care in addition to virtual community
      participation, and those in the control group received only ordinary prenatal care.
