    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the in vivo expansion of natural killer (NK) cells 14 days after treatment with
           allogeneic NK cell-enriched peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with
           relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate, in terms of complete remission, in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Correlate complete remission rate with NK cell expansion, interleukin-15 levels, and
           donor/recipient killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) ligand matching status in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive fludarabine IV on days -6 to -2 and cyclophosphamide
           IV on day -5 or on days -5 and -4.

        -  Allogeneic natural killer (NK) cell-enriched peripheral blood stem cell transplantation:
           Patients receive allogeneic NK cell-enriched peripheral blood stem cells IV over 15-60
           minutes on day 0. Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously beginning on day 0
           and continuing 3 times a week for up to 2 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 months.
