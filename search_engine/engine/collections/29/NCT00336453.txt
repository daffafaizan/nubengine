      hospitalizations are very high in children less than 24 months of age and children age 24-59
      months have a high rate of medical care utilization due to influenza. Recently, it has been
      noted that there are deaths attributable to influenza even in previously healthy children.
      Recent CDC recommendations reflect this growing awareness of the impact of influenza in
      children and state that virtually all children less than 18 years of age should receive
      annual influenza vaccination.

      Currently available licensed trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) are prepared from viruses
      that are grown in embryonated hens' eggs. Alternative substrates for vaccine production are
      desirable in order to reduce the vulnerability of and to expand influenza vaccine supply.
      Recombinant DNA techniques allow for expression of the influenza hemagglutinin (rHA) by
      baculovirus vectors in insect cell cultures. Advantages of this technique include speed of
      production, absence of egg protein, and a highly purified product.
