      1, participants will be enrolled using a rolling 6 dose escalation scheme. The starting dose
      of LOXO-292 is equivalent to the adult recommended phase 2 dose of 160 milligrams (mg) twice
      a day (BID). Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is
      identified, participants will be enrolled to one of four phase 2 dose expansion cohorts
      depending on tumor histology and tumor genotype. Cycle length will be 28 days.
