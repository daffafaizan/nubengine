    
      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of trametinib monotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC
      whose tumors non-synonymous NF1 mutations and are KRAS wildtype. Eligible patients must have
      documented disease progression either during or after treatment with most recent therapy and
      may not have received prior treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Patients with activating
      alterations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS-1 must also have received appropriate TKI treatment.
      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive trametinib monotherapy and followed for
      the primary endpoint of objective response rate and additional secondary endpoints. A total
      of 27 patients will be enrolled into the study, with the goals of obtaining 24 evaluable
      patients. Patients may continue treatment until disease progression or up to 24 months from
      the time of study entry or until the study is closed. All patients will be followed for 12
      months.
