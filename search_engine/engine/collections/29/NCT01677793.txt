      without current and past history of any psychiatric disorder and autistic symptoms. All the
      participants will receive psychiatric interviews (K-SADS-E/SADS) and complete the Chinese AQ
      or SRS to screen for any psychiatric disorder or autistic symptoms. They will receive the
      WAIS-III or WISC-III (depending on their age) first to ensure their full-scale IQ greater
      than 80, followed by the CPT and CANTAB for a wide range assessments of attention, executive
      functions, and memory. The MRI assessments (T1 and T2 imaging, DSI, and resting-state fMRI)
      will be subsequently arranged within 2 weeks after psychiatric/neuropsychological
      assessments.

      The investigators anticipate that this study (1) will establish the first template of brain
      anatomy and structural connectivity of children and adolescents in our population, (2) will
      be the first report on the developmental trajectory of brain of Chinese in both brain gross
      anatomy and tractography; (3) will provide evidence about how these development in brain
      structures associated with maturation in cognitive functions.
