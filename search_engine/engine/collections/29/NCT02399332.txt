      complex care plan for diabetic patients in conjunction with the patient's clinical team
      (physician and chronic disease management nurse) improve outcomes including glycemic control,
      health care utilization and medication adherence.

      Hypothesis: Collaborative complex care planning for diabetic patients with the primary care
      physician, chronic disease management nurse and community pharmacist leads to improvement in
      patient health outcomes, decreases hospital visits and visits to family physician and
      emergency room and improves medication adherence.

      Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to serve as a pilot in exploring if collaborative
      care provided by physicians, chronic disease nurse and community pharmacists in formulating
      and following complex care plans leads to better clinical outcomes when compared to care
      plans that are formulated and followed in isolation by the physician and chronic disease
      nurse. This study would be the basis for a future in depth project comparing outcomes of care
      plans completed in isolation by the pharmacists or physicians with those created in a
      collaborative environment. Our long-term objectives are improvement in patient outcomes,
      reduction in health care expenditure as well as preventing duplication and potential
      discordance of comprehensive care plans.

      Methodology

      Patients and study design: This is a single centre prospective case control pilot study.

      A cohort of 25 eligible diabetic patients at the South Health Campus Family Medicine Teaching
      Clinic (an outpatient academic family medicine clinic in Calgary, Alberta) will be studied
      and compared against a group of 25 control diabetic patients. The intervention would be
      involvement of patient's community pharmacist with their clinical team in formulating the
      complex care plan and following up with the patient on a monthly basis. The control is a set
      of patients who have complex care plans completed by their clinical team with no coordination
      with the pharmacist.
