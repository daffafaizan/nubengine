      functioning. This study will enroll mothers with anxiety disorders and their children to
      determine whether a brief family-based intervention will reduce childhood anxiety better than
      standard care.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the family-based prevention program or to
      evaluation only for 8 weeks. Participants in the prevention program will have weekly sessions
      with a therapist and will learn skills to help reduce anxiety. Self- and parent-reports,
      diagnostic interviews, a computerized memory task, and a videotaped parent-child interaction
      task will be used to assess participants. Assessments will be conducted at study start and
      one week after intervention completion (Week 9). Follow-up visits will be conducted at 6 and
      12 months after intervention completion.
