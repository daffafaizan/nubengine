      prevent headaches. Therapeutic ultrasound studies have generally been used in combination
      with other physical therapies.

      Therapeutic ultrasound is known to act in two different ways, thermal and non-thermal. With
      thermal effect, it is possible to reduce pain and joint joints and increase local blood flow,
      while stimulating tissue regeneration, soft tissue repair, blood flow regulation in chronic
      ischemic tissues and protein synthesis with nonthermal effect. In addition, its effect on
      inflammation accelerated repair by affecting cell activities, altering platelet membrane
      permeability, leading to the release of serotonin and accelerating wound healing.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether therapeutic ultrasound is superior to placebo
      ultrasound in the treatment of migraine.
