      public health. In the last decades, the trend of delaying marriage and childbearing has
      further exacerbated the burden of infertility. From February 2010 to November 2011, a
      large-scale population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in northern and eastern
      China. It was reported that the overall prevalence of infertility was 15.5% among women 'at
      risk' of pregnancy, and 25.0% among women attempting to become pregnant in China. The
      prevalence of infertility was surprisingly high and aroused our great attention. To further
      explore the fecundability and associated risk factors in current China, this community based
      prospective cohort study was established. Recruitment will be performed at cites of National
      Free Pre-conception Check-up Projects (NFPCP). Besides of the information of sociodemographic
      characteristics and childbearing history of couples, their results of check-ups will also be
      obtained. By regular follow-ups, valid data of time to pregnancy will be collected. A
      prospective cohort would provide an opportunity to reveal the incidence of infertility, and
      explore the underlying risk factors of infertility, as well as the demand of assisted
      reproductive technology.
