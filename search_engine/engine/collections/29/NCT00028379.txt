      chronic stroke. Motor training results in use-dependent plasticity, thought to underlie
      recovery of motor function after cortical lesions. We recently demonstrated that stimulation
      of peripheral nerves (SPN) administered in association with motor training enhances
      use-dependent plasticity in healthy volunteers. The purpose of this protocol is to
      investigate if SPN administered in association with motor training enhances use-dependent
      plasticity in patients with chronic stroke. If so, it may become an important tool to enhance
      the beneficial effects of rehabilitative treatment in this patient group.
