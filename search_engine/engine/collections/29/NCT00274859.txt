      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic cancer not amenable to
           anthracycline or taxane therapy treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical benefit and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on day 1 and oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours on day 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
