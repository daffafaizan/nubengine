      homogenous group of patients.

      In a tertiary academic centre, patients undergoing groin or axillary RLND or CLND after
      positive SLNB for melanoma, skin cancer, sarcoma or breast cancer were enrolled in a
      randomized controlled trial for surgical dissection technique. The study was reviewed and
      accepted by the local ethical committee. Patients were older than 18 years and gave an
      informed consent. All patients with a past medical history of contralateral lymph node
      dissection or other cause of lymphedema (previous trauma, deep venous thrombosis,
      radiotherapy, etc.) were excluded. Patients undergoing both iliac and inguinal lymph node
      dissections were excluded as well. No patients had distant or in transit metastasis. Patients
      were randomly assigned using sealed numbered envelopes to one of two arms of the study in a
      1: 1 ratio. In the first group the dissection was conducted with USS (Harmonic Focus Â®,
      Ethicon Endo-Surgery (Europe) GmbH) exclusively. In the control group the lymphadenectomy was
      performed using ligation and monopolar electrocautery. All patients were operated by a
      dedicated team headed by a single surgeon.
