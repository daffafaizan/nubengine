      patients with schizophrenia. Folic acid is a promising adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia
      that may also provide benefits for patients with other mental disorders. Furthermore the
      effects of folic acid may be affected by genotype.

      The trial will investigate the effects of adding mirtazapine and the effects of adding folic
      acid to treatments for schizophrenia. At randomisation, patients will be separately
      randomised to mirtazapine or placebo and to folic acid or placebo.

      Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2x2 factorial trial with 12-week follow-up.
