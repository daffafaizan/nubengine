    
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is a common global infectious disease, which is an
      important cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.

      At present, due to the non-standard Helicobacter pylori eradication program in clinical work,
      poor patient compliance and other reasons, the phenomenon of HP eradication treatment failure
      is more and more common. However, there is still no conclusion on the most appropriate time
      for remedial treatment in patients with Hp eradication failure.
