      muscle performance in DSP and further experiments are underway to find more exercises for the
      recovery of motor function impairment. In fact the rehabilitation treatment, that aims at
      reducing motor disability, preserving gait functions and preventing falling risks, is an
      interesting therapeutic approach. Literature recommends balance re-training exercises, muscle
      strengthening, selective stretching and retraining of motor activity.

      New technologies produced in the recent decades different devices used in strengthening
      exercises (electromechanical dynamometers), balance recovery (balance platforms) and gait
      (analyzing treadmills) have visual feedbacks through which the patients may independently
      monitor accuracy and intensity of their exercises, being therefore strongly motivated and
      resulting in a high training intensity. These technologies are often used in rehabilitation
      of different patients, but are rarely employed for DSP.

      The purpose of this case control study was to examine the effectiveness of the application of
      analysing treadmill, muscle strengthening and balance training compared to a control
      intervention in patients with diabetic neuropathy.
