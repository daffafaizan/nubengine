      conservative, however postoperative complications are still observed. At early postoperative
      period, the most common operative wound complications are seroma, infection and necrosis.
      Shoulder dysfunctions are a frequent complication and difficult women to return to their
      activities. There is no consensus regarding the onset and type of exercise in postoperative
      period. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the active no-limited mobilization
      with limited mobilization in the immediate post operatory at the incidence of wound
      complications in women submitted to surgery for the treatment of breast cancer.

      It's a randomized clinical trial that will include women aged 18 years or older, submitted a
      curative surgery for breast cancer at Hospital do Câncer III (HCIII-INCA) located in Rio de
      Janeiro. All patients admitted for surgical treatment at the institution and during the study
      period will be evaluated for eligibility criteria. Those considered eligible for the study
      will be clarified regarding the objectives, treatment groups, adverse effects and
      non-compulsory participation of the study. Upon acceptance to participate, they will be
      allocated to the respective intervention groups. Group 1 - upper limbs no-limited movement
      with amplitude above 90º for flexion and abduction of shoulder; Group 2 - upper limbs limited
      movement at maximum 90º amplitude flexion and abduction of shoulder, until withdrawal
      surgical points.
