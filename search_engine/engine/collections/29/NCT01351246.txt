      face-to-face services, as there is lowered stigma and significantly reduced or eliminated
      cost, transport, and timing difficulties. Families can complete self-directed programs at
      home, in their own time and at their own pace. Furthermore self-administered programs are
      often very cost-effective and their use can ease the financial burden of mental health of the
      community. These parenting programs can be particularly effective by reaching the populace.
      Moreover in primary care settings where financial resources, time and expertise might be
      lacking to provide behavioral interventions, self-directed programs might be a promising tool
      for disseminating effective parenting interventions more widely.

      Bibliotherapy is one form of self-directed therapy. In bibliotherapy a selected book is
      thought to meet the specific need of the person to be treated and reading is used as the
      therapeutic technique. In opposition to pure self-help programs, bibliotherapy in terms of
      guided self-help provides patients (or parents) with written instructions as well as
      therapeutic contacts at regular intervals. During these contacts, problems and questions can
      be discussed to give further support. Self-help interventions have already proven to be
      effective for adults with anxiety or affective disorders as well as for depressive
      adolescents. However there has only been little research concerning the reduction of
      children's behaviour problems through parental self-help programs under minimal contact
      conditions.
