      standard and convalescent plasma in a volume of 200ml (150-300ml); C- standard and
      convalescent plasma in a volume of 400ml (300-600ml). The Bayesian multi-arm and multi-stage
      model will be used, which will allow an interim analysis after the inclusion of 30 patients,
      with repeated interim analyses for every 30 additional patients. With this, we expect to
      define not only the efficacy of convalescent plasma, but also the volume of plasma needed if
      efficacy is proven. The study will be interrupted if the efficacy of the convalescent plasma
      group is proven, so that all severely ill patients as defined in the study can receive the
      convalescent plasma treatment. The same will occur if there is no difference in primary
      outcome with the use of convalescent plasma or serious adverse effects.
