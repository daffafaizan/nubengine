      with ages ranging from ten to 35 years with main age of 22.68 will be divided into four
      groups each included ten patients. One group will be treated with scar revision only (control
      group or group I), 2nd group will be injected with PRP after scar revision, 3rd group will be
      injected with ADSCs after scar revision and the 4th group will be injected with a combination
      of PRP and ADSCs after scar revision. All groups were assisted pre-operative and six months
      post-operative. Complications, Scar width, Vancouver scar scale (VSS), surgeon assessment
      scar scale and patient assessment scar scale will be considered the outcome measurements.
