    
      An exploratory "Fit & Function" study of Continuous Real Time (CRT) ShuntCheck, a
      non-invasive method for monitoring changes in CSF shunt flow in hydrocephalus patients. This
      study will gather information to refine the design of the CRT ShuntCheck sensor. Our Aim I
      product work will yield a clinic-ready prototype which adheres well to human skin, conforms
      to the curve surface of the clavicle and provides a safe level of skin cooling over an
      extended period of time. Many of the clinical uses of CRT will involve patient movement -
      standing up to investigate suspected overdrainage, or the simple fidgeting of children
      undergoing monitoring. The Aim II Fit and Function testing will most importantly identify
      movement-related product performance issues. If we can identify the causes of "signal noise",
      we can modify our sensor design to make it less susceptible to "motion artifacts".

      Additionally testing will identify age/size specific issues - is the sensor small enough for
      use on younger children, does the looser skin of older adults generate move motion artifacts
      in the signal.

      These studies will include 10 pediatric and 10 adult asymptomatic patients who are willing to
      undergo CRT ShuntCheck testing over a one hour period. Test results will not be used to guide
      patient care and testing will not interfere with or delay any other patient testing or care.
