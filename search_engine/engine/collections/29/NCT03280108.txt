      study. Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 10 study visits over a
      7-month period. Of these 10 visits, 1 is preoperative, 2 are operative, and the remaining 7
      are postoperative visits. Primary endpoint data will be collected at the Month 6 (Day
      120-180) post second eye implantation visit.
