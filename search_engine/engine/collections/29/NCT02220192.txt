      procedure (LEEP). Standard LEEP involves treating the entire cervix using FDA-approved
      equipment. Focal LEEP utilizes the same surgery and the same equipment but only treats the
      visually unhealthy part of the cervix and not the entire cervix. Side effects and unusual
      symptoms will be monitored as well as the patient's thoughts and recommendations of the
      procedure. The total amount of time of study participation is six months.
