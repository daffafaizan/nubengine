    
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of KZR-616 in
      patients with active polymyositis or dermatomyositis who completed the double-blind treatment
      period of Study KZR-616-003, up to and including the Week 32 Visit, prior to the first dose
      of open-label KZR-616.

      Patients will be evaluated for eligibility according to the entry criteria at, or within 8
      weeks after, the Week 32 Visit (ie, the End of Treatment [EOT] Visit [Visit 34]) of Study
      KZR-616-003.

      All patients will receive a SC injection of 30 mg KZR-616 at Visit 1 (Day 1), followed by
      weekly SC injections of 45 mg KZR-616 through Week 48 (EOT Visit). The final follow-up visit
      will occur 12 weeks following the last dose of KZR-616 (End of Study [EOS] Visit), for a
      total length of participation of up to approximately 60 weeks.
