        -  moving the last injection into beginning of the grass pollen season for all study arms
           in order to ensure highest possible IgG4 levels when they are needed - i.e. at the peak
           of the grass pollen season,

        -  administration of more than 3 pre-seasonal injections in order to build up sufficiently
           high levels of IgG4 already in the first year of treatment , and

        -  dosing during the beginning of the grass pollen season to establish safety in this
           setting The effect of such optimized immunization schedule on the induction of an IgG4
           immune response as a surrogate parameter for efficacy will be studied. The Total Nasal
           Symptom Score (TNSS) before and after the treatment and Combined Symptom-Medication
           Score (SMS) during the grass pollen season will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.
           This will allow intra-individual comparison of seasonal symptom data and responsiveness
           in the chamber setting.
