    
      Individuals with cardiac heart failure, in functional class II and III (according to the New
      York Heart Association), residents of the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, of both
      genders and aged ≥ 18 years, will be recruited from the Outpatient Clinical of Heart Failure
      of the Hospital de Clínicas of Porto Alegre, RS/ Brazil. At the end of the initial
      evaluations of each participant, they will be randomly allocated in one of two groups:
      functional training group (FTG) and strength training group (STG). After the consent of the
      participants, the author of the research will start collecting the data, by completing an
      anamnesis form. The following evaluations will be performed before the start of the study and
      immediately after the end of the research, by prior appointment: cardiopulmonary capacity,
      quality of life, functionality, palmar grip strength, maximum inspiratory pressure,
      endothelial function and lean body mass. Both groups will perform the exercise training three
      times per week, during 13 weeks, totaling 39 sections.
