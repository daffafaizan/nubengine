    
      A non-inferiority, two-arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of prophylactic salpingectomy at the time of a cesarean delivery will be conducted as an
      initiative to avoid a missed opportunity in the primary prevention of ovarian cancer. Once
      enrolled and consented, women will be randomized using a stratified block randomization
      algorithm according to number of prior cesarean deliveries and BMI to either salpingectomy or
      bilateral tubal ligation. The data collection will include preoperative CBC, time of
      procedure, postoperative CBC at 24 hours, standard patient demographics, procedural
      complications, estimated blood loss, return to the OR, length of stay, pain scores, and
      postoperative complications, including readmission within 6 weeks.
