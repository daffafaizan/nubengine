      change in disability among older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and assess the
      extent to which Central Nervous System amyloid-beta deposition and neurocognitive function
      modify the relationship between Strategy Training and Enhanced Usual Care on change in
      disability. Assessments will be obtained at Baseline, 6 week short assessment, 6 and 12
      months post intervention. Interventions, such as Strategy Training, focused on slowing
      emergence of disability despite underlying pathology may keep older adults as engaged in
      meaningful daily activities for as long as possible. This project tests a novel and promising
      non-pharmacological intervention and will inform our understanding of important effect
      modifiers- amyloid beta deposition and executive function- on change in performance of
      cognitively challenging daily activities. Enhancing our understanding of amyloid beta
      deposition, executive function, disability, and a promising non-pharmacological intervention
      could support aging for millions of older adults who, in the near future, will experience
      disability related to MCI.
