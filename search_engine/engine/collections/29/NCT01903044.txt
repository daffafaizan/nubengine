      at rest, loss of tissue integrity, distal amputations and have a major impact on the quality
      of life. Despite recent advances in surgical vascular procedures, a large number of patients
      (approximately 40%) are not eligible for these revascularization procedures. New strategies
      for revascularization need to be explored. Besides, in some cases results of such
      interventions do not give desirable effect, search of new methods of treatment therefore is
      necessary. Recent evidence indicates that bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) are
      a potential new therapeutic target.
