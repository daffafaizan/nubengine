      study does not affect the health care the patients receive. The time between symptom and
      surgery is compared to the outcome of the CEA after 45 days, 6 months, 1 year and 5 years. An
      intervention in the form of new practical local and regional guidelines in January 2009 (#17
      of the 29 study months) aimed at reducing the delay and increasing the patient safety.

      PRIMARY AIM:

      To study the risk of Ipsilateral stroke, any stroke, death, any cerebrovascular event, any
      cardiovascular event.

      Two primary analyses:

        1. Ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 90 Days of the presenting event. This analysis is
           aimed at the short term risk of pre-operative stroke. Survival analysis will be used.
           CEA will be used a censor, thus excluding all peri-operative and postoperative strokes.

        2. All primary endpoints within 5 years of the presenting event. This analysis is aimed att
           the long term risk of cardio-vascular morbidity and mortality.

      Secondary analyses:

      1) Same as first primary analysis, but including all stroke as endpoint, not only ipsilateral
      ischemic stroke.

      SECONDARY AIM:

      To attempt to validate different risk and score systems already published by other sources.
      Such as can ABCD2-score be used safely to chose between acute and fast normal screening for
      carotid stenosis?
