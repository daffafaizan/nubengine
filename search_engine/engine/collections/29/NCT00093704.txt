      Primary

        -  Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory
           Epstein Barr virus-positive lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the antitumor effect of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, open-label, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. Patients also receive
      ganciclovir IV twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 3
      courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-9 patients will be accrued for this study.
