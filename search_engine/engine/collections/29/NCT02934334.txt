      "Integrated biological markers for the prediction of treatment response in depression", or
      the CAN-BIND-1 study. In addition, this study is also open to other participants who
      completed other CAN-BIND studies, as well as remitters who meet the inclusion criteria. Since
      patients usually seek medical attention only after relapse has occurred, imminent precursors
      to relapse are not well known. In this study, participants who are currently responding to an
      oral antidepressant treatment regimen and/or therapeutic intervention will be monitored over
      a minimum period of 13 months, which provides a unique opportunity to discover near-term
      biomarkers of relapse.

      The study is conducted in partnership with Janssen Research & Development and utilizes remote
      monitoring technology for data gathering.
