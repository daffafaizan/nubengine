      the feasibility and efficacy of an intervention designed to increase rates of tobacco
      abstinence for cancer patients before their cancer surgery. This study (a follow up to
      smaller pilot studies) will serve as a means to further develop a treatment protocol and to
      generate an accurate effect size for a full scale trial. The present study will constitute a
      development clinical trial with a primary aim of developing an effect size for smoking
      cessation at the time of surgery (7-day point prevalence abstinence), and a secondary aim of
      creating an effect size for long-term abstinence at 3 months post-surgery.
