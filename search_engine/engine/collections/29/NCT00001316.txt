      the lack of an adequate animal model it is generally necessary to utilize human peripheral
      blood and lymphoid tissues cells for studying aspects of either in vivo or in vitro HIV
      infection. A dichotomy exists between the amount of HIV that can be measured in peripheral
      blood compared to lymphoid tissue, as well as the types of immune cells that reside in each
      compartment. We wish to be able to continue to elucidate many pathogenic aspects of HIV
      infection and other immune dysfunctions using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
      intact tissue or cells obtained from two major lymphoid organs, lymph nodes and bone marrow.
