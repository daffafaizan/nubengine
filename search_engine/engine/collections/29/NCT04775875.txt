      feasibility of focused ultrasound as an intervention for patients with obsessive compulsive
      disorder (OCD). Participants in this study will undergo 8 consecutive weekly sessions of
      transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFUP) targeting the caudate of the basal
      ganglia. The safety of this protocol will be closely monitored and data will be used to
      determine whether any significant safety issues exist when using focused ultrasound for this
      neurological application. Treatment response will be measured using the Beck Depression &
      Anxiety Inventories, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, and the Global Rating of
      Change Scale.
