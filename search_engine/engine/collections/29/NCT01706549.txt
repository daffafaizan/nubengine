      examination 1-3 years after surgery, if they suffer from pain 6 months after surgery. All
      patients were treated in Pirkanmaa District Hospital and the anesthesia was either
      propofol-infusion or sevoflurane gas with remifentanil-infusion.

      6months after the surgery, questionnaires about pelvic pain were sent to the patients.
      Patients still having pain at that time, were invited for detailed sensory and gynecological
      examinations.
