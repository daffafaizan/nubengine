      with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis treated as
      outpatients at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Lung Center. Using
      pre-existing data, we will determine if advanced care planning has been discussed with these
      patients and record this information. For all patients, we will gather data about specific
      demographic and clinical characteristics that may have contributed to the presence or absence
      of these discussions. The study is descriptive in nature and is not powered to detect a
      difference between the two groups. Instead, we aim to describe the characteristics most
      frequently associated with advanced care planning discussion in these two particular groups.

      Potential subjects will be identified with assistance from the Information Warehouse. After
      identification, data will be abstracted from pre-existing data in the electronic medical
      record and collected in a coded fashion for each subject. Each subject will be assigned an
      anonymous subject identification number and all links to identifying information will be
      destroyed prior to analysis. All study data will be stored on a secure password protected
      data base to which only study personnel will have access.
