      for tissue acquisition and pathological diagnosis of pancreatic solid mass because of its
      superior accuracy and lower complication rate compared to CT-guided biopsy. However, the
      tissue adequacy and diagnostic yield remained unsatisfactory for 2 reasons. First, the
      conventional dry suction technique (DST) often get small tissue and 3 or more needle passes
      (i.e. biopsies) are required to obtain enough specimen. Second, blood contamination of the
      acquired tissue interfered with microscopic examination. Investigator aim to develop a novel
      technique to improve tissue acquisition within a fewer needle passes and avoid blood
      contamination by using heparin-based modified wet suction (H-MWST).

      Methods This study will be a randomized crossover clinical trial. Patients with pancreatic
      solid mass indicated for EUS FNB will be enrolled. EUS FNB will be done by one experienced
      endoscopists in National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive EUS FNB with either dry suction technique (DST) or H-MWST first for the
      initial 2 needle passes, and then crossover to another suction technique for a total of 4
      needle passes. The obtained tissue of each needle pass will be sent separately and examined
      by a pathologist who is unaware of the procedure order. Procedure related complications will
      be recorded. The primary outcome will be the acquired tissue quality quantified comparison.
      The secondary outcome will be the overall diagnostic yield, the specimen adequacy, and
      complication rate by each suction technique.
