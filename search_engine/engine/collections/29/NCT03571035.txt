      digital camera is fixed on a special extension arm attached to patient's head. During
      movement the camera records changing positions of two markers placed on two selected two
      points on a patient's face. With such data, it possible to assess the absolute range of
      mandibular abduction as well as displacements from optimal trajectory occurring during
      movement, which indicative of stomatognathic dysfunctions.
