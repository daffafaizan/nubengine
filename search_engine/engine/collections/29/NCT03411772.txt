    
      Upon completion of the laparoscopic bariatric procedure to be performed for every patient and
      just before recovery from general anesthesia, an ultrasound-guided TAP block will be
      conducted in the operative theater by the anesthetist for group I patients whereas group II
      will be recovered from anesthesia without having a TAP block.

      The ultrasound probe will be placed on the lateral abdominal wall in the mid-axillary line
      between the lower costal margin and iliac crest. Using ultrasound will allow accurate
      deposition of the local anesthetic in the correct neurovascular plane. A spinal needle will
      be advanced using in-plane technique between the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and
      transversus abdominis muscles. With intermittent aspiration, 20 mL of local anesthetic (0.25%
      bupivacaine) will be deposited in the TAP on each side and seen as a hypoechoic shadow
      pushing the two layers apart.
