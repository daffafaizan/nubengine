        -  Compare the feasibility of neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy with vs without surgery
           and adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with resectable malignant mesothelioma.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study followed by a randomized, controlled study.

      Patients undergo 3 courses of a platinum-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) combination
      chemotherapy regimen to be determined by the treatment center. Upon completion of combination
      chemotherapy, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms provided tumor is resectable
      and there is no disease progression.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo extra-pleural pneumonectomy followed by post-operative
           radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo follow-up only. Patients may receive additional standard
           therapy according to their treatment center.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1
      year, and then annually thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years and then
      annually thereafter.
