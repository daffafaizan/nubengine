      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) by week 12 in patients with stage III
      unresectable/stage IV melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median progression free survival, overall survival, and toxicity profile
      of the combination of ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and high dose aspirin in patients with stage
      III unresectable/IV melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, ipilimumab IV
      over 60 minutes on day 1 for courses 1-4, and aspirin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
