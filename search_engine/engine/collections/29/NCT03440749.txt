      Physical activity brings motor and cognitive benefits and appears as an important aspect of
      the therapy that is offered to them. In particular, the learning of movements in the presence
      of multisensory rhythmic information seems to have beneficial effects at the cognitive and
      motor level. The present study aims to test the respective effects of rhythm and
      multisensoriality on motor learning in children with cerebral palsy.

      The motor learning task is known as the "Serial Reaction Time Task" (SRTT). It consists in
      repeating a sequence of movements of the upper limbs using visual-spatial information alone
      (V). It will test the addition of synchronous auditory stimulation to visual information or
      rhythmic auditory stimulation(VAR), to contrast with a control condition with non-rhythmic
      auditory stimulation (VANR). The performance of the children will be measured by the reaction
      time (RT), its stability and the number of errors made throughout the motor learning.

      The child is placed in front of a screen on which 4 luminous stimuli are presented on a
      horizontal plane. Four buzzers are placed in front of him, each buzzer corresponds to the
      position of a stimulus. The stimuli light up in a predetermined sequence (10 positions) and
      the child must press the buzzer corresponding to the position of the stimulus that comes on.
      Four blocks of 5 sequences are repeated to test the general learning (B1 to B4) and then a
      block of random stimuli is presented to test the specific learning of the sequence (B5).
