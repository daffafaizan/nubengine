    
      This is an open-label safety extension study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of a fixed 30 mg dose of benralizumab administered subcutaneously (SC) in severe asthma
      patients on inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting Î²2 agonist (ICS-LABA) therapy with or
      without chronic oral corticosteroids (OCS) and/or other asthma controllers. All patients will
      receive active drug on the same dosing regimen they received in BORA (NCT02258542). In order
      to protect the blind of BORA, patients will remain blinded to treatment regimen allocation
      until they have completed all end of treatment (EOT) assessments in BORA and signed informed
      consent for participation in this study, after which treatment allocation will be unblinded
      to both the investigator and the patient.
