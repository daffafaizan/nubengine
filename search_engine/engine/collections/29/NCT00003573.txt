        -  Assess the response rate and toxicity of oral etoposide and radiotherapy in children
           with newly diagnosed high stage medulloblastoma.

        -  Compare the response rate and toxicity of these patients to historical control patients
           registered on POG #9031.

        -  Estimate the 2-year event-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of dose intensive chemotherapy with oral etoposide, cisplatin,
           cyclophosphamide, and vincristine following craniospinal irradiation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients begin treatment within 1 month of surgery. Patients receive 6 weeks of
      radiotherapy to the head and spine, with boosts to the posterior fossa and to sites of
      metastasis. Patients also receive 2 courses of oral etoposide once daily for 3 weeks
      concurrent with and immediately following radiotherapy (weeks 1-3 and 5-7).

      Patients then receive adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin IV once every 4 weeks for
      3 courses beginning on week 11, oral etoposide daily for 21 days every 4 weeks for 3 courses
      (weeks 11, 15, and 19), cyclophosphamide IV on days 1 and 2 with filgrastim (G-CSF) SQ daily
      for at least 10 days every 4 weeks for 8 courses (weeks 23-51), and vincristine IV on days 1,
      8, and 15 every 4 weeks for 8 courses (weeks 23-51).

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within about 2
      years.
