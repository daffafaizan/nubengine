      ischemia caused by coronary stenosis. Computation of the fractional flow reserve (FFR) from
      coronary angiography is based on 3D reconstruction and fluid dynamics algorithms using a
      modified frame count; therefore, we do not need to induce hyperemia or perform invasive
      procedures with a pressure wire to measure it. During the past few years, the diagnostic
      accuracy of the QFR was investigated and showed favorable outcomes. However, data for
      patients with acute coronary syndrome are lacking. In addition, no data are available for the
      performance of the QFR in predicting clinical outcomes. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic
      performance of the QFR versus the FFR and their predictive abilities for clinical outcome in
      a real-world all-comer population.

      The Catholic imaging and Functional Research (C-iFR) Cohort was designed to evaluate the
      diagnostic performance and clinical outcome predictive ability of the QFR in consecutive
      patients undergoing CAG and the FFR at 4 major cardiac centers in Korea from January 2012 to
      May 2018. All hospitals (Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul; St. Paul's Hospital, Seoul;
      Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, Incheon; Uijeongbu St. Mary's Hospital, Uijeongbu) perform a
      high volume of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, with more than 800 PCI
      procedures performed per year. This QFR registry includes demographic characteristics,
      clinical information, laboratory data, QFR findings, and FFR findings, with clinical outcome
      data collected over 4 years (a median of 2 years)
