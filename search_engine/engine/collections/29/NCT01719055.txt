    
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, global registry of Boston Scientific
      neurostimulation systems for pain.

      The study treatment will consist of neurostimulation trial therapy with any commercially
      approved Boston Scientific Corporation neurostimulator for pain. Positive trials, subjects
      with a successful trial outcome, may progress to permanent implant of a neurostimulation
      system. Individualization of neurostimulation therapy for pain will be determined according
      to investigator discretion and site routine care, and in accordance with inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.
