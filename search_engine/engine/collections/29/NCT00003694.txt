      I. To estimate the hematologic and cytogenetic response rate of newly diagnosed patients with
      BCR/ABL (+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with combined homoharringtonine
      (omacetaxine mepesuccinate) and low dose cytarabine.

      II. To estimate the toxicity of these two drugs given in combination in a cooperative group
      setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess duration of hematological response and incidence of hematological progression
      for all patients.

      II. To assess duration of cytogenetic response in patients continuing protocol therapy beyond
      the initial nine months.

      III. To use quantitative Southern blot monitoring of blood samples to monitor molecular
      response rates in patients entered onto CALGB treatment studies for CML.

      IV. To compare quantitative Southern blot results of blood samples with marrow cytogenetics
      at the time of complete molecular response.

      V. To use RT-PCR to monitor the frequency of residual disease in patients who have achieved a
      complete blood Southern blot and marrow cytogenetic response (elimination of BCR/ABL
      positivity by Southern blot and absence of the Philadelphia chromosome by cytogenetics).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cytarabine and homoharringtonine concurrently by continuous intravenous
      infusion for 7 days. Courses repeat every 28 days. Patients receive a minimum of 9 courses of
      therapy in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are
      major cytogenetic responders at 9 months may continue therapy or switch to interferon. Minor
      cytogenetic responders are switched to interferon, and nonresponders are removed from therapy
      and given the option to switch to interferon.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 10 years.
