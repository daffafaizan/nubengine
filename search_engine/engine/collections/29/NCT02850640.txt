      and their treating physicians. Eligible patients will be recruited from study-sites in
      Singapore and will be followed until death. Patients and their consenting primary informal
      caregivers will be interviewed first at baseline and then every 3 months thereafter until the
      patient's death. A post-death interview with primary informal caregiver will be conducted at
      8th week and 6 months after the patient's death. As the majority of the care during last year
      of life is provided by hospices, the eligible patients will be followed as they receive
      treatment and care at various hospices. Treating physicians of the patients will be invited
      to take part in the study. They will be asked to answer a survey conducted only once during
      the duration of the study.

      Data on medical expenditures incurred by a patient from diagnosis of advanced cancer until
      death will be collected. With patient consent, these data will be extracted every 6 months
      from the time of patient enrolment from relevant databases, including hospitals and hospices.
