      life. THOP is defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) < 20 mIU/L and FT4 < 0.80 ng/dL.
      After obtaining written consent from the parents, preterm newborns <32 WG with THOP will be
      included. Randomization is stratified by center and 2 age-groups (24-28 WG and 29-32 WG). One
      arm will receive L-thyroxine treatment and the other arm will receive placebo. Treatment will
      be started within one week after diagnosis and will last 6 weeks. TSH and FT4 will be assayed
      2 weeks after stopping treatment.

      The primary endpoint is the neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of life, assessed by the
      Brunet-LÃ©zine score.
