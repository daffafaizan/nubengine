    
      All patients with benign uterine pathology at preoperative examinations (pelvic ultrasound
      and/or magnetic resonance and/or CT scan) and with indication for total laparoscopic
      hysterectomy, will be enrolled in the study.

      While under general anesthesia, the patient is positioned in the dorsal lithotomic position
      with both legs supported in stirrups with a Trendelenburg tilt and arms along the body. A
      four disposable or reusable, sterile trocar transperitoneal approach is used. A 10 mm port is
      inserted at the umbilicus for the telescope. Once pneumoperitoneum (12 mmHg) is achieved,
      intra-abdominal visualization will be obtained with a 0° high-definition telescope (HD
      EndoEye 10 mm, Olympus Winter & IBE GMBH, Hamburg - Germany) or with 0° 3D laparoscopy
      high-definition (Olympus Winter & IBE GMBH, Hamburg - Germany). The instruments used include
      bipolar grasper, monopolar scissors, monopolar hook, various graspers and a suction
      irrigation system. Clermont Ferrand uterine manipulator (Model K.Storz Endoskope,Tuttlingen,
      Germany) is optionally used to move the uterus.

      Total hysterectomy is then performed according to standard technique used by the recruiting
      center (development of the pararectal space and identification of uterine artery, coagulation
      of ovarian pedicles, development of the vesico-uterine septum, colpotomy).The vaginal vault
      is then closed with a 0 Vycril suture laparoscopically (continuous suture).

      Detailed operative time, intra and post operative early complications will be recorded
      (Extended Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications will be used for post
      operative complications)
