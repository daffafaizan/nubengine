      infusion, external pressure can be used which cause hemolysis and alteration of red blood
      cell. The investigators will study correlation between variable external pressure and
      hemolysis and deformability of red blood cell. Differ from previous study, the investigator
      will use scanning electron microscope for observation red blood cell.
