      Shared decision making (SDM) has been defined as: 'an approach where clinicians and patients
      share the best available evidence when faced with the task of making decisions, and where
      patients are supported to consider options, to achieve informed preferences". To conduct SDM,
      a PDA was developed to be administered for patients with ureteral stone to choose treatment
      options. We expect the PDA would benefit the intervention group in the aspects of knowledge
      and communication in choosing treatment.The aim of this study is to conduct a single center
      randomized controlled trial (RCT ) to evaluate the benefit of PDAs on decision making.

      Patients and Methods:

      Decision aids are interventions designed to help patients with ureteral stone to choose their
      treatment options for unilateral ureteral stone and any potential outcome relevant to
      treatment options. Patients with unilateral ureteral stone are randomly assigned to receive a
      PDA (PDA group) or the standard oral information (control group) during consultation.

      In control group, patients will receive standard oral information. In PDA group group, PDA
      will be used as a tool to explain the benefits and harms between ureteroscopic lithotripsy
      (URSL), flexible urteroscopic lithotripsy (F-URSL), extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
      (ESWL). And by following SDM principles, the patients are guided to consider their individual
      values and preferences and helped to make a choice that best meet their needs. This study
      will be conducted in a single center (Shuang Ho Hospital). The outcomes are decision
      conflicts and decision-making and SURE test before treatment.

      Hypothesis:

      We expect that the PDA would promote communications between doctors and patients, to further
      help the patient to make a proper decision for his/her own.
