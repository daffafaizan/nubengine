      (ICU) develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Patients in whom VAP develops have a
      higher mortality rate up to 50%, stay longer in the intensive care unit (ICU), and require
      more resources than those without the disease. Despite the availability of modern ICU care
      and modern antibiotics, the overall clinical cure rate after 72 hours of antibiotic treatment
      for VAP is only 40%. The cure rate for Pseudomonas aeruginosa is even lower. It is unclear
      why VAP cure rates are so low. The ATS guidelines recommend IV antibiotic treatment (IV AB),
      especially directed against gram-negative microorganisms. However, the relatively poor
      response rates seen with intravenous therapy of VAP and the emergence of MDR organisms makes
      new treatment options desirable. The ATS/IDSA VAP guidelines recommend that "adjunctive
      therapy with an inhaled aminoglycoside or polymyxin (colistin) for MDR Gram-negative
      pneumonia should be considered, especially in patients who are not improving". It is
      therefore necessary to investigate whether adjunctive therapy with inhalation Tobramycin
      could ameliorate prognosis. The recommendations by the Society of Infectious Diseases
      Pharmacists are similar.
