    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To gain preliminary data of the anti-tumor activity and safety profile of the combination
      of imiquimod and pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable cutaneous melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare and contrast (in a hypothesis generating manner) the biomarker profiles of
      patients who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria with patients who do not.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and apply imiquimod cutaneously on
      days 1-5 (Monday - Friday). Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years (approximately 35
      courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.
