      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical toxicity of beta-glucan in combination with monoclonal antibody
           3F8 in patients with metastatic neuroblastoma.

        -  Evaluate the biologic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of beta-glucan.

      Patients receive oral beta-glucan once daily on days -4 to 12 and monoclonal antibody 3F8 IV
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and with a human antimouse
      antibody (HAMA) titer < 1,000 U/mL.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of beta-glucan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients undergo urine, bone marrow, and blood sample collection periodically for biological
      studies. Samples are analyzed for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity,
      complement-mediated cytotoxicity, and serum HAMA response via immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
