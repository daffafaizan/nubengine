      c) Diabetic patients with normal HDL levels; and d) Non-diabetic patients with normal HDL
      levels. The studies will be performed after washing out lipid lowering drugs. Intima media
      thickness (IMT) will be performed in all groups. Main biochemical techniques will be
      centralised. Isolation and characterisation of HDL subclasses and remnant HDL, as well as a
      determination and preÎ²1 HDL will be performed. HDL studies examining HDL proteomic and
      metabolomic profiles will be performed. Functional studies will determine the effects on the
      endothelium, inflammation, cholesterol efflux and oxidation according the qualitative
      changes. These HDL measurements will be repeated in group (a), after they are treated with
      fibrates or Niacin. HDL metabolism in adipocytes will be extensively studied, and the
      clinical associations between HDL alterations and plasma AT-derived molecules will be
      examined.
