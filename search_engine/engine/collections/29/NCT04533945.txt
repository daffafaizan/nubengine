      satisfaction, which can potentially lead to an improvement in glycemic control and hospital
      utilization. Inpatients admitted to the medical-surgical units would be considered based on
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient qualifies they would be consented to
      participate in the trial. In addition they would be given a script for refills. Primary
      outcome is change in HbA1c and secondary outcomes at baseline and 90 days include
      satisfaction, number of ED/inpatient visits, completion of follow-up appointment, and
      duration of CGM use.
