    
      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate an EF training enhanced cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for BED (EF-BED+CBT) compared to standard CBT in patients with BED
      and a comorbid mood/anxiety disorder to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of EF-BED+CBT in reducing binge eating, impairment, and comorbid
      depression/anxiety symptoms. Adult participants with BED and comorbid mood/anxiety disorder
      will be randomized to a four month remote treatment of either EF-BED+CBT or CBT alone.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, following treatment (month 4) and 2-month
      follow-up (month 6).
