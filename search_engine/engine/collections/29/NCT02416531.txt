    
      Dosimetry and Experimental Groups: There is no dosimetric protocol established for the
      treatment of VLS with PDT, nor with LLLT. According to the literature, energy densities range
      from 9 to 150 J/cm2 and power densities from 40 to 700 mW/cm2, not to mention work that do
      not report the dosimetry used. As such, the dosimetry to be used in this study is based on a
      pilot clinical study performed by our group.

      The patients will be randomized into 3 groups with 20 patients in each one:

      Group GC: Corticosteroid over the whole vulva. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment applied
      once daily at a dose of 1 g/application (1 g sachets) for 4 weeks.

      Group GPDT: Localized photodynamic therapy at 8 points of the vulva. Methylene blue 0.01%
      intralesional, λ = 660 ± 10 nm, P = 100 mW, PD = 510 mW/cm2, E = 4 J, ED = 20 J/cm2, t = 40
      s, once a week for 4 weeks.

      Group GLLLT: Localized low-level laser therapy at 8 points of the vulva. The same parameters
      as for GPDT, except for the methylene blue, once a week for 4 weeks.

      Analyses: The histological and immunohistochemical analyses will be performed before and 30
      days after the start of treatment, whereas clinical analysis will be performed weekly on
      treatment days for the GPDT and GLLLT groups. The control group will not be seen weekly
      because the standard treatment is performed by the patients themselves, in their own homes,
      for 30 days as recommended by the International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease
      (ISSVD).

      After treatments the patients will be followed for verification of recorrence during one
      year, at minimum.
