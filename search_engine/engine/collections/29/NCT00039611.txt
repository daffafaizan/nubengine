        -  Provide oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium using the
           FOLFOX4 regimen for front-line treatment in patients with no prior chemotherapy for
           advanced colorectal cancer who are not eligible for entry into ongoing clinical trials
           of higher priority. (The regimen in this Treatment Referral Center protocol is one that
           was found to be superior in a recent national intergroup study.)

        -  Further determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Further determine the anti-tumor activity of this regimen, defined as the rate of
           time-to-treatment failure, time to progression, and survival, in these patients.

        -  Capture data on subsequent salvage therapy administered to patients treated with this
           protocol.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on
      days 1 and 2, and fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with clinical
      evidence of benefit from this treatment, defined as stable disease, partial response, or
      complete response as well as no increase in size of any measurable or evaluable lesion and no
      new sites of disease, may be eligible for additional courses.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 300 patients per month will be accrued for this study.
