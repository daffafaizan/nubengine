      intensive care unit (PICU). As such, chest radiography has emerged as the most commonly
      utilized tool in the assessment of lung pathology despite evidence that it may not be the
      most accurate. Since the seminal article by Lichtenstein in 2008, lung ultrasound has emerged
      as an alternative to chest radiography in the assessment of critically ill adults. Likewise,
      pediatric lung ultrasound has a growing body of research to support its use in commonly
      encountered lung pathology including pneumonia, asthma, bronchiolitis, acute chest syndrome,
      pleural effusions, and pneumothorax. Despite the rapidly growing body evidence, there remains
      little literature to support its use the diagnosis and management of acute respiratory
      failure in the PICU.

      The proposed study will evaluate whether point-of-care lung ultrasound is accurate in
      determining the etiology of acute respiratory failure on admission to the PICU.

      Specific aims include:

        -  Aim 1: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care lung ultrasound
           examination in identifying the etiology of acute pediatric respiratory failure on
           admission to the PICU.

        -  Aim 2: To determine the inter-observer reliability of point-of-care lung ultrasound
           examination findings in acute pediatric respiratory failure among trainee and expert
           sonographers.

        -  Aim 3: Compare point-of-care lung ultrasound with chest radiography in the rate of
           detection of consolidation, interstitial edema, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion.

        -  Aim 4: Describe the POC-LUS findings in patients admitted to the PICU with acute
           respiratory failure
