      to medical and psychiatric morbidity and mortality. We developed and propose to test the
      efficacy of a new psychosocial intervention, Problem Adaptation Therapy (PATH), for patients
      with major depression, cognitive impairment (up to the level of mild to moderate dementia)
      and disability. The proposed R01 study meets a critical need of this population, i.e. a
      treatment alternative for patients in whom antidepressants may have limited efficacy and for
      whom psychosocial interventions are underdeveloped and understudied.

      The principal innovation of PATH is its personalized approach focusing on the patient's
      ecosystem (i.e. the patient, the caregiver, and the home-environment) and targeting
      behavioral problems related to both depression and disability. PATH is delivered at the
      patients' home, teaches the patient-caregiver dyad problem-solving skills, and incorporates
      environmental adaptations (including notes, signs, reminders, calendars, voice alarms) to
      improve the patient's functioning.
