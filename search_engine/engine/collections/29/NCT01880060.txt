      internet-based intervention with monetary incentives to reduce the weight of overweight and
      obese employees (INCENT) when compared to a low-intensity, internet-based weight loss program
      without incentives (Livin My Weigh). Participants in INCENT will receive daily e-mail support
      that facilitates goal setting, regular assessments of body weight, and incentives based on
      percent of original body weight lost at the end of each quarter over the 12-month program.
      The e-mail supports will target improving perceptions of self-efficacy and outcome
      expectations related to weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight. In addition e-mail
      support will facilitate participant problem solving and identification of resources for
      healthful eating and physical activity at home, in their neighborhoods, and at their
      worksite. Participants in Livin My Weigh (LMW)will receive evidence-based physical activity
      and nutrition information to facilitate weight loss through quarterly newsletters and
      quarterly educational sessions.
