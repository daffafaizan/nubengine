      combined effects of administered drugs, host factors and strain factors on mycobacterial
      sterilisation. If performed in parallel with PK measurements, the method can be used to
      evaluate the effect of drugs throughout the dosing cycle. The aim of this trial is to assess
      the WBA activity and PK data of pyrazinamide and its metabolites boosted with allopurinol in
      healthy volunteers.
