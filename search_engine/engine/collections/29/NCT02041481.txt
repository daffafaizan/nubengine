    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of MEK162 (MEK inhibitor
      MEK162) plus leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the safety of the combination of MEK162 across all investigated dose levels.

      II. Describe the pharmacokinetics of MEK162 and FOLFOX in 6 patients in the expanded MTD
      cohort.

      III. Describe any clinical activity to the combination using Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      IV. Determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) which may be less than the MTD for both
      intermittent and continuous dosing of MEK162.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MEK inhibitor MEK162. Patients are assigned to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive MEK inhibitor MEK162 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, and
      leucovorin calcium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, and
      fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive MEK inhibitor MEK162 PO BID on days 1-5, and leucovorin calcium IV
      over 2 hours, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on
      days 6 and 7. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
