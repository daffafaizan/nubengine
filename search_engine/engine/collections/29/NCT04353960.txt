      peri-operative variables monitored before, during and after uniform traction on extra ocular
      muscles (EOM). The oculocardiac reflex (OCR) will be elicited by quantified (200 gram,
      10-second, square-wave) traction on Jameson muscle hook under insertion of an extra ocular
      muscle (EOM, rectus). Stable pre-tension heart rate, and greatest change heart rate will be
      recorded. Additional variables to be recorded: birthdate, gender, race, weight, iris color,
      pre-operative neurodevelopmental conditions, pre-operative medications, induction
      medications, expired carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, exhaled gas concentrations, anticholinergic
      medications, opioids, muscle relaxants, type of airway and the number of EOM operated.
