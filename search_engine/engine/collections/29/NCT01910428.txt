    
      A phase I study to assess the limiting toxicities, global safety and clinical activity of
      ERYASPASE, using a dose titration design to confirm that the safety profile of ERYASPASE in
      combination with the CALGB chemotherapy regimen is similar to that observed in the European
      chemotherapy regimen. PK/PD and immunogenicity parameters will also be evaluated.
