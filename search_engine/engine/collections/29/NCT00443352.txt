      and prophylactic treatment. Acute headache medication is intended to relieve the pain and
      disability of an acute attack and stop its progression. Prophylactic (preventive) headache
      therapy is generally given daily, even in the absence of headache, to reduce the frequency
      and perhaps the severity of anticipated attacks. Subjects who experience recurring migraine
      attacks which significantly interfere with the subject's daily routine despite acute
      treatment, may warrant chronic prophylactic treatment.

      Duloxetine may be an important treatment option for millions of unsuccessfully treated
      migraine patients and therefore warrants further study. Considering this, we propose a
      single-center, open-label pilot trial to collect and evaluate data on the safety and efficacy
      of duloxetine in the preventive treatment of subjects with episodic migraine headaches. The
      results of this pilot trial will provide preliminary insight into the clinical role
      duloxetine may play in the treatment of headache, as well as provide a basis for future
      well-controlled trials of this medication.

      This is a single-center, open-label, pilot trial to collect and evaluate data on the safety
      and efficacy of duloxetine in the preventive treatment of subjects experiencing episodic
      migraine headaches. Following a 28-day baseline period, qualifying subjects will be entered
      into an 84-day treatment period. Subjects will be titrated over the first four weeks to a
      dose of 120mg or their maximally tolerated dose (MTD). The dose adjustments will be based on
      individual subject response and/or subject's tolerability. Subjects will maintain a daily
      diary capturing detailed information on migraine headache days.
