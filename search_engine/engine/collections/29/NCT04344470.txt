      The main focus of this protocol will be to try to identify the quale of free will, its
      electrophysiological correlates, and to determine whether this quale plays a causative role
      in movement.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

      We will be doing a series of experiments. In the first experiments, we want to explore the
      behavioral response of normal subjects when they move after a visual stimulus that can be
      seen or unseen. We want to study behavior in different conditions with movement triggered by
      stimuli seen and not seen. Furthermore, we want to analyze the EEG related to those stimuli
      to explore sensory and motor processing.

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoints:

      Reaction time and accuracies of the responses to different stimuli in different conditions
      will be identified as well as the subjects subjective experiences. EEG ERP shapes and
      microstates patterns will also be investigated.

      Study Population:

      Up to 50 healthy volunteers of both genders between the ages of 25-45, fluent in English and
      right-handed.

      Participant Duration:

      The total study is expected to last 48 months, with each individual expected to participate
      in a single 4-hour outpatient visit at the NIH Clinical Center, but there can be multiple
      visits.
