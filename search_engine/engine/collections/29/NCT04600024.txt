      by compression of the sciatic nerve and other structures that pass under the piriformis
      muscle (PM). Due to difficulties in diagnosis, PS is confused with other pathologies such as
      lumbar disc pathology, lumbosacral radiculopathy, and sacroiliac dysfunction. As a result,
      patients are exposed to unnecessary and ineffective treatments, even surgery. The main
      problems in the PS diagnosis are the absence of objective physical examination findings,
      radiological findings, and a clear etiology. When the pathophysiology and etiology of PS are
      considered, there is no identifiable cause in most patients. Previous studies suggest that
      trauma, anatomical variations, and the trigger point in the muscle may cause PS. No study in
      the literature radiologically examined the pelvis or hip bone morphological features in PS to
      the best of our knowledge. This study aims to determine whether pelvic or hip bone morphology
      features pose a risk for PS in this study.
