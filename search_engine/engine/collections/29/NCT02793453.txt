      Messenger RNA (mRNA) purified from periodontal smears obtained from healthy and periodontitis
      patients by "Masterpure©" protocol.After reverse transcription (RT-PCR), in-silico design of
      primers and specificity and efficiency calculation, Complementary DNA (cDNA) are quantified
      by a semi-quantitative method (delta-delta CT) vs a Housekeeping gene. Wilcoxon-Mann &
      Whitney tests and Chi² tests are performed to check the significativity of the results
      between groups.
