      From the list of volunteering teams meeting inclusion criteria, a random selection will be
      made. This will enable the formation of two groups of 20 teams each (control group and
      experimental group). An observational method coupled with a validated questionnaire transfer
      will allow teams to be questioned about their avoidable task interruptions (control group and
      experimental group).

      The multifacet intervention program is based the concept of teamwork implementation.
      Targeting potential for improvement will be decided and implemented by each team
      (experimental group).

      Statistics analysis will be conducted on teams before and after the implementation of the
      program. The assessment criteria will be: the evolution of characteristics of the task
      interruptions observed (interactions between coordination functions and care delivery
      functions, prevalence, avoidability, duration, resumption of tasks, social representations of
      task interruptions).
