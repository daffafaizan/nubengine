      and/or myofascial trigger points' desensitization. Patients will be randomized to two groups.
      The first group receives MBB in one side and paravertebral deep intramuscular (PDI) injection
      in the other side of the back. Next week the pattern of injection will be reversed so the
      side which had received MBB will take PDI injection and PDI side will take MBB. Second group
      takes the intervention in reverse order.
