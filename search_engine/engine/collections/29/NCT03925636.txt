    
      The aim of this study is to determine the tolerability and potential efficacy of dietary
      therapy, the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), in pediatric patients with persistent antigen
      positivity due to C. difficile colonization with minimally active symptomatology. The goal of
      this pilot study is to gather preliminary data for a future treatment controlled trial of SCD
      versus standard medical therapy.

      This is a single center, open labelled study designed to determine tolerability, preliminary
      safety and potential efficacy in pediatric patients with persistent C. difficile colonization
      with minimally active symptomatology. The study patients will be recruited from Seattle
      Children's Gastroenterology and Infectious Disease clinic.
