    
      There are several forms of nonsurgical treatment for trigger finger, the most used are:

        -  Oral nonsteroidal and steroidal antiinflammatory's drugs use to resolve the inflammatory
           process

        -  Corticosteroids local injection: that proposes to control the inflammation, these
           injections have shown good effectiveness for trigger finger treatment.

        -  Orthotic: with the aim of to immobilize the affected joint until the resolution of the
           inflammatory process.

        -  Electrotherapeutic modalities:

        -  Paraffin that increases cellular metabolism and promotes peripheral vasodilatation,
           favoring the transduction tissue fluid, lymph flow, hyperemia and consequent absorption
           of exsudato.

        -  LASER -Lower Level Laser Therapy (LLLT): the absorption of light through the skin's
           photoreceptors stimulates mitochondrial chain reactions, promoting adenosine
           triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, acting on gene expression, which raises the level of
           growth factors and Tissue repair

      Although the non-surgical treatment is often used there is no evidence in the literature of
      which is the most effective conservative treatment for trigger finger. Thus, it is necessary
      use appropriate methodology to define the benefits and harms of each treatment modality and
      assess the effectiveness of these nonsurgical treatments, and may define which one has a
      higher resolution and lower rates of trigger finger recurrences in short, medium and long
      term.
