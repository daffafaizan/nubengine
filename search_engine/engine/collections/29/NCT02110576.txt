      the differences between Maximum Amplitude (MA) and LY30 calculated in the traditional small
      deviation method and by an absolute MA method.

      The maximum amplitude (MA) for a sample is determined in real-time using one of two
      MA-identifying algorithms: Small Deviation MA (the default algorithm) or Absolute MA. Both
      algorithms are available in commercially available software. Both algorithms find an MA for a
      sample; however, the difference between the two algorithms is the "acceptance criteria" which
      each use for identifying the MA. As compared to Small Deviation MA, the Absolute MA has a
      larger and more stringent rules set.

      A study will be run to establish reference intervals following the guidelines set out in CLSI
      document C28-A3c. This guideline calls for a reference interval to be constructed from at
      least 120 donors. To meet the guidance outlined in the CLSI guideline, we will collect a
      minimum of 146 donors.
