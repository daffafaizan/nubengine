      of treatment with Xeloda, capecitabine + oxaliplatin, Adriamycin Liposomial or cytarabine

      The product will be applied throughout the body in abundant quantities so that the skin is
      perfectly hydrated. It is applied twice daily (after showering and evening), gently massaging
      the area until completely absorbed.

      The product will be provided at the unit of oncology pharmacy, when the patient is
      randomized. 3 packs per cycle will be provided. If not enough (because the patient has
      greater surface area) will be supplied more. Each time you start a new cycle 3 new packages
      will be delivered.

      The patient will not apply any other cosmetic product in the treated areas.

      In addition all patients regardless of the group will receive recommendations for reducing
      the appearance of skin problems caused by these type of drugs.

      The study will have a total duration of 24 weeks (8 cycles of chemotherapy), except in cases
      of patients requiring a cycle delay for filing toxicity. In these patients the total duration
      of the study must be sufficient to end the eighth cycle.

      If the side effects are so severe that greatly affect the quality of life of the patient and
      the doctor thinks fit, may prescribe drug treatment.
