      replacement surgery. However, the safety was not well studied. For better understanding the
      effect and safety of local analgesic agent, we choose LevoBupivacaine with different
      injection way to find out. We divide patient to three groups, for comparing the effectiveness
      of LevoBupivacaine, and safety of LevoBupivacaine by checking intra-blood concentration. The
      pre-emptive analgesics and post-operative analgesics were the same as routine protocol in
      other total joint replacement.
