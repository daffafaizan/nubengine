      gradual conversion to monotherapy in subjects with partial onset seizures who are not well
      controlled by current AEDs. The 18 week double-blind treatment period consists of a 2-week
      period for titration of study drug, 6-week period for taper or conversion off AEDs, and a
      10-week monotherapy period. Subjects not entering an optional open-label extension study will
      enter a 1-week period to taper off study drug followed by an end of study visit (week 19).
