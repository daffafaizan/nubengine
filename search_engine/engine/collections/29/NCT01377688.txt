      including poor blood pressure and glucose control, but has never been used to treat DKD. To
      mitigate the growing burden of DKD, these studies are designed to determine whether a
      potentially scalable, telehealth intervention effectively slows progression of DKD in a
      diverse US population and whether it is also cost-effective. The intervention simultaneously
      addresses medication management and behavioral therapies and education that seek to optimize
      adherence and self-efficacy. This proposed pilot trial will begin to evaluate if a
      multifactorial telehealth intervention may be effective in reducing progression of DKD.
