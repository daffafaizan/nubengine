      release (positive feedback), and this is at least partly independent of BMI differences. To
      test more directly the role of hyperandrogenemia/hyperandrogenism (HA), we will assess if the
      androgen-receptor blocker flutamide enhances P4 augmentation of gonadotropin release in
      estradiol (E2)-treated women with PCOS. We will study 10 women with PCOS. This is a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover study, with subjects undergoing two
      assessments of P4 positive feedback - once after 4 weeks' pretreatment with flutamide and
      once after 4-weeks' pretreatment with placebo (in random order). We will assess P4 positive
      feedback via frequent sampling for 16 hours. Subjects will be pretreated for 3 days (prior to
      CRU admission) with transdermal E2 (0.2 mg/day), starting no earlier than cycle day 7.
      Subjects will be admitted to the CRU the evening of day 3 of E2 treatment. Starting at 0200
      h, blood will be collected for 16 hours. After 6 h of sampling (0800 h), subjects will
      receive a single oral dose of P4. A second CRU admission - performed at least 2 months later
      to permit adequate washout of flutamide (as needed) - will be identical to the first except
      that placebo pretreatment will be exchanged for flutamide pretreatment or vice versa. We will
      assess the P4-mediated augmentation of FSH release, with secondary endpoints including the
      P4-mediated augmentation of LH release. We hypothesize that in E2-pretreated women with PCOS,
      acute P4 augmentation of FSH release (positive feedback) will be enhanced by
      androgen-receptor blockade (flutamide).
