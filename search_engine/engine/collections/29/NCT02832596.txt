    
      24 patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery will be included and randomized to
      receive either norepinephrine in the dose needed to maintain pre-anesthesia blood pressure or
      to a control group and receive norepinephrine only if mean arterial pressure decreases below
      60 mmHg. Equal anesthesia in both groups will be monitored. No fluids will be infused.

      Changes in vascular resistance and cardiac output will be measured with thermodilution and
      changes in plasma volume will be measured with 125I-HSA.

      Endothelial cell function will be evaluated by measuring leakage of 125I-HSA and the plasma
      concentration of endothelial cell markers. Hormonal effects will be evaluated by measuring
      the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Shedding of glycocalyx will be
      evaluated by measuring heparan sulphate. The level of fibrinogen and platelet function will
      be evaluated by thromboelastography/multiplate.
