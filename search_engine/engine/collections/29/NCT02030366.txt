      the pupillary response to multifocal chromatic stimuli will be assessed in 20 healthy
      subjects and 20 ICP-monitored severe TBI patients.

      The portable pupillometer will be tested in 20 healthy volunteers. Their pupillary responses
      will be measured 3 times/day for 1 week.

      Pupillary response of 20 severe TBI patients will be evaluated as detailed below at the
      following time points:

        1. At admittance to ICU, prior to insertion of ICP and CT scan

        2. Prior to CT scans that are routinely performed at day 3 and 7 post injury

        3. Routinely at the beginning of every medical personnel shift for 7 days (3 times a day).

        4. With every change in ICP(more than 5 mmHg for more then 15 min) Data will be recorded
           and analyzed.
