    
      Sixty ASA I-II patients undergoing THA would be randomised to one of two groups in a
      double-blind study:

      Group LIA: A total of 151.5 ml of a combination of 0.2% ropivacaine (150 ml), 30 mg ketorolac
      (1 ml) and 0.5 mg (0.5 ml) adrenaline was administered systematically peri-articularly during
      THA and 30 ml of normal saline for ultrasound-guided 3-in-1 block Group Femoral block:
      Received 30 ml of ropivacaine 0,75% for ultrasound-guided 3-in-1 block and a total of 151.5
      ml of normal saline peri-articularly.

      All patients would receive spinal anaesthesia with 0.5% heavy bupivacaine for surgery

      Postoperatively, the following parameters would be measured:

        1. Pain intensity at fixed time intervals during 0-7 days and thereafter at weekly
           intervals for 1 month

        2. Rescue morphine consumption during 0-4, 4-24 and 24-48 h

        3. Side effects and complications

        4. Home readiness and length of hospital stay

        5. Chronic pain intensity measured after 3 and 6 months using the Brief Pain Inventory

        6. Plasma Cytokine concentration at fixed intervals

        7. Motor block using Bromage scale

        8. EQ5D and HOOS questionnaires
