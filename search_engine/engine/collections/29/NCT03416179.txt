    
      Two separate registration trials conducted under one protocol number are proposed to
      adequately and independently evaluate the addition of glasdegib in intensive and
      non-intensive chemotherapy populations. Each study will have an experimental treatment arm
      and a placebo arm. Endpoints are the same for each study except where specifically indicated.

      Assignment to the Intensive Study or the Non-Intensive Study will be made by the Investigator
      based on the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations.

      Study B1371019 is a randomized (1:1), double-blind, multi-center, placebo controlled study of
      chemotherapy in combination with glasdegib versus chemotherapy in combination with placebo in
      adult patients with previously untreated AML.

      Glasdegib is being studied in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of adult
      patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are not candidates for
      intensive induction chemotherapy (Non-intensive AML population).

      Glasdegib is being studied in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin for the treatment
      of adult patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (Intensive AML
      population).
