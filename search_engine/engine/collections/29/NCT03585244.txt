      text-messaging based study we will gather and analyze data on changes in body weight over a
      6-month interval, in individuals aged 12 and over. We would like to learn about the normal
      weight variation in the PWS population.

      We anticipate that this study will inform future clinical trials for hyperphagia/obesity
      related therapies, and provide a basis for understanding how well potential therapies are
      working. For this study, there will be no intervention and the all data will be collected via
      texting.
