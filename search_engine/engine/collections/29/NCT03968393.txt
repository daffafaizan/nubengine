      randomized controlled trial of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) versus no
      anticoagulation in patients with transient perioperative atrial fibrillation after noncardiac
      surgery and additional stroke risk factors. The primary objective is to assess the
      feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of NOACs versus no anticoagulation in patients
      with perioperative atrial fibrillation after noncardiac surgery and additional stroke risk
      factors.
