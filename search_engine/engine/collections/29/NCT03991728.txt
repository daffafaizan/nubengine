    
      More in detail this registry has the following objectives:

        -  To describe clinical indications for TMJ replacement, and treatment patterns (including
           differences among regions if feasible)

        -  To describe the clinical evolution and outcomes of patients treated with a TMJ
           replacement

        -  To explore the relationship(s) between treatment, outcome(s) and quality of life (QoL).

        -  To identify predictive factors for favorable outcomes (pain reduction, range of motion
           (ROM), occlusal status, QoL) in patients treated with TMJ replacement.

        -  To describe the reasons of patients who refused TMJ replacements
