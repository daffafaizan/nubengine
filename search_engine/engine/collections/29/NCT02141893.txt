      family asthma management and low rates of controller medication use. A previous study found a
      family management intervention called CALMA to be effective in reducing asthma symptoms and
      service utilization. However, CALMA was not effective in increasing the use of controller
      medications. CALMA- plus was developed to address this issue by adding to CALMA components of
      educational training of physicians and nurses, and screening for asthma in clinics serving
      Medicaid Puerto Rican children with persistent asthma. A total of 404 children in eight
      clinics were studied after forming four pairs of clinics and randomizing the clinics (1:1) to
      CALMA-only or CALMA-plus within each pair. After adjusting for clinic variation, the study
      failed to demonstrate that the CALMA-plus intervention was more efficacious than the CALMA-
      only intervention for increasing reported controller medication use or decreasing symptoms in
      children with persistent asthma. Both groups had lower rates of asthma symptoms and service
      utilization consistent with previous results of the CALMA-only intervention. Limitations of
      the study were small number of clinics available, comparison of the experimental intervention
      with an evidence based intervention, and limited exposure to some aspects of the
      intervention. More effective interventions may include aggressive case management, and
      providing the physician with more relevant information.
