    
      Patients who have been interviewed, examined, and a plan has been made by the treating
      physicians in the Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery practice will be invited to
      participate at the end of the visit if the patient and physician mutually agree that PFPT is
      the treatment modality to pursue.

      If she agrees to participate, she will be consented and randomized. If she is randomized to
      standard counseling, she will be given the standard handout to read. If she is randomized to
      the intervention, she will receive the standard handout and view the 4-minute educational
      video on an iPad.

      At the conclusion of the counseling, patients will be asked if they have any additional
      questions, and these will be recorded and answered. The patient will also fill out a visual
      analog scale about how informed she feels regarding PFPT.
