    
      <Part I - Phase I trial> The phase I clinical trial is to identify the MTD and DLT of
      CG200745 PPA. Initial dose of CG200745 PPA is 150 mg/m^2, and it will be extended to 225
      mg/m^2, 300 mg/m^2 or it will be reduced to 75 mg/m^2 based on the results of the cohort of 3
      subjects per dose level.

      Based on the 3+3 dose escalation study design, CG200745 PPA is to be administered as in four
      different cohorts according to the dose level. Each cohort consists of 3 or 6 subjects.

        -  Dose Level -1: CG200745 PPA 75 mg/m^2 x 5 (375 mg/m^2/cycle) / -50%

        -  Dose Level 1: CG200745 PPA 150 mg/m^2 x 5 (750 mg/m^2/cycle) / initial base dose

        -  Dose Level 2: CG200745 PPA 225 mg/m^2 x 5 (1,125 mg/m^2/cycle) / 50%

        -  Dose Level 3: CG200745 PPA 300 mg/m^2 x 5 (1,500 mg/m^2/cycle) / 33%

      <Part II - Phase II trial> In the phase II clinical trial, the subjects will be administered
      with the dose which is to be identified as a recommended dose based on the results of Phase I
      study. The whole one cycle is consisted of 28 days, same as the phase I. The entire treatment
      period is 6 cycles and tumor assessment is evaluated every 2 cycles.
