      and efficacy (ITT and PP analysis) of the traditional 2nd rescue therapy and the tailored
      therapy for H. pylori infection based on culture and MIC, the patients were classified into
      the three regimen group under the patient's agreement and underwent 2nd eradication [14 days
      bismuth-based quadruple therapy (Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) regular dose b.i.d.,
      tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg q.i.d. (three tablets at 30 min before meals and one
      tablet at 2 hours after dinner), metronidazole 500 mg t.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg

      moxifloxacin 400 mg q.d., and amoxicillin 1g b.i.d.), or tailored therapy based on H. pylori
      culture and MIC (select the 2nd rescue regimen between 14 days of bismuth-based quadruple
      therapy or 14 days moxifloxacin-containing triple therapy according to antibiotics
