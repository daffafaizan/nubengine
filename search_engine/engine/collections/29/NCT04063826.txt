    
      This is a pilot study in two parts that aims to determine the feasibility of conducting
      PET-MR imaging using [18F]-FBA-A20FMDV2 ([18F]-IMAFIB) and novel PET-MR imaging in patients
      with SH and CASH in CRC hepatic metastatic disease. A combination of factors will be used to
      determine the feasibility of [18F]-IMAFIB PET-MR imaging including visual adequacy of the
      PET-MR image, adequate signal to noise ratio and the ability to evaluate changes in
      [18F]-IMAFIB uptake and PET-MR parameters. In addition, the operational feasibility of this
      study will be assessed. Up to 10 patients will be evaluated in this study. The number of
      patients to be included in this heterogeneous cohort of patients has been based on
      feasibility considerations taking into account recruitment rates and not on any formal
      statistical evaluation. An adaptive study design will be used with patients with imaging
      results being continuously assessed. In the first part 3 patients will be imaged, 2 with
      severe biopsy proven SH and one with severe CASH. Thereafter, depending on the imaging
      results, the second part will include up to 7 patients with mild to moderate SH and those
      with mild to moderate CASH. If there are major changes in the imaging protocol an amendment
      to the ethics committee will be submitted.
