    
      Participants will receive pre-test genetic counseling in one of three ways: (1) in person at
      MD Anderson; (2) by telephone with an MD Anderson Genetic Counselor/study professional; (3)
      with a local Genetic Counselor in conference with the MD Anderson Genetic Counselor/study
      professional. After receiving pre-test genetic counseling, participants will be given the
      opportunity to schedule a submission of a small sample of blood (about 6 tablespoons) for
      genetic testing for p53. You may have this blood test repeated if there are any problems in
      the lab. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Participants who submit a sample may choose to see a genetic counselor/study professional in
      person or schedule a phone conversation to receive the results of the genetic test. Genetic
      counseling may take place at MD Anderson at no cost. Participants may wish to have counseling
      close to their home, though they then are responsible for the cost of the counseling. If,
      after talking to the counselor/study professional, the participant wants to know the results
      of the test, he or she will be told. A participant will be given more counseling and advice
      on what other care might be needed and what other actions they should take.

      The test results will be kept private. Names will not be used in computer records.
