    
      Scrub typhus patients will be recruited into the scrub typhus patient (EXP) arm of the study.
      There will be 3 sub-groups:

        -  EXPa (n=12) will have blood and non-invasive eschar samples collected (consent to study,
           declined biopsy).

        -  EXPb (n=12) will have blood, non-invasive eschar samples, and an eschar biopsy collected
           (consent to study, draining lymph node (LN) inaccessible).

        -  EXPc (n=12) will have blood, non-invasive eschar samples, eschar biopsy, and LN FNA
           collected (consent to study, draining LN accessible).

      Samples will be collected at baseline (all) and 2 weeks (blood only).

      Control participants will be recruited into the scrub typhus control.

      - EXC (n=12) are healthy individuals, attending hospital for elective/minor surgery or
      treatment of minor skin injury, and normally reside in a scrub typhus endemic region. Blood
      and a skin sample will be collected at baseline only.
