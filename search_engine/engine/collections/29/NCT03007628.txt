      therapy (ECT).

      Widespread stimulation of cortical and subcortical regions is inevitable for ECT since the
      substantial impedance of the scalp and skull shuts most of the electrical stimulus away from
      the brain. Nevertheless, magnetic pulses are capable to focus the stimulus to a specific area
      of the brain because they can pass the scalp and skull without resistance. In Addition,
      electric current will penetrate into deeper structures, while magnetic stimulus are only
      capable to reach a depth of a few centimeters. As a consequence, MST are able to generate
      focus stimuli on superficial regions of the cortex while ECT can't, which may give MST the
      capability to produce comparable therapeutic benefits with the absence of apparent cognitive
      side effects.

      However, MST and ECT may both works via alterations of cortical inhibition and default mode
      network.
