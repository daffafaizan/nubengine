      symptoms, in a part of the affected patients (about 10-20%) an allergy cannot be found on
      skin prick test or blood. Therefore, the planned trial will investigate the incidence of
      allergic and non-allergic rhinitis in a non selected group of young students (n=100-300). The
      hypothesis postulates that in test subjects with non-allergic rhinitis the allergy can only
      be proven locally in nasal secretion.

      From the initial large cohort of patients, 24 subjects with house dust mite allergy and
      allergic rhinitis and 24 patients with non-allergic rhinitis will be selected and
      investigated in more detail at a second visit. At the second visit, blood and nasal secretion
      (measurement of local IgE) will be taken from all pre-selected 48 patients. At visit 2 a
      nasal provocation test with house dust mite allergen will be performed in all patients to
      compare nasal symptoms with the results of local IgE between patient groups. In addition the
      same investigations will be performed in a group of 20 healthy non-allergic subjects.
