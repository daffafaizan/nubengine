    
      The aim of the study is to verify the application of combinations of several laboratory
      parameters in early postnatal blood samples, for identification of infants, who will suffer
      from early abnormal neonatal neurological outcome, in a population at risk.

      The population at risk is defined as term and late preterm (>36 weeks of gestation) human
      infants following perinatal hypoxia-ischemia with or without postnatal resuscitation.
