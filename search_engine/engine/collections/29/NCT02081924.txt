      at regular intervals over the course of a day (8hours).

      Following this, on a different day, volunteers will have an infusion of kisspeptin, which
      will be administered by a small pump to deliver the hormone into subcutaneous tissue (fatty
      tissue just below the skin surface). On day 1 of the pump infusion there will be another day
      of regular blood sampling for 8 hours. After this the kisspeptin pump will continue and the
      participants will return to the research unit on day 3 for a review and a single blood test.
      On day 5 the participants will have a review, a blood test and the kisspeptin pump will be
      changed. Kisspeptin infusion will continue and on Day 8 the participant will return for
      another 8 hour study. At the end of this the kisspeptin pump will be removed.

      The above will be repeated using either placebo (saline) or kisspeptin in doses of 0.1, 0.3
      or 1.0 nmol/kg/hour during the early follicular phase of 4 separate menstrual cycles.
