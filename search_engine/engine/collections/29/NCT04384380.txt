      coronavirus, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified first in
      Wuhan, a city of Hubei province, People's Republic of China (PRC). COVID-19 rapidly spreads
      in China and to other parts of the world. Currently more than 370,000 laboratory-confirmed
      cases have been reported worldwide, and the case count has been rising daily, and caused a
      global health emergency. As of March 29, 2020, there were 298 confirmed cases in Taiwan.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate (HCQ) in adult Patients with mild to moderate
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) compared to standard of care treatment (SOC). The primary
      endpoint for the study is to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ, with respect to the time to
      negatively rRT-PCR assessments from the randomization date up to 14 days. The secondary
      endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ in the aspect of virological assessments and the
      change of clinical symptoms. In addition, the safety and tolerability of HCQ will be
      evaluated during treatment period in COVID-19 patients.
