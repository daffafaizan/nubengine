      IVF treatment. On the day of ovum pick up, the fluid aspirated from the first follicle in
      each ovary will be saved and analyzed for cellular content by fluorescence-activated cell
      sorter (FACS) analysis and cytokine and hormone by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
      and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In addition, a total of 5cc of blood will
      be drawn from the patient when introducing the intravenous line for analysis of immune cell
      composition,hormones and cytokine levels. During the whole study number of oocytes
      retrieved,number of mature oocytes,number of fertilizations,implantation rates and clinical
      pregnancy rates will be documented as well.
