      Griend and undergraduate student research assistants, have agreed to collaborate with Hope
      College and Sawyer Products, Inc. to analyze the impact of different water filter deployment
      strategies in schools and villages on diarrhea and other medical and economic outcomes. The
      distribution of the water filters will begin in September 2018 to Child Hope schools in 4
      different countries (Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua). In order to
      evaluate efficacy of alternative filter deployment strategies, filters will be distributed in
      4 separate treatment arms:

      Arm 1: Simultaneous installation of filters in schools and the villages sending children to
      the school Arm 2: Initial installation of the water filters in a school, with later
      installation in the corresponding village Arm 3: Instillation of the water filters in
      villages, with later installation in the corresponding school Arm 4: Control arm. No filter
      installation initially but, ultimately, installation of filters in both the schools and
      villages.

      Self-reported information on filter usage and health outcomes will be collected through
      surveys administered to parents (in the households in the villages), teachers (in the
      schools) and school administrators. Data collection will occur at baseline (when filters are
      installed), at 2 and 8 weeks post installation. The major goal of this project is to better
      understand the different health impacts of each different deployment strategy on child and
      family wellbeing. Better understanding of these filter installation strategies will help
      guide us as we make filter deployment decisions to provide access to clean drinking water.
