      the recurrence-free survival in the same group was 56.5 %, both being higher than those in
      the transplantation only group (P=0.0001 for overall survival and P=0.0000 for
      recurrence-free survival). In no-vascular invasion subgroup treated with LT with ADV-TK
      therapy, both overall survival and recurrence-free survival were 100 %, significantly higher
      than those with vascular invasion subgroup treated with the combined LT and ADV-TK therapy
      (P=0 for each group). Vascular invasion was an important factor affected survival and
      recurrence, hazard ratio=3.687; P=0.014 and hazard ratio=12.961; P=0.000, respectively.
