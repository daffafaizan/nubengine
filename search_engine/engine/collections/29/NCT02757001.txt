    
      This is an prospective observational study of patients that have been implanted a inferior
      vena cava filter with intention to be retrieved.

      Patients are recruited when the filter is implanted, and the investigators observe when is it
      finally retrieved (dwell time), if retrieval is possible or not, and if there is any
      complication at the retrieval of the filter.
