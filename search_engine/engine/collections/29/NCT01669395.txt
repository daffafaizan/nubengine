      patients quality of life. Patients with severe heart disease often struggle with everyday
      life, characterized by reduced physical capacity, tendency to depression and anxiety to
      perform everyday activities that may provoke symptoms.

      A large proportion of patients who are offered cardiac rehabilitation deselect that offer. Of
      the patients who do participate, more than 50% stop the rehabilitation ahead of time. A large
      group of patients with severe heart failure and classified in NYHA Class III and IV, deselect
      the offer because of lack of energy to participate in cardiac rehabilitation or is when
      specified by a medical assessment discharged from the hospital without the offer of training
      or any other form of rehabilitation.

      The offer of rehabilitation for patients with severe heart failure is lacking as it is today.
      This study assesses the effectiveness of an early home based rehabilitation program that
      complements the general psycho-social support, symptom-oriented and preventive medical
      treatment that these patients always have the option to get.
