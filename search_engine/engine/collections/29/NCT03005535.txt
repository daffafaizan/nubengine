      on early markers of functional damage of the arterial wall, moderately hypercholesterolemic
      subjects will be supplemented for 8 weeks with 30 g/day of both a vitaminized corn oil (plus
      B6 and E vitamins) or olive oil. The two intervention periods will be spaced by a 4 week
      washout period.
