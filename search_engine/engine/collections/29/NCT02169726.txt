      California, Irvine. The device call Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy, this device developed with
      harmless light that can measures and detect the change of blood flow, oxygen level,
      temperature and muscle tissue in lower back during therapeutic ultrasound therapy treatment.

      The researchers can provide information in real-time tissue change before, during, and after
      treatments that can determine the effectiveness of the treatment and speed up recovery time.
