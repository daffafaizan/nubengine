      regimen with BUCY or TBICY is considered as the standard myeloablative regimen for ALL in
      CR1, but the choice between BU-based or TBI-based conditioning regimen still remains
      controversial.In order to analyze the impact of conditioning regimen on long-term survival
      and relapse, in this study, the safety and efficacy of BUCY and TBICY myeloablative
      conditioning regimens in patients undergoing allo-HSCT for ALL in CR1 are evaluated.
