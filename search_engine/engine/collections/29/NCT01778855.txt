      currently available imaging tools at a subset of multicenter sites. HASTIER will evaluate
      therapeutic response with imaging outcome measures for recanalization and reperfusion. Key
      scientific objectives include the evaluation of hypothermia on benchmark recanalization and
      reperfusion rates in 120 cases of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. Recanalization will be
      measured with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score change from baseline-36 hour
      CT/MRI angiography. Reperfusion will be measured with Tmax > 6s lesion volume change from
      baseline-36 hour CT/MRI perfusion imaging. Secondary outcomes will be measured with serial
      changes in permeability abnormalities derived from CT/MRI perfusion imaging, hemorrhagic
      transformation, and infarct growth from baseline-36 hours. Correlation of these imaging
      parameters with clinical outcomes will provide insight to accelerate research during these
      translational steps in hypothermia treatment for acute ischemic stroke.
