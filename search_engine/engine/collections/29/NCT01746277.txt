      classic mutations, such as 19 deletion or 21 leucine 858 arginine(L858R). However, most
      patients with NSCLC who respond to EGFR-TKIs eventually experience progression of disease
      after approximately 12 months. The lack of an established therapeutic option for NSCLC
      patients who have progressive disease after EGFR-TKIs failure poses a great challenge to
      physicians in terms of how best to manage this growing group of lung cancer patients.

      In clinical practice some of the initially EGFR-TKI sensitive tumors which progressed
      evidence a striking increase in tumor volume within several weeks, after being taken off
      EGFR-TKI. This response is called "rebound phenomenon". Most experts still believe that these
      tumors continue to be "oncogene-addicted" to EGFR. So it is rational that EGFR-TKI combined
      with another chemotherapy regimen can be used to treat NSCLC after the failure of EGFR-TKI
      therapy.

      However in some phase â…¡clinical trials involved a few NSCLC patients who failed to EGFR-TKI
      therapy, another treatment mode, that is to say, at least one cytotoxic chemotherapy was used
      firstly then switched to EGFR-TKI therapy until progression of disease, was used and called
      reintroduction or retreatment of EGFR-TKI. Using this treatment mode, some investigators
      reported the partial remission (PR) and disease control rate (DCR) were observed in 21.7%-36%
      and 65.2%-86% NSCLC patients.
