      There is a little knowledge on long-term urinary morbidity in patients treated with radical
      prostatectomy (RP) and salvage radiotherapy (SRT). Both treatments are potentially curative
      for localized prostate cancer (PC). Improved long-term survival makes the awareness of late
      effects from radiotherapy important.

      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study was to access, late urinary morbidity in patients treated with SRT.
      The patients included in this study will have an urodynamic examination. The results from the
      urodynamic examination will help us with a better understanding of the different symptoms and
      their grade, after treatment with RP and SRT because of PC.

      Materials and methods:

      A total of 67 patients will be invited to participate in this urodynamic study. The patients
      will undergo a urodynamic examination, included biomechanical examination of urethra. The
      examination is a standard procedure at the department of Urology, Aarhus University hospital,
      Denmark.

      The patients will, in relation to the urodynamics, have taken two blood samples. The blood
      samples, will later on, be used to detect some of the genetic reasons for morbidity after
      radiotherapy.

      Endpoint:

      The primary endpoint is the outcome of different parameters as a result of the urodynamic
      examination.

      Perspective:

      The perspective of this study is to help understanding the efficacy og morbidity of salvage
      radiotherapy. The investigators hope to get a better understanding of the mechanisms related
      to urinary morbidity.
