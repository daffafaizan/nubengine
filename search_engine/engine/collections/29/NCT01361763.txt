    
      The primary endpoint is the number of microbleeds, as measured by MRI, at 90 days of follow
      up.

      The study is based on the hypothesis that drugs inhibitor of the thrombin is more effective
      than ASA in preventing vessel obstruction. The rationale behind the study is based on the
      assumption that: a) the formation of microthrombi is relevant to the clinical expression of
      the CADASIL disease, and b) thrombin inhibitors are more effective than antiplatelet drugs in
      preventing lesions by microvessel obstruction.

      Eligible patients will be randomized into one of the 2 treatment groups:

        1. One week wash-out (W1), Dabigatran one tablet 100mg twice a day for 12 weeks, a second
           one week wash-out (W2), treatment with ASA one tablet of 100mg/day once a day for 12
           weeks;

        2. The same scheme repeated with reversed sequence No initial wash-out week will be
           required for patients in group 2 already treated with ASA.

      Clinical and instrumental evaluations will be carried out during the first (W1) and second
      wash-out weeks (W2), and at the end of the study (during the week that follows the second
      treatment regimen (W3). Each evaluation will consist of physical examination, blood tests and
      MRI.

      Safety is evaluated on the basis of brain microbleeds and severe haemorrhages.
