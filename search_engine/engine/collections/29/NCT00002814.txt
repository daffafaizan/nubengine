      glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma treated with paclitaxel (TAX) and topotecan
      (TOPO) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. II. Determine survival in
      these patients. III. Describe the toxicity of TAX/TOPO/G-CSF. IV. Evaluate tumor p53
      expression in relation to response to TAX/TOPO/G-CSF.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive paclitaxel, topotecan, and G-CSF every 3 weeks for at least 2
      courses and until 2 courses beyond maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months for
      2 years, then every 6 months for relapse and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be entered if there are 1-3 responses in the
      first 20 patients.
