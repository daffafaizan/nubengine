      challenging to manage. Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) is a genetically determined form of
      LDL-cholesterol, elevation of which is an independent risk factor and predictor of adverse
      cardiovascular events. Lp(a) is felt to increase cardiovascular risk via its prothrombotic
      effect and by enhancing intimal lipoprotein deposition. Lipoprotein apheresis is the most
      effective treatment for raised Lp(a). Lipid lowering agents such as statins have little to no
      effect on Lp(a) levels.
