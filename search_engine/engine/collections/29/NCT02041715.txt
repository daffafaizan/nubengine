    
      Approximately 20 male and female healthy adult subjects, 18 to 50 years of age at the time of
      dosing, will participate in this study. The SAD phase of the study is planned to have up to 4
      cohorts with 4 subjects (3 receiving TKM-100802 and 1 receiving saline) in each cohort.
      Additional cohorts may be enrolled in the SAD phase if a MTD is not established after the
      initial 4 cohorts. In the multiple-dose phase, one cohort is planned with 4 subjects (3
      receiving TKM-100802 and 1 receiving saline) at a maximum dose of 0.24 mg/kg TKM-100802.
