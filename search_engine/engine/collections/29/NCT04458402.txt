    
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety of adjuvant hypofractionated whole pelvis
      radiation therapy (WPRT) in endometrial cancer. The primary objective of the study is to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose per fraction (MTDF), defined by acceptable acute
      clinician-reported GI and GU toxicity and patient-reported GI toxicity, of WPRT from among
      the two study dose levels. Acute GI and GU toxicity will be assessed according to both the
      NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, and Patient Reported
      Outcome-CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE). Clinician-reported dose-limiting toxicity (C-DLT) is a binary
      outcome (yes/no), defined as an acute grade 3 or higher GI or GU per CTCAE, occurring within
      three months of completing WPRT. Patient-reported DLT (P-DLT) is a binary outcome, defined by
      a GI toxicity with a score of â‰¥4 on the 5-point scale per PRO-CTCAE, occurring within three
      months of completing WPRT. The MTDF is defined as the minimum of the dose with a C-DLT rate
      closest to the clinician-reported target C-DLT rate of 20% and the dose with a P-DLT rate
      closest to the patient-reported target P-DLT rate of 55%. Toxicity results of NRG-RTOG 1203-
      A Randomized Phase III Study of Standard vs. IMRT Pelvic Radiation for Post-Operative
      Treatment of Endometrial and Cervical Cancer- were used to define the acceptable percentage
      of DLTs. The study will accrue participants in cohorts of size 3. The starting dose level
      will be dose level 1 (41.25 Gy in 15 fx).
