      increasingly popular especially among surgeons, whether general or dental. In light of the
      clinicians whom have relied on augmented reality in their fields of work, it was suggested
      that an augmented reality-assisted orthodontic bonding guide be of use. Such an application
      would theoretically solve many issues of the indirect bonding techniques at hand.

      In this study, we shall investigate whether the theory behind such an augmented
      reality-assisted bonding guide is on par with the digitally-assisted indirect bonding in
      terms of patient convenience, accuracy of bracket placement and time consumption of the
      bonding process, to see whether it qualifies to be a method among all the other methods
      stated in the literature for indirect bonding.

      Digital indirect bonding has many advantages, one of which is achieving greater accuracy in
      bracket positioning, however it has some down sides such as excess composite flashes around
      brackets after curing and the cost of 3D printing.

      Aim of the Study Is to evaluate the patients' convenience upon using the newly introduced
      augmented reality-assisted bonding guide in comparison to the digitally-assisted indirect
      bonding tray. Secondary objectives such as accuracy and procedure time consumption between
      the two methods are also of importance.

      Null Hypothesis There will be no difference in the patients' convenience, accuracy and
      procedure time consumption between the two methods proposed.

      Trial Design Split-mouth, randomized, clinical superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio.
