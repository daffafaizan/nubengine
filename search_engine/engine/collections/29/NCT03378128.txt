      minimally invasive surgery in patients undergoing interval debulking following neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

      Primary Objective:

      Prospectively evaluate the feasibility and safety of the minimally invasive interval
      debulking approach

      Secondary Objective(s)

        1. Identify the patient population for which the minimally invasive interval debulking
           approach will offer comparable, if not improved, outcomes as the laparotomic interval
           debulking technique

        2. Validate previously identified preoperative imaging computed tomography (CT) criteria
           and CA-125 values to predict optimal cytoreduction in laparotomic primary cytoreductive
           surgery and apply it towards the prediction of optimal cytoreduction (≤ 1 cm residual
           disease) following minimally invasive interval debulking surgery

        3. Validate the previously identified laparoscopic scoring system for primary cytoreductive
           surgery and apply it towards the prediction of optimal cytoreduction (≤ 1 cm residual
           disease) following minimally invasive interval debulking surgery

        4. Monitor the number of hospital days in the first 30 days postoperatively (length of stay
           after interval debulking including any days of readmission)

        5. Evaluate the oncologic safety as it relates to time to return to chemotherapy in
           patients who undergo laparoscopic minimally invasive interval debulking surgery

        6. Evaluate the complications as assessed by incidence of a composite of major
           complications and a second composite of minor complications

      Study Design This will be a prospective pilot study to address feasibility and safety to
      identify a patient population amenable to this surgical approach. This will allow for the
      future trial to include randomization
