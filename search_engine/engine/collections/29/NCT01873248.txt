      a somatostatin analogue, DOTA-octreotate, or DOTATATE, which has high affinity for the
      somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2). Most gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) NETs express SSTR2
      on their cell surfaces; when the radiolabeled SSTR2 analogue binds to these receptors, the
      radioactive molecule is internalized and transported to the tumor cell nucleus, thus
      concentrating the radioactivity and improving the signal-to-noise ratio on the PET scan,
      particularly as the background rapidly clears. This internalization, combined with the
      improved physical principles of PET imaging, shorter half-life of the 68Ga (68 minutes vs.
      about three days for 111In), improved radiation dosimetry, faster scanning, and lower cost
      results in a greatly improved scan for diagnosis, staging and restaging of NET disease
      compared to conventional 111In-octreotide imaging. Additionally, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT
      scanning can be performed in 1.5 hours from injection of the radiopharmaceutical to
      completion of the scan, vs. 2-3 days for 111In-octreotide imaging.
