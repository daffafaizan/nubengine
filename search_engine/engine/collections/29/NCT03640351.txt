      old, who visited Severance hospital for cataract surgery and has dry eye. The participants
      who satisfies criteria, and who can be monitored at all times during each period of
      observation after surgery are included in the study.

      Methods: The subjects are randomly divided into three groups. Group 1 will use preservative
      diquafosol ophthalmic solution, Group 2 will use preservative containing diquafosol
      ophthalmic solution, and Group 3 will use preservative free sodium hyaluronate after cataract
      surgery. Before surgery, all patients underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination that
      included evaluation of logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)
      uncorrected-distance visual acuity (UDVA) and CDVA, manifest refraction, slit-lamp
      examination (Haag-Streit, KÃ¶niz, Switzerland), and dry eye parameters including tear breakup
      time, schirmer test, OSDI, and MGD staging. All examinations were repeated at 1, and 3 months
      after surgery.
