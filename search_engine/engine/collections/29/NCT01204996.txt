    
      CNTO 888 is an antibody that works by blocking a protein called CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2).
      In research studies CCL2, has been shown to increase the growth of new blood vessels which
      help the tumor to survive. It is hoped that blocking CCL2 may help to control tumor growth.

      Patients will receive one of four treatments. A dose of 15 mg/kg CNTO 888 will be
      administered once every 3 weeks in combination with either docetaxel, gemcitabine, or
      paclitaxel-carboplatin in Treatment Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively; and 10 mg/kg CNTO 888
      will be administered once every 2 weeks with DOXIL® / Caelyx® (doxorubicin HCl liposome
      injection) for intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks in Treatment Arm 4. The maximum time
      that patients will be in the study is one year.

      Safety assessments will be conducted throughout the course of the study. Safety assessments
      include the monitoring of side effects,clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry,
      and urinalysis), vital signs, and physical examinations. CNTO 888 will be administered IV at
      2 different doses (15 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) dependant on the chemotherapy combination.
      Combination therapy will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, the
      patient refuses further combination therapy, withdraws consent, or is treated for 1 year
