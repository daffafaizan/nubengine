      A. Evaluate other aspects of cognitive functioning (using the Tower of London, the
      Probabilistic Reversal-learning task, the Rey Complex Figure, the Reading the Mind in the
      Eyes test) in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder, depending on the presence or absence
      of a history of suicide attempt; B. Explore performance on neuropsychological tests depending
      on the type of therapy administered (lithium salts or valproate monotherapy or in combination
      with other mood stabilizers); C. Explore a possible relationship between circulating levels
      of lithium or sodium divalproex results and different neuropsychological tests; D.
      Establishment of a biobank for this population with leftover blood samples following serum
      lithium or divalproex testing.
