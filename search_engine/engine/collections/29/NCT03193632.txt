      disease which might expose patients to either malnutrition or overfeeding.Malnutrition is
      associated with deterioration of lean body mass (LBM), poor wound healing, increased risk of
      nosocomial infection, and weakened respiratory muscles. On the other hand overfeeding in
      medically compromised patients can promote lipogenesis, hyperglycemia, and exacerbation of
      respiratory failure. Many factors may affect the resting energy expenditure (REE) through
      manipulation of oxygen consumption (VO2). One of the strongest determinants of REE is the
      LBM.

      A measurement of muscle mass and changes in muscle mass could thus provide an index of LBM in
      critically ill patients. At present, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are widely used as reference methods for evaluating
      LBM in vivo. However, these methods are impractical in critically ill patients. More
      practically, ultrasound scanning is a simple, portable, safe, and a low-patient burden
      technique. Several studies found that the use of ultrasound can be a good estimate to LBM.

      Indirect calorimetry remains the accepted standard for determining the REE in the critically
      ill. Indirect calorimetry measures oxygen consumption(VO2) and carbon dioxide excretion (VCO2
      ) (both in mL/min), which are used to calculate the respiratory quotient and the resting
      energy expenditure. Although, the measured LBM has been shown as an important determinant of
      REE, there was no previous study tested the relationship between estimated LBM by
      ultrasound-based muscle thickness measurement and REE.
