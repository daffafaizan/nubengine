    
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can occur following
      exposure to a traumatic event in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. PTSD
      is marked by clear biological changes as well as psychological symptoms. Many people with
      PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or
      frightening thoughts. This study will assess the effect of post-trauma propranolol on
      reducing the incidence and severity of PTSD. The study will also evaluate propranolol's
      effectiveness as a preventive measure against subsequent PTSD symptoms.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be recruited upon admission to the Massachusetts
      General Hospital Emergency Department after exposure to a psychologically traumatic event.
      Baseline psychometric and psychobiologic measurements will be collected. Within 6 hours
      following the traumatic event, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 40 mg
      of short-acting propranolol or placebo and 60 mg of either long-acting propranolol or
      placebo. For the next 10 days, participants will receive 120 mg of either long-acting
      propranolol or placebo twice daily. A 9-day medication tapering will follow. Participants
      will undergo psychophysiologic, psychodiagnostic, and psychometric testing for PTSD 1 and 3
      months following the traumatic event.
