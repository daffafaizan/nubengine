      Company Limited as an adjunctive treatment in the maintenance therapy of bipolar I disorder.

      Participants will be seen twice a month for the first two months and then once every month up
      to the end of the 9-month treatment period. Participants who complete the 9-month treatment
      period will have a follow-up visit approximately seven days after the last visit. A safety
      followup phone call will be made 30 days after completion of the 9-month treatment period.

      Based on the recommendation of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee which determined
      that the study data had met pre-determined criteria for futility, Takeda has made a decision
      to terminate the study. No safety concerns were identified by the Independent Data Monitoring
      Committee
