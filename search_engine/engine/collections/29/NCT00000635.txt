      recurrences. Treatment with the drug acyclovir results in healing for most patients, but
      repeated treatment sometimes results in resistance of the virus to acyclovir. Thus, when this
      happens, other treatments need to be used. Trifluridine is an antiviral drug that is used for
      the treatment of Herpes infections that occur in the eye. This study attempts to determine if
      trifluridine is useful for treating HSV sores that have not healed after treatment with
      acyclovir.

      Patients receive at least 10 days (and up to 42 days) of treatment with topical trifluridine.
      Trifluridine is applied in a thin fluid layer that overlaps the edges of the lesion.
      Polymyxin B sulfate/bacitracin zinc ointment is then applied over the trifluridine. Lesions
      are covered by a nonabsorbent dressing. Medication is applied every 8 hours.
