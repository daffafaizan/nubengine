      increase of T (CD4/CD8) and B circulating lymphocytes expressing specific markers of
      activation and differentiation (HLA-DR, CD25, CD38, CD45RO, CCR7).

      110 adults over 18 years, on national waiting list for a first lung transplantation in the
      centers of Marseille and Strasbourg (France), whatever the lung disease, and who will be
      transplanted and benefit immunosuppressive induction therapy that specifically targets T
      lymphocytes will be included. Peripheral venous blood sampling just prior to pulmonary
      transplantation, at day 15 and one month post-transplant will be realized for lymphocyte
      phenotyping by flow cytometry (CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, HLA-DR, CD25, CD38, CD45RO, CCR7).
      Acute rejection will be evaluated at 1 month and 1 year post-transplant by trans-bronchial
      biopsies.

      The two main perspectives are to 1) find a specific, non-invasive, blood-based diagnostic
      marker of acute post-lung transplant rejection with diagnostic performance equivalent to
      trans-bronchial biopsy 2) demonstrate a specific blood marker, non-invasive, predictive of
      acute rejection in order to adapt immunosuppressive therapy early and reduce the occurrence
      of this risk.
