      have caused significant mortality. The impact influenza has or could have on the increasing
      number of patients who are immunocompromised due to acute and chronic diseases as well as
      immunosuppressive therapies is largely unknown. Limited information is available about the
      innate immune response to influenza and how chronic illness and immunosuppression may affect
      the immune response to the virus in comparison to that seen in normal hosts.

      We will evaluate both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised (control group) patients
      from the local community, and the NIH Clinical Center. Patients with known or suspected
      influenza will be evaluated by recording their symptoms, collecting their blood and nasal
      specimens, and isolating their viruses. Each patient s infection will be mapped by performing
      genomic analysis of the viral isolates collected during the patient s infection (which will
      include analysis of sequences known to confer resistance to antiviral medication), measuring
      cytokine levels in blood and nasal mucosal samples, and measuring influenza-specific antibody
      responses. Correlation of these results with clinical symptoms and clinical outcomes will be
      evaluated. Elucidation of these responses and the genomic changes the virus may undergo
      during infection and treatment for influenza in both normal and immunocompromised patients
      may help to better understand the impact influenza has on the overall health of patients, as
      well as what strategies may be performed to better protect or treat patients during the
      emergence of a new pandemic.
