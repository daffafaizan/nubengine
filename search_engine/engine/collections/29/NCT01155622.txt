    
      Patients admitted consecutively were potentially eligible for the study if they had a
      witnessed out-off hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) apparently related to heart disease and an
      interval of <60 minutes from collapse to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Additional
      inclusion criteria were:

        1. Age >18 years.

        2. Initial registered rhythm of a shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless
           ventricular tachycardia) or asystole.

      Exclusion criteria were:

        1. Known pregnancy

        2. Glasgow Coma Scale score after ROSC >8.

        3. Cardiogenic shock (a systolic blood pressure of <80 mm Hg despite inotrope infusion >30
           minutes).

        4. Other nonshockable rhythms (pulseless electric activity).

        5. Terminal illness present before the OHCA.

        6. Possible causes of coma other than cardiac arrest (drug overdose, head trauma, or
           cerebrovascular accident).
