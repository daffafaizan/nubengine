      immunity. However, past researches showed dissatisfactory clinical outcome in clinicaltrials
      using autologous NK cell infusion alone. With the expectation that the combination of
      autologous NK cell infusion and chemotherapy may increase the therapeutic efficiency of
      chemotherapy alone in cancer treatment, the investigators design and conduct this randomized
      controlled trial in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
