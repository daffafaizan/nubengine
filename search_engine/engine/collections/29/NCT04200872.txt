      biological aspect. The second one has having growing interest.

      The use of the biological adjuvants, as growth factors (rhBMP2 and 7), platelet-derived
      growth factors (PDGFs), Platelet gel (PG) or Plasma Rich Fibrin (PRF), as well as peptides
      and molecules are demonstrating promising results in the field of bone regeneration.

      The addition of autologous bone marrow concentrate cells has proven to be an effective option
      in the treatment of bone defects, although to date there is no clear superiority of one
      method over the other.

      In light of this, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic
      outcomes of the treatment, with or without the application of biological adjuvants,
      collecting data coming from the treated patients for pseudarthrosis of the upper limbs from
      2000 to 2017 at the SC Orthopedic Surgery, Innovative Techniques of the Istituto Ortopedico
