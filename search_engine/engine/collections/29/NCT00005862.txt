      I. Determine the response rate, response duration, and overall survival in patients with
      advanced, metastatic, or recurrent soft tissue sarcoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumor when
      treated with SU5416.

      II. Determine the safety of SU5416 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive SU5416 IV twice weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months for 1 year.
