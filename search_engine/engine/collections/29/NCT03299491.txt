      packages in three districts (Gomma, Seka Chekorsa, Kersa) in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia.
      Twenty-four clusters with 160 individuals each are required to detect a 17% change in the
      primary outcome (proportion of facility-based births) with 80% power,assuming a cluster
      autocorrelation of 0.8 and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1. Primary health
      care units (PHCU) which consist of a health centre and several community-based health posts
      will serve as trial clusters. All PHCUs with maternity waiting areas (MWAs) constructed will
      be eligible for selection. Eligible women will be randomly selected from PHCU catchment areas
      stratified by MWA functionality and health centre basic emergency obstetric care (BEmOC)
      capacity. This is to ensure balanced distribution of poorly functioning MWAs and facilities
      with diminished BEmOC capacity between trial arms.

      Cross-sectional household surveys will be conducted with eligible women to collect
      information on socio-demographics, knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding maternal
      health services, reproductive history and maternal health service utilization. Surveys will
      be administered by trained interviewers on tablet computers programmed using Open Data Kit at
      baseline prior to intervention roll out and at endline. Multilevel regression models will be
      used to quantify the effect of the intervention packages on outcomes of interest. Random
      effect terms for PHCUs will be included to account for the clustered nature of the data.
