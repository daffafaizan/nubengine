      resolution images of the coronary arteries. This new imaging system enhances the
      understanding of complex coronary lesions and the complex interaction between coronary
      devices and vessels by assembling/compiling 2-dimensional cross sections.

      This 3-dimensional reconstruction with strut segmentation becomes possible on-line in the
      TERUMO OFDI console with 3-dimensional imaging software, which enables stent enhancement and
      3D reconstruction within one minute. This "real time" 3D OFDI will promote the utilisation of
      3-dimensional assessment in the treatment of bifurcation lesions.
