      Likert scales are used. This allows the magnitude of individual's perceptions and
      satisfaction to be measured on a multipoint scale anchored at each end. In addition, the
      study will describe patient perceptions related to device attributes, which are of importance
      in describing overall patient perception. A range of potential device benefits (e.g. ease of
      use, convenience, injection site pain, injection anxiety, injection confidence) will be
      captured using a questionnaire. The study aims to characterize patient attributes that will
      indicate when one device may result in greater patient satisfaction than another. Patient
      attributes are composed of patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, demographics, social and
      educational status psychological status, willingness to self-manage, injection experience)
      and Psoriasis characteristics (e.g. disease severity, disease duration, co morbidities, prior
      treatment, quality of life). The study will also take the opportunity to measure health
      outcome measures as there may be important differences in cost of training and patient
      support between the two devices.
