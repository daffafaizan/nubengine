      fluid shifts and fluid retention resulting in extravascular fluid accumulation and
      postoperative organ dysfunctions, complicates perioperative fluid management and influences
      patient outcome.

      Changes in extravascular volume after surgery have been much debated, studies in major
      surgery suggest that extracellular volume expansion may correlate with intraoperative fluid
      administration, while other studies show the intravascular volume to be decreased after
      surgery.

      Difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements of the fluid phases is recognized and despite
      years of research, perioperative extravascular volume changes have not been clarified in
      acute high-risk abdominal (AHA) surgery. It is essential to be able to identify and
      characterize the transition from necessary fluid resuscitation to harmful fluid volume
      accumulation, intra- as well as extravascular.

      The present study seeks to investigate the perioperative fluid status and fluid shifts in
      patients undergoing AHA surgery, specifically focusing on intra- versus extra-vascular fluid
      status in patients with intestinal obstruction versus intestinal perforation.
