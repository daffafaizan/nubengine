      Assess the feasibility of outpatient induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by examining whether:

        1. > 50% of patients treated as outpatients can complete chemotherapy without being
           admitted to hospital.

        2. < 5% of patients die within 14 days of beginning outpatient chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive outpatient induction chemotherapy.

      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

      The study was monitored to assure that there was not an excess probability of admission to
      the hospital during receipt of outpatient chemotherapy or death within 14 days of initiating
      chemotherapy as assessed by Bayesian posterior probabilities using the "predictive
      probabilities" tool (MD Anderson Cancer Center Department of Statistics).

      Stopping earlier would happen under 2 circumstances:

        1. Excess probability that patients required admission to hospital during the 4-7 days of
           outpatient chemotherapy (predictive probability be < 0.10, or 7 patients admitted and 3
           not admitted among 10 patients enrolled versus the maximum acceptable rate of 4 patients
           admitted and 6 not admitted among 10 patients enrolled).

        2. Excess probability that patients die during the 14 days after beginning outpatient
           treatment (predictive probability be >0.90, for example in cases where there are 2
           patient deaths within 14 days and less than 5 patients without deaths within 14 days, or
           in any case where there are 3 patient deaths within 14 days).
