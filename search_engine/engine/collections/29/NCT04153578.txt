      hemodynamic stability.1 Both weight-based and non-weight-based dosing recommendations exist
      with no clear evidence that one is better than the other.3-10 However, in light of the
      obesity epidemic and emerging evidence regarding the dangers of excessive catecholamine
      exposure, an evaluation of dosing practices is warranted. The aim of this study is to
      determine whether clinical outcomes differ between patients receiving weight-based and
      non-weight-based vasopressor dosing strategies for septic shock. This is a multicenter,
      retrospective chart review. Patients admitted to MDMC and MCMC from 4/1/2017-8/31/2019 will
      be identified through the electronic medical record utilizing ICD codes for sepsis and septic
      shock. Patients meeting study inclusion criteria will be analyzed as described below.
      Outcomes will be assessed between patients receiving WBVP and NWBVP with planned subgroup
      analysis in each group between patients with BMI < 30, 30-49, and > 50.
