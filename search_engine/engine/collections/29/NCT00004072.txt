        -  Evaluate the efficacy of O6-benzylguanine combined with carmustine in patients with
           previously untreated or refractory multiple myeloma.

        -  Assess the effects of O6-benzylguanine on bone marrow myeloma cells in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 60 minutes followed 1 hour later by
      carmustine IV over 60 minutes. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive 2 additional courses beyond attainment
      of best response (partial or complete response or stable or plateau disease).

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
