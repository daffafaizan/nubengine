    
      Study specific aims are: (1A) Evaluate changes in serum inflammatory cytokine protein markers
      in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy; (1B) Evaluate changes in electroencephalographic
      and radiologic markers of CAR-T-related toxicities in comparison to neurocognitive function
      following CAR T-cell therapy; (2A) Assess changes in activity levels using
      actigraphy/accelerometry to continuously monitor physical activity; and (2B) Assess changes
      in driving performance using a standardized on-road instrumented vehicle drive.

      Patients (n=20) will be recruited into the study if they are diagnosed with relapsed or
      refractory DLBCL or ALL, and scheduled to undergo commercially-available CAR T-cell therapy.

      The following measures will be completed during primary study visits: prior to apheresis (T0)
      and 8-weeks post CAR-T cell infusion (T6). (1) blood inflammatory proteins; (2) brain wave
      recordings (or EEG), brain imaging, and neurocognitive assessment; (3) free-living activity
      levels; and (4) driving performance and safety. EEG will assess neural activity patterns of
      brain dysfunction; brain imaging will look for brain abnormalities; neurocognitive
      assessments will evaluate changes in thinking, concentration, and memory. A research-grade
      activity monitor will be used to assess activity levels. Driving performance and safety will
      be evaluated using a driving simulator and an on-road vehicle designed to monitor behavior
      while drivers complete a driving course. Analyses will assess changes between study visits,
      as well as relationships between immunological, neurological, activity, and driving measures.
