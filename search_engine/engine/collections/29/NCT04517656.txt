      of medical improvement, some of these pathologies present drug resistances, or high risk of
      relapse. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation remain the gold standard of
      consolidation, to maintain a durable response. In this situation, allograft with
      hematopoietic stem cells donor aims at producing Graft-versus-Tumor effect, by producing a
      new immune system, reproducing anti-tumoral immunity.

      However, all hemopathies do not have the same sensibility. Nowadays, mechanisms underlying
      this phenomenon remain poorly understood.

      Indeed, few data precisely document the expression of immunological checkpoints and other
      biomarkers in the context of allogeneic HSC transplantation, particularly their impact on
      post-transplant outcome. Therefore, we want to systematically study the expression profile of
      different biomarkers during allogeneic transplantation, in order to establish a correlation
      between these expression patterns and post-transplant outcome. Ultimately, this research will
      enable to (i) have tools to predict the post-transplant response and (ii) define whether a
      targeted therapy could be beneficial or be contraindicated for adequate patient management.

      Patients will be selected for the study once they meet all the inclusion criteria. The study
      will be proposed to them during the pre-allogeneic consultation as part of their usual care.
      This study does not modify the treatment or the usual management of patients according to the
      current practice of pre- and post-transplant management. Clinically, it consists of building
      up a relevant biological collection.
