    
      Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a
      surgical procedure to treat cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity
      (peritoneal metastases). It is associated with a prolonged time for return of bowel function
      after surgery.

      Alvimopan is a drug used to speed up the time for return of bowel function after surgery. It
      works by blocking the opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, which normally slow
      down bowel function in patients receiving postoperative opioid pain medication. It has not
      previously been tested in patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC.
