    
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study designed to
      collect long-term safety and efficacy data and provide PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) access to
      participants in completed PCI-32765 studies. PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) is a first-in-class,
      potent, orally-administered, covalently-binding small molecule inhibitor of bruton's tyrosine
      kinase. "PCI-32765" and "ibrutinib" refer to the same molecule; hereafter, "PCI-32765"will be
      used. Participants will continue with the current PCI-32765 dosing regimen established in the
      parent PCI-32765 study until the investigator determines that the participant is no longer
      benefitting from treatment (ie, disease progression or unacceptable toxicity has occurred),
      the study is terminated by the sponsor, the participant withdraws consent, alternative access
      to PCI-32765 is available and feasible, or for other reasons as defined in the protocol.
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study and summarized. Efficacy may be analyzed in
      combination with the data collected in the parent protocol. Blood samples and a lymph node
      biopsy sample for biomarker evaluations will be collected at the time of disease progression
      or at the End of Treatment visit for participants who discontinue treatment without disease
      progression (where local regulations and shipping logistics permit). There is no formal
      hypothesis testing planned for this long-term extension study. Participants can receive
      treatment with single-agent PCI-32765 and continue until end of study, which is defined as
      the time of the last End-of-Treatment safety assessment for the last subject participating in
      the study or 5 years after the last subject entered, or upon a decision by the sponsor to
      terminate the study, whichever occurs earlier.
