      Heimke in 1976.

      The major advantages of immediate implant placement are reduction in number of visits, thus
      reduces the treatment time and improves patient satisfaction, provides ideal three
      dimensional implant position, and preserves the alveolar bone in the extraction socket

      . However, immediate implants may have some disadvantages that can affect the success rate,
      which include inadequate primary implant stability when compared with delayed implants,
      inadequate soft tissue closure especially in case of thin tissue biotype, inability to
      inspect all aspects of the extraction site for defects or infection, and finally the added
      cost of bone grafting when the jumping distance is over 2mm.

      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is one of the extracellular components of the connective tissue that
      belongs to the family of glycosaminoglycans, due to its non-immunogenic and non-toxic
      properties , it can be used in many medical fields such as dentistry, ophthalmology,
      dermatology.

      HA has an important role in wound healing through inducing early granulation tissue
      formation, inhibiting destructive inï¬‚ammatory process during the process of tissue healing,
      inducing re-epithelialization and angiogenesis.

      HA not only acted as a carrier of growth factors and cells but also stimulated bone formation
      through chemotaxis, proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts.
      Although HA shares bone induction properties with osteogenic growth factors as bone
      morphogenic protein 2 and osteopontin.

      HA also has anti-inflammatory effect through scavenging reactive oxygen species, such as
      superoxide radical (O2) and hydroxyl radical (OH) species, and inhibiting neutrophil derived
      serine proteinases, HA also has anti-edematous effect that may be related to its osmotic
      buffering capacity.

      So surrounding of an implant with hyaluronic acid give a great potential to improve new bone
      formation and improve bone/implant contact which will improve healing time and implant
      stability.
