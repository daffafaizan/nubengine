      be recruited and randomly divided into real tDCS and sham groups. All the participants will
      receive individualized speech therapy based on the results of their speech assessment.

      For the real tDCS group, an anodal high-definition tDCS of 2 milliamperes (mA) lasting for 20
      minutes will be delivered to the orofacial area of the primary motor cortex (SM1) during
      speech therapy. For the sham tDCS group, stimulation given during speech therapy will only
      last for 30 seconds in order to cause a similar sensation on the scalp as the real
      stimulation group. There will be a total of 10 daily sessions during a 2-week period.
