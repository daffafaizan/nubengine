      for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain in opioid-naive patients. Patients are
      gradually titrated from a 5mg dose of oxymorphone ER (taken every 12 hours) until stabilized
      dose is achieved. The study design is an open-label, nonrandomized 6-month study with a
      titration/stabilization period of â‰¤ 1 month followed by a 5-month maintenance period.
