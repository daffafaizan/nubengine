    
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a mobile application system
      using the Patient Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events (PRO-CTCAE) to improve patients' participation in symptom management during cancer
      treatment. Breast, lung, head and neck, esophagus, and gynecologic cancer patients who will
      begin new lines of chemotherapy or radiation therapy will be randomly assigned into the
      intervention and control groups (2:1 ratio). The intervention group will have the mobile
      application installed on their smart phones which they could record symptoms and adverse
      events due to cancer treatments using the pre-specified PRO-CTCAE questions for different
      types of cancer. The control group will have usual care. Primary endpoint is patients'
      participation/engagement of reporting symptoms and it will be evaluated at 8 weeks after the
      intervention using a questionnaire developed by the research team. Secondary end points are
      unexpected hospital visits during treatment during 8 weeks after the beginning of the
      treatment and quality of life at 8 weeks after the intervention.
