    
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, observational, open-label, non-randomized,
      multi-center study. It is designed to collect clinical follow-up data on Differential Target
      Multiplexed (DTM®) programming that is available in Medtronic's Intellis™ spinal cord
      stimulator, which has shown superiority to conventional programming parameters in a
      randomized controlled trial (NCT03606187).

      Participants currently implanted with a permanent neurostimulation system, whom are planned
      for conversion to DTM® programming as well as newly identified participants planned to
      undergo a trial of neurostimulation using DTM® will be eligible to participate in this study.
      Data will be collected at baseline prior to DTM® programming exposure.

      Participants who continue to meet eligibility criteria and have had their implanted DTM
      programming activated will enter the 24-month follow-up period, where participant
      self-reported questionnaires will be assessed each month with study visits to occur at months
      3, 6, 12 and 24.

      Throughout the study, objective functional data will be collected automatically as part of
      the Medtronic Intellis™ device interrogation.
