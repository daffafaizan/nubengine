      Staphylococcus aureus would impact emergency department clinician antimicrobial selection for
      adults with cutaneous abscesses.

      We performed a prospective, randomized controlled trial in two urban emergency departments
      comparing a rapid molecular test with standard of care culture-based testing. Follow-up
      telephone calls were made at between 2 and 7 days, 1 month, and 3 months after discharge.

      Patients at least 18 years old presenting with a chief complaint of abscess, cellulitis, or
      insect bite and receiving incision and drainage were eligible. Seven hundred seventy-eight
      people were assessed for eligibility and 252 met eligibility criteria.
