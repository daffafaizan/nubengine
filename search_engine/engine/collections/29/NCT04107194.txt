      Eligible subjects will be defined by the positivity to at least 2 out of 4 tests for
      Helicobacter pylori infection diagnosis (i.e. histology, rapid urease test, urea breath test
      and serology). Stool samples and gastric biopsy specimens of eligible patients will be
      analyzed at enrollment, using real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect
      bacterial DNA mutations conferring resistance to amoxicillin, clarithromycin, tetracycline,
      metronidazole, and levofloxacin. Participants allocated to the tailored intervention arm will
      receive an antibiotic combination therapy according to the result of stool sample molecular
      analysis. Participants allocated to the empiric intervention arm will be treated by either a
      quadruple concomitant or bismuth-containing regimen, according to the 2017 European
      Helicobacter pylori management guidelines. In all participants, infection eradication will be
      evaluated 30 days after treatment end, using urea breath test. We will also assess the
      diagnostic accuracy of the RT-PCR on fecal samples in detecting bacterial antibiotic
      resistances, using the RT-PCR on gastric biopsy specimens as the reference standard.
