        -  LVMI is expected to remain stable or to be ameliorated over an average of 24 months
           treatment duration. The LVMI reduction observed in patients followed up to 24 months is
           expected to be significantly reduced with a mean change of -6.6 g/m2 (-11.0, -2.1, 95%
           CI).

        -  eGFR [CKD-EPI] is expected to remain stable over an average of 24 months treatment
           duration. The long-term effect of Migalastat on eGFR is expected to be comparable to the
           decline over time in healthy adults. The annualized rate of change over this period is
           expected to be ≤1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in females and ≤3 mL/min/1.73 m2 in males.

        -  Significant reduction is expected in plasma lyso-Gb3 concentration at month 6, month 12
           and month 24 following treatment with Migalastat.

        -  ERT-naïve patients treated with Migalastat are expected to show an improvement of GI
           symptoms (diarrhea) over 24 months.

        -  No progression of White Matter Lesions (WML) during treatment duration is expected.

        -  No higher frequency of stroke/transient cerebral ischemia during treatment duration is
           expected.

        -  Severity of neuropathic pain is expected to remain stable or to improve during treatment
           duration.

        -  Dosing/amount of symptomatic medications of neuropathic symptoms is expected to decrease
           during treatment duration.
