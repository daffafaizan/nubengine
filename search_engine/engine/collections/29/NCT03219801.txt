      follow-up, twenty SLE patients ranging from 14 to 60 years old were enrolled in this trial.
      Participants matched with the inclusion criteria were allocated randomly into two
      groups:Human Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hUC-MSCs) treated group and
      control group. Clinical trials are being increasingly established to investigate the
      therapeutic potential of these cells for SLE. The aim of the present study is to investigate
      safety and efficacy of vein infusion of allogeneic hUC-MSCs in patients with SLE.
