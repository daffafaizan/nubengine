      I. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective response rate (complete
      response [CR] + partial response [PR]) in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head
      and neck following treatment with GW572016 (lapatinib ditosylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Secondary objectives of this study are to estimate time to progression, describe the
      adverse event profile, and to obtain preliminary assessments of changes in pre- versus
      post-treatment measurements for selected biomarkers in tumor cells from these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
