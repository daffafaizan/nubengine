      delivered by nurses with special training, using a stepped-care approach targeted toward pain
      and fatigue, followed by fifteen other prevalent cancer symptoms. Second goals are to improve
      physical and social functioning, lower emotional distress, and improve communication with
      family caregiver in symptom management, and assist them to reduce their levels of depression
      and burden. This research is funded through a grant from the National Cancer Institutes, and
      builds upon the Family Care Research Team's program of supportive cancer-care research.

      OUTCOMES: This study tests a stepped-approach intervention to determine if it improves
      symptom outcomes, especially pain and fatigue. Secondary outcomes addressed by the
      intervention are physical role impact, social functioning, and emotional distress. These
      outcomes can have significant impact on patients and family caregivers' well-being as
      patients undergo chemotherapy. The shorter, more intense intervention corresponds to changes
      int he clinical management of cancer patient with more intense, shorter chemotherapy
      treatments; therefore, this intervention will be more easily translatable to the clinical
      setting.
