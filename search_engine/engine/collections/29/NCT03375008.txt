      disease(NAFLD). The causes are known to be associated with metabolic diseases such as
      obesity, insulin resistance type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Histologically, it is
      characterized by steatosis, hepatocellular injury, and inflammation and fibrosis of the liver
      parenchyma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
      carcinoma(HCC) may develop even in patients without viral hepatitis, therefore there have
      been much interest and many researches in causation and diagnosis for nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis(NASH).

      Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease(NAFLD) and is the only reliable method for differentiating nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis(NASH) from simple steatosis. However, liver biopsy has several drawbacks,
      including invasiveness, potential complications such as excessive bleeding and death,
      sampling error, and inter- and intra-observer variability.

      Magnetic resonance(MR) imaging has been used as a multiparametric imaging tool with which to
      evaluate steatosis by chemical shift imaging andm magnetic resonance(MR) spectroscopy, and
      fibrosis by magnetic resonance(MR) elastography and T1 mapping. To the best of our knowledge,
      there is no accurate imaging diagnostic tool for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH),
      therefore the investigators aimed to develop non-invasive imaging diagnostic model using
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imager(MRI).
