      measuring lung inflammation: [18F](+/-)NOS (the F stands for fluorine and NOS stands for
      Nitric Oxide Synthase, which targets iNOS), O-15 carbon monoxide ([15O]CO), and O-15 water
      ([15O]H2O). The NOS tracer gives information specifically about lung inflammation, while the
      carbon monoxide and water tracers give information about whether the lung inflammation causes
      more blood or water to be retained in the area of lung inflammation.

      In order to show that [18F](+/-)NOS-PET is related to the amount of inflammation, the
      investigators first need to create a state of controlled lung inflammation that can be
      measured and quantified. "Controlled lung inflammation" means a reaction in the lungs that is
      similar to that which occurs during lung infection (increased respiratory secretions and
      cough). It is "controlled" because the investigators will not be using anything alive or
      contagious (it does not spread from one part of the body to another, and cannot spread to
      another person), and a small area in only one lung will be affected. In order to created this
      state of controlled lung inflammation, the investigators plan to place a small amount of a
      purified bacterial substance called endotoxin into a single small section of the lung using a
      bronchoscope (a long, flexible narrow tube that is passed through the mouth into the airways
      of the lung). This use of endotoxin is considered investigational, and the investigators have
      received permission from the FDA to use endotoxin in this research study.
