      treatment for pharmacoresistant depression, we lack neural target biomarkers for identifying
      who is most likely to respond to TMS and why. To address this gap in knowledge this
      observational study evaluates neural targets defined by activation and functional
      connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-anchored cognitive control circuit,
      regions of the default mode network and attention circuit, and interactions with the
      subgenual anterior cingulate.

      The study evaluates whether these targets and interactions between them change in a
      dose-dependent manner, whether changes in these neural targets correspond to changes in
      cognitive behavioral performance, and whether baseline and early change in neural target and
      cognitive behavioral performance predict subsequent symptom severity, suicidality, and
      quality of life outcomes.

      This study is designed as a pragmatic, mechanistic observational trial partnering with the
      National Clinical TMS Program of the Veteran's Health Administration.

      All veterans will receive a clinical course of TMS as part of their routine care. Those who
      agree to enrollment in the observational study will be assessed at 'baseline' prior to
      commencement of their TMS treatment, 'first week' after initiation of TMS (targeting five
      sessions) and 'post-treatment' at the completion of TMS (targeting 30 sessions).

      Veterans will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a cognitive
      behavioral performance battery, and established questionnaires.

      To our knowledge, our study will be the first pragmatic, mechanistic observational trial to
      use fMRI imaging and cognitive-behavioral performance as biomarkers of TMS treatment response
      in pharmacoresistant MDD.
