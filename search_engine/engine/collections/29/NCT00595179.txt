      crude estimates such as overt physical examination, measurement of laboratory values and
      physical measurements of vascular flow and resistance. The ability to non-invasively measure
      tissue perfusion and oxygenation would provide the surgeon an improved means to assess if an
      injured organ will survive. The recent development of real time infrared (IR) and Near
      Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy (NIRIS) digital cameras has allowed for the determination of
      tissue perfusion and oxygenation in a non-invasive fashion. Although in the early stages of
      development, the application of infrared and NIRS technology holds great promise to permit
      the surgeon to better assess the viability of tissues in ways that have not been possible. We
      propose to evaluate infrared and NIRS technology in the assessment of kidney allografts using
      data previously collected during recipient operations at the NIH.
