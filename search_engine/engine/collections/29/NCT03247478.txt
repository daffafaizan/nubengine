      low, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or PET/CT did not significantly improve specificity to
      axillary lymph node. The aim of this study is to determine performance of computed tomography
      (CT) reconstruction on evaluation of lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      breast cancer patients.
