      I. To collect, both prospectively and retrospectively, data on disease characterization,
      treatment and outcome for pregnant patients with malignancies seen at M. D. Anderson Cancer
      Center.

      II. To organize clinical information in order to support multifaceted queries of patient
      characteristics, treatment, and pregnancy outcome data and to facilitate correlation of these
      characteristics with patient outcome.

      III. To have a single data repository, kept on a secure platform, that will integrate
      clinical information and research findings and serve as a secure archive for future research.

      OUTLINE:
