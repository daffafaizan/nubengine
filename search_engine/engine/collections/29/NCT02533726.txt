      optimal patient turning, strictly every 2 hours with at least 15 minutes of tissue
      decompression, reduces the occurrence of hospital acquired pressure ulcers. Optimal turning
      procedures will be obtained with the use of a patient monitoring system (Leaf Healthcare,
      Inc.) and compared to standard preventative care practices.

      Sensors were placed on all participants as they were admitted to ICU. A nurse's user
      dashboard was turned on for participants in the Optimal Turning Group, but was not turned on
      for participants in the Standard Care group.
