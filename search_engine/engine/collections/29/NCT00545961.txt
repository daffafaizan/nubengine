      treatment. The diagnosis and treatment outcomes of acute sinusitis are contradictory, and
      better diagnostic criteria are needed. In adults with acute maxillary sinusitis, bacterial
      culture results obtained from the nasal middle meatus are comparable to those obtained from
      sinus puncture and aspiration. In children, the presence of pathogenic bacteria (S.
      pneumoniae, H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis) in the nasal middle meatus during respiratory
      infection predicts longer duration of signs and symptoms of common cold.

      In this randomized placebo-controlled study, the effect of the antimicrobial treatment
      (amoxicillin-clavulanate) is examined in children with pathogenic bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H.
      influenzae or M. catarrhalis) in the nasal middle meatus during respiratory infection. The
      duration of the symptoms and speed of recovery is recognized by daily symptom-diary, the
      results are compared between the treatment groups.
