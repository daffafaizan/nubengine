      Tomographic Angiography (CTA) in a one-day visit. Three groups of patients will be enrolled:
      patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome, patients with stable ischemic heart disease, and
      asymptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease.

      Prior to 18F-NaF administration, participants will have blood drawn to measure serum
      creatinine and other biomarkers related to heart disease.

      All participants will undergo a 18F-NaF PET scan and a coronary CTA (which includes contrast
      administration). If medically appropriate, participants will have oral or intravenous
      beta-blocker (metoprolol) and nitroglycerin prior to CTA imaging.

      Up to 10 patients will be asked to return for repeat18F-NaF PET and coronary CTA imaging 2 to
      21 days after the initial scan. Up to 20 patients will be asked to return for repeat 18F-NaF
      PET scan and coronary CTA imaging about 6 months after the initial scan. Researchers will
      compare the repeat images to the initial studies.
