      area in the United States are invited to participate over a 4 month period. All
      English-speaking patients, between 18 and 89 years old, visiting an orthopeadic surgeon with
      a new problem, for which either invasive or non-invasive treatment is possible and a DA is
      available are asked to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria are non-English speakers
      or a clear preference for a treatment option by surgeon or patient. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a 1:1 ratio using an Excel random
      number generator. Patients in the intervention group go over the DA during the visit, once
      the surgeon has identified the diagnosis. After the diagnosis is set, the surgeon steps out
      of the visit and steps back in when the patients has reviewed the DA. The surgeon and the
      patient go over the treatment options and a decision will be made. After the visit, all
      patients, both in the intervention and control group, are asked to fill out a survey. Two
      weeks after enrollment a research assistant calls all patients for a follow up questionnaire.
