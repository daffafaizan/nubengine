      randomization sequence from study staff) to one of two Child Speech Interventions: Speech
      Perception or Speech Production. These interventions will be provided in individualized
      one-hour treatment sessions once per week for six consecutive weeks during the first
      treatment block. During the second 6 week treatment block all children will receive a group
      phonological awareness intervention. Concurrently their parents will be randomly assigned to
      receive instruction in the provision of a home program, either Articulation Therapy or
      Dialogic Reading. This will result in 4 groups of 18 children with each group receiving one
      of four combinations of intervention: Speech Production Intervention + Articulation Parent
      Group; Speech Production Intervention + Dialogic Reading Parent Group; Speech Perception
      Intervention + Articulation Parent Group; and Speech Perception Intervention + Dialogic
      Reading Parent Group. Assessments will occur pretreatment, after the first treatment block,
      after the second treatment block, and 9 months after the end of the second treatment block.
