      increasing the risk of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Aging is associated with increased
      white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and appears to alter functional connectivity within the
      brain both of which associated with cognitive function (references). Observational studies
      suggest that regular physical activity is associated with improved cognitive function and
      higher cerebral blood flow 1,2. However, it is unknown if aging or exercise training status
      alters the structural and functional biomarkers that are predictive of cognitive decline.
      Thus, the overall goal of this project is to examine the age-related and exercise training
      status-related differences in structural and functional changes in the brain, detected by
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

        1. To determine if white matter hyperintensities on MRI scans of the brain are altered by
           aging and exercise training status.

        2. To determine the interaction of aging and habitual physical activity on functional
           connectivity in the brain.
