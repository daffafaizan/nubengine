      variety of spinal pathologies, but predominantly for degenerative disease which is most
      prevalent in the obese and or older population. These operations can result in relatively
      high post operative surgical pain and necessitate significant post operative opioid
      consumption which can precipitate co-morbid medical conditions such as respiratory depression
      and failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal ileus, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary
      embolism. Additionally, these medical comorbidities also represent an increased burden on
      healthcare expenditure with increased length of hospital stay, inpatient testing and
      treatment, and need for additional follow up.

      The investigators objective is to study the effect of a long term opioid analgesic,
      methadone, in a uniform population undergoing a single level minimally invasive lumbar
      fusion. The preoperative single dose administration of methadone has already been shown to be
      effective in improving post operative pain control in open multi-level spinal fusion patient
      populations and has become the standard of care in most surgical centers across the country.
      The long half-life of methadone results in improved steady state pharmacokinetics relative to
      other traditional opioids and is thought to improve pain control while decreasing
      consumption. In addition to Mu opioid receptor agonism, Methadone is thought to also have
      adjunctive analgesic and anti-tolerance effects due to CNS excitatory glutamatergic NMDA
      receptor antagonism. There are also reports of synergistic effects from serotonin and
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.

      The investigators predict that a single preoperative oral methadone administration can result
      in improved postoperative analgesia with requirement of less IV and PO traditional narcotics
      within the first 2 weeks post operatively and also will not increase co-morbid risks relative
      to traditional shorter acting opioid analgesics that are presently given preoperatively.
