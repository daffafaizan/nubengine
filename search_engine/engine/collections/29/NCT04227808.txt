      multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was approved for advanced or unresectable HCC. In
      this study, investigators aim to evaluate the effects and safety of adjuvant apatinib therapy
      for the patients who underwent curative resection for HCC with high risk of disease
      recurrence.

      Participants who underwent radical resection for HCC with high risk of tumor recurrence will
      be recruited in this study. During 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, each participant will receive
      a screening visit to exclude residual tumors. Each eligible participant will be treated with
      lenvatinib until tumor recurrence, intolerant adverse effect, participant' refusal, or
      completing 12-month treatment.
