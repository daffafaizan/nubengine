      patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patients were stratified into four strata
      according to the side of the lesion and the surgical approach. A set of numbered envelopes
      containing cards indicating the allocated group was prepared for each stratum. When a new
      eligible participant was registered, an envelope was randomly drawn, and the therapist was
      informed of group allocation.

      To ensure consistent intervention, two certified occupational therapists were trained by two
      primary investigators to administer the intervention and control group protocols
      independently. The two trained occupational therapists recorded outcome measurements at the
      baseline and immediately after the intervention. The evaluators were blinded to group
      allocation, and participants were blinded to the study hypotheses.
