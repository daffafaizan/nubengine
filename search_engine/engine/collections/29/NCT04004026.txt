      quality of life. Approximately 40% of patients describe walking problems and 70% of
      individuals in this group are reported to be affected by daily living activities. One of the
      most important causes of loss of function is balance problems. Balance problems, on the other
      hand, result in falls that cause severe injuries. One of the most important goals in the
      rehabilitation of individuals with MS is to increase their performance by minimizing the risk
      of falling in their daily lives. Therefore, determining the performance-based fall risk of
      these patients is important in terms of establishing a rehabilitation program and evaluating
      the treatment results. In this context, researchers have recently reported that assessment of
      backward gait may be an important clinical tool to determine the risk of falling, especially
      in individuals with balance problems. However, it has not been investigated whether backward
      gait is often associated with performance and balance tests in individuals with MS who have
      balance problems. The aim of this study is to determine the validity and reliability of the
      3-meter backwards walk test for evaluating performance-based fall risk in individuals with
      MS.
