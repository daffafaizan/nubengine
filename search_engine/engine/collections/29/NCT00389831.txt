      4 treatment days at which subjects performed a repeated 'Suggested Immobilization Test' (SIT)
      during a 30min pre-dose and a 4 hours post-dose period. During these periods the severity of
      RLS symptoms in the legs was assessed by the subject using a numeric symptom severity scale.

      In addition the leg movements were measured by actigraphy to assess the Periodic Leg Movement
      Index during Wakefulness (PLMWI, PLM per hour). Subjects applied a single dose of treatment
      on each treatment day (placebo nasal spray or rotigotine nasal spray in 3 ascending doses).
