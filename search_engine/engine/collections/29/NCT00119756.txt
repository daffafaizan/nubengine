      conducted with buttock administration. This is a randomized, multicenter, crossover design
      study in evaluating safety and tolerability of paliperidone palmitate in two different
      injection sites. The study hypothesis is that there will be no difference in safety and
      tolerability between buttock injection compared to shoulder injection at any of the three
      different doses of paliperidone palmitate. The patients will receive intramuscular injections
      of paliperidone palmitate in either their buttocks or in their shoulders
