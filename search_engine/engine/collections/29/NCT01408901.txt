      disease (PAD). PAD is expected to be increasingly common as the population survives longer
      with chronic disease. Patients with PAD have greater functional impairment and faster
      functional decline compared to those without PAD. However, currently there are only two FDA
      approved medications for improving functional performance in patients with PAD. Furthermore,
      these FDA approved medications are only modestly beneficial for improving walking performance
      in patients with PAD.

      Preliminary evidence suggests that increasing circulating levels of CD34+ cells with
      granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or other therapies may improve
      walking performance in patients with PAD. However, results of small clinical trials testing
      the ability of GM-CSF to improve walking performance in patients with PAD are mixed. The
      association of GM-CSF with improved walking performance in PAD is not definitively
      established. Preliminary data also suggest that lower extremity ischemia, induced during
      walking exercise, may increase circulating CD34+ cell levels, enhance homing of CD34+ cells
      to ischemic sites, and augment the ability of GMCSF to improve walking performance in PAD.
      However, it is currently unknown whether the combination of GM-CSF and supervised treadmill
      exercise significantly improve functional performance more than either therapy alone.
