      prolonged the duration of rocuronium and reduces the onset time of rocuronium. Magnesium acts
      on motor end plate, where magnesium reduces the release of prejunctional acetylcholine,
      thereby decreasing the muscle membrane excitability. However, the quantitative rocuronium
      saving effect of magnesium is not clear. This study's hypothesis is that magnesium would
      reduce the amount of rocuronium. And the investigators want to evaluate how much magnesium
      can reduce the amount of rocuronium. Secondary outcome is the effects of magnesium on
      recovery time, postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting.
