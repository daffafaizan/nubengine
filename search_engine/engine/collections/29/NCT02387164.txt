      GAD (Diamyd), combined with high dose Vitamin D3, may delay or stop the autoimmune process
      leading to clinical type 1 diabetes (diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association
      criteria) in non-diabetic 4-17.99 year old children with ongoing beta-cell autoimmunity as
      indicated by positive islet autoantibodies.

      The secondary objective is to demonstrate that treatment with Diamyd is safe in children at
      risk for type 1 diabetes.

      The children will be followed for 5 years in the study. Primary endpoint is proportion of
      subjects diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in each treatment arm. Secondary endpoints are 1)
      safety, 2) change in metabolic status from normal to impaired glucose metabolism in the group
      of children with normal glucose metabolism at baseline screening.
