      release is high among incarcerated opiate addicts.

      We attempt to prevent relapse to opiate abuse by two different means:

      Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) versus Naltrexone implants, randomly allocated to two
      groups by sealed envelopes.

      All participants may choose in which group to continue after 6 (and again after 12) months,
      when the implants supposedly stop releasing naltrexone.

      The total treatment period is 18 months, continuation with MMT is optional after study
      termination.
