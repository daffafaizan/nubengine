      benefits in hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) patients, while the interest of
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) remains debated. The primary endpoint was to compare alveolar
      recruitment using global end-expiratory electrical lung impedance (EELI) between HFNC and
      NIV. Secondary endpoints compared regional EELI, lung volumes (global and regional tidal
      volume variation (TV)), respiratory parameters, hemodynamic tolerance, dyspnea and patient
      comfort between HFNC and NIV, relative to face mask (FM).
