    
      This study will be a single-centre, examiner blind, two treatment, parallel group, stratified
      (by baseline number of bleeding sites smoking status and bacterial sampling) randomized
      clinical study. At the screening visit, following provision of written informed consent,
      eligible participants will be provided with a standard toothpaste and toothbrush for brushing
      once in at the clinic and for approximately one week use at home until the baseline visit.
      Participants will be asked to abstain from brushing over a 12 hour period prior to the
      Baseline visit. At the baseline visit an oral soft tissue (OST) assessment, Modified Gingival
      Index (MGI) and Bleeding Index (BI), and then dental plaque assessment will be performed.
      Participants will be stratified according to their baseline number of bleeding sites, smoking
      status and whether selected for bacterial sampling. Participants will be then randomized into
      one of two treatment groups. After using, their assigned treatment twice daily at home for 6
      weeks (visit 3), 12 weeks (visit 4) and 24 weeks (visit 5), participants will return to the
      site with overnight plaque at approximately the same time of day as the Baseline visit if
      possible. Participants will undergo a full OST examination and the recording of any Adverse
      Events (AEs). Participants will then undergo MGI, BI followed by dental plaque assessment.
      Microbiological samples will be collected on a subset of 50 participants (Determined by first
      50 participants randomized).
