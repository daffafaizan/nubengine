        1. To establish a method for identifying the mutations in the EGFR gene in small clinical
           samples from lung cancer patients.

        2. In a retrospective study(n=500) relate survival to the frequency and types of mutations
           in the EGFR gene in a Danish population of patients with advanced, inoperable non small
           cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosed prior to the introduction of treatment directed
           towards EGFR.

        3. In a prospective study (n=300), to identify the mutations in the EGFR gene in patients
           treated with erlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the EGFR. Presence of
           mutations will be related to the expression of other parts of the EGF system, to
           mutations in the gene coding for K-RAS and to treatment response.
