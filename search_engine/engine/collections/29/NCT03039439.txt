      I. To determine the differences in clinical behavior and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarkers
      between parathyroid carcinoma (PC), atypical neoplasm (AN) and parathyroid adenoma (PA).

      II. To determine which potential genes can be used in patients with parathyroid tumors for
      diagnostic purposes.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected tumor tissue and blood samples are analyzed via immunohistochemical
      profiling for identifying potential genes showing molecular aberrations as other types of
      cancer.
