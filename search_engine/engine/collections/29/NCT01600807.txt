    
      This study will be conducted in two parts: a phase I study and a phase II study. In both
      instances, a treatment cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). Subjects will take OSI-906 by mouth, twice
      a day, every day. Subjects will receive gemcitabine through an IV in clinic over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects will take erlotinib by mouth, once a day,
      every day.

      At every visit subjects will have a physical exam and blood tests. An EKG will be done on
      days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of all subsequent cycles. A CT scan will be done
      every 2 cycles (8 weeks).

      Subjects will complete a daily drug diary and perform glucose monitoring (finger stick) once
      daily at home.
