      diuretics influences 90-day clinical outcomes compared to usual care including intravenous
      diuretics in symptomatic heart failure patients with persistent congestion. Hospitalized
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either a tailored, peripheral ultrafiltration
      approach complementary to intravenous low-dose diuretics and other guideline-directed medical
      therapy OR high-dose diuretic therapy and other Guideline-directed medical therapy.
