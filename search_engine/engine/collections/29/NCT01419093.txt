      patient-centered communication skills (Aim 1). When implemented fully, the intervention will
      also include referral to a community fitness program. Clinicians will be randomly assigned to
      two groups (1 and 2). Group 1 will participate in the training intervention first; group 2
      will act as a wait-list control for Group 1. The primary outcome, the effectiveness of the
      intervention on clinician use of the 5As during routine office visits, will be measured by
      examining 371 audio-recorded patient visits prior to, immediately, after, and 6 months after
      the clinician is trained. Secondary outcomes include whether the communication training
      intervention improved patients' perceived competence to adopt physical activity (Aim 2)and
      whether clinicians believe that the communication intervention addressed pertinent barriers
      to promoting exercise (Aim 3). Exploratory outcomes (Aim 4) will [assess potential mediators
      of the intervention's effect, examine the effect of the intervention on actual physical
      activity levels in a subset of participants, and create a taxonomy of communication markers
      for each of the 5As.]
