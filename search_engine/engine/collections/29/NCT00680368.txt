      Index (RSI), a survey tool for medical residents designed to measure quantitatively the level
      of supervision the resident received while caring for an outpatient during a patient care
      encounter.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: This is a prospective trial assessing the Residency Supervision Index
      (Index) applied to outpatient care encounters for test-retest reliability and construct
      validity.

      METHODOLOGY: Trained interviewers administered the Index during face-to-face and in-clinic
      interviews with 60 consenting resident physicians and their 37 consenting attending
      physicians to descsribe the care they provided to 143 patients at the outpatient clinics
      involving 148 clinical encounters at the Loma Linda VA Medical Center.

      For each encounter, data comes from administering the Resident Supervision Index to the
      resident and attending. Baseline data describing each subject (attending physicians and
      resident physicians) came from face-to-face interviews.

      Test-retest reliability is assessed by re-administering the Index to residents for within 24
      hours of the encounter. Concurrent validity is assessed by re-administering the Index to the
      attending physician responsible for the patient's care.

      CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS: The study will help our understanding of how residents at VA medical
      centers receive training and are supervised for the purpose of both education and patient
      outcomes.

      IMPACT/SIGNIFICANCE: The instrument is planned for future studies to assess the association
      between resident supervision and training outcomes, clinical workload, patient outcomes,
      quality of care, and care costs.
