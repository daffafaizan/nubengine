      pneumonia order set. After obtaining consent, subjects will be randomized to the proboiotic
      or placebo group. Subjects will be followed for 21 days after starting the study treatment to
      determine critical outcomes such as incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and C-Diff.
      Other outcomes include length of stay, healthcare costs, and death.
