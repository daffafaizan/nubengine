    
      Randomized, controlled trial with 1:1 randomization (n=50). The control group will receive
      the usual care for TBI through the clinical program with standard providers based on usual
      patient evaluation and needs. The intervention group will receive MBSR in addition to the
      usual care through the TBI program.

      The usual care pathway will include physician visits, rehabilitation therapies (PT/OT/ST/et
      al), and other providers as needed based on recommendations by his or her providers. Some
      variability will exist, but withholding standard of care would be unethical and standardizing
      care would be impossible. However, providers will be asked that medications, et al that could
      affect sleep remain unchanged during the trial period (maximum 12 weeks), which is reasonable
      given that patients have a chronic injury and no emergent/acute needs based on
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Subjects in a control group will be offered complimentary MBSR after 6 month follow up visit
      is completed.
