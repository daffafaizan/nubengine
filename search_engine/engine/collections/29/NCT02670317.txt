    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial in young patients (18-60
      years) with poor-prognosis (age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, aaIPI, 2 or 3) newly
      diagnosed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).

      Patient will receive 6 courses of G-CHOP21 (Obimutizumab- cyclophosphamide,
      hydroxydaunomycin, Oncovin, and prednisone) followed by 2 doses of Obinutuzumab supplemented
      with Ibrutinib. Duration of treatment will be 5 months plus 4-5 weeks for response
      evaluation.

      During the study, disease status will be evaluated after the 4th cycle by computed tomography
      (CT) scan, and after end of treatment by imaging test (18FDG-PET [positron emission
      tomography] and CT scan).

      Patients will be recruited over 2 years and followed for a minimum of 2 years after the end
      of the treatment phase.
