      malignant obstruction of the colon compared to only decompression as first intervention
      regarding postoperative outcomes. We hypothesize that patients with malignant obstruction
      benefit from avoidance of emergency cancer resection, by a two-stage procedure, with
      decompression by a stoma or stent as first intervention, leading to decreased short-term
      morbidity and mortality and improved long-term oncological outcome.
