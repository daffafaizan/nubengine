      stage.The first-line therapy include chemotherapy of targeted therapy .Tarceva now was
      established first-line therapy for advanced lung adenocarcinoma with mutant EGFR
      patients.However,the benefit lasted for about 6-8 months.So we consider to add apatinib,a
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF,to the therapy of these patients.We designed the study to
      find out whether the addition of apatinib to the Tarceva would enhance the efficacy of
      Tarceva.
