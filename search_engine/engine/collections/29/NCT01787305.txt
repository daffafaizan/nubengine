      blood clots. Having a positive antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) test does not mean the person
      has APS; but a small number of people do develop APS. These antibodies can also occur in
      otherwise healthy people. We believe certain bacteria in the gut may cause these antibodies
      to be produced.

      Current treatments in APS target the blood clotting system and the goal is to prevent future
      blood clots. Many patients require this therapy for their entire life. If an persistent
      trigger can be found within the gut microbiota, it may help in developing other treatments.
      This study is being conducted at two centers, Yale University School of Medicine in New
      Haven, CT, and The Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, New York. We expect to enroll a
      total of 40 subjects in this study at these study sites.

      Visits will be as follows:

      Visit 1: Initial screening visit: Review of medical records and questionnaire completion.

      Visit 2 (one month after initial visit) & Visit 3 (2 months after initial visit):
      Questionnaire relating to any changes that may have taken place since recruitment. Brief
      physical examination by the study doctor.

      Overall participation: Over a period of 8 weeks.

      Sample Collection:

      At each study visit, a sample of blood will be obtained (approximately 6.5 tablespoons of
      whole blood) via one needle stick.

      A take-home stool sample collection kit will be provided. Stool samples will be obtained
      within 24 hours before or after blood collection and delivered (or mailed) to a study site. 2
      kits will be provided at the initial visit, 1 kit will be provided at the follow up visit at
      month 1.
