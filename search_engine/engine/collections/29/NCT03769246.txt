      poor posture while sitting and standing. Those who spend prolonged time sitting in poor
      posture often develop muscular imbalances leading to tight chest muscles and weakness in back
      muscles. The Upright system is a device which helps provide a sensory reminder to alert users
      when their posture is poor. The purpose of this study is to determine if patients who use the
      upright posture device demonstrate improved pain control and self perception of posture when
      compared to those given standard ergonomic instruction.
