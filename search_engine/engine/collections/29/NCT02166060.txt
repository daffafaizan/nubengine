      unsatisfactory percentage of biventricular pacing. Patients may loose biventricular pacing
      because of inadequate sinus tachycardia.

      Ivabradine may prevent inadequate sinus tachycardia and improve quality of live of CRT
      recipients.

      According to current guidelines ivabradine is recommended in patients with symptomatic heart
      failure with heart rate at rest >70.

      The hypothesis of this study is that ivabradine may increase percentage of biventricular
      pacing in CRT recipients who have unsatisfactory percentage of biventricular pacing and >50%
      of heart rate in device memory >70.
