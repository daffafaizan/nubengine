      inducing stimuli presenting human interactions (pictures and video sequences). For each
      participant physiological responses (pupil diameter, heart rate, and skin conductance) were
      recorded before, during and after induction.

      Participants were asked to evaluate the intensity and the valence of emotional stimuli.

      In addition, a neurological evaluation, a clinical and cognitive assessment were performed.

      Neurological, clinical and cognitive evaluation - Each participant had a clinical structured
      interview, a neurological evaluation, self-administered assessment (Hospital Anxiety &
      Depression Scale, Emotional Skills Profile, Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale, and
      cognitive assessment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment).

      Physiological assessment - The recording was performed for all participants during the
      presentation of pictures (static stimuli) or videos (dynamic stimuli) selected according to
      their high emotional intensity (positive, neutral and negative valence), representing human
      interactions. For each participant heart rate, electrodermal activity, and pupil diameter
      were recorded during three experimental conditions: rest, induction (presentation of stimuli)
      and after induction (recovery). Participants were asked to evaluate the intensity and valence
      of the pictures and videos using the Self-Assessment Manikin.
