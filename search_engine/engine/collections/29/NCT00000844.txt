      have produced different results, and it is not clear whether the differences were due to the
      interferon alpha products used or to problems in the study design. Therefore, three
      preparations will be compared to evaluate their potential efficacies.

      Patients are randomized to receive 6 months of Alferon LDO alone, Alferon with Veldona,
      Alferon with Ferimmune, or three placebos, with follow-up visits monthly.
