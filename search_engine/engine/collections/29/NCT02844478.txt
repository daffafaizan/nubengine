      (QoL), inflammation, stress, telomere length, and mucosal immune function of Hispanic
      caregivers of persons with ADRD and (2) determine whether a caregiver intervention can
      effectively improve the QoL, inflammation, stress, telomere length, and mucosal immune
      function biomarkers of Hispanic caregivers.

      The proposed study is a non-randomized trial design with three groups of ADRD caregivers that
      vary based on Hispanic ethnicity and English/Spanish language preference. The project's
      specific aims are:

      Specific Aim 1: To compare the quality of life (QoL) (stress, depression, and burden),
      mucosal immunity function (sIgA), stress (sCortisol and sAmylase), inflammation(CRP), and
      telomere length in Spanish-speaking Hispanic, English-speaking Hispanic, and English-speaking
      non-Hispanic caregivers who participate in an evidence-based Stress-Busting Program (SBP) for
      family caregivers of family members living with ADRD. Working hypothesis: At baseline,
      Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers have lower QoL and immune function, higher levels of
      inflammation and stress, and shorter telomeres as compared to Hispanic and non-Hispanic
      English-speaking caregivers.

      Specific Aim 2: To compare the impact of the SBP on QoL and biomarkers for stress, aging,
      inflammation and mucosal immunity among those caregivers completing the SBP (Hispanic
      caregivers completing the culturally adapted translated version to Spanish of SBP and
      Hispanic and non-Hispanic caregivers completing the English-SBP). Working Hypothesis:
      Spanish-speaking Hispanic caregivers completing the Spanish-SBP show more improvement in
      their QoL and biomarkers of stress, mucosal immunity, aging and inflammation
      post-intervention as compared to Hispanic and Non-Hispanic caregivers completing the
      English-SBP. To achieve these aims, the investigators propose to deliver the 9-week English
      SBP and the translated and culturally adapted Spanish-SBP. Saliva and blood samples and self-
      report measures of QoL will be collected at baseline and 9 weeks (end of intervention)
