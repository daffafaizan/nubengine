      nurse-administered intradermal influenza vaccine (Intanza). A blood sample will be taken
      prior to vaccination and 21 days post-vaccination. Participants will record information in a
      memory aid for 7 days including daily temperatures, solicited, unsolicited and general
      reactions. They will be called on study Day 8 to collect this information. Participants will
      return 21-24 days later for follow-up serology and review of adverse events.
