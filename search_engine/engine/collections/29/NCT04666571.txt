    
      The trial design is a multi-centre, blinded, superiority two arm, parallel group design
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) of personalised (TOKA) versus standard high tibial
      osteotomy (HTO).

      The aim of the PASHiOn trial is to establish whether digitally planned personalised HTO
      surgery (TOKA) increases the accuracy of bone correction in comparison to conventional HTO
      surgery. Embedded within the trial is a non-randomised pre-RCT technology check and safety
      assessment of 5 patients (Phase 1), followed by a randomised controlled trial of 88 patients
      (Phase 2).

      During phase 1 of the clinical investigation, 5 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria
      will be recruited and assessed in an identical way to the 88 patients recruited in the main
      trial, but without randomisation. Recruitment of the remaining patients (Phase 2) will take
      place after the six-week assessment on the fifth patient is complete and the oversight
      committee supports progression to Phase 2.

      Patients will be randomised to Phase 2 in a 1:1 ratio and patients will be blinded as to
      which treatment arm they receive.
