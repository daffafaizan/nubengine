    
      the research methodology that will be used

      Induction of fatigue using isometric neck flexor muscle endurance test (NET):

      An isometric neck muscle endurance test (NME test) will be performed for the deep neck
      flexors (Rectus Capitus Anterior, Rectus Capitus Lateralis, Longus Capitus, Longus Colli)
      until exhaustion in all participants occurs. With the subject in hook lying position through
      CHIN RETRACTION AND HEAD ELEVATED FROM THE COUCH.

      All the assessment measurements will be done before and just immediately after performing the
      cervical muscle fatigue then after 15 minutes of fatigue induction(fatigue recovery) A.
      Measurement of neck proprioception using cervical joint position error test via OVERHEAD
      LASER POINTER

      B. Measurement of postural stability using :

        1. Biodex balance system(limit of stability) to measure postural stability

        2. Multi-Directional Reach Test
