      a cytotoxic T cell attack on the marrow stem cell. It is effectively treated in most patients
      with either immunosuppressive treatment (IST) or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT). However, after IST, 'clonal evolution' is a significant complication in
      about 15% of patients, presenting as either a new cytogenetic abnormality or morphological
      evidence of myeloid malignancy. In particular, the development of chromosome 7 abnormalities
      is considered high risk and is associated with poor prognosis. The optimal treatment of
      chromosome 7 abnormalities following SAA is not defined though HSCT is widely offered.
