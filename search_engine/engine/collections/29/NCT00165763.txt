      patients consequent to cerebrovascular disease. Post-mortem studies show that VaD patients
      have a cholinergic deficiency like in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cholinesterase inhibitors are
      now standard treatment for mild to moderate AD. This study aims to determine if donepezil, a
      cholinesterase inhibitor, would benefit patients with VaD by decreasing their scores in the
      VaDAS-cog and improvement in their CIBIC rating over a period of 24-weeks treatment. Adverse
      events will also be monitored.
