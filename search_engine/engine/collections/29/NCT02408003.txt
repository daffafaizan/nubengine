      patients undergoing open aortic valve replacement surgery due to stenosis, the investigators
      want to compare the effect on myocardial relaxation between two commonly used drugs,
      levosimendan and milrinone, using catheter-based measurements in combination with
      echocardiographic evaluation.

      Standard anaesthesia and surgical care for these patients is performed. After surgery is
      completed and the participant is transferred to the intensive care unit, the studies are
      performed during general anaesthesia and the participants still connected to a respirator
      with controlled ventilation.

      Echocardiographic data will be collected simultaneously with hemodynamic parameters - first
      at two control measurements, then after each of two different doses of the drug. Preload,
      afterload and heart rate will be kept stable during this intervention. The echocardiographic
      data is later analyzed offline for strain and strain rate.

      To further investigate the dependency of strain and strain rate on changes in preload,
      afterload, and heart rate, these variables are consecutively changed prior to drug
      administration. For this purpose, all patients first have their baseline data recorded,
      thereafter are paced at two different rates, then preload and afterload is altered by passive
      leg elevation and phenylephrine, respectively. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic data are
      collected simultaneously at baseline and after each intervention. Before administration of
      the drugs, baseline conditions are restored.
