      and in as many as 50% of women with recurrent implantation failure, leading to suggestions
      that correction of such pathology could improve treatment outcome. Hysteroscopy allows visual
      assessment of the cervical canal and uterine cavity and provides the opportunity to operate
      in the same setting. Routine outpatient hysteroscopy before starting IVF has been postulated
      to diagnose and treat abnormalities of the cervix and uterine cavity and hence improve IVF
      outcome.

      A systematic review of published studies suggested that outpatient hysteroscopy in the
      menstrual cycle preceding an IVF treatment cycle could significantly increase the clinical
      pregnancy rate in women who had previously had recurrent implantation failure, even when no
      hysteroscopic abnormality was detected.

      However, the result of the TROPHY study - published in the Lancet in 2016 concluded that
      Outpatient hysteroscopy before IVF in women with a normal ultrasound of the uterine cavity
      and a history of unsuccessful IVF treatment cycles does not improve the livebirth rate and
      they recommended that further research into the effectiveness of surgical correction of
      specific uterine cavity abnormalities before IVF is warranted.

      An MD thesis done in our department on the evaluation of the endometrial cavity in infertile
      patients and prior to IVF recommended that there is an urgent need to RCT to emphasize the
      benefit of removal of the detected intrauterine lesions before proceeding to IVF.
