      Primary

        -  To determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in
           patients with acquired erlotinib hydrochloride- or gefitinib-resistant advanced
           adenocarcinoma of the lung treated with dasatinib.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  To determine the overall response rate in patients with EGFR T790M lung adenocarcinomas
           treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with EGFR
           T790M lung adenocarcinomas treated with this drug.

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of dasatinib in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Beginning 1 week after completion of erlotinib hydrochloride or gefitinib therapy,
      patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Response is assessed by CT scan at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and then every 8 weeks thereafter.
