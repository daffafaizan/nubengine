      Assessment Tool (MOAT), to assist hospital pharmacists identify patients at highest risk of
      preventable medication related problems (MRPs).

      The MOAT will be developed following recommendations of the PROGnosis RESearch Strategy
      (PROGRESS) partnership. A prospective cohort study of 1,500 patients will be used to develop
      the MOAT from the medical wards of two UK hospitals. Data will be collected on prognostic
      factors (selected based on a review of published literature and expert opinion) for each
      patient, together with details of MRPs that occur. All MRPs will be reviewed by an expert
      panel who will grade for severity and preventability using recognised criteria. Multivariable
      logistic regression models will be used to determine the relationship between potential risk
      factors such as polypharmacy, renal impairment, and the use of 'high risk' medicines, and the
      study outcome of preventable medication related problems that are at least moderate in
      severity. Bootstrapping will be used to adjust the MOAT for optimism, and predictive
      performance will be assessed using calibration and discrimination. A simplified scoring
      system will also be developed, which will be assessed for sensitivity and specificity.

      The intention of this research is to develop a prediction-tool (the MOAT), which has the
      potential to be adopted widely into clinical practice. If the initial research is successful
      in producing a prediction-tool with good predictive performance further research will be
      carried out to assess how feasible it would be to use the MOAT in practice, the potential
      efficiency savings, and an assessment of clinical risk to patients through use of the MOAT.
