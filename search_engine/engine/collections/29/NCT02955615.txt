      lymphocytes. In systemic lupus erythematosus, there is a so called "insufficiency" in a
      subpopulation of T lymphocytes, the regulatory T cells (Tregs) leading to altered immune
      balance between regulatory and effector T cells. These cells seem to play a major role in the
      physiopathology of the disease. Many researches enlighten the fact that this Tregs/Teffs
      balance can be restored by administering low dose of IL-2. It is thus assumed that treatment
      with low dose of IL-2 may impact positively the progression of the disease and thus help
      patients improving their clinical outcomes.
