      identify and characterize prostate cancer (PCa) with the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data
      System (PI-RADS) v2. However, there are diagnostic difficulties for suspicious patients with
      PI-RADS score 3 and not all PCa are equivalently visible on mpMRI. For such patients, other
      alternative imaging techniques are required to properly characterize and detect PCa.

      It has been widely reported that 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging offers excellent performance in
      detecting primary PCa and is able to noninvasively characterize the aggressiveness of PCa.
      Recently, integrated PET/MRI, which combines the strengths of both modalities, has been shown
      to have great potential for influencing clinical practice by providing a more certain map of
      localized PCa to aid targeted biopsies and therapy.

      This perspective cohort study aims to assess the detection rate of PCa through prostate
      biopsy within suspicious patients harboring unfavorable mpMRI but favorable 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI
      who have had no prior prostate biopsy.
