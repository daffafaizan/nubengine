      Primary

        -  Determine radiographic objective response rates in patients with locally advanced
           gastrointestinal stromal tumor treated with neoadjuvant imatinib mesylate.

        -  Determine histological response in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine R0-resectability and organ-preserving resectability in these patients after
           treatment with this drug.

        -  Correlate radiographic imaging and metabolic imaging with histological response in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily for 4-6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-3 weeks after completion of imatinib
      mesylate, patients with responding or stable disease undergo surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks, 6 months, and then at
      1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
