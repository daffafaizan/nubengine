      Vilazodone in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are unresponsive to, only
      partially responsive to, or cannot tolerate a trial of the generic SSRI, citalopram (e.g.,
      "partially responsive" means patients who report that their depressive symptoms have improved
      through the use of citalopram but that significant depressive symptoms persist; "cannot
      tolerate" refers to patient report of intolerable side effects that result in a desire to
      discontinue the medication). Seventy-two subjects with major depressive disorder who are
      still symptomatic or report intolerable side effects after a 6-week open-label trial of
      citalopram 20mg/day ( i.e. who are not classified as responders) will be randomized to
      receive a higher maximum dose of citalopram (40mg/day) or switch to vilazodone during the
      randomization phase of the trial for 6 weeks. The hypothesis to be tested is that vilazodone
      will result in greater rates of treatment response and be better tolerated compared to being
      titrated up to a higher maximum dose (40mg/day) of citalopram. The proposed study will
      provide needed data on the efficacy of switching antidepressants when individuals do not
      fully respond to previous treatment or have intolerable side effects with a generic SSRI.
