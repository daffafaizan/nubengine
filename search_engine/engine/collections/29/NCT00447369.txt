      valproate has demonstrated to be effective as monotherapy for migraine prevention in
      placebo-controlled trials. Besides, other new drugs like gabapentin have been used in the
      prevention of migraine with a good level of evidence. The pregabalin is an anticonvulsant
      that has not been proved to use in migraine prevention and it has a similar action mechanisms
      of the gabapentin. The purpose of this study is the comparison of the effect of pregabalin
      and sodium valproate in migraine prevention in a randomized blinded crossover study.
