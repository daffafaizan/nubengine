      twisting, writhing movements and abnormal postures. It is associated with abnormal electrical
      activity in two groups of nerve cells in the brain called the globus pallidus internus (GPi)
      and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). GPi DBS appears to be effective for medication-refractory
      focal and segmental dystonia affecting the cranial and cervical regions in open-label series,
      but recently GPi stimulation has been associated with subtle motor disturbances in previously
      non-dystonic body regions (i.e., arms and legs) in this population of patients. DBS of the
      STN has also been reported to be effective for treating generalized and cervical dystonia in
      small open label trials. STN DBS for cranial and cervical regions may provide similar
      efficacy in the treatment of dystonia as GPi DBS, but without unwanted stimulation-induced
      motor effects. Objectives of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of STN-DBS and
      GPi-DBS for dystonia; Participants will be evaluated pre- and postoperatively with standard
      dystonia rating scales including the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia rating scale (BFMDRS),
      Changes in cognitive function will be assessed with neuropsychological testing. Stimulation
      parameters will be documented, and a patient questionnaire will be administered
      postoperatively to determine if patients are experiencing stimulation-induced motor adverse
      effects. Patient weight will be recorded at study visits. This pilot study will provide
      preliminary open label efficacy outcomes for STN DBS in the treatment of primary dystonia and
      will help determine if this target should be compared to GPi DBS in a larger double-blind
      trial.
