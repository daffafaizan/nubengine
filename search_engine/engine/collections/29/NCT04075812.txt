    
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an insult to the spinal cord resulting in a change, either
      temporary or permanent, in its normal motor, sensory, and/or autonomic function. It is
      estimated that the annual incidence of spinal cord injury (SCI), not including those who die
      at the scene of the accident, is approximately 40 cases per million population in the U. S.
      or approximately 12,000 new cases each year.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate high definition non-invasive neuromuscular
      stimulation of an upper extremity in tetraplegic participants. This study will plan to enroll
      up to 15 subjects who have been diagnosed with tetraplegia. The total duration of the study
      is expected to be about 18 months, and each participant is expected to be on the study for
      about 6 months.

      The study design will consist of the following two (2) phases listed below. I. Baseline
      assessment and calibration (approximately 1 month) II. Testing motions: pre-sequenced and
      EEG-triggered motions; further calibration as needed (approximately 5 months)

      Phase I - Baseline

        -  Medical history review

        -  Physical and neurological exam

        -  EMG

        -  Fit and calibrate external stimulator: The Battelle Neuromuscular Stimulator will be
           setup and calibrated to evoke wrist and hand/finger movements.

      Phase II - Testing Motions After the Neuromuscular Stimulator is setup and calibrated,
      various spatial and temporal stimulation patterns will be tested to evoke wrist/hand
      movements in various sequences of individual and combined movements.
