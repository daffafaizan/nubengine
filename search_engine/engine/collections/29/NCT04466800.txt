      has been responsible for more than 100 000 hospitalizations. Following the acute phase of
      this disease, some patients may have sequelae, such as breathing difficulties or
      malnutrition. However, the prevalence and intensity of those sequelae still remain unknown.
      Thus, a functional and respiratory rehabilitation program associated with personalized
      nutritional care may be necessary to improve those patients' prognosis.

      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a 4-week rehabilitation program following
      the acute phase of COVID. This program includes regular physical activity supervised by a
      physical acticity educator, a systematic malnutrition screening and a nutritional follow-up
      performed by a dietitian. Patients will be randomized in two groups: rehabilitation program
      (intervention group) or usual care (control group). Quality of life, physical performance,
      respiratory capacities and nutritional status will be assessed in both groups at inclusion
      and one month later (corresponding to the end of the rehabilitation program for the
      intervention group).
