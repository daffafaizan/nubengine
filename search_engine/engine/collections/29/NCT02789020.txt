      determine eligibility in the research study. Half of the participants in this study will be
      in a group that will receive the study drug (rasagiline), and half will be in a group that
      will receive a placebo. A placebo is a pill that is made to look like the study drug, but it
      does not contain any active ingredients. A computer algorithm will randomly decide group
      assignment (like the flip of a coin). The study drug will be provided at the end of the first
      visit. The participants will not know which study drug is received, placebo or rasagiline.

      During the research study the following test may occur: (1) questionnaires about quality of
      life and depression; (2) tests to measure strength and motor function; (3) tests to measure
      cognition; (4) orientation session to learn a precision gripping task; (5) functional MRI
      scan of the brain; (6) structural MRI scan of the brain.
