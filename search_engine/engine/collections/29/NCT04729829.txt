      families living in rural, inland Timor-Leste. This trial aims to test and compare the effects
      of two treatments, alone and in combination, on the frequency and volume of household fish
      consumption in upland areas as a proxy for improved dietary diversity and micronutrient
      intake. Treatment 1 is the installation of nearshore, moored fish aggregating devices (FADs)
      to improve catch rates with existing fishing gears. Treatment 2 is social and behaviour
      change (SBC) activities to promote fish consumption. Villages in inland communities will be
      randomized to receive treatment 1, treatment 2, both treatments, or neither treatment. Some
      households with one child under five will be recruited, and data will be collected at
      baseline (prior to the rollout of the treatments) and endline. Our study will determine the
      impact of an improved supply of fish, along with nutrition-oriented SBC activities, on the
      fish purchasing and consumption practices of rural, inland households. Findings from this
      study are urgently needed by small island developing states in order to make policy and
      investment decisions on how best to improve households' diets using locally available,
      nutrient-dense foods such as fish. Investments such as these are needed to break the cycle of
      malnutrition.
