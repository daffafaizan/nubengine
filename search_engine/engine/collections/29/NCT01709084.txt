    
      This is a 48-week, multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), multinational (conducted
      at different countries), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance) study to assess whether tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine/rilpivirine (TDF/FTC/RPV) shows noninferior response rates
      of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) suppression less than
      400 copies per mL, compared with TDF/FTC/efavirenz (TDF/FTC/EFV). The study consists of 3
      phases including, the screening phase (of 6 weeks), treatment phase (of 48 weeks), and follow
      up phase (of 30 to 35 days after the last dose of study medication). During the 48 weeks
      treatment phase, patients currently with HIV-1 RNA suppression less than 50 copies per mL on
      their first-line antiretroviral regimen, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, in 2 groups, ie,
      Group 1 (treatment group) and Group 2 (control group). Both these groups will receive a fixed
      dose combination (FDC) regimen (ie, FDC tablet: one tablet per day) of either TDF/FTC/RPV in
      Group 1 or TDF/FTC/EFV in Group 2. Patients will return for study visits at Week 4, 12, 24,
      36, and 48 during the treatment period, and then every 24 weeks thereafter during the
      extended treatment period until the last patient has his or her Week 48 (or treatment
      discontinuation) visit. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory (central
      and local) tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination will be performed
      throughout the study. The treatment duration for each patient will be expected to be between
      48 and 108 weeks.
