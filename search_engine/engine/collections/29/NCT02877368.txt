        -  to assess the influence of imatinib on sarcopenia patients with advanced or high-risk
           resected gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST)

        -  to compare imatinib-induced toxicities between patients with advanced or high-risk
           resected gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) with pre-treatment sarcopenia and
           patients with advanced or high-risk resected gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST)
           without pre-treatment sarcopenia
