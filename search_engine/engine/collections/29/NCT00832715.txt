      A procedure called EBUS-TBNA has been developed that might allow doctors to get samples of
      lymph glands without performing an operation. The standard practice is a surgical operation
      called a mediastinoscopy. If researchers find out that EBUS-TBNA is as accurate as
      mediastinoscopy, it may mean that patients with lung cancer can avoid having surgery or will
      be able to get treatment before surgery.

      EBUS-TBNA:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will first have an EBUS-TBNA. This will be
      performed on an out-patient basis under general anesthetic. The doctor will examine your
      lungs for suspicious lymph glands with an ultrasound, and then will take a sample of tissue
      from the lymph gland. This will be done using a flexible scope called a bronchoscope that can
      be passed into the windpipe. The lymph glands around the wind pipe can be seen and then
      removed with a small needle. The procedure should take about 1 hour.

      Researchers will then analyze the lymph glands that were removed. Depending on whether or not
      the lymph glands have cancer in them, your doctor will then recommend the most appropriate
      therapy for you. This may include mediastinoscopy or some other appropriate therapy.

      All the data for the study will be stored with a password protected system.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be over after you have completed EBUS-TBNA.

      This is an investigational study. EBUS-TBNA is FDA approved for this procedure.

      Up to 120 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
