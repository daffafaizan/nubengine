    
      The first phase of this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of BCI-838 following
      oral administration of single doses of BCI-838 in healthy male subjects. The pharmacokinetics
      of BCI-838 and its metabolite BCI-632 following single ascending doses of BCI-838 will be
      evaluated, as will the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of BCI-838 and its metabolite
      following single oral doses of BCI-838 in healthy male subjects.

      The second phase of this study will evaluate and compare the relative bioavailability and PK
      of the metabolite BCI-632 following single oral administration of several new pro-drug
      candidates in healthy male subjects.
