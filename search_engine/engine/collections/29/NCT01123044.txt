      Efficacy:

      To determine the efficacy of cultivated corneal epithelial stem cells as a treatment for
      patients with severe ocular surface disorder.

      The corneal limbal epithelial stem cell transplant (CLET) successful outcome will be measured
      by improvement of vision, maintenance of corneal re-epithelisation with absence of recurrence
      of surface disease and subjective improvement of symptoms.
