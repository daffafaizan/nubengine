    
      This is a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-response intervention
      study with vitamin D3. Women will be recruited prior to 18 weeks of gestation and randomised
      to receive placebo, 10 or 20 mcg/d of vitamin D3 from baseline visit in their first trimester
      until delivery. Blood samples will be collected at baseline, midpoint and endpoint of the
      trial, at 10 week intervals, and from the umbilical cord at delivery. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D
      concentration of 30 nmol/L will be used to denote vitamin D deficiency. Information on
      maternal anthropometry, diet, lifestyle, sun exposure, blood pressure, iPTH and serum total
      calcium will also be reported.
