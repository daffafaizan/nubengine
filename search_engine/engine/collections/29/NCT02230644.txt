      physiological. This study proposes to examine three signatures of stress in order to
      triangulate data and achieve a more comprehensive understanding of patients' stress response:

        1. Psychological - we will use validated psychological questionnaires including STAI to
           measure both trait and state anxiety. We will also be using a simple prospective time
           perception test and a Stroop test to assess whether patients' attention capacity.

        2. Physiological - We will use biosensors and bioharnesses to gather electrocardiogram
           (ECG) data in order to test the complexity loss hypothesis. This hypothesis states that
           the physiological responses of organisms under constraints (ageing, illness, stress)
           exhibit grossly reduced dynamics and lose the ability to adopt to the changes in the
           environment. We will examine whether patients exhibit these reduced dynamics as their
           operation approaches and whether the arts can be used to increase the complexity of
           their responses.

        3. Biological - we will take two small saliva (spit) samples from patients to test whether
           levels of stress hormones such as cortisol are elevated in patients, and whether other
           immune biomarkers such as pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 are reduced by
           pre-surgical stress but maintained when music and art are present. Previous research
           within the field of psychoneuroimmunology suggests that alterations in psychological
           stress levels have consequences for biological response (Ader, 2007).
