      total knee arthroplasty at Sandoval Regional Medical Center with administered intraoperative
      tranexamic acid, who do not meet the exclusion criteria. The patients will be examined on
      postoperative day 1. Lower-extremity ultrasound will be used to screen for deep vein
      thrombosis (DVT). Incidence data for DVT will then be compared with the historical incidence
      rate at our institution for total knee arthroplasty without the use of tranexamic acid, which
      is approximately 12%. Patients found on screening to have deep vein thrombosis will be
      referred for appropriate care.
