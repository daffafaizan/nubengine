    
      Twenty-four cancer outpatient clinics at Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto have been
      randomly assigned so that patients attending them will receive either early palliative care
      (referral to the palliative care team) or routine cancer care.

      Patients are recruited from Gastrointestinal, Lung, Genitourinary, Gynecology and Breast
      clinics and are eligible to participate if they have advanced cancer, and have a life
      expectancy of six months to two years.

      Patients and their caregivers who agree to participate are asked to complete questionnaires
      at baseline and every month for 4 months. These questionnaires ask about their quality of
      life, and satisfaction with their medical care. After they have completed the 4-month
      questionnaires, some patients and their caregivers will be interviewed, so that they can
      describe in their own words their quality of life, satisfaction with care, and views about
      palliative care. These interviews will be audiotaped and analyzed to provide additional
      information that cannot be obtained by questionnaires alone.
