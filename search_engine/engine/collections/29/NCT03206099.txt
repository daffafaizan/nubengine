      technologies to help determine genetic contributions to various health conditions. These
      efforts have increased rates of molecular diagnosis for a subset of participants as well as
      uncovered fundamental insights into the cellular and signaling pathways of human biology.

      Despite these successes, analysis and interpretation of genomic data remain a substantial
      challenge. Simply, researchers do not understand the functional and clinical consequences of
      most human genetic variation. This is true across the intramural research program. Making
      progress in this area requires a coordinated, systematic, and transparent approach to
      clinical genomics research.

      This protocol is specific to genetic testing and explicitly aims to both strengthen clinical
      care and enhance research throughout participating programs at the NIH. Probands will provide
      biological specimens for genetic testing and will be required to be enrolled on a primary
      protocol, which will execute the primary clinical and research evaluations. This protocol
      serves as a vehicle for a programmatic effort that includes standardized phenotyping, test
      ordering through the Clinical Research Information System (CRIS), sample collection and
      isolation, nucleic acid analysis, bioinformatics, clinical interpretation, reporting in CRIS,
      genetic counseling, and supporting effective use of genomics as a research tool throughout
      the intramural program. Overall, increased process standardization will support data
      integrity and efficiency while still accommodating the need for investigator flexibility.
