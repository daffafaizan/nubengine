      deaths, hospital days, doctor visits, and overall health care expenditures. In addition,
      heart failure is the most common discharge diagnosis in the elderly. Heart failure can be
      defined as a state in which cardiac output is insufficient to meet metabolic demands. This is
      most frequently manifested by symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea. Inherent in this definition is
      that symptoms may be increased or only occur during times when metabolic demand is increased,
      such as during exercise. As such, exercise intolerance is a hallmark of the heart failure
      syndrome. Exercise intolerance correlates not only with disease severity and also with
      subsequent mortality. Exercise tolerance can be objectively quantified during maximal symptom
      limited standardized exercise protocols by analysis of exercise time, workload, METS
      (metabolic equivalents), and oxygen consumption (V02)' These measures have appropriately
      become accepted as standards for functional assessment in this disorder as well as outcome
      measures following therapeutic interventions in HF. P.A.R.I.S. is a randomized,
      attention-controlled, single-blind trial of supervised aerobic exercise training in older
      patients with heart failure. The primary outcome is exercise capacity and the main secondary
      outcome is quality of life. Mechanistic outcomes were also examined. In PARIS, which focused
      on cardiac mechanisms, there were HFPEF and HFREF patients studied in parallel. In PARIS-II,
      there were only HFPEF patients which focused on vascular mechanisms.

      Main outcomes have been reported (see citations below).
