      the bioavailability of AXL1717 in advanced cancer patients.

      A single, oral dose of AXL1717 is to be administered to patients on each of two occasions
      that are 7-day apart, in random order: after an overnight fast (fasted treatment) and with a
      high-fat or moderate-fat breakfast (fed treatment).
