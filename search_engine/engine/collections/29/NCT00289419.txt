      normal mobilisation and a reduction of the surgical stress response. After total hip
      replacement epidural treatment has proven superior, with regards to pain relief, than
      treatment with parenteral infusions and periphery nerve blocks. Even though epidural
      treatment gives excellent pain relief adverse effect as motor block, urine retention,
      hypotension and itching occurs regularly which delays rehabilitation.

      Treatment with the administration of local anesthetic in the operating field has shown its
      efficiency in reducing postoperative pain with a low incidence of adverse effects after
      various surgical procedures.

      This study compares continuous epidural infusion of ropivacaine added morphine to a new
      technique, where ropivacaine, ketorolac and adrenaline is used to infiltrate the tissue
      around the hip joint during surgery, and is injected by an intraarticular catheter 8 hours
      postoperative.

      Data of pain scores, analgesia consumption, adverse effects and mobilisation is collected for
      the first 4 postoperative days.
