      was being administered) clinical trial to compare the safety and efficacy of topical GV to
      that of oral nystatin suspension. Male and female HIV-1 positive participants â‰¥ 18 years of
      age were randomized (as if by the toss of a coin) with equal probability and stratified by
      CD4+ T-cell counts and the use of antiretroviral therapy at the time of study entry to
      receive either topical GV solution (5 mL swish and gargle for 1 minute and spit two times
      daily) or nystatin oral suspension (5 mL swish for 1 minute and swallow four times daily) for
      14 days. Therapy was considered as failed if participants have no clinical improvement
      (assessed by severity of pseudomembranous candidiasis) during either treatment regimen.
      Evaluation of signs and symptoms of oral candidiasis was done by an evaluator who was blinded
      to the treatment assignment. A total of 494 participants was expected to enroll in the study
      but due to early study closure only 221 enrolled; and participants are expected to be on the
      study for about 13 weeks.
