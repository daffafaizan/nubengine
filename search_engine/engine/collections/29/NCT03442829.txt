      consecutive weeks, and impacts on food preferences and intakes will be assessed at baseline
      (day 0), after 1 week (day 7), and after three weeks (day 21). Preferences for sweet and
      non-sweet foods will be assessed during two taste tests at each assessment time, where six
      different foods will be rated. Sweet and non-sweet food consumption will also be measured at
      two meals at each assessment time - breakfast and lunch. Identical buffet meals composed of
      sweet and non-sweet foods suitable for consumption at breakfast and lunch will be provided
      ad-libitum. Intervention breakfasts will only be consumed on the days between test days.
