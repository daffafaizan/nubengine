      not had the same results. The purpose of the study is to find out if taking calcium and
      vitamin D supplements, while following a low-calorie diet, can help people lose weight.

      We will use special orange juice with less calories than regular orange juice. Half of the
      subjects in this study will drink the study juice (reduced-calorie orange juice) containing
      extra calcium and vitamin D. The other subjects will drink reduced-calorie orange juice
      without any extra calcium or vitamin D in it.

      Comparisons: We will compare subjects who follow the diet and take calcium and vitamin D
      supplements to those who only follow the diet.
