    
      ASPIRED is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, double-blind, parallel group,
      event-driven, pragmatic, registry-based randomized controlled trial that will define the
      value of low dose aspirin (100 mg daily) on cardiovascular events in people with ESKD
      receiving dialysis.

      The study will be conducted using the existing platform of the Chinese peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) Dialysis Registry to screen, recruit and to collect study data as
      part of patient's routine clinical care during dialysis to improve efficiency and to minimize
      cost of a clinical trial.

      ASPIRED is an event driven trial with an anticipated duration of approximately 5 years.

      Randomization will be performed using a web-based system via a pass word protected encrypted
      website interface.

      The study procedure utilizes routine six-monthly clinic visits for study follow-up to
      increase efficiency and minimize the burden on participants.

      The analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principles. An independent Data Safety and
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will established to monitor the study for safety and efficacy.
