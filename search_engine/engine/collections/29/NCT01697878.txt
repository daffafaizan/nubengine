      on the criteria used for making diagnosis, and they are suggested to be at increased risk to
      develop serious perioperative complications, especially during the postoperative period.
      Weight loss might be considered as an appropriate treatment of OSA but in turn it has
      recently been reported that OSA is an independent risk factor for development of
      perioperative complications, importantly oxygen desaturation, in patients undergoing weight
      loss surgery. It seems logical to evaluate if these patients would benefit from
      post-operative CPAP treatment in the PACU. The results of this multidisciplinary study will
      have an impact on PACU treatment of patients with OSA and will further optimize patient care
      at MGH.
