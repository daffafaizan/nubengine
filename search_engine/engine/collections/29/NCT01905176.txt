      interventions, on heart failure (HF) patients' quality of life and on HF outcomes, compared
      to the usual care. The interventions include promotion of self-care practices through
      education and support. HF patients admitted in the public hospitals of the Cyprus Republic
      are screened for eligibility. Consented patients who meet the inclusion criteria are
      recruited before their discharge, and are randomly allocated to one of the four groups of the
      trial. Patients of the three intervention groups receive educational intervention and
      support, before discharge or post-discharge through telephone, or both. Patients of the
      fourth group receive the usual care (control group). The patients' follow up period is 3
      months. The main purpose of the study is to determine whether the combination of predischarge
      education/support and tele-management is more efficient in improving HF outcomes, rather than
      the in-person and telephonic components alone. Outcome measures include quality of life and
      HF events (re-admissions and death) and time to HF event.
