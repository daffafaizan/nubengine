      neutrophils. It can be measured in stools and elevated levels are observed in children with
      inflammatory bowel disease. The protein is stable in stool samples for up to seven days at
      room temperature, which allows collection at home and potential delays in transport to the
      laboratory. S100A12 could be used as a marker to discriminate between pediatric inflammatory
      and functional gastro-intestinal conditions, and prevent children with a low probability of
      inflammation from unnecessary endoscopic procedures. Until now a reliable reference interval
      for healthy children is lacking.

      OBJECTIVE To establish reliable reference intervals for fecal S100A12 in healthy children.

      TIME FRAME Healthy children will be asked to send in one feces sample anonymously during the
      inclusion period. The investigators expect that the required 120 samples will be collected
      before December 2015. There will be no follow up of patients.
