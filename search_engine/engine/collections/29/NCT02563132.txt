      bloating and flatulence) during up to 24 hours after the procedure. So far, it has not been
      studied in inflammatory bowel disease patients who represent specific patient population
      indicated for colonoscopy. They are characterized by younger age, structural changes of the
      colon including intestinal resections and need for repeated and frequently difficult
      procedures.The study was designed to evaluate discomfort during 24 hours after the carbon
      dioxide insufflation colonoscopy in comparison to standard air insufflation colonoscopy.
