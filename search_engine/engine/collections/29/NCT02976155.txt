      the prognosis of these patients. And it has been confirmed that early enteral nutrition
      results in better outcome. However,some epidemiological investigation reported that in most
      intensive care unit, the phenomenon of delayed feeding or under feeding are not uncommon. In
      2007, a study reported that the percentage of early enteral nutrition within 48h is 64%,
      based on mechanical ventilated patients in 208 intensive care unit nationally. Other study
      indicated that the calorie supported by the enteral nutrition only constitute 50% of the
      target calorie. Several studies have showed that the application of a standard enteral
      nutrition protocol could result in an improvement in the delivery of enteral feedings to
      patients. However, there is no such study in China.The goal of this study is to evaluate
      whether a standard enteral nutrition protocol can improve the efficiency in achieving
      nutritional goals and improve prognosis in critically ill patients.
