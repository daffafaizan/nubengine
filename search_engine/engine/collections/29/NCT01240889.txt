      fluticasone, and montelukast to affect the upper airway and systemic physiologic, biologic
      and clinical parameters occurring after an early and late upper airway allergic response to
      ragweed in ragweed allergic rhiniticsThe assessment of early allergy responses in the nose
      has been fairly well established in our laboratory and we will use methods detailed in
      previous publications (21, 23 24). One potential challenge will be to sample upper airway
      mediators and cytokines without affecting clinical parameters such as symptom scores and
      acoustic rhinometry readings. Moreover, we will need to sample at time points throughout six
      or more hours in order to accurately determine the effects on late phase allergic responses.
      Nasal filter paper sampling is a technique that we are currently engaged in using, and we
      will work with Roche to elute the samples and measure multiple mediators and cytokines.
