      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with irinotecan hydrochloride- and
           cisplatin-refractory metastatic esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cancer
           treated with cetuximab, cisplatin, and irinotecan hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the adverse event profiles in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess epidermal growth factor receptor expression in tumor tissue from patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over
      30 minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor biopsy at baseline to evaluate epidermal growth factor receptor by
      immunohistochemistry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.
