        -  Correlative studies performed on biospecimens of human subjects can be used to
           investigate the biology of solid tumors, inform the development of new strategies for
           treating those cancers, and evaluate these new therapeutic approaches. Specific areas of
           interest include, but are not limited to:

        -  the underlying mechanisms of tumor-specific immune response and suppression in cancer
           patients

        -  genetic and molecular profiling of tumors through circulating tumor cell (cTC),
           circulating DNA, and tissue analysis

        -  investigation of potential early diagnostic and prognostic indicators for solid tumors
           such as cTCs and miRNA expression of serum exosomes

        -  identification of mechanisms of drug-related adverse events and correlation with
           clinical parameters

        -  the role of commensal gut microbiota in both the innate and adaptive responses to tumors
           as well as with the use of anticancer agents

      Objectives:

        -  Analyze biospecimens such as tissue, urine, saliva, stool and blood components, which
           include serum, leukocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and circulating
           tumor cells (cTC), of human subjects.

        -  Correlate analysis results with clinical parameters such as demographics, toxicities,
           and treatment outcomes.

        -  Undertake genetic analysis of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples for advanced
           mutational analysis.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients and healthy volunteers whose biospecimens are of interest to NIH investigators.

        -  18 years of age or older.

      Design:

      - Subject cases will be evaluated by NCI or Interventional Radiology, NIH Clinical Center
      personnel. Blood, tissue, urine, saliva or other samples may be collected at the initial
      visit and at follow-up visits.
