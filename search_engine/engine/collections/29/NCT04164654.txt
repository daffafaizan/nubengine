    
      This study is a pilot eight-week randomized controlled intervention. It employs a "waitlist"
      control strategy for the first 4 weeks of the study (considered to be the active study
      period).

      Randomization will be to one of two conditions:

        1. Experimental group: Immediate access to the Nod app

        2. Waitlist control group: Participants will be granted access to the app four weeks after
           the experimental group

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 2, 4, and 8 weeks follow up. Assessments will include
      measures of loneliness, and other mental health and institutional satisfaction measures
      listed in the secondary outcome measures section.
