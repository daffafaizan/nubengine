      order to render it biologically suitable for fibroblast reattachment. however, systematic
      reviews showed no clinical significance when it was used as a root surface conditioner.
      Recently it was found in experimental studies that when citric acid was used on bone surface
      for a brief period, it increased bone formation and improved consolidation of grafted bone to
      bone bed. In this study infrabony defects were treated with citric acid PH 1 and 50%
      concentration for 30 seconds before washing it off and then application of bovine derived
      xenograft was done to fill the defect. BMP-2 marker was evaluated at days 1,3,7,14 and 30 by
      taking a sample using perio-paper from the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and clinical and
      radiographic parameters were taken after 6 months of follow-up
