      Although the chronological aging process is unstoppable, the physical signs of aging,
      particularly characteristics of the skin, may be delayed through a variety of medical
      interventions such as topical medications or resurfacing lasers. It is not currently known
      whether skin carotenoid antioxidant levels correlate with skin aging characteristics,
      although studies with other antioxidants suggest this may be true 3. In addition, while
      selected blood metabolites correlate with changes in age2, we do not know if this correlates
      with skin changes. Our current study focuses on whether differences in skin carotenoid levels
      and blood metabolite levels correlate with skin aging characteristics in age-matched
      subjects. Furthermore, we will explore whether three months consumption with a commercial
      multi-nutrient formulation (LifePak Nano) affects metabolic markers of aging, skin aging
      characteristics including skin elasticity and transepidermal water loss. We will also examine
      whether smokers respond differently from nonsmokers in the above parameters after
      supplementation.
