    
      This is a proof of concept, randomized, controlled prospective pharmacological trial, single
      blind, with two parallel arms.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of repeated locoregional
      anesthetic blocks with bupivacaine in patient's persistent dentoalveolar pain compared to a
      control group receives a simulated anesthesia (local anesthesia with lidocaine).

      The secondary objectives are :

        -  to evaluate the tolerance of repeated locoregional anesthetic blocks to bupivacaine
           patients with persistent dentoalveolar pain compared to control receiving simulated
           anesthesia (local anesthesia with lidocaine).

        -  to evaluate demographic and nosological predictive factors (age of symptoms,
           Quantitative Sensory Testing results) and psychometric (anxiety, depression,
           dramatization) of the effectiveness of anesthetic blocks.

      After signing the informed consent, the patients participate will be randomized to anesthetic
      block treatment with bupivacaine or lidocaine.

      During the 1st step of the study patients will participate at 6 visits (day -7, day 0, day 7,
      day 14, day 21 and M2) and will receive either a series of 4 locoregional anesthetic blocks
      with bupivacaine or a series of 4 local anesthesia with lidocaine ("simulated" control group)
      at day 0, day 7, day 14 and day 21. The main criterion is raised 2 months after the end of
      the series.

      During the 2nd step

        -  The patients from experimental group will be followed until month 6 (2 visits: month 3
           month 6).

        -  The patients from control group :

        -  will received in open (if they want) a series of 4 locoregional anesthetic blocks with
           bupivacaine (day56, day,63, day 70, day 77) and will be followed during 6 months after
           the first injection (7 visits: day 63, day 70, day 77, month 3, month 4, month 5, month
           8)

        -  will be followed until month 6 ((2 visits: month 3 month 6).
