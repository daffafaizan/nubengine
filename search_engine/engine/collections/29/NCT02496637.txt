      in this study. After completing the baseline assessment, eligible participants were randomly
      assigned to one of the three arms. Those in the AAT condition received guided administration
      of AAT over the course of three weekly group sessions, with an additional booster session
      three weeks after completion (week 6). The standard treatment comparison group received four
      similarly timed group sessions of psychoeducational/nutrition information facilitated by a
      registered dietician. A manualized approach to administration of the intervention was created
      based on the AAT treatment and was strictly followed in order to standardize the
      implementation of the prevention groups. The no-treatment control group only participated in
      the assessments.
