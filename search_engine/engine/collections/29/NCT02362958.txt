      positive breast cancer, might benefit from the treatment of trastuzumab. However, there is
      small benefit for some patients having short disease-free survival after adjuvant trastuzumab
      or short progression-free survival after first-line trastuzumab-based therapy. In clinical
      practice, the investigators also found it is fact. And the investigators have a scientific
      rationale for clinical testing of lapatinib plus chemotherapy in patients with
      trastuzumab-refractory, metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.
