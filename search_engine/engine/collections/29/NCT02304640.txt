      contribute to different severities of CRF among Asian breast cancer patients. Through this
      study, the investigators aim to evaluate the prevalence and severity of CRF among Asian
      breast cancer patients, and to identify the biological and clinical determinants of CRF among
      these patients.

      This will be a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, observational study conducted at the
      National Cancer Centre Singapore and KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Informed consent
      will be obtained from participants before the investigators proceed with data collection.

      The study participants will be assessed at relevant time points. Biological determinants and
      symptoms associated with CRF will be assessed. The associations between changes in CRF,
      plasma cytokines levels, serum cortisol levels, and other clinical determinants will be
      elucidated.
