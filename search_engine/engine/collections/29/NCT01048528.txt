      Unfortunately, the cohorts that ultimately will benefit most from the vaccines, those at
      elevated risk for cancer, are likely to be stressed. Chronic stress can impair immune
      function, including immune response to vaccines. An inadequate response to vaccines can
      weaken their protective effect. Women at elevated risk for breast cancer can experience
      significant levels of distress and have associated immune function decrements. Interventions
      to treat distress-related immune decrements among these women are needed because these women
      will be among the first candidates for breast cancer vaccines. In theory, stress-management
      interventions should improve immune function and response to vaccines; however, the findings
      to date are mixed. The proposed investigation will conduct an exploratory randomized clinical
      trial to collect preliminary data on the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral stress management
      (CBSM) group intervention among women who are at elevated risk for breast cancer because of
      family history and who are reporting elevated levels of distress. Study outcomes will include
      antibody and cellular immune response to hepatitis A vaccine and self-reported distress.
