    
      This study is a 1:1 randomized controlled trial with an intervention for 18 months and a
      follow up period of 12 months.

      The study will explore if treatment with recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH) improves
      bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD), and thereby prevents the high risk of fracture
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      Disturbed bone metabolism is related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients
      with CKD. This study also wishes to examine of treatment with recombinant PTH improves
      cardiovascular parameters.
