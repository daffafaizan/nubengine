    
      Objective:

      The objective is to investigate the dose-response effect of nicotine on the top-down and
      bottom-up mechanisms of attention in cigarette smokers.

      Study population:

      Male and nonpregnant-female smokers 18 to 55 years of age.

      Design:

      This study is a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of nicotine or placebo nasal sprays.
      Participants have five visits: a training session and four experimental sessions. Each
      participant receives a test dose of the nasal spray immediately following the training
      session to ascertain tolerability and become familiarized with the effect of the spray. One
      dose (0, 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0 mg) of nicotine nasal spray is administered at the beginning of each
      experimental session followed by the test battery.

      Outcome Measures:

      Outcome measures are vital signs, ratings of mood and drug effect, and performance (accuracy,
      response time) on a test of selective attention.
