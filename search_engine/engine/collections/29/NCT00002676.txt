      dexamethasone) and BVAM (carmustine/vincristine/cytarabine/methotrexate) plus whole-brain
      radiotherapy in patients with primary central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (PCNSL).
      II. Assess the toxic effects associated with this treatment. III. Assess the survival of
      patients with PCNSL receiving this treatment. IV. Investigate the frequency of systemic
      involvement at follow-up. V. Identify factors that appear to be associated with outcome.
