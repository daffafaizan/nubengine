      Determination of the subjects " sodium sensitive ". Sodium sensitive subjects will continue
      the study and non-sodium sensitive subjects will stop the study.

      Wash-out period nÂ°1 (2 weeks at least) pursuit of the dietary instructions.

      Cross over study - Clinical Pharmacology Center :Center (48 subjects)

      All the subjects will realize the 4 visits of the cross over study, and will received Nacl
      and placebo according to the randomisation plan.

      Visit 4 and visit 6 contained the same interventions for the participant (exept the
      consultation with the dietetician) and visit 5 et 7 are the same regarding the interventions
      for the participant.

      First period

      Visit 4 - Day 0 :

        -  Return of the urinary bottle

        -  Collection of adverse events and concomitant treatment

        -  Clinical examination

        -  Blood pressure measure

        -  Arterial compliance (non invasive)

        -  Pregancy test (for women of childbearing age)

        -  Measure of weight and height

        -  Impedancemetry

        -  Blood sample for biological analysis (electrolyte pattern + serum creatinine + Renine +
           Aldosterone + Angiotensin II and MPE assay)

        -  Assay of urinary sodium excretion

        -  Consultation with a dietician.

        -  Delivery of a diet record , and a booklet to be completed every day of the study period

        -  Reminder of the use of the blood pressure measure device

        -  Delivery of the study treatment according to the randomisation plan :

      6.51 g of NaCl per day to distribute on the various meals + 1.5 liters of spring water (poor
      in sodium) to drink each day, Or placebo NaCl every day to distribute on the various meals +
      1.5 liters of spring water (with sodium bicarbonate) to drink each day.

      Every day during 14 days The first take of treatment will be done on the Clinical
      Pharmacology Center

      - Delivery of the urinary bottle for the twenty-four-hour urine analysis before Visit 5

      Visit 5 (Day 14) :

        -  Return of the urinary bottle, of the empty treatment (to check compliance), of the diet
           record and of the booklet

        -  Collection of adverse events and concomitant treatment

        -  Clinical examination

        -  Blood pressure measure

        -  Arterial compliance (non invasive)

        -  Measure of weight

        -  Impedancemetry

        -  Blood sample for biological analysis (electrolyte pattern + serum creatinine + Renine +
           Aldosterone + Angiotensin II and MPE assay)

        -  Assay of urinary sodium excretion

        -  Delivery of the urinary bottle for the twenty-four-hour urine analysis before Visit 6

      Wash-out 2 (at least 2 weeks) pursuit of the dietary instructions.

      Second study period

      Visit 6 (day28) - beginning period 2

      Visite 7 (Day42) - end of period 2 and end of study

      This second period is the same as the first period, except that the subject will not have the
      consultation with the dietetician and will receive the other study treatment according to the
      randomization plan.

      Ancillary Study This trial contains an ancillary study of genotypage (optional with specific
      consent of the subject) with the aim of the confrontation with the phenotyping.

      For that purpose, a blood sample will be made in the period of selection on the subject who
      gives their consent, in the same time of the blood sample for renal biology at visit 1.

      These results would allow to identify biomarkers of blood pressure sensibility at the sodium.
