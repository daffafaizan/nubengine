    
      in 3-7 years old children with high risk of mumps, epidemiological investigation of the serum
      IgG antibody level were conducted, and then a prospective observational cohort was
      established in the population with a history of mumps vaccination, and the incidence of mumps
      in each antibody level group will be observed, the relationship between different antibody
      levels and the incidence after mumps vaccinated were analyzed, to explore attenuation of
      mumps IgG antibody levels in the body,S79 vaccine strain against F genotype mumps' antigenic
      cross-reactivity and the protective effect of antibodies.
