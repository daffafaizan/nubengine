      EMBODY Task) to measure mental states during meditation using pattern recognition or machine
      learning technology. This task is being piloted and validated in 20 meditators and 20 control
      participants, in two waves of pilot testing. Meditators will have practiced meditation for at
      least the 5 years, at least 90 minutes weekly. Control participants will have little to no
      meditation experience and will be age- and gender-matched to each meditator. All participants
      will be MRI-compatible, healthy with no health conditions that affect breathing, have no
      current psychiatric disorder, and not be taking psychotropic medications.

      In the EMBODY Task, participants will be instructed to pay attention to areas of the body,
      their thoughts, sounds in the scanner, and to stop paying attention, in short intervals
      (16-45s). They will also meditate on their breath for 10 minutes. The investigators will
      determine whether pattern recognition technology can distinguish 5 mental states, and whether
      these brain patterns can be used to identify mental states during meditation. The
      investigators hypothesize that all 5 mental states will be distinguished by pattern
      recognition in the meditators, and potentially in the controls. Investigators also
      hypothesize that meditators should pay attention to their breath longer during meditation
      compared to controls.
