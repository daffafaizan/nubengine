    
      1. Both the case and the control of this study shall be a high-functioning group consisting
           of young adults aged 18 to 35 years with ASD and an IQ of 70 or over. A total of 48
           young adults will be recruited and divided into two groups. One will be the case group
           and the other will be the waitlist control group. And the study will be going on 3
           institutions. Again, the case will be divided into two sub-groups of ten and carry out
           this new developed program for both parents and young adult. That is, the program will
           be carried out two times in each of both groups. The waitlist control group will be
           allowed to receive personal outpatient treatment and general therapeutic intervention
           from community while waiting.

        2. Effects of the program will be measured both at the case and the control by using a
           scale which measures social interaction, quality of peer relationship, disposition of
           autism and social anxiety. Equal assessments for both the case and the control will be
           conducted right before the beginning of the program and right after the completion of
           the program and four months after the completion of the program.
