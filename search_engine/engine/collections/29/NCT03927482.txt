      intervention for, and in collaboration with CCS. Phase I will develop and test a smart phone
      application (the "Cares" app) incorporating the text message program with additional features
      and functionality requested by students in the pilot trial (Aim 1.1). After obtaining user
      feedback (Aim 1.2) programming will be completed in both iOS and Android languages. To ensure
      that the College Alcohol Risk Education System (CARES) is well positioned to get into the
      community college marketplace, it is critical to demonstrate efficacy. Phase 2 will conduct
      an efficacy trial of CARES compared to a competing alcohol education program that would be
      feasible for most community colleges to adopt, thus providing a real-world comparison with
      data suitable to support future efforts toward commercialization. This study will also
      identify the types of individuals for whom CARES is more/less effective and identify how it
      might be improved.
