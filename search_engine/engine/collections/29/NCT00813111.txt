      administration of 300 mg of SKY0402 compared with 100 mg of conventional,
      commercially-available bupivacaine HCl (i.e. Marcaine 0.5% with epinephrine) administered
      locally into the implant pocket of each breast for postoperative analgesia in subjects
      undergoing bilateral, cosmetic, sub-muscular, breast augmentation under general anesthesia
      (endotracheal or otherwise). A total of 600 mg of SKY0402 or 200 mg bupivacaine HCl per
      subject is therefore administered. Post-operative assessments were conducted including
      adverse event and serious adverse event monitoring through Day 30.
