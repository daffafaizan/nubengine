      48 hours of age through umbilical artery catheter aspiration or routine venous puncture. The
      samples were spun at 7000 rpm for 3 minutes. Platelet-free plasma was stored at -20Â°C until
      BNP analysis of all collected samples was carried out. The BNP assay was performed using a
      fully automated immunoassay system ADVIA method for the Centaur System (Bayer Diagnostic
      Division).

      In preterm infants who were treated with indomethacin or surgical ligation we collected
      additional blood samples 2-4 hours before intervention and 24 hours after the completion of
      the ductus treatment.
