      Participants who are eligible to take part in this study will be randomly assigned (as in the
      flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups:

        -  Those who are in Group A will take abiraterone acetate, a LHRH analogue, and prednisone.

        -  Those who are in Group B will receive a LHRH analogue alone. Participants will have 2
           out of 3 chances of being placed in Group A or 1 out of 3 chances of being placed in
           Group B.

      Participants in both groups will receive the study drug(s) for about 3 months followed by a
      prostatectomy (prostate surgery) between 2 and 4 weeks after they stop taking the study
      drug(s).

      Length of Study:

      Participants will receive study drugs on this study for about 3 months before having surgery
      to remove their prostate about 2-4 weeks later. Participants will be removed from this study
      if the disease gets worse, if they experience intolerable side effects, or their study
      doctors feel that it is in their best interest to stop the study.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Participants will return to the clinic 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months
      (for up to 8 years) after your surgery for follow-up visits. Up to 66 patients will be take
      part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson after their surgery.
