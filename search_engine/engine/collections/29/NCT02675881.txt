      outcome in patient treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

      A combination of dual switching system and separable clustered electrode has been reported to
      create large ablative zone in preclinical study.

      Based on preclinical study, the investigators conducted a preliminary study in eligible 60
      patients to measure whether this combination (dual switching system and separable clustered
      electrode) improves technical success rate and local tumor progression rate over a year, in
      comparison with historical control group using propensity score matching.
