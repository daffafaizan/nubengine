      (KMC) is a safe and effective method of warming; however, it is not always feasible, and not
      possible in settings such as resuscitation or clinical instability. Electric warmers are the
      standard of care in developed countries, but are extremely costly, complicated with risk of
      causing both hypo and hyperthermia with misuse, and often not feasible in settings without
      stable electricity. Through a multi-institutional collaboration, the investigators have
      developed an electricity-free infant warmer. After laboratory based prototype testing for
      safety and efficacy, the investigators aim to study the supervised use of the warmer under
      routine implementation conditions in a resource-limited setting. The primary aim of Phase 1
      is to determine if the infant warmer is a safe, effective, usable and functional addition to
      KMC. This is planned in a convenience sample of patients in two district hospitals, one in a
      relatively warm environment, and one in a colder setting using quantitative methods and
      observer audits of usability and functionality. After determination of safety and
      effectiveness and making any necessary modifications to the warmer, Phase 2 aims to study the
      warmer in rural health centers and transport, as this is where we ultimately aim to use the
      electricity free devices due to the limited access to functioning and stable electricity in
      these settings. The overall goal of the project is dissemination of the study results, and
      ultimately the infant warmer to the district and national level for key policy makers and
      stakeholders, as well as globally via publication.
