      This is the same dose that is used to treat patient with sickle cell anemia. They will be
      given this medication for a total of 3 months. Their other medications will remain the same.
      At the conclusion of the 3 months, the patients will be taken off of the glutamine and will
      continue their other medications. The investigators will monitor the patients an additional 3
      months (6 months after the initiation of the study) off the L-glutamine. In this manner, the
      investigators will have a washout period. The outcome will be a comparison of the results
      before the initiation of the L-glutamine, to the results after treatment, and after the
      washout.

      Data analysis will consist of comparing the patient's fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c
      values. The investigators will also check the levels of fructosamine. This is a standard test
      that is done in any clinical laboratory. To help determine the mechanism for the L-glutamine
      effect, the investigators will also measure the complete blood count, chemistry panel,
      hepatic function panel, urine micro-albumin, patients' weight, and waist circumference. The
      investigators will use the Student t-test for statistical analysis. Significance will be
      tested at the 0.05 level.

      The investigators will collect demographic information on the patients in the study. Age,
      sex, duration of diabetes, smoking history, and race will be noted. The investigators will
      use regression analysis to determine whether these factors have any effects on the observed
      results.
