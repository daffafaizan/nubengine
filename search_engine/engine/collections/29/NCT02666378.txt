      treatment is heart complications in which the heart muscle is weakened and no longer able to
      pump sufficient amounts of blood throughout the body. This complication can lead to the
      following symptoms: shortness of breath on exertion, swollen ankles and feet, lack of energy
      and a reduced capacity to carry out day-to-day activities.

      This research study is focused on identifying the early signs of such heart complications
      using CMR, which may allow preventative treatment options to be made available in future.
