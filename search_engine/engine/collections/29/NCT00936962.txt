      doses. Most are one (12 mth) dose. High rates of serogroupC disease in 2000 and 2001 prompted
      some provinces to launch universal MenC vaccination programmes in 2002. The goal was to
      provide protection in infancy and early childhood (the time of most risk) with the hope that
      the protection would extend throughout adolescence (the second highest risk). It is unclear
      if early multi-dosing or 1 dose programmes would offer better protection (lack of data). Each
      province in Canada has chosen different Meningococcal C Conjugate vaccine provision schedules
      for the primary vaccinations.

      This study will look at short term protection after the differing provincial series of
      vaccinations has been given and compare those who do not get primary vaccination under 1 year
      of age (NS) with two schedules of primary immunization (BC at 2 and 4 mths and Alberta at 2
      months). A blood sample will be collected at 12-13 mths for this comparison. A booster
      vaccination of the current provincial Men C vaccine will be provided at 12 months. Another
      blood sample will be collected 1 mth later to look at the difference in responses between the
      groups (different provincial primary vaccination schedule). 2 years and 4 years later (at age
      3 and age 5), another blood sample will be collected to look at the difference in long term
      protection of the groups where the primary schedule was different.
