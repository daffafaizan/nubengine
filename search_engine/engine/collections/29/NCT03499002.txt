      standard simulation lab or the ER department to learn the skill of suturing. These students
      will not have any knowledge of suturing prior to this study. Each group will have 15
      students. Each student will be given access to the same suturing learning video. They will
      each attempt 15 sutures on a lab generated skin placed over a volunteer's arm. Each incision
      length will be predetermined and of the same length. The student will have the opportunity to
      re-watch the video in between each suture attempt. The volunteer will record the student's
      number of attempts and whether or not they had to review the video. The idea behind this, is
      that students should began to plateau with their learning after about 8-9 attempts and most
      will no longer require the video beyond that.After the 15 attempts, the student will
      immediately practice 6 sutures on a second skin over the volunteer's arm, again of a
      predetermined incision length. At this point the students will only be allowed to practice
      the suturing skill and will not have access to the learning video. At this point, the
      student's hands will be video recorded to assess the accuracy of the skill.One week after the
      learning session, regardless of the environment they initially learned in, the student will
      be brought to the ER and again allowed to practice 6 sutures on a simulated skin placed over
      a volunteer's arm. The incision will be the same length as the incision in the previous
      practice session. Again, the student's hands will be video recorded while practicing the 6
      sutures.Afterward, the student will be given a questionnaire regarding which environment they
      practiced in and how prepared they felt to practice in the insitu environment without
      learning aids.
