      quantity to racial disparities in smoking status (Aim 1), objective sleep characteristics and
      smoking behavior among blacks and whites who smoke cigarettes (Aim 2), and whether sleep
      restriction modifies craving and withdrawal in racially diverse smokers (Aim 3).
      Specifically, we will utilize self-report questionnaires, objective measures of sleep quality
      and timing (actigraphy) and circadian phase (dim light melatonin onset), as well as
      ecological momentary assessment of cigarette use, smoking urges, cravings, and withdrawal
      symptoms to identify circadian and sleep characteristics that are most strongly associated
      with smoking status, heaviness of smoking and dependence among blacks and whites. Finally, we
      will test whether acute sleep restriction (4 hours of time-in-bed) versus sleep extension (10
      hours of time-in-bed) modifies craving and withdrawal symptoms following cessation in black
      and white smokers. If successful, the results of this study will result in identification of
      circadian dysfunction and insufficient sleep as mechanisms that underlie the association
      between sleep and cigarette smoking behaviors and dependence in diverse populations.
      Moreover, these findings are likely to inform clinicians of the importance of sleep and sleep
      timing on cigarette smoking behaviors and dependence that will help in the development of
      novel interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco use.
