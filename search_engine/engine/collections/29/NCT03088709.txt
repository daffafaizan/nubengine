    
      An open label, single-arm, single-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      feasibility of haplo-SCT as an alternative donor source for patients who lack a matched
      sibling/unrelated donor options. The choice of the chemotherapy treatment for transplantation
      will be up to the investigator. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide will serve as the backbone
      of the immunosuppression treatment to prevent GVHD.

      GVHD Prevention Treatment:

      Cyclophosphamide will be administered IV on Day 3 and Day 5 post transplant.

      Tacrolimus will be administered IV until patient can take it by mouth starting on day of
      transplant and continue approximately 100 days post-transplant.

      Mycophenolate mofetil will be administered IV until patient can take it by mouth starting on
      Day 1 post transplant until 28 days.
