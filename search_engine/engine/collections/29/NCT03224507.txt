      of dexamethasone, lenalidomide (revlimid), daratumumab (Darzalex) and carfilzomib (Kyprolis)
      to treat patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The therapy with KRdD (Kyprolis,
      Revlimid, dexamethasone, Darzalex) will be followed by autologous hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (auto-HCT) and KRdD consolidation. Duration of therapy will be guided by
      eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD). The hypothesis is that the KRdD therapy
      particularly in combination with the auto-HCT will be safe and lead to deep remission.
      Patients who become MRD- will discontinue therapy (no maintenance therapy) and be actively
      monitored for resurgence of MRD or clinical relapse.
