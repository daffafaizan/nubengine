      patients with Brugada syndrome. Since a recent non-randomized pilot study and scarce case
      reports documented potential clinical benefit of epicardial ablation of fragmented
      electrograms in the region of the right ventricular outflow tract, patients in this trial
      will be randomized to continued implanted cardioverter defibrillator therapy (control arm) or
      ablation of areas of fragmented electrograms in the right ventricular outflow tract plus
      continued implanted cardioverter defibrillator therapy (intervention arm). A projected 92
      patients in each group will be studied.
