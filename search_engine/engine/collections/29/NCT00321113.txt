    
      An open, multicentre, randomized, parallel group study to compare in marginal old-for-old
      renal transplant patients the safety and efficacy of two treatments: sequential mycophenolate
      mofetil/delayed tacrolimus plus steroids vs tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil, in
      patients requiring induction with anti-IL2 monoclonal antibody.

      Elderly (≥50 years) low risk patients (PRA grade ≤50%, in the previous 6 months) receiving an
      allograft transplantation of marginal kidney(s) from elderly (>65 years) donors (old-for-old
      allocation) will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms:

      Arm1: Sequential mycophenolate mofetil/tacrolimus/steroids

      Arm2: Tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil/steroid one single dose (perioperatively)
