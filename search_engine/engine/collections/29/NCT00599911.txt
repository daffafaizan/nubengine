      disability and the 4th leading contributor to the global burden of disease. There are unmet
      medical needs in the treatment of depressive disorders in terms of insufficient effectiveness
      and unpleasant side-effects of current therapies. The overall prognosis of the disorder is
      positive for the majority of patients, but as many as 30% of patients will develop a chronic
      and treatment-resistant depression. In the study, patients with depression are treated for 6
      weeks. Assessments of efficacy and safety are taking place every week for the first 4 weeks
      and again after 6 weeks of treatment.
