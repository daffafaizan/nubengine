    
      This study is a randomized double-blind, single-center, phase IV clinical trial. The purpose
      of this study is to compare the immunogenicity and safety of three different immunization
      schedules of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) and/ or combined hepatitis A and B vaccine
      (HABV) in healthy Chinese infants between 18 and 24 months old. The subjects were randomly
      assigned into 3 groups. Subjects in group 1 each received 2 doses of HAV with a 6-month
      interval (at day 0 and month 6); subjects in group 2 each received 1 dose of HAV at day 0 and
      1 dose of HABV at month 6; subjects in group 3 each received 2 doses of HABV with a 6-month
      interval (at day 0 and month 6).
