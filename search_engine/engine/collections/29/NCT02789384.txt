      ultimate proof of its usefulness in the clinic still requires prospective evidence. Our
      prospective study aims to validate the prognosis value of the CINSARC signature in a
      prospective way. Moreover, the neoadjuvant setting is an ideal one to identify molecular
      predictive factors of sensitivity to chemotherapy by correlating tumor response with genetic
      profile of STS. Moreover, molecular profiling of treatment-refractory tumor cells may reveal
      alterations that are associated with drug resistance, metastatic recurrence and disease
      progression. The identifications of such factors in the neoadjuvant setting may help to
      improve the management of STS patients in the adjuvant and metastatic settings
