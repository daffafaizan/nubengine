    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      sorafenib tosylate (sorafenib) or crizotinib in combination with vemurafenib in patients with
      advanced cancers who progressed on standard therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Preliminary assessment of antitumor efficacy of sorafenib or crizotinib combination with
      vemurafenib in patients with advanced cancers.

      II. Preliminary assessment of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sorafenib or crizotinib in
      combination with vemurafenib.

      III. Preliminary assessment of biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vemurafenib and sorafenib tosylate. Patients are
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms by their physician.

      ARM I: Patients receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and sorafenib tosylate PO
      BID on days 1-28.

      ARM II: Patients receive vemurafenib as in Arm I and crizotinib PO once daily (QD) or BID on
      days 1-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
