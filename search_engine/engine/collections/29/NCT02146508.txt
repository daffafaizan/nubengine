    
      Esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) is the precursor lesion of esophageal squamous cell
      cancer. ESD causes no symptoms but can be detected by screening. ESD may harbor various
      grades of dysplasia. Patients with moderate grade or high grade dysplasia (MGD or HGD) have
      up to a 40-fold increased risk of esophageal squamous cell cancer.

      In this study, persons known to have ESD with MGD or HGD on the basis of prior screening will
      be invited to undergo endoscopic treatment with either endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
      and/or radio frequency ablation (RFA) in order to remove or ablate regions of ESD.
      Participants will undergo a series of endoscopies to treat ESD and monitor success of
      treatment.
