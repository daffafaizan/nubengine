      position can effectively control the worsening of OSA see in the postoperative period.

      The study patient will be randomized to semi-sitting position (45 degrees incline) group or
      supine (0 degrees incline) group. Patients will undergo a portable sleep study on the first
      or second postoperative night. They will also be monitored with wristwatch oximeter pre and
      postoperatively according to the study protocol. Patients will be managed according to the
      routine care determined by the health care team. There will be no change in the clinical
      management of patients.
