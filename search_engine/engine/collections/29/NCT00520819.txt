      only include individuals with high cardiovascular risk (men rather than women, smokers rather
      than nonsmokers, middle-aged to elderly rather than young individuals), in order to recruit
      people with presumed high oxidative stress who might be most likely to show an effect and
      benefit from our intervention.

      at the time of inclusion, participants will be randomized to three groups; control group,
      kiwi group or phytochemical group. The kiwi group will consume three kiwis a day, whereas the
      phytochemical group will consume an array of antioxidant-rich food stuffs. The intervention
      period is eight weeks.

      Blood samples will be collected before and after the intervention period.
