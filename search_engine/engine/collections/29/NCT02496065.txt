    
      Subjects diagnosed to have breast cancer for which surgical resection is clinically indicated
      will be enrolled in this study.

      Upon obtaining signed informed consent, subjects will enter a Screening Period for up to 14
      days to determine eligibility. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in the study.

      All subjects entered into the study will be required to arrive at the hospital (or Phase 1
      unit if applicable) for BLZ-100 administration at least 2 hours before their scheduled
      surgical procedure. Following administration of BLZ-100, subjects will be continuously
      monitored for safety and any allergic reaction occurrence for 30 minutes; thereafter,
      subjects will be evaluated for 7 days after drug administration. All subjects will be
      followed for at least 30 days following drug administration to monitor for SAEs.

      Tumor samples will be imaged in situ and ex vivo with the SIRIS imaging system or equivalent
      device, processed, and sent to a central laboratory to be evaluated for ex vivo fluorescence
      using the OdysseyÂ® CLx imaging system.
