      Resonance Imaging for staging and identification of a dominant lesion and will be randomly
      selected for either a single low dose rate permanent seed implant or 2 fractions of high dose
      rate brachytherapy. Using image registration techniques, dominant lesions will be biopsied
      under anesthesia at the start of the brachytherapy procedure. Biopsies will reviewed for
      tumor Gleason score and sent for Cell Cycle Progression testing (Prolaris). Patients
      receiving high dose rate brachytherapy will also have biopsies between the 2 fractions to
      assess tumor changes induced from the first fraction. Post implant quality assurance will
      determine the dose to the dominant lesions and compare these between the 2 types of
      brachytherapy. Post implant symptoms will be tracked for severity and time course.
