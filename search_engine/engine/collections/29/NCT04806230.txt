      creatinine were collected at the first prenatal appointment and at gestational week 15, 20,
      25, 35 and at partus. The time interval between drug intake and sampling was registered in
      all cases. At partus, a serum samples from the umbilical cord was collected drug
      concentration was assessed. At the first prenatal appointment a blood sample for analyzing
      the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype was also collected. All drug concentration analysis were
      executed post hoc, after last partus, whereas physiological parameters were part of normal
      routine sampling. Concomitant medication, weight changes and smoking habits were registered
      throughout the pregnancies.

      Our main findings were that dose corrected serum concentrations of neither sertralin nor
      citalopram changed during the pregnancy. In addition, concentrations of escitalopram and
      venlafaxine and their metabolites appeared to be stable throughout pregnancy, even though a
      linear mixed models statistic calculation could not be done due small number of samples.

      Results from previous research on sertraline PK during pregnancy are inconclusive. Two
      studies suggested decreased levels (Freeman, Sit 2), while one study indicated increased
      levels (Westin). Previous studies, except for Westin's are, however, limited by small sample
      sizes (six and eight) and a substantial inter-individual variance.
