      combination with thalidomide. Since it is not known at this time which treatment is the best,
      you will be placed by chance in one of the two groups.

      Treatment consists of three cycles of combination chemotherapy, each over four days. Three
      drugs, Cytoxan, etoposide, and cisplatin will be given into the vein as a continuous four-day
      infusion. Decadron will be given by mouth over four days. G-CSF will also be given daily as a
      shot under the skin to help bone marrow recover.

      After 3 cycles of combination chemotherapy, your myeloma will be reassessed. If myeloma is
      stable or responding, patients will receive an additional 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Then
      myeloma will again be reassessed and if again found to be stable or responding,3 final cycles
      of chemotherapy will be given.

      Following the completion of chemotherapy, or sooner if your physician feels that the
      chemotherapy side effects are to great, patients will receive maintenance therapy with
      dexamethasone. Patients originally assigned to receive thalidomide, will continue to take
      thalidomide daily throughout protocol treatment.

      The major reason for conducting this research is to gather biologic information from patients
      who have myeloma. Information gained from such research may contribute to a greater
      understanding of the reasons for treatment failure and may assist in the selection of
      appropriate treatment for individual patients.
