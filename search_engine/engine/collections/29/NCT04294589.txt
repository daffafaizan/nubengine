      perform the blood count (NFS), using the method in place in the laboratory, adapted from the
      method initially described by Gavillet et al. The analyses will be carried out on a Fortessa
      LSR cytometer (Becton Dickinson), the antibodies used are specific to NET components:
      citrullinated H3 anti-histone in indirect labelling coupled APC, PE myeloperoxidase and
      Hoescht 34580 as DNA marker. The level will be measured in NETs/ÂµL of whole blood as a
      function of the white blood cell count (Sysmex XN-3000). In parallel, other parameters
      associated with ETV risk will be evaluated: NFS on Sysmex-XN PLC, D-dimers, FVIII and MP. The
      assays of PM, D-dimers and FVIII will be performed specifically as part of the project, the
      other parameters will be measured as part of routine patient management and will not result
      in any additional constraints or costs. Biomarker assays will be performed at the time of
      cancer diagnosis on the EDTA and citrate tubes collected for NFS and TP/TCA respectively as
      part of routine care.
