      on-going routine medical care, it is likely that such education is delivered with different
      details and intensity. Motivating a patient with diabetes to become involved in his or her
      care is of primary importance in achieving better systemic control.

      Ocular complications from diabetes remain the most common cause of blindness among American
      adults 20-74 years of age. A recent survey reported that loss of vision is the most feared of
      all diabetic complications. Thus, it is possible that an educational intervention at an
      ophthalmology office may have additional impact beyond the current standard of diabetes
      education at a primary care or diabetologist/endocrinologist office alone. This study will
      determine whether diabetes education in the ophthalmology office (which includes same-visit
      feedback of HbA1c levels, combined with standardized education regarding same-visit blood
      pressure, retinopathy status and overall diabetes education) can improve subsequent HbA1c as
      compared with current standard care in an ophthalmology office.

      Materials used in this research setting must be applicable for use in ophthalmology
      practices. Therefore, the materials and procedures for this study have been developed with
      the goal of easy translation to this audience.
