    
      The study is a multicenter, open label Phase I trial. Phase 1, dose-escalation : This study
      uses a 3+3 design to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      There will be 3 escalating dose levels in the trial (0.5 μCi/kg, 1 μCi/kg, and 1.5 μCi/kg).
      Each dose can be administered in up to 3-8 cycles providing that the total dose received per
      patient does not exceed 4.5 μCi/kg.

      De-escalation (decrease dose level to 0.25 μCi/kg) is planned if at the first dose level of
      0.5 μCi/kg, after expanding the cohort to a maximum of 6 patients, ≥2 patient have DLTs. At
      the dose level of 0.25 μCi/kg, if eligible to continue receiving additional doses of the
      study drug, patients will receive up to 8 doses in total, with the total administered
      activity being 2 μCi/kg.

      The starting dose level will be 0.5 μCi/kg of 225Ac-Lintuzumab administered on day 1 of each
      cycle. If this dose level is safe, the second dose level of 1 μCi/kg will be explored. If the
      starting dose level results in DLTs in ≥2 patients, the dose level of 0.25 μCi/kg will be
      explored.

      Subjects will receive the investigational drug as a single infusion at the prescribed dose
      level.

      Intra cohort dose escalation/ decrease is not allowed.

      Minimum three to maximum six patients will be treated at each dose level, and dose escalation
      will proceed as follows:

        1. Rules for dose escalation are:

             1. If 0 of 3 patients have a DLT, escalate to the next dose level (Unless enrolling
                patients at the 0.25 µCi/kg dose level)

             2. If 1 of 3 patients has a DLT, expand the cohort to 6 patients

             3. If ≤1 of 6 patients has a DLT, escalate to the next dose level (Unless enrolling
                patients at the 0.25 µCi/kg dose level)

             4. If ≥2 of 3 or ≥2 of 6 patients have a DLT, then the previous dose is the MTD
                (Unless enrolling patients at the 0.25 µCi/kg level, in which case the trial is
                terminated)

             5. Three patients will start at the 0.50 uCi/kg dose. The next dose level will be 1.0
                µCi/kg and the final dose level will be 1.5 µCi/kg. Dose de-escalation to 0.25
                µCi/kg will occur if, at the 0.5 µCi/kg dose, there are ≥2 of 3 or ≥2 of 6 patients
                with a DLT.

        2. If a patient has not progressed nor had CR by the end of a cycle, the patient can
           continue treatment for a maximum of three (1.5 µCi/kg), four (1.0 µCi/kg), or eight
           cycles (0.25 µCi/kg and 0.50 µCi/kg).

      All patients may receive GCSF support starting on Day 9 if clinically indicated and
      continuing until ANC>1,000.

      After the dose escalation portion is completed, treat 3 additional patients at the highest
      established dose level to confirm MTD and establish that dose level as MTD.
