      replace the blood volume removed with either healthy donor RBCs and/or colloid/crystalloid
      solutions. Depending on the RF used, the procedure can be considered an RBC Exchange or RBC
      Depletion/Exchange procedure. The RBC Depletion/Exchange procedure is a modification of the
      RBC Exchange procedure. The AMICUS RBCx protocol provides the ability to use various RFs
      including healthy donor RBCs or a combination of fluids, such as saline followed by RBCs. In
      RBC Exchange and the exchange portion of the RBC Depletion/Exchange procedures, RBC units are
      used as the RF, while colloid and/or crystalloid solutions are used as the RF in the
      depletion portion of the RBC Depletion/Exchange procedures. A new operating protocol on the
      AMICUS Separator that enables the device to perform Red Blood Cell Exchange (RBCx) procedures
      in accordance with the replacement fluid(s) (RF) prescribed by a physician for patients with
      sickle cell disease
