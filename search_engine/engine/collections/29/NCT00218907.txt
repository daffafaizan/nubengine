      C&T because of their unique opportunity to identify HIV positive patients. These underserved
      communities often use the ED for their regular health care specifically because it provides
      services outside of the usual weekday working hours. However, there are significant barriers
      to HIV C&T in the ED, such as the lack of resources to provide prevention oriented messages,
      cost issues, and the feasibility of providing the required manpower for testing. The
      objective of this study is to determine whether an educational video, with the required
      pre-test counseling elements, conveys the necessary information for inner city ED patients to
      consent to a standard Elisa HIV test.

      In order to address the HIV testing needs of the patient population presenting to the ED,
      innovative methods must be developed to provide HIV C&T, while simultaneously removing the
      barriers to testing. Video technology may provide an opportunity to make HIV counseling
      feasible when counselors are not available.
