      a prolonged healing process with variable outcome. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that
      low molecular weight heparin had no effect on preventing DVT after Achilles tendon surgery.
      Whether intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) can prevent DVTs and improve healing after
      Achilles tendon rupture has to our knowledge not been tested before.
