      during mechanical ventilation, and cause difficulties in ventilator weaning.
      Electroacupuncture was indicated to promote activities of diaphragm and improve diaphragmatic
      function. Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy of electroacupuncture in assisting ventilator
      weaning in patients with severe stroke. Sixties eligible patients will be randomly assigned
      to receive electroacupuncture or sham electroacupuncture treatment one session per day until
      the success of ventilator weaning (up to 21 days). The primay outcome is the ventilation
      duration within 21 days after enrollment.
