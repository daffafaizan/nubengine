    
      This Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized study evaluates the PK, safety, and tolerability of
      a single concurrent IV infusion of ETX2514SUL in participants with various degrees of RI, in
      participants with ESRD who are on HD, and in healthy matched control participants with normal
      renal function.

      Participants will be enrolled into five cohorts, according to renal function status, and will
      receive an IV infusion of ETX2514SUL (single dose of up to 1000 milligrams [mg] ETX2514 and
      1000 mg sulbactam given by concurrent 3-hour IV infusion). Participants in Cohort 5 will
      receive the ETX2514SUL infusion both post-HD (Period 1) and pre-HD (Period 2).
