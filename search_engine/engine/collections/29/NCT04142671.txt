      disease affects movement function, particularly walking/gait which is an important activity
      of daily living. It is believed that increased joint loading measured by the moments acting
      upon the joints, contributes to the degeneration of joint cartilage in Alkaptonuria,
      particularly in the weight bearing joints such as the knee and hips, resulting in accelerated
      progression of painful symptoms. Currently there is no cure for Alkaptonuria and the current
      management includes joint replacement surgery. Gait modification strategy interventions could
      be a non-invasive alternative which could delay the time to surgical interventions by
      reducing or altering joint loading and stalling the progression of disease.

      The aims of this study are 1) to determine if individualised gait modification strategies can
      be used to reduce the 3D knee joint loading, 2) to determine if the gait modifications can be
      retained without feedback during over ground walking and 3) to determine the individualised
      gait modification strategies adopted by AKU patients.

      Gait data will be measured and quantified using the non-invasive typical clinical gait
      analysis set up, using 3D motion capture combined with force data whereby joint angles,
      moments and powers can be calculated in all 3 planes of motion during treadmill walking. The
      intervention will involve real-time biofeedback using Motek's M-Gait treadmill. Due to the
      heterogeneity of the sample, each AKU patient will act as their own control. Gait data will
      be compared pre- and post-intervention and a validated pain score will be used to identify
      any patterns with knee pain and adopted gait modifications.
