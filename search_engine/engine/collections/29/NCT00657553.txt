      the risk for serious relapse is very high. The drug Bortezomib has been highly effective for
      treatment of the disease in an advanced stage such as post-transplant relapse. Due to the
      need of maintenance therapies, it is necessary to look to certain drugs that may prolong
      remission and increase the quality of life. Bortezomib, when taken at the beginning of
      remission, may prove to be a beneficial maintenance drug for the management of multiple
      myeloma.
