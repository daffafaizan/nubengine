      (at both doses of 5 mg and 10 mg/day) compared to placebo treatment for 12-week Treatment
      Period followed by a 4-week Withdrawal Period in patients with chronic idiopathic
      constipation. During Withdrawal Period a sub-group of patients in elobixibat 5 mg and 10 mg
      treatment arms respectively received placebo treatment, while rest of the patients continued
      with 5 mg and 10 mg treatment in respective groups. In placebo groups, patients received
      elobixibat 10 mg treatment during Withdrawal Period. Patients were followed-up for 2 weeks
      after end of the Withdrawal Period.

      The assessment of primary and key secondary end points was done for patients who completed
      the first 12 weeks of treatment period. Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) were reported till
      2 weeks after end of the Withdrawal Period.

      The trial was early terminated due to a distribution issue with the trial medication.
