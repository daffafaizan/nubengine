    
      This is an observational pilot study to enhance understanding of the pathophysiology and
      epidemiology associated with effects of AKI in premature infants and the role that neonatal
      AKI plays in future development of CKD. In eligible preterm infants, blood and urine samples
      will be collected at pre-specified time points during hospitalization and at outpatient
      follow-up appointments at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years of age and stored in the
      biorepository. Blood pressure will be measured and recorded at NICU discharge and at all
      follow-up visits. A renal ultrasound will be performed to monitor renal growth at 2 and 5
      years of age. All data will be entered into a comprehensive clinical database, including
      laboratory results.
