      ("FOSPHENYLOINE") with large contra-indications. In this case the physician is not able to
      know the past medical history of the patient, the biological examinations and so he can not
      decide which molecules he can use.

      The levetiracetam is a knowledge medication in the epilepsy since more than twenty years. One
      of specificity of the levetiracetam is to be able to be used in all situations (no clinical
      or biological contre-indication). This molecule seems like to be very interesting to be used
      in prehospital system.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the association levetiracetam / clonazepam in first
      line in the prehospital treatment of the status epilepticus
