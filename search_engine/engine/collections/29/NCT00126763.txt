      in opioid-tolerant patients with moderate to severe non-malignant chronic pain currently
      taking an around-the-clock opioid. Patients will discontinue their current opioid regimen and
      begin using ZR-02-01 as soon as possible under the direction of the physician investigator
      upon entry into the study. Patient's dose of ZR 02 01 will be determined by the investigator
      using sponsor-provided conversion. Pain therapy will be under the supervision of the
      physician investigator.
