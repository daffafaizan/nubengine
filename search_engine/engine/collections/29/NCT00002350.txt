      non-infectious HIV genes into a patient's muscle, along with agents that promote uptake of
      the genes into host cells. Host cells that have taken up these genes then produce viral
      proteins in a form that elicits immune responses in the form of antibodies, killer T-cells,
      and helper T-cells. The safety of this new vaccine approach needs to be assessed.

      PER 2/27/96 AMENDMENT: The Biojector 2000 provides an option for delivering the vaccine
      without a needle and employs a single-use syringe to avoid cross-contamination.

      Patients are given intramuscular injections of APL 400-003 at one of three doses (30, 100, or
      300 mcg) on day 0 and again at weeks 10 and 20, and followed for 16 weeks after the final
      dose. An 8-week period prior to initial dosing is required for immortalizing the patient's
      PBMCs.

      PER 2/27/96 AMENDMENT: Five patients will be evaluated at the 300 mcg dose with the Biojector
      2000.
