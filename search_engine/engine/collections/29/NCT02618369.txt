    
      The objective of this study is to determine if MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound
      (MR-HIFU) is safe and effective technique for alleviating the pain associated with osteoid
      osteoma and other benign bone tumors in paediatric patients and adults(up to age 40 yrs).
      This technique meant to be an alternative to the standard-of-care, radiofrequency and
      laser-based percutaneous ablation. Safety of the technique will be assessed through
      evaluating non-targeted heating using MRI based temperature mapping. and inspecting patients
      post treatment for skin burns or other signs of serious adverse events. Efficacy of the
      technique will be assessed by evaluating/recording patients observed pain, quality of life,
      and pain medication usage both before and up to 6 months following treatment.
