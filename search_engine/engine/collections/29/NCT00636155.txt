      be different manifestations of the same disease. Treatment options for CLL/SLL range from a
      watch and wait approach to bone marrow transplant. Currently there is no consensus on the
      best treatment regimen and new approaches to treatment are needed.

      EL625 is a 20-mer antisense molecule which binds to a coding region of exon 10 in p53 RNA
      transcripts. It can bind to both mutant and wild type p53. p53 is involved in regulating
      apoptosis and DNA repair in cells. When genetic damage occurs p53 is upregulated. As the
      expression of p53 increases in normal cells they are more likely to undergo apoptosis rather
      than cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. However in malignant cells, for a given level of DNA
      damage they are more likely to undergo cell cycle arrest and repair rather than apoptosis.
      Because EL625 is theorized to increase response to chemotherapy, we propose adding EL625 to a
      combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab.
