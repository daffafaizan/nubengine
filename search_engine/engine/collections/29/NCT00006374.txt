      cancer treated with topotecan and paclitaxel versus etoposide and cisplatin. II. Compare time
      to response, response duration, time to progression, and survival in these patients treated
      with these regimens. III. Determine the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these
      patients. IV. Compare the effects of these regimens on symptoms of disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender, ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), and elevated LDH (absent vs
      present). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Patients
      also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood
      counts recover. Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours on day 1 and etoposide IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
