      burden of disease. Although the efficacy and the effectiveness of psychological treatments
      for depressive disorders have been demonstrated, there remains the problem of maintaining the
      benefits achieved during the initial treatment phase. Therefore options of follow-up care
      have to be considered. Since access to psychotherapeutic treatments is limited and costly,
      internet-based interventions can offer a feasible opportunity for follow-up care in order to
      enhance the long-term effectiveness of psychotherapy.
