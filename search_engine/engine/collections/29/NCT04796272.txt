      (MS), regardless of the type of MS and level of disability. Despite the clinical importance
      of MS-related fatigue, pharmacological treatments remain quite ineffective in preventing or
      treating chronic fatigue.

      Recently, physical activity has proven to be an effective therapy with benefits on chronic
      fatigue as well as on different functions (muscular, cardiorespiratory, cognitive, etc.).
      Nevertheless, the effects of physical exercise may vary between MS patients, as MS is a
      heterogeneous disease and does not affect each individual in the same way. The objective of
      this project will be to characterise the benefits of an exercise programme adapted to each
      individual's abilities compared to a traditional exercise programme with the aim of reducing
      perceived fatigue and improving the quality of life of Patients with multiple sclerosis.
