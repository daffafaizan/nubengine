      vestibular stimulation on gait pattern by using spring gravity bar , when you bounce up and
      down it stimulate vestibular system that is considered straight line vestibular stimulation
      and strength extensor muscle of lower limb by pressure on spring during stance phase all that
      change gait stability and stride length so can improve gait pattern .
