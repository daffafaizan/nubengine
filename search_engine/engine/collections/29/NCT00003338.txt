      monoclonal antibody (LymphoScan) in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after
      chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. II. Describe human antimouse antibody production in these
      patients. III. Demonstrate that addition of a single LymphoScan study to conventional
      diagnostic modalities (CDMs) can differentiate between tumor and residual scarring. IV.
      Determine the diagnostic operating characteristics of LymphoScan to detect residual tumor in
      patients with radiologically detectable masses. V. Compare patient management plans based on
      CDMs alone and both CDMs and LymphoScan.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive an infusion of technetium
      Tc 99m LL2 monoclonal antibody (LymphoScan) by IV injection or infused over 20-30 minutes
      after completion of therapy as part of the response evaluation procedures. Planar images are
      acquired between 4-8 hours and 18-24 hours following antibody injection, and single photon
      emission computerized tomography (SPECT) imaging is performed between 4-8 hours following
      antibody injection. Patients may receive a repeat injection of LymphoScan. Patients are
      followed for 3 to 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 60 patients accrued into this study.
