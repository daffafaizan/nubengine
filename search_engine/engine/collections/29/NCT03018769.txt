      artery disease (CAD) which includes patients with chronic stable angina, oldmyocardial
      infarctions and also stable condition after revascularization (i.e percutaneous coronary
      intervention （PCI）, coronary artery bypass graft （CABG）). According to 2012 American Heart
      Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guide, the objective of the treatment
      for SCAD is to maintain or recover patients' exercise tolerance, quality of life and avoid
      complication like heart failure，so as to decrease mortality, eliminate symptoms and avoid
      adverse reactions.

      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has two thousand years of history in managing CAD and has
      its advantages in improving quality of life. Using scientific method to evaluate, demonstrate
      and conclude the clinical curative effect of TCM is an extremely important task for both TCM
      and Chinese and western integrative medicine win the treatment of CAD. Recent researches
      mainly focus on certain types or some certain pathological and physiological stages of CAD,
      worse still, different areas experts have their own experiences and opinions with the
      treatment. There is a lack of unified syndrome differentiation and prescriptions plan for the
      chronic stable CAD and not enough attention has been paid to TCM despite it having many
      advantages in improving quality of life in these patients. Considering all the above, this
      research studied past syndromes research results and real clinical effective chronic SCAD
      cases. Cases were analysed and explored, effective cases were filtered, syndrome
      differentiation of the prescriptions was refined, thus build a TCM diagnosis and treatment
      information database.
