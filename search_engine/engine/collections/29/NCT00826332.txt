      catheter through the uterine cervix. It is now recognized that this step should be done
      carefully and that it affects success rates. The embyos should be carefully deposited in the
      cavity. special care should be given to avoid touching the uterine fundus during the
      procedure. In recent years, sonographic guidance appears to increase success rates.
