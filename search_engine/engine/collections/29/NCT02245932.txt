      physical and cognitive function, which is reflected in altered body composition. current
      studies in healthy subjects suggest that resveratrol improves metabolic health by enhancing
      muscle mitochondrial function and adipose tissue morphology.

      Study design: Proof-of-concept randomized placebo-controlled double blinded clinical trial of
      4 weeks.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Subjects may be confronted with certain inconveniences and risks. Subjects will
      be asked to wear an accelerometer two times for one week. During the entire study period
      subjects will visit the MUMC+ 2 times for various non-invasive measurements (questionnaires,
      anthropometry, and physical function test) as well as some minor invasive procedures (venous
      blood sampling and muscle and fat biopsies) which can cause a local haematoma afterwards.
      However, the patients will be informed about their metabolic and cardiovascular health, which
      we expect to be positively affected by the intervention. In addition, all patients will
      receive a lifestyle advice tailored to their health status.
