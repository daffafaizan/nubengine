      bony mallet finger in 29 patients who presented to investigators' clinic between 2013 and
      2015. Patients were randomly assigned to conservative or surgical treatment groups. Patients
      in the conservative group were followed with immobilization with aluminum splint and physical
      therapy. Patients in the surgical group were treated with investigators' new surgical suture
      anchor technique and then received physical therapy. The patients were followed for 12
      months. Primary study outcomes were extension deficit, days to return to work and DIP
      flexion.
