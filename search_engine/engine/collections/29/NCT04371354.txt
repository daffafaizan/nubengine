      operation of health facilities. During the Covid-19 outbreak most of the scheduled
      endoscopies were cancelled and only emergent and urgent endoscopies were performed in the
      unit. This meant that for six weeks, around 98% of our daily workload was cancelled. During
      that time the investigators have developed a protocol in order to resume scheduled endoscopic
      activity in the decreasing phase of the pandemic.

      The hypothesis of this prospective observational study is that implementation of a protocol
      based upon Covid PCR tests and clinical triage is useful to categorize two types of Covid-19
      infection risk and two levels of personal protection equipments required.

      The primary aim is to evaluate the outcomes of implementing a protective protocol with two
      levels of protection for Covid-19 in the endoscopy unit. As secondary aims, the
      investigators, want to evaluate the endoscopy unit staff and patients infection rate after
      implementation of the protective protocol; and the utility of previous Covid PCR testing and
      on day clinical triage to discriminate patients before endoscopy.

      A brief daily questionnaire will be filled by all the endoscopy unit staff members
      questioning about type of procedures performed in their allocated endoscopy room, level of
      protection used and PCR status of their attended patients. Patients will be followed up for a
      period of two weeks to discard development of Covid-19 disease with possible origin in their
      visit to the endoscopy unit.
