      participate in the study. The participants will receive conventional routine oestrogen
      replacement in the form of transdermal patch. The participants will be reviewed every 2
      months for a total of 8 months to document uterine, breast and bone assessment. This will be
      completed using a variety of tools. After 4 months, the participants will receive an
      incremental increase in oestrogen dose.
