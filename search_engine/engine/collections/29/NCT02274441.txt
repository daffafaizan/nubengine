    
      Objectives :

        -  To measure the incidence of the potentially life-threatening gynaecological emergencies
           (G-PLE) and of the Cases of severe morbidity (SM)

        -  To analyze the determinants of the SM,

        -  To validate an objective score of quality

      Criterias of evaluation:

        -  Incidence of the G-PLE and SM cases during one month.

        -  Reliability and validity of measurements of the indicators of quality of care.

      Methodology:

      Stage 1: Data acquisition (prospective) within 22 gynaecological emergencies departments.

      Stage 2: Sampling and checking of files of patients included at stage 1

      Calendar of the research project:

      18 months:

        -  6 months for the phase of preparation,

        -  1 month for the investigation of incidence,

        -  5 months for the phase of checking data,

        -  6 months of statistical analysis

      Statistical Analyzes:

      Descriptive statistics of the data. Estimation of the incidence rate of the potentially
      life-threatening gynaecological emergencies (G-PLE) and of the cases of Severe morbidity (SM)
      among women consulting for acute pelvic pain.

      To construct reliable quality indicators, principal components analysis and Cronbach's Î±
      statistics will be performed to determine the underlying dimensions. Construct validity of
      indicators will be assessed by testing predefined hypotheses about relationship between G-PLE
      and or SM and quality indicators.
