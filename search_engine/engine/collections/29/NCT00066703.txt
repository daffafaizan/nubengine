        -  Compare the disease-free survival, breast cancer-free interval, distant recurrence-free
           interval and overall survival of premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast
           cancer when treated with triptorelin and exemestane vs triptorelin and tamoxifen.

        -  Compare the quality of life, including late side effects of early menopause, of patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, international, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to planned use of concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and number of
      positive lymph nodes (0 vs 1 or more). Treatment duration is 5 years. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter. Quality
      of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and annually for 3 years.
