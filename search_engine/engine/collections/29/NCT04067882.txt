      treatment in cervical cancer, but so far it has not been possible to standardize the use of
      any biomarker or biomarker signature as a predictor of the response to treatment with
      reproducible results. Therefore, there is still a need to develop an effective method to
      predict the response to chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer. This
      prospective study included 189 patients with cervical cancer clinical stages IB2-IVA, without
      previous treatment.

      Tumor samples will be obtained at the confirmatory diagnostic biopsy. All samples will be
      processed by the pathology laboratory as usual. The RNA will be extracted from the paraffin
      blocks with the RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The
      RNA will be stored at -20°C until use. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) will be performed with the kit
      High-Capacity cDNA Reverse transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primers for the 27
      genes will be developed. The relative expression will be calculated using the 2- ΔΔCt method,
      using the expression of β-actin as a normalizing gene.

      In order to obtain the prognostic score, the score assigned by the classifier for the sample
      will be calculated from the 2-ΔΔCt values obtained for each gene. This will be done by a
      computer-readable medium containing the type expression profiles related to a good and a bad
      response to the standard treatment.
