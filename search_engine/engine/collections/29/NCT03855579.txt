      optimum hemodynamics by optimizing the intravascular volume and by using some inotropes.
      However, conventional inotropes such as beta-agonists are associated with tachycardia and
      arrhythmia which increase myocardial oxygen demand.

      Levosimendan is an inodilator which exerts its positive inotropic effect by enhancing the
      sensitivity of troponin C to calcium without increasing intracellular calcium concentration.
      Levosimendan also decreases the systemic vascular resistance, so, it increases the cardiac
      output without increasing myocardial oxygen consumption.

      This study aims to compare the efficacy of Levosimendan versus Milrinone in supporting
      hemodynamics during off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in patients with low
      ejection fraction.
