    
      Follicular Lymphoma (FL) is a cancer of a B lymphocyte, a type of white blood cell. FL is
      typically a slowly progressing but incurable disease. Follicular lymphoma cells produce a
      specific defect in the patient's immune system impairing their ability to control their
      cancer. Lenalidomide has been shown to reverse the specific immune defect caused by FL in the
      patient. By including lenalidomide, the RELEVANCE study aims to eliminate the cancer while
      restoring the patient's immune competence.
