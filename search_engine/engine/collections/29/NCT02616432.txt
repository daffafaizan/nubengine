      ensure that all Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group / American College of Radiology Imaging
      Network (ECOG/ACRIN) TMIST components are properly functional and to provide an opportunity
      for fine tuning before launching the full TMIST. The accrual target for TMIST LEAD-IN is 6354
      participants (one tenth of the projected enrollment target for TMIST) at three lead-in study
      sites: 1. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, 2. Vancouver (under the auspices of
      the Screening Mammography Programme of British Columbia) and 3. The Ottawa Hospital.
