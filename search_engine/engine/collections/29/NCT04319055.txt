      in telemedicine, such as early screening of childhood ptosis for prompt referral and
      treatment. People could use this software via mobile devices to get a primitive diagnosis
      before they reach the physicians. Furthermore, in primary health care, where there is no
      oculoplastic surgeon, the software could assist primary care physicians or general
      ophthalmologists, in identifying the need for a referral.
