      explore safety, tolerability and PK of single intravenous doses of ANXV. Part II, Multiple
      Ascending Dose (MAD), will explore safety, tolerability and PK of multiple doses (five
      consecutive daily doses) of intravenous ANXV.

      The objectives of this study are:

      Primary objective:

      - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single/multiple ascending doses of ANXV in
      healthy male subjects.

      Secondary objective:

      - To determine the PK profile of single/multiple ascending doses of ANXV in healthy male
      subjects.

      Exploratory objectives:

      - To evaluate ADA to ANXV and other relevant parameters.
