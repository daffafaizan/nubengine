      asthma, based on two different dosing strategies. No therapy intervention is made with
      existing prescribed medications (SERETIDE or SYMBICORT), but evaluations outside standard
      care is made by evluations with diary cards, questionnaires, PEF evaluations and spirometry
      which is regarded as the intervention by the Swedish Authorities.
