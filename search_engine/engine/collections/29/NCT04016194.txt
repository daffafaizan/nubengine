    
      Retrospective analysis of longitudinal data collected during clinically routine from
      approximately 200 patients with CF aged 3 years or more between 01.01.1980 and 31.12.2005.
      The overall aim of this project is to retrospectively assess whether LCI measured for
      clinical purposes during school age is predictive for survival or lung transplantation in
      adulthood. For this, the investigators will assess in a systematic way clinically measured
      LCI and relate them with the compound outcome survival or lung transplantation
      retrospectively.
