      receptors on spinal cord excitability and on the severity of symptoms in patients with mild
      to moderately advanced restless legs syndrome. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical
      study, the acute efficacy of ropinirole will be assessed through the use of validated
      electrophysiological tests and severity scales. Safety will be monitored by means of frequent
      clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.
