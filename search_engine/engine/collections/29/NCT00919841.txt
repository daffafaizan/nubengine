      Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital will be invited to participate the study. Weekly
      transabdominal and/or transvaginal ultrasound examinations will be offered until the uterus
      is completely involuted. Transabdominal or transvaginal approach will be at the examiner's
      discretion. Uterine volume will be measured with 3-dimensional sonographic technologies.
      Ovaries will also be assessed, along with Doppler flow in several vessels in the pelvis. The
      pattern of involution will be analyzed.
