      years. The test porcelain veneer is CAD/CAM milled as a veneer shell that is then fused to
      the CAD/CAM milled Lava crown to make the final crown to be cemented in the patient's mouth.
      This may be a more predictable technique in the fabrication of Lava crowns than current
      conventional methods.
