      I. To determine if our ventilatory strategy to prevent atelectasis (VESPA) can reduce the
      intra-procedural development of atelectasis during bronchoscopy under general anesthesia when
      compared with conventional mechanical ventilation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe proportion of VESPA-induced complications. II. To describe and compare
      proportion of bronchoscopy-induced complications in VESPA and control arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive anesthesia using a standard short breathing tube called laryngeal
      mask airway (LMA) and then undergo standard of care bronchoscopy.

      GROUP II: Patients receive anesthesia using a longer breathing tube called an endotracheal
      tube and then undergo standard of care bronchoscopy.
