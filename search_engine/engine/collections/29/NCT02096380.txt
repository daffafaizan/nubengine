    
      Patients presented with non-keratinizing NPC and stage Ⅲ-Ⅳb T3-4N1M0/TxN2M0 are randomly
      assigned to receive one cycle induction chemotherapy (docetaxel+cisplatin+fluorouracil) plus
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy (investigational arm) or three cycles induction chemotherapy
      (docetaxel+cisplatin+fluorouracil) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (investigational
      arm)(control arm). Patients in both arms receive radical Intensity modulated radiation
      therapy (Trilogy, Varian), and cisplatin (30mg/m2) every weeks for six cycles during
      radiotherapy. Radiation is delivered to GTV at 70 Gy in 30 fractions, CTV1 at at 60 Gy in 30
      fractions and CTV2 at 54 Gy in 30 fractions. Patients in the investigational arm receive
      docetaxel (60mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin (20mg/m2 on day 1-4) and fluorouracil
      (800mg/m2/d,continuous infusion, day 1-4) every three weeks for one cycle or three cycles
      before the radiotherapy. The primary end point is response rates after radiotherapy,
      failure-free survival (FFS) and toxic effects and treatment compliance. Secondary end points
      include overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), locoregional
      failure-free survival (LR-FFS). All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat
      population; the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned
      treatment.
