      procedures differed only by the content of the infusate. In one session, 6% ethanol was
      infused. In the other session, only vehicle was infused, quantifying the placebo response for
      every subject. The order of alcohol or placebo sessions was counterbalanced; subjects were
      blind to which session was which; sessions were scheduled to occur approximately 2 weeks
      apart. Measures were collected before, and at beginning and end of infusion, and included
      subjective perceptions, EMG, EEG, stop-signal performance, eye movements, and auditory
      responses. Design allowed analysis of effect of alcohol vs placebo, initial effect of alcohol
      and acute tolerance to alcohol.
