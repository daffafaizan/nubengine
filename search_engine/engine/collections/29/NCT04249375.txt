        1. Implement a pilot pharmacogenomics program to test medication safety and effectiveness
           of antibiotics, analgesics and mental health medication to enhance prescribing
           decision-making.

        2. Develop data collection forms to collect necessary patient information from the
           prescribing physicians.

        3. Develop pharmacogenomics reports to return results to physicians, pharmacists, patients
           and their families.

        4. Determine how the tests and results are perceived and utilized by physicians,
           pharmacists, patients and their families.
