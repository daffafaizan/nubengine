      States and is marked by advanced stage at diagnosis and a high mortality rate. Intraductal
      papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a cystic lesion that can be potentially cancerous,
      leading to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Currently, there is no existing imaging modality that
      is both sensitive and cost-effective enough in accurately measuring or detecting
      adenocarcinoma and IPMN. Improving the methods used in identification and localization of
      this disease is critical.

      Secretin, a hormone produced by duodenal mucosal cells increases blood-flow to the pancreas.
      The investigators' hypothesis is that as secretin increases blood flow to the pancreas, there
      will be increased conspicuity in areas of dysplasia/cancer where there is minimal blood-flow,
      enhancing tumor detection. The investigators are conducting a prospective, randomized-control
      pilot study of thirty subjects with IPMN or pancreatic cancer who are undergoing surgical
      resection at Columbia University's Pancreas Center. Fifteen subjects will be randomly
      selected to undergo S-MRI prior to surgery and fifteen subjects will be selected as controls,
      undergoing MRI without secretin-enhancement and matched for age, sex, race and tumor-type.
      The investigators will first evaluate if secretin allows for increased tumor conspicuity,
      enhanced visualization of the lesion, by comparing the calculated tumor conspicuity of S-MRI
      to N-MRI groups.

      The investigators will then assess if S-MRI imaging allows for increased accuracy in lesion
      measurements by looking at the concordance in measurements between S-MRI and tumor specimens
      post-resection as compared to the concordance in measurements between N-MRI and tumor
      specimens post-resection.
