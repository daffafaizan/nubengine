      for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In fact, eggs are a great source of phospholipids
      (phosphatidylcholine) where choline has many metabolic roles, specially in lipid metabolism
      and cell membrane structure. Choline is present in the diet as free choline, which is
      absorbed in the small intestines, or choline esters, which is absorbed intact primarily
      through the lymphatic system. In addition, recent evidence suggests that the choline found in
      eggs may be metabolized by intestinal microbes into trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a compound
      that may increase the risk for CVD. However, it is not known to what extent egg intake may
      contribute to plasma TMAO concentrations.

      Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the impacts of daily intake of 3 eggs
      versus a choline supplement on plasma TMAO as well as other biomarkers for CVD risk, with the
      goal of determining if the same amount of choline given as phosphatidylcholine from eggs will
      increase plasma choline levels without a concomitant increase in plasma TMAO, such that CVD
      risk is not negatively impacted.
