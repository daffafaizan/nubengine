      Adaptive Test for Mental Health (CAT-MH) into an EHR for a healthcare system and evaluate the
      effectiveness of collecting CAT-MH PROs via an EHR-tethered patient portal (MyChart) vs.
      usual care in two randomized controlled trials. The first aim of this study will consist of a
      randomized controlled trial comparing screening rates among adult primary care patients with
      an active patient portal account (MyChart) and due for depression screening who receive usual
      care (CAT-MH screenings during routine clinic visits) vs. MyChart population-based CAT-MH
      screenings. The second aim of this study involves a randomized controlled trial comparing
      depression remission rates among patients with active moderate-to-severe MDD who receive
      usual care vs. MyChart CAT-MH measurement-based care. In addition, we will examine the
      resources needed to integrate the CAT-MH into the EHR and design the health IT strategy for
      collecting PROs via the patient portal.
