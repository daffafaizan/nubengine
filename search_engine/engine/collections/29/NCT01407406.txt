      populations to support future clinical development of BIIB023 in China and Japan.

      Study Design: This is a single-dose, Randomized, Double-Blind, parallel-group study to
      evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of BIIB023 administered intravenously (IV) to adult
      Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian healthy volunteers. The Caucasian group is included to allow
      comparison of PK data from different groups using data from the same study under the same
      controlled conditions.
