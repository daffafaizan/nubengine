      IC50<10nmol/l for all three AKT isoforms.

      AZD5363 is well designed to inhibit the important main signal pathway in various human
      cancer. AZD5363 is a specific inhibitor of the AKT pathway which is activated in a wide
      spectrum of tumours.The combination of AZD5363 to standard chemotherapy, paclitaxel, might
      improve the outcomes of 2nd line therapy in advanced gastric cancer patients .
