      little is known about the effects of intensive care unit (ICU)-associated sleep disturbances
      on patient outcomes. Furthermore, few interventions have been rigorously evaluated to
      demonstrate efficacy in improving sleep in the ICU and associated patient outcomes. Post-ICU
      neurocognitive test performance data from this study will be linked to a pre-existing Quality
      Improvement (QI) project for patient sleep in the MICU. We hypothesize that patients'
      post-ICU neurocognitive performance (delirium status, attention, short-term memory,
      processing speed, and executive function) will positively correlate with scores from a
      previously-published Sleep in the Intensive Care Unit Questionnaire. In addition, we
      hypothesize that both neurocognitive performance and the Sleep in the Intensive Care Unit
      Questionnaire will improve during the multi-stage MICU-wide sleep QI project. Our project
      will provide valuable empirical evidence to help support guidelines for promoting sleep in
      the ICU setting.
