      pterygium excision followed by amniotic membrane associated with a small conjunctival
      autograft (2x3mm) or conjunctival autograft (approximately 5x8mm) alone. The patients were
      examined after 1, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 360 days after the surgery. Recurrence was considered as
      a fibrovascular ingrowth of 1.5 mm or more beyond the limbus with conjunctival drag.
