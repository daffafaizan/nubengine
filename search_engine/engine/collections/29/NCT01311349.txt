      of tigecycline in disk diffusion on clinical bacterial isolates collected from inpatients and
      outpatients. Fourteen hospital centers participated in the program. In vitro efficacy of
      tigecycline will be determined through the in vitro disk diffusion activity, using FDA
      breakpoints.
