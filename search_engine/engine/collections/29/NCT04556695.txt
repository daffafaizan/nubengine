    
      The study follows a sequential, mixed-methods model involving three stages. The first stage
      will involve the dissemination of a questionnaire survey, in which participants will
      self-estimate their sedentary behaviour on a working day and on a non-working day. The second
      stage will involve the use of thigh-worn accelerometers and a sleep/work log to obtain
      objective data regarding sedentary behaviour among a purposive subset of participants who
      responded to the questionnaire. The third stage will involve semi-structured interviews with
      a purposive subset of participants who wore the accelerometers, which will be analysed with
      the application of a theoretical framework regarding the acceptability of healthcare
      interventions.
