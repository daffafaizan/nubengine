      Purpose of Sub-study E - Rapamycin and cMRI to evaluate cardiac function:

      The over-arching hypothesis is that RAPA treatment will effect simultaneous improvement in
      parameters known to be negatively impacted by aging. For example, systemic inflammation is
      higher in older individuals and contributes to the development of age-related pathologies
      affecting both the heart and the vasculature. In particular, evidence indicates that
      aging-associated alterations in inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways are critically
      involved in the etiology of age-related declines. The study team hypothesize that mTOR
      antagonism with RAPA will improve detrimental age-related pathologies affecting the heart in
      elderly humans.
