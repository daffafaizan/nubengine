      patients must have received treatment from each of three ARV classes: NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs,
      have received at least two PI-based ARV regimens (may include the current regimen) with a
      viral load greater than or equal to 1000 copies/mL at the time of study entry. The two
      separate PI-based regimens must each have been taken for at least 3 months. At least one
      resistance-conferring PI-mutation (from a pre-established panel) must be present. Baseline
      genotypic screening will be performed and will be used in conjunction with ARV medication
      history to determine new background therapy for each individual subject to use.

      Following genotypic screening at baseline, qualifying subjects will be randomized to one of
      three blinded treatment regimens. Subjects will discontinue their current protease inhibitor
      and initiate TPV/RTV for 2 weeks of functional monotherapy. Thereafter, the background ARV
      medications will be optimized and subjects will remain on blinded TPV/RTV plus optimized
      background therapy for the duration of the trial. Trial duration ranges between 12-32 weeks,
      depending on when the subject is entered into the trial and the interim analyses for
      determination of optimized TPV/RTV regimen is completed. On determination of the optimal
      TPV/RTV dose, subjects may opt to continue open-label treatment.
