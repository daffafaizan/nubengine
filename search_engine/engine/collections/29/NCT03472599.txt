      the most serious problems encountered by Veterans with neurologic injuries such as spinal
      cord injury (SCI). The majority of persons with SCI suffer from neurogenic bladder (73%) and
      only 17% of persons with traumatic SCI manage their bladders with voluntary micturition. The
      investigators' long-term goal is to develop and clinically implement a "bladder pacemaker"
      able to restore bladder continence for Veterans with spinal cord injury (SCI). This proposal
      will 1) determine the long-term effectiveness of genital nerve stimulation (GNS) to
      chronically ( 1 year) reduce urinary incontinence and improve quality of life for Veterans
      with SCI, and 2) develop and produce an effective take home GNS system that can be used by
      more Veterans, given to Veterans at the end of the study and used in future multi-VA studies.

      The rationale for studying chronic GNS is based on the demonstration in humans with SCI that
      abnormal hyper-reflexive bladder contractions can be acutely inhibited and bladder capacity
      acutely increased using GNS. The peripheral and easily accessible location of the dorsal
      genital nerve (DGN) allows surface stimulation and therefore provides the potential for a
      less complicated surgical intervention than is currently available, increasing the number of
      individuals who could benefit from bladder control neural prostheses. While GNS has been
      demonstrated to be effective acutely by multiple groups, relatively few groups have attempted
      to test this approach for more than a day.
