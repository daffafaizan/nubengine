      randomly allocated to two different groups. Treatment group is acupuncture, while the control
      group is sham acupuncture. The ratio of treatment group and control group is 2:1. Both
      acupuncture and sham acupuncture group will receive 12 sessions of verum/sham acupuncture in
      4 weeks.

      The result of this trial (available in 2011) will supply evidence on the efficacy of
      acupuncture for sleep disorder of CFS.
