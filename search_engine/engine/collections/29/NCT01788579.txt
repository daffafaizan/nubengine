      drug-involved female offenders under community supervision. Moreover, accumulating research
      has found strong associations linking experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and
      continued drug use among women in drug treatment. This research suggests that failure to
      prevent IPV among drug-involved female offenders under community supervision likely to result
      in higher rates of relapse, treatment attrition and recidivism and underscores the need to
      address the IPV service needs among the rapidly growing population of female offenders under
      community supervision. Computerized multimedia IPV prevention service tools have been shown
      to be feasible and effective in conducting screening, brief intervention and referral for IPV
      in medical care settings. The proposed services research addresses the significant public
      health problem of IPV victimization and a co-occurring risk for relapse and recidivism among
      drug-involved female offenders under court supervision or probation. The proposed
      computerized tool employs a self-paced, multimedia format to conduct IPV screening, brief
      intervention and IPV-related service referrals that is informed by best IPV screening and
      referral practices and previous intervention research. This innovative tool represents a
      cost-effective option that may implemented with greater fidelity and result in better client
      satisfaction and IPV prevention outcomes. Furthermore, if found to be effective in
      identifying IPV and improving linkage to IPV services, this cost effective computerized
      service tool may be scaled up with ease and speed in court and probation settings in New York
      State and nationwide.
