      for early breast cancer, we have yet to determine the optimum number of cycles for TC
      adjuvant chemotherapy. In this prospective, open-label clinical trial, estrogen receptor
      (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative early breast cancer
      patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes will be randomized into either 4 cycles or 6 cycles of
      TC adjuvant chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of each group will be assessed through
      disease-free survival (DFS), invasive disease free survival (iDFS), distant disease free
      survival (DDFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AE) as graded by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0.
