      a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging and FLAIR in the region of ischemia resulted in
      a significantly better functional outcome at 90 days. This trial will enroll acute ischemic
      stroke patients within 4.5 to 24 hours of onset. All the patients had an ischemic lesion that
      was visible on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging but no parenchymal hyperintensity on
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), which indicated that the stroke had a ischemic
      penumbra. Randomization will be 1:1 to TNK-tPA (experimental) or standard treatment
      (control), in compliance with guidelines for acute stroke. Clinical outcome was assessed by
      disability on the basis of the modified Rankin scale at 90 days follow-up, which will be
      performed by a blinded assessor.
