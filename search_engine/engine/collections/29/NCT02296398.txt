      Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation clinic with the diagnosis of CTCL. It includes
      Mycosis Fungoid, SÃ©zary Syndrome and other subtypes of CTCL, like Cytotoxic Cutaneous T-cell
      lymphomas. Those patients that received or will be prescribed per standard of care with
      romidepsin for at least 1 month (or at least more than 1 cycle of treatment) will be
      reviewed. We estimate that 50 patients could fit the criteria above, since the drug started
      to be prescribed in the Dermatology Clinic. Clinical information regarding diagnosis, stage,
      prior treatment received, and therapeutic response will be recorded. Blood parameters such as
      cell blood count, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and albumin at baseline and after treatment
      with romidepsin will be reviewed, and recorded if abnormalities are detected.
      Electrocardiogram changes will also be checked and recorded. All the information will be
      gathered in an excel spreadsheet in order to perform a descriptive analysis. We aim to assess
      the use of romidepsin as maintenance therapy and assess which schedule of treatment was most
      frequently used and associated with a better response with fewer side effects.
