      than 65 years of age. The vast majority of the patients have mild aberrations of serum
      calcium (< 1.50 mmol/l ionized calcium), and some patients may even be asymptomatic. The
      present trial is designed to clarify the indications for surgical treatment in this large
      subgroup of patients.
