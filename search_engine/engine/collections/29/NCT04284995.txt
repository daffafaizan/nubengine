      high-grade inhibition of platelet aggregation (≥80%) shortly after subcutaneous
      administration. For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) early treatment
      with RUC-4 could be beneficial by improving initial patency of the infarct related vessel and
      by minimizing thrombotic occlusions, thus improving both coronary artery and myocardial
      microvascular blood flow, possibly resulting in a decrease in infarct size and a reduction in
      complications of STEMI.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the PD and PK properties of a single subcutaneous
      injection of RUC-4 in STEMI patients presenting to the cardiac catheterization laboratory
      with planned coronary angioplasty. In addition the safety and tolerability will be assessed
      at baseline and hospital discharge.
