      transplantation co-morbidity index (HCT-CI) ≥ 3) in adult (≥ 18 yrs) AML patients, for whom
      current treatment strategies are highly unsatisfactory. Therefore new treatment modalities
      are introduced and evaluated in multiple parallel randomized phase II studies that will be
      conducted within the frame of a master protocol. The scheme of this new design consists of
      one arm with one of the currently considered best available treatments for unfit AML patients
      (i.e. 10-day decitabine). After a maximum of 3 10-day courses, or less in case of good
      response, treatment will be continued with 5-day decitabine courses. This treatment will be
      compared to investigational treatments in combination with decitabine.

      The competitor of the 10-day decitabine schedule will be 10-day decitabine combined
      (sequential) with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor midostaurin (independent of the presence of
      FLT3 mutations). The rationale for midostaurin is: 1) single agent midostaurin has shown
      efficacy in both FLT3 wild type and mutant AML; 2) it has shown efficacy in a phase III
      randomized controlled trial when combined with intensive chemotherapy in FLT3-mutated AML
      (RATIFY study); 3) midostaurin has been successfully combined with hypomethylating agents
      (azacitidine and decitabine) and improved the response compared with historical response
      rates of these drugs, suggesting at least additive affects of midostaurin with
      hypomethylating agents.
