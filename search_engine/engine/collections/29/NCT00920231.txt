      integrated system comprising of a laptop computer, webcam, gps, digital compass, microphone,
      and stereo earphones. The system will be voice controlled. The algorithm will be trained to
      identify and located objects and navigationally landmarks in real-time, previously selected
      by sighted developers. After the system has passed objective engineering milestones, blind
      subjects will be tested to determine whether the novel system will improve the ability of the
      blind to travel over a test course in a hospital setting.
