      overall survival and improving quality of life. In patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian
      cancer (relapsed disease after 6 months from the end of first line chemotherapy) the
      combination of paclitaxel/carboplatin is considered the standard treatment. Generally, the
      combination platinum-based chemotherapy may well be associated with a survival benefit in
      patients with platinum-sensitive disease. Carboplatin, pegylated doxorubicin (caelyx)
      docetaxel, have been approved for second-line treatment of ovarian carcinoma and seem to be
      active in platinum-sensitive disease.
