      mechanical obstruction. This disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality with a
      prevalence up to 4% of population. Patients with this disease have a reduced quality of life.
      The principal etiologies include: post-surgical, diabetes, medications and idiopathic.
      Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating and abdominal pain. Diagnosis is
      based on the combination of symptoms and studies as gastroscopy that shows retained food in
      the stomach without a gastric outlet obstruction and confirmed with a gastric emptying
      scintigraphy. Treatments have limited effect in these patients, including medications,
      botulinum toxin injection, surgical gastric electrical stimulation, laparoscopic pyloroplasty
      and stent placement. G-POEM is a new technique based on per-oral endoscopic myotomy treatment
      in achalasia patients, which has been recently proposed for treatment of patients with
      refractory gastroparesis with good initial results. The investigators aim is to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of this new technique in a group of mexican participants with this
      disease.
