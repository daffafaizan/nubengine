    
      This is a Phase 1 open-label study of three doses of amikacin/fosfomycin. Approximately 30
      healthy volunteers will be dosed in five cohorts of six subjects each. The first (sentinel)
      subject in each of the first three cohorts will be dosed alone. If no significant safety or
      tolerability events occur, the remaining five subjects in each of the first three cohorts
      will be dosed. The first cohort (n=6) will be administered the 30/12 mg dose of
      amikacin/fosfomycin. The second cohort (n=6) will be administered the 60/24 mg dose of
      amikacin/fosfomycin. The third cohort (n=6) will be administered the 90/36 mg dose of
      amikacin/fosfomycin. All doses in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will be delivered with the PARI
      Investigational eFlow Nebulizer System. The fourth cohort (n=6) will be administered the
      90/36 mg dose of amikacin/fosfomycin using the PARI LC Sprint Nebulizer. The fifth cohort
      (n=6) will test the lowest dose level at which all subjects achieved > 0.3 Âµg/mL amikacin
      peak serum concentration. The nebulizer used to deliver doses in cohort 5 will be determined
      after amikacin concentrations from cohorts 1 through 4 are reviewed.
