      features. Overexpression of the receptor in tumor samples or high level of blood HGF in
      subjects is related to higher recurrence rate after surgery for HCC, while high c-Met
      expression correlates with shorter survival in HCC subjects. In summary, c-Met holds an
      important prognostic role in the natural history of HCC. This Phase 3 study in MET
      Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC subjects has been designed based on the results from the
      randomized, controlled Phase 2 study conducted by ArQule, Inc. with tivantinib versus placebo
      in subjects with MET Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC who have failed one prior systemic
      therapy, mentioned above. The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of tivantinib
      in MET Diagnostic-High HCC subjects who were previously treated with one systemic therapy,
      and to further evaluate the safety profile of the experimental drug in this subject
      population.
