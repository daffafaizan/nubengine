      1980 by the Fordtran group as isosmotic preparation for minimal water and electrolyte
      exchange with plasma to ensure safe cleansing of the bowel through a mechanical effect of
      large-volume lavage. The conventional total dose of 4 L given the day before the procedure is
      safe and effective and has been the standard cleansing regimen for the last 25 years. To
      overcome the difficulty in completing the bowel preparation due to large volume and/or taste,
      reduced-volume (mixed) bowel preparation of bisacodyl and 2 L of PEG-ELS have been shown to
      provide adequate colon cleansing and better tolerability.

      In the last recent years, time of preparation has been demonstrated to be a critical factor
      for bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Several studies have demonstrated that reducing the
      time interval between the completion of bowel preparation and the exam improves colon
      cleansing compared with standard dose regimen of the PEG-electrolyte solution given the day
      before colonoscopy. At the same time manufacturers have tried to improve the taste and
      palatability of PEG formulations by adding suitable ingredients such as ascorbic acid or
      citric acid. LoVol-esse is a reduced-volume PEG-based bowel preparation to be used in
      combination with bisacodyl and designed to improve patient tolerability and attitude toward
      bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopy thanks to the reduced volume and improved taste. The
      present study is intended to compare the new dosing regimen of the bowel lavage solution
      given the same day compared with standard PEG formulation (SELG 1000) given the day before
      colonoscopy.

      The results of this study will tells us if the last-hour preparation is effective and offers
      adequate tolerability and compliance to be adopted in clinical practice.
