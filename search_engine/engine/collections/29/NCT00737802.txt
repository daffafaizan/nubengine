      (gastrointestinal tract). The specific part the study team will look at is called the "lower
      esophageal sphincter complex." This complex is located where the esophagus (food pipe) meets
      the top of the stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter complex involves a group of muscles,
      and the study team hopes to better understand how they work.

      The study team hopes that, by studying the lower esophageal sphincter complex, it may be
      possible to discover how it functions and what causes it to fail. When a complex fails, this
      can lead to reflux and heartburn. So learning more about the lower esophageal complex may
      help doctors' better treat future patients with reflux problems.

      We plan to study these functions in normal control subjects, in patients with GERD (heartburn
      symptoms), and in patients with Barrett's esophagus (a change in the lining of the esophagus
      due to chronic reflux). The doctor performing the study procedure has previous experience
      with and is skilled in performing these procedures.
