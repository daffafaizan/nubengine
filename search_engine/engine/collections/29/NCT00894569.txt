      Except for some subsets with favorable prognosis, for most of these patients, treatment
      options are limited, and no standard first-line regimen has been identified. Standard therapy
      for patients with adeno- or undifferentiated CUP is Paclitaxel/Carboplatin, yielding response
      rates between 20-40%. In recent years, targeted therapies with inhibitors to EGFR, several
      tyrosine kinases, and VEGF have been shown to improve survival in different solid tumor
      entities. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against the EGF receptor, has proved efficacy in
      combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, gastric cancer,
      squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Because of
      these promising results it seems to be reasonable to examine the impact of adding cetuximab
      to standard chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with CUP.
