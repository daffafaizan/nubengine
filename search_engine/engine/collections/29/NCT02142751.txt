      trial to prove the noninferiority of fosfomycin versus meropenem in the targeted treatment of
      bacteraemic UTI due to ESBL-EC, designed as a real practice trial. It is a non-commercial,
      investigator-driven clinical study funded through a public competitive call by Instituto de
      Salud Carlos III, Spanish Ministry of Economy (PI13/01282).

      The study is coordinated by investigators from Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena in
      Seville, Spain; the sponsorship is performed by Fundación Pública Andaluza para la Gestión de
      la Investigación en Salud de Sevilla (FISEVI), of which the sponsor-scientific
      responsibilities are delegated to the CTU (Clinical Trial Unit-Hospital Universitario Virgen
      del Rocío, Seville, Spain). All participating patients or their relatives must give written
      informed consent before any study procedures occur, including the withdrawal of biological
      samples for the study.

      The hypothesis to test is that intravenous fosfomycin is not inferior to meropenem for the
      targeted treatment of bacteraemic UTI caused by ESBL-EC in terms of efficacy.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that intravenous fosfomycin is not
      inferior to meropenem for reaching clinical and microbiological cure 5-7 days after the
      completion of treatment.

      Secondary objectives include comparing the early clinical and microbiological response,
      30-day mortality, hospital stay, recurrence rate, safety and impact on intestinal
      colonisation by MDR Gram-negative bacilli, evaluation of the rate of resistance development
      to fosfomycin and blood level concentration of fosfomycin.
