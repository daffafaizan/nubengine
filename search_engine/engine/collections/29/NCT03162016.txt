      cover multiple recession defects. Moreover, connective tissue graft shows significant
      postoperative morbidity to treat generalized multiple gingival recessions. The goal of this
      study is to show if Mucoderm could be considered has a substitute of connective tissue graft
      in the coverage of gingival recession defects.
