      and matrix remodelling could be responsible for these changes. Using CLME changes of in the
      bronchiolar wall and alveolar ducts can be visualized, described and measured.

      In lung transplant recipients, CMLE will be performed to distinguish characteristics of
      distal airways in stabile patient in contrast to patients with bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome.

      In both groups data will be correlated with CT findings, pulmonary function tests and
      anatomopathological results.
