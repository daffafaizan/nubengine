      death 1 (PD-1, Pembrolizumab and Durvalumab) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1,
      Atezolizumab) have shown promising results as second-line treatments in phase II studies with
      response rates of about 30%.

      Although urothelial cancer is prone to immune checkpoint blockade, better understanding of
      the underlying mechanisms is necessary to improve patient selection. The efficacy of immune
      checkpoint inhibitors in urothelial cancer may be affected by both tumor specific and
      environmental factors. In order to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in urothelial
      cancer, drivers of local immune suppression need to be identified.

      In this prospective translational multicenter study, clinical data, peripheral blood and
      sequential tumor biopsies are collected from urothelial cancer patients treated with
      second-line treatment with pembrolizumab to identify the role of immune evasive mechanisms
      combined with genomic characterization. A pre-treatment tumor biopsy and blood sample will be
      obtained and subsequently whole genome sequencing and whole genome RNA sequencing is
      performed. Both tumor tissue as well as peripheral blood will be investigated for immune and
      molecular profiling. A biopsy will also be taken after start of treatment (at 6 weeks) and at
      progression (optional)

      For future research projects, longitudinal blood samples will be collected for isolation of
      immune cells, cytokine/chemo-attractants and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
