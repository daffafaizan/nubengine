      group is set and the test drug will be administered for 14 consecutive days.

      After receiving the informed consent form the subject themselves, the investigators start the
      screening 14 days to 1 days prior to taking the study drug (D-14 to D-1).

      One day before first dosing (D-1), subjects are hospitalized. On the next day (D1), after
      completed the hospitalization inspection, eligible subjects will be selected to start with
      the first dose, and from day 1 to day 14 (D1 to D14), continue once daily dosing and complete
      the corresponding inspection, observation and blood sampling. They continue hospitalization
      and are discharged on day 17 (D17) after completing the relevant examinations. On days 19,
      21, 23，25 (D19, D21，D23 and D25), blood samples are collected and safety evaluation is
      performed.

      Telephone follow-up is performed on day 44 (D44, 30 days after the last dose of the drug).

      Subjects who early terminated the test after taking the study drug should be tested at the
      end of the study (D25/ET) as far as possible.

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation are collected before daily dosing; D1 (before
      dosing, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 hours after dosing), D2 (before dosing and 24 hours after
      first dosing), D10 (before dosing), D11 (before dosing), D12 (before dosing), D13 (before
      dosing), D14 (before dosing, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 hours after dosing), D15 (24 hours
      after last dosing), D16 (48 hours after last dosing), D17 (72 hours after last dosing), D18
      (96 hours after last dosing), D19 (120 hours after last dosing), D21 (168 hours after last
