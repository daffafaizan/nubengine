        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicity of azacitidine plus phenylbutyrate in patients with
           refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this treatment regimen where maximal gene
           reexpression occurs in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in these patients.

        -  Determine the minimally effective dose of azacitidine in combination with phenylbutyrate
           that elicits a biological or clinical response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously for 14-21 days and sodium phenylbutyrate IV
      continuously for 1-7 days. Treatment repeats every 35 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses and durations of treatment with azacitidine
      and phenylbutyrate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
