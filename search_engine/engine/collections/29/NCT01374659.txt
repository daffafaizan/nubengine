    
      <Inclusion Criteria> Patients with histologically proven DTC were studied. All patients had
      previously undergone total thyroidectomy and more than one session of postoperative RI
      therapy. More than 12 months of follow-up after the last RI therapy session, all patients
      showed increasing pathological Tg levels (Tg > 9-10 ng/ml) after TSH stimulation (TSH > 30
      mU/l). However, neither tumor recurrence nor metastasis could be detected in any patient by
      post-therapeutic [131I] scanning, neck US, or chest radiography. Patients with obvious
      cervical pathology or positive fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) were excluded from the
      study. The work was approved by our Institutional Review Board and written informed consent
      was obtained from each patient.

      <Study protocol> The study was prospectively designed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacies
      of [18F]-FDG-PET/CT and [124I]-PET/CT in patients with elevated Tg levels, but who yielded no
      pathological findings on conventional imaging. The [124I] radioisotope was supplied by the
      Radiopharmaceutical Research Team of the Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences
      (KIRAMS). All involved patients underwent a diagnostic [131I] scan, [18F]-FDG-PET/CT, and
      [124I]-PET/CT. On the first day (D1) of the study, blood and urine were collected for routine
      examination; to measure blood TSH, Tg, and anti-Tg antibody levels; and to assess urine
      iodine excretion after 4 weeks of levothyroxine (LT4) withdrawal. All patients had consumed a
      low-iodine diet for the prior 2 weeks, following written instructions and assisted by a
      dietician. On the second day (D2) of the study, an [131I] scan was obtained 48 h after
      administration of 74 MBq of [131I]. On day 10 (D10) of the study, patients fasted for at
      least 4 h before examination, and were (intravenously) given 370 MBq [18F]-FDG. All patients
      were instructed to rest comfortably for 60 min and to empty the bladder before scanning.
      Whole-body PET/CT images were obtained using a Discovery ST scanner (GE Healthcare,
      Milwaukee, WI). Seven or eight frames (3 min/frame) of emission PET data were acquired in the
      two-dimensional mode after noncontrast CT scans had been performed from the base of the skull
      to the upper thigh (tube rotation time of 1 s per revolution; 120 kV; 60 mA; 7.5 mm per
      rotation; and an acquisition time of 60.9 s for a scan length of 867 mm). Emission PET images
      were reconstructed via non-contrast CT using an iterative method (ordered-subsets expectation
      maximization with two iterations and 30 subsets; field of view 600 mm; slice thickness 3.27
      mm). Attenuation-corrected PET/CT images were reviewed on an Xeleris workstation (GE
      Healthcare). All images were independently interpreted by two experienced nuclear medicine
      physicians and screened for "hot spots" indicative of hypermetabolic abnormalities.

      On day 11 (D11) of the study, 24 h after administration of an [124I] trace dose (74 MBq),
      whole-body PET/CT scans were obtained using the Discovery ST scanner. First, a non-enhanced
      CT scan was performed, from the base of the skull to the upper thigh (tube rotation time of 1
      s per revolution; 140 kV; 80 mA; 3.75 mm per rotation; acquisition time of 23.9 s for a scan
      length of 804 mm). Subsequently, seven or eight frames (5 min per frame) of emission PET data
      were acquired in the two-dimensional mode and reconstructed via CT using an iterative method
      (software from General Electric Medical Systems; ordered-subsets expectation maximization
      with two iterations and 21 subsets; field of view 600 mm; slice thickness 3.27 mm).

      <Data analysis> To ensure that the interpretation of [18F]-FDG-PET/CT and [124I]-PET/CT data
      was performed under similar conditions, all physicians who initially read images of one type
      were deliberately blinded to the results of the other type of imaging, and to patient
      clinical data. This was achieved by ensuring that the interpreting physicians were not
      involved in patient clinical care. Findings on [18F]-FDG-PET and [124I]-PET scanning were
      compared with data from diagnostic and post-therapeutic [131I] scans. Moreover, the data were
      compared with those of radiological imaging (US, CT, and MRI information), and/or those of
      cytological investigation (FNAC), to confirm (or otherwise) the findings of the [131I] scans,
      and those of both forms of PET/CT (using [18F]-FDG and [124I]). For each patient, the
      presence or absence, and number and localization of any recurrent lesions (if present) were
      determined. The data of both types of PET/CT scans were classified as follows: 1)
      True-positive, if pathologic [18F]-FDG or [124I] uptake was proven by histology, cytology, or
      other imaging techniques, and caused therapy to be changed; 2) False-positive, if no
      pathologic [18F]-FDG or [124I] uptake was seen (such observations were of no clinical
      consequence); 3) True-negative, if no [18F]-FDG or [124I] uptake was found and the patient
      had neither an elevated Tg level nor any evidence of recurrence upon subsequent follow-up;
      and, 4) False-negative if no [18F]-FDG or [124I] uptake was noted despite elevated Tg levels,
      even if positive findings were obtained when other imaging methods were employed.
