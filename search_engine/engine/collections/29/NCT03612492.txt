    
      Esmolol is a selective beta-blocker of fast action that antagonizes beta-1 adrenergic
      receptors. Venous lidocaine is the agent most used to attenuate the hemodynamic response to
      laryngoscopy and intubation, in addition to cough reflex.

      Objective: To compare the hemodynamic response during laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation
      using continuous infusion of lidocaine and esmolol.

      Methods: Randomized, double masked clinical trial aims to compare the effect of esmolol and
      lidocaine on orotracheal intubation. All patients will receive balanced general anesthesia.
      One group (EG) will receive bolus esmolol of 1.5mg / kg in 10 min following by continuous
      infusion at a rate of 0.1mg / kg / min. The lidocaine (LG) group will receive lidocaine bolus
      of 1.5mg / kg in 10 min following by continuous infusion at a rate of 1.5mg / kg / h.

      Data on hemodynamic changes, reaction to laryngoscopy, conditions at intubation and adverse
      events will be evaluated.
