      pregnancy in (1) twin pregnancies with a dilated internal cervical os between 14+0 and 26+0
      weeks, and (2) in monochorionic twin pregnancies complicated by TTTS treated by Laser surgery
      between 16+0 and 26+0 weeks' gestation in whom a short cervix (<15mm) is identified.

      Study Design: Randomised controlled trial

      Study population:

      2 groups

        -  Twin pregnancies between 14 - 26 weeks' gestation presenting with an open cervix

        -  Monochorionic twin pregnancies complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)
           treated by Laser surgery between 16+0 and 26+0 weeks' gestation in whom a short cervix
           (<15mm) is identified

      The primary outcome is time to delivery (from randomisation to birth). Secondary outcomes
      include gestation at delivery, preterm birth before 28, 32 and 34 weeks' gestation,
      birthweight, stillbirth, neonatal death, survival to discharge, days of admission to the
      neonatal intensive care unit, composite outcome of stillbirth, neonatal death,
      intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, respiratory distress syndrome,
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising entercolitis, proven
      neonatal sepsis, or the need for ventilation, days of maternal admission for preterm labour
      and maternal morbidity.
