    
      From 2 hospitals of Korean medicine, we will enrol 82 chronic TMD patients in Axis 1, Group Ⅰ
      according to RDC/TMD diagnostic criteria, and randomly allocate 41 patients each to an HPP
      group and a physical therapy (PT) group. Treatment will be administered in 10 rounds, after
      which there will be 4 follow-up visits (6, 9, 13, and 25 weeks from baseline). The primary
      end point is 6 weeks after baseline, and the primary outcome is the difference in Visual
      analogue scale (VAS) score for temporomandibular pain between baseline and Week 6. Secondary
      outcomes will be Numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for temporomandibular pain and discomfort,
      temporomandibular joint range of motion, Korean version of Beck's Depression
      Index-Ⅱ(K-BDI-II), Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS), Patien Global Impression of
      Change(PGIC), and quality of life. Using data on adverse events and cost-effectiveness in the
      two groups, we will perform a safety assessment and a cost-effectiveness analysis (economic
      assessment).
