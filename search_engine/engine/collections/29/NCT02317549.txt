    
      Primary Objective(s):

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if enteral administration of LB1148 will
      increase the number of days alive without cardiovascular, renal or pulmonary organ support
      through Day 28.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to determine if LB1148 will:

        -  Reduce mortality at Day 7, Day 28 and Day 90;

        -  Reduce the number of days to organ dysfunction resolution as evidenced by Sequential
           Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≤2 in patients alive on Day 28;

        -  Reduce the daily organ dysfunction as evidenced by average SOFA score through Day 14 and
           Day 28;

        -  Reduce the number of patients with new-onset organ dysfunction at Day 8;

        -  Increase the number of days alive and free from renal replacement therapy through Day
           28;

        -  Increase the number of days alive and free from renal dysfunction through Day 28;

        -  Increase the number of days alive and ventilator free through Day 28;

        -  Increase the number of days alive and free of vasopressors through Day 14 and Day 28;

        -  Increase the numbers of days alive and free from liver dysfunction through Day 28;

        -  Increase the number of days alive and not in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) through Day
           28;

        -  Increase the number of days alive and not in the hospital through Day 28, and

        -  Improve patient functional outcomes through Day 28 as evidenced by the EuroQoL EQ 5D
           questionnaire.

      In addition, the study will assess the safety and tolerability of LB1148 in patients with
      septic shock.

      The exploratory objectives of this study are to determine if LB1148 will:

        -  Reduce the number of patients with new-onset organ dysfunction from Day 9 through Day
           16;

        -  Decrease the number of days to normalize serum lactate (≤2.2 mmol/L) through Day 28;

        -  Reduce the average daily serum lactate levels through Day 8;

        -  Increase the number of days alive and free from ileus through Day 8 and Day 28.
