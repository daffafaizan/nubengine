    
      Twenty participants with lower limb loss who were referred to receive amputee rehabilitation
      at Hacettepe University, Faculty of Health Sciences, department of Physiotherapy and
      Rehabilitation, Prosthetics and Biomechanics unit, will be the subjects of this study.

      Participants with lower limb loss will evaluate with the following assessment tools:
      Demographic datas; age, gender, height, body mass, year, side and level of limb loss will be
      recorded. Gait parameters (step length, variation of step length) will evaluate with Gait
      Trainer Biodex 2, at participant's preferred speed. To eliminate the learning effect,
      participants practiced at treadmill to determine appropriate gait speed. Once participants
      implied the preferred speed, they asked to walk at their self selected speed for 6 minutes.
      Data was recorded between the 2nd and 4th minutes at walk. Phantom sensation and phantom pain
      will be asked as existence or not. Sensorial loss will evaluate with Semmes Weinstein
      Monofilaments.
