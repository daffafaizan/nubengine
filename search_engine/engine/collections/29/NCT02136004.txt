    
      The objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Rex Medical
      Closer Vascular Sealing System (VSS) in sealing femoral arterial access sites and providing
      reduced times to hemostasis (TTH) compared with performance goals at the completion of
      diagnostic or interventional procedures performed through 5, 6 or 7 Fr procedural sheaths.
      This study will be considered a success (from a statistical perspective) if it meets both the
      Closer VSS superiority goal for the primary effectiveness analysis and the Closer VSS
      performance goal for the primary safety analysis.
