      non-invasive measures. Fifty participants who are about to begin the Healthy Lifestyle
      Program (HLP) at the Weight and Wellness Clinic (WWC) and another 50 participants who are
      about to complete HLP will be recruited to the study. After informed consent is obtained, the
      patient will be asked to complete several questionnaires about sleep and wellbeing. Their
      height and weight will also be measured by the research staff. The patient will then be given
      a wrist-worn accelerometer to wear for 16 weeks to measure their sleep and physical activity.
      They will be asked to complete the same set of questions at approximately the 8th and 16th
      week at a research visit. Data on existing diagnosis of sleep disorders will be extracted
      from the patients' electronic medical records.
