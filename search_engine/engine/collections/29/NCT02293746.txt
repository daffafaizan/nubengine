    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm study conducted under a common implant and
      follow-up protocol. Each subject will serve as their own control.

      The study will collect pre-operative two-night home sleep testing, medical history and
      subject quality of life measures. Intra- and post- operative procedure data will be
      collected. Therapy usage and device adjustment data, as well as a subject satisfaction with
      therapy survey, will be collected for additional analysis.

      Post-implant, procedure- and device-related events, QoL questionnaires, therapy usage and
      device adjustment data will be collected. Sleep study data will collected during the 2-month
      visit and, if conducted, a 3-month visit using a single night in-lab titration PSGs At 6 and
      12 months post-implant, 2-night home sleep testing will be completed. Safety data will be
      collected throughout the study. Subjects will be exited from the study following the 12-month
      visits.

      The subject population will consist of otherwise healthy men and women that are at least 21
      years old and have: 1) Provided written informed consent to participate, 2) Indicated a
      willingness to comply with study requirements for the specified follow-up duration, 3) Met
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria of this protocol.

      Up to 60 subjects will be implanted at up to 5 sites in Germany.
