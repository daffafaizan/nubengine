      I. Determine if the combination of duloxetine (DL) and neurofeedback (NFB) is superior to DL
      or NFB alone in treating chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the optimal number of neurofeedback sessions needed to result in long-term
      relief of CIPN in a large cohort of cancer survivors and across socioeconomic groups.

      II. Examine baseline brain signatures as a predictor of response to neurofeedback (NFB) and
      to duloxetine and determine who will require more sessions of NFB to achieve relief of
      symptoms.

      III. Examine if the combination of DL + NFB (than those getting DL or NFB alone) or a larger
      number of NFB sessions results in better improvements in cancer-related symptoms, physical
      functioning, and quality of life (QOL).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive neurofeedback training over 1 hour each 3-5 times weekly for up to
      5 weeks. Patients also receive duloxetine orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 5 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive neurofeedback training session over 1 hour 3-5 times weekly for up
      to 5 weeks.

      GROUP III: Patients receive duloxetine PO QD for 5 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 months.
