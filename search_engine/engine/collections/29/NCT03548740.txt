      sufficient for the development of cervical cancer. Additional factors correlated with HPV
      persistence include immunodeficiency caused by HIV, smoking, use of oral contraceptives and,
      more recently reported, vaginal dysbiosis. In a state of dysbiosis, there is a marked
      reduction of Lactobacillus and a high diversity of bacteria, with increased abundance of
      anaerobic bacterial species. Based on this, the investigators are going to analyze the
      changes of microbiota in women with high-risk HPV and the cervical lesions. And the
      investigators hope to figure out the difference and change in microbiota to realize the
      tanning of cervical lesions.
