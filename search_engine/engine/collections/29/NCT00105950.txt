    
      This Phase II open label, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacodynamic effects of oral lapatinib administered as a single agent therapy to patients
      with relapsed or refractory inflammatory breast cancer. Eligible patients must have a
      diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer based on clinicopathologic criteria, tumor that is
      readily accessible for biopsy, and must have previously received treatment with an
      anthracycline and taxane-containing regimen (30 patients) plus trastuzumab (90 patients).
      Patients enrolled must have tumors that overexpress ErbB2, with or without co-expression of
      ErbB1. The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the objective response rate
      (defined as complete response plus partial response). Secondary objectives are to evaluate
      clinical benefit including quality of life parameters, progression-free survival, overall
      survival, time-to-response, response duration, safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamic
      effects on intracellular mediators that regulate tumor cell growth and survival, as well as
      effects on proteomic profile, and circulating levels of extracellular domains of ErbB1 and
      ErbB2 in peripheral blood.
