      of Q/LAIV compared to FluMist in children 2-17 years by comparing the strain-specific
      post-dose geometric mean titers of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies. Children were
      randomized 3:1:1 to receive Q/LAIV or one of two FluMist vaccines. Subjects 9-17 years of age
      received a single dose, and those 2-8 years of age received two doses one month apart. Serum
      was obtained 1 month after dose 1 except in influenza vaccine-naive subjects 2-8 years old,
      when it was obtained after dose 2. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.
