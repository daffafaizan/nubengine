      non-pregnant woman. There is even less data on placental transfer of drug to the neonate when
      medications are given prior to delivery. This study proposes to look at the pharmacokinetics
      of two drugs (Cefazolin and ondansetron) given routinely to pregnant women who are planning
      to deliver via cesarean section. The investigators will evaluate the metabolism of both drugs
      by the pregnant woman, the placental transfer over time, and the subsequent metabolism of the
      transferred drug in the neonate.

      The investigators hope to learn 1) the pk profile of both drugs in pregnancy, and how it
      differs from the non-pregnant woman, 2) the placental transfer of both drugs, and 3) the
      profile of neonatal metabolism of the drug that crosses the placental barrier.
