      carfilzomib for a total of 4 days (Day-9, -8 and Days -2, -1). The first two daily infusions
      will be given at a fixed dose of 20 mg/m2 and the final two doses will be escalated from the
      standard dose of 27 mg/m2 to 56 mg/m2 in a Phase I design, based on toxicity. The busulfan
      will be administered for 2 days over 3 hours from D-7, -6, at 130 mg/m2 . This dose was found
      to be safe and equivalent to the standard daily dose of 3.2 mg/kg. The 3rd and 4th daily
      doses of IV Busulfan will be adjusted in order to yield a systemic plasma drug exposure
      represented by a daily area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of
      approximately 5,000 millimoles-minute per dose (mM-min). These targeted plasma concentration
      of IV busulfan will be based on pharmacokinetics studies performed during the first day of IV
      busulfan. Melphalan will be given at a dose of 140 mg/m2 on Day -3. Each cohort will start
      with a goal of accruing three patients to determine the dose limiting toxicity.
