      administration of photodynamic therapy with Visudyne® and an intravitreal injection of
      ranibizumab. These short term effects will be assessed with visual acuity measurements and
      ophthalmic examinations including indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescein angiography (FA) as
      well as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) measurements. The primary variable for this
      assessment is the incidence of CNV closure one week after combined therapy as assessed with
      high speed ICG angiography. Fluorescein and ICG angiography will be performed using a
      scanning laser ophthalmoscope (HRA). All angiographic studies and OCT examinations will be
      evaluated by the Bern Photographic Reading Center in a masked fashion. Visual acuity
      assessments will be performed with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like
      visual acuity testing charts.

      A secondary objective is to explore the effect of the same-day administration of photodynamic
      therapy with Visudyne® and an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab:

        -  on retinal thickness as measured by OCT over time

        -  in change of total lesion area, area of CNV assessed by FA

        -  in mean change of VA from baseline over time
