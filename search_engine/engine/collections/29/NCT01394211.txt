      I. To determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate at surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate alternative measurements of anti-tumor activity: proportion of patients
      achieving sustained decrease in antigen KI-67 (ki-67) at 12 weeks of therapy with anastrozole
      plus pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride); proportion of patients achieving down-staging to a
      pathologic stage 0 or 1 at surgery.

      II. To assess qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this combination, with special
      emphasis on the frequency of events grade 3 or greater, or the occurrence of unexpected
      toxicities.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride* orally (PO) once daily (QD) and anastrozole PO QD
      for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then
      undergo definitive surgery.

      NOTE: *Pazopanib hydrochloride is stopped 7-14 days before surgery.
