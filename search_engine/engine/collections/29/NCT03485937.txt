    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if pre-operative videos describing the
      patient's forthcoming day in the Mohs clinic decrease pre-operative patient anxiety and
      increase postoperative patient satisfaction, when added to standard of care written and
      verbal instruction.

      Design/Study Type This study will be a randomized control trial in which patients will be
      randomized to either the intervention (pre-operative Mohs Surgery video viewing) or control
      (standard of care) group in order to understand the impact of the video on patient anxiety
      and satisfaction. Patients will be randomized using an Accelerated Biased Coin Design in the
      statistical program R.
