      humans (> 20 kHz) and ultrasonography has been widely used as diagnostic devices for several
      decades. In addition to diagnostic purposes, ultrasound is clinically used for therapeutic
      applications, including tumor ablation, thrombolysis, bone regeneration, and facilitated drug
      delivery. Recently, therapeutic angiogenic effects of low-intensity ultrasound have been
      reported in endothelial cells, chick chorioallantoic membrane, and a rat model of hind limb
      ischemia. the investigators hypothesis low-intensity ultrasound can improve the ailment of
      ASO. In the present study, by evaluating the efficacy and safety of low intensity ultrasonic
      on ASO, to explore the noninvasive auxiliary treatment of ASO. 90 patients were randomly
      divided into 2 groups: A)control group，patients were given Conventional conservative
      treatment: B）treatment group，patients were given Conventional conservative treatment and low
      intensity ultrasonic treatment; Treatments last for 4 weeks, three times a week, stimulation
      was given 8 minutes every time, location of treatment were lower limb ischemia area and its
      surrounding tissues；outcome indicators were recorded Before and 4 weeks after the trial, The
      Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), ankle brachial ratio, the farthest distance Walking,
      percutaneous tissue oxygen tension, tissue oxygenation index recovery time, local skin
      temperature, ultrasonic blood vessels, and muscle enzymes, hepatic and kidney function.

      the investigators speculate after 4 weeks of Low intensity ultrasonic treatment, all the
      observation index of ASO patients can be improved; meanwhile, creatine kinase, liver and
      kidney function, blood in urine routine, electrocardiogram (ecg) has no obvious change.
