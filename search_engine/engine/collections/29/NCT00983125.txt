      available on the French market, (0.625 and 1.25 mg.mL-1 in pre-filled bags), both with
      sufentanil. It appeared that the high concentration was more powerful, however leading in
      some cases to give doses of levobupivacaine superior to the label's recommendations. This
      indicates to use the low concentration, with a risk of a poorer efficacy. Our aim is to show
      that efficacy can be restored with a systematic addition of clonidine, which has documented
      analgesic properties when administered perispinally.
