      it is also greatly limited by insurance coverage, shortage of therapists, and logistic
      constraints. To address this, stroke patients need a rehabilitation method they can use on
      their own, without direct clinical supervision, and for activities of daily living. MyHand is
      a wearable and active hand orthosis consisting of a glove and forearm splint, equipped with
      actuators and tendons which connect to the fingers.
