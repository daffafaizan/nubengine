      and it increases morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure. Amiodarone administration
      is proposed initial agent for prevention and treatment of POAF, but while useful, this drug
      has a number of adverse side-effects and relapse requiring anticoagulation therapy at
      hospital discharge is prevalent. Effective medications are needed with respect to management.
      Minocycline, an old tetracycline antibiotic, has additional effects including inhibition of
      atrial myocyte apoptosis.The finding that apoptosis of right atrial myocytes is thought to be
      one etiologic factor underlying POAF supports examining the hypothesis in this project that
      adding minocycline to amiodarone could favorably reduce POAF frequency rate. Minocycline has
      been used for over four decades and has a good safety profile, therefore this investigation
      is not a phase I trial. With a limited sample size, while the data of our MINAA Exploratory
      trial (the Minocycline Plus Amiodarone Versus Amiodarone Alone for the Prevention of Atrial
      Fibrillation After Cardiac Surgery) were not sufficient to draw definite conclusions, rather
      they suggested feasibility of such therapy in this cohort. In the current pilot study, we
      assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of minocycline plus amiodarone in preventing
      POAF with a larger cohort of two parallel groups (n=40, each) randomly assigned in a 1:1
      ratio.In this trial we compare intravenous minocycline 100 mg daily x 5 days starting
      intra-operatively combined with oral amiodarone (400 mg twice daily for 7 days, then 200 mg
      twice daily for the next 7 days), versus the same dose oral amiodarone alone, for prevention
      of POAF among adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafts, heart valve repair or
      replacement, or combined procedures. All patients receive 150 mg intravenous amiodarone
      intraoperatively and a 2nd similar dose of amiodarone bolus is permitted for tachyarrhythmia
      any time within 24 hours after surgery.The primary outcome is a newly detected POAF by
      telemetry, Holter monitoring, or by daily wireless ECG sensors within 6 weeks from the time
      of randomization. Composite secondary outcomes include death at 30 days, length of hospital
      stay, and other adverse events.To elucidate how minocycline causally elicits its
      pharmacologic effects, sera sampling of biomarkers such as NF-Kappa B, cleaved caspase-3, and
      NT-pro-BNP are measured pre-procedure, then on the 3rd and 5th postoperative days. If the
      proposed intervention is successful, it underscores what can ensue when the target evolves to
      the common population level requiring a nuanced approach pursued by Phase III-IV proposals
