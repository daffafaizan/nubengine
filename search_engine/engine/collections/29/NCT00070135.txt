    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if allogeneic transplantation from a matched sibling or unrelated donor using a
      non-myeloablative preparative regimen results in a 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) that is
      better than historical results using standard chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine 2-year actuarial risks of transplant-related mortality, acute and chronic
      graft-versus-host (GVHD) disease and relapse among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      in first complete remission (CR1) following a non-myeloablative preparative regimen.

      II. To examine recovery of T and B cell number and function following non-myeloablative stem
      cell transplant.

      III. To examine the time course of T, B and myeloid progenitor chimerism following this
      preparative regimen.

      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of intravenous busulfan used in a non-myeloablative
      preparation regimen in AML patients age >= 60 years.

      OUTLINE:

      PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      -7 to -3 and busulfan IV over 2 hours 4 times per day (every 6 hours) on days -4 and -3.

      GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus orally (PO) or IV
      twice daily (BID) on days -2 with taper between days 90-120, and stopping by days 150-180.
      Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and rabbit antithymocyte
      globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -4 through -2.

      ALLOGENEIC PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRASNPLANTATION (PBSC): Patients undergo allogeneic
      PBSC transplant on day 0. Patients then receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) daily
      beginning on day 12 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      for 3 years.
