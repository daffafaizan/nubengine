      Treatment aims at improving or restoring impaired function or at compensating for deficits.
      More recently, computer technology has been integrated into treatment options. In this study,
      a detailed and comprehensive computerized software program for aphasia rehabilitation is
      designed for the treatment of Arabic speaking Egyptian aphasic patients.

      Aim of the study: design a computerized software program for the rehabilitation of Arabic
      speaking Egyptian aphasic patients.

      Subjects: The study was conducted on 50 patients with aphasia who attend the unit of
      Phoniatrics during the period of one year, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Alexandria Main
      University Hospitals.

      Methodology: The training materials were designed as a software program. Each patient was
      subjected to assessment before and after the application of the rehabilitation program.
      Patients were randomized into two groups: group I who received therapy using the software
      aphasia rehabilitation program and group II who received conventional (traditional) language
      therapy. Therapy continued for 48 sessions over six months.
