      disorder (OCD) stigma has been associated to shame, guilty and delay asking for help. The aim
      of the study is to analyze the efficacy of a mobile health application (app) designed to
      increase mental health literacy, help seeking attitudes and reduce stigma associated with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. The app has been named ESTOCMA. It consists in a game in which
      participants are asked to fight against the OCD stigma monster through ten missions.
      Participants have to liberate 10 characters who are prisoners of EsTOCma monster. A
      randomized controlled trial with crossover design will be carried out in non-clinical
      population to assess pre-post changes in levels mental health literacy, help seeking
      attitudes and stigma through app completion (an estimation of 10 days), and after 3 and 6
      months (follow up). Participants from community will be randomly assigned to one of two
      conditions: undertaking immediate-use or delayed use. All participants will be requested to
      complete a set of questionnaires at baseline (T1), after completion of the app (T2), 3 months
      (T3) and 6 months (T4) from baseline. Participants from immediate-use will be asked to use
      the app during 10 days between T1 and T2. Participants from delayed used condition, will use
      the app after T2 evaluation, and will have an extra evaluation after 15 days (T2.1).
