      combinations than with the unfixed combinations. Fixed combinations are better tolerated than
      their respective prostaglandin analogue. However, among the most serious side effects induced
      by PGA are the breaking down of the blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) and the development of
      cystoids macular edema (CME). Also, timolol maleate drops increase protein concentration in
      the human and benzalkonium chloride, eye drops preservative induces anterior chamber
      inflammation. This randomized, masked-observer, prospective clinical trial was approved by
      the Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas, and it adhered to the tenets of the
      Declaration Of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.
