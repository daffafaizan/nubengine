      important functional and structural consequences in skeletal muscle. In muscle fiber is
      observed inflammation and necrosis as a result of lost regenerative capacity. The muscle
      fibers can be replaced by connective and adipose tissue. In a previous study the
      investigators identified that 50% of Duchenne and Becker patients in the range of thirteen
      years old have obesity. In addition, these patients (N=66) have hyperinsulinemia (53.7%) and
      insulin resistance (48.5%). It is well known that obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin
      resistance have a inflammatory background.

      It has been demonstrated that eicosapentaenoic fatty acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic fatty
      acid (DHA) exhibit anti-inflammatory properties and have beneficial effects on obesity,
      hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in children and adolescents.

      Objective: Determine the effect of EPA and DHA on inflammation, obesity and insulin
      resistance in patients with DMD/DMB compared to those receiving placebo.
