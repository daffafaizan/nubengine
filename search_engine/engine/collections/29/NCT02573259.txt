    
      Protocol B8011001 is a Phase 1, two part, open-label, multi center, multiple-dose, safety,
      efficacy, PK, and PD study of PF-06801591 administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneous
      (SC) in previously treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma,
      squamous cell carcinoma head and neck (SCCHN), ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, non-small cell
      lung carcinoma (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumors.

      The first part of the study, Part 1 dose escalation, was designed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of increasing dose levels of IV or SC administered PF-06801591 to establish the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) design.
      Part 2 expansion is designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of 300 mg of
      PF-06801591 administered SC once every 4 weeks in patients with NSCLC or urothelial carcinoma
      as well as confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 1 enrollment has completed,
      enrollment will only be allowed for Part 2.
