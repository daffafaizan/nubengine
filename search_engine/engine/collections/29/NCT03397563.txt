    
      This is a single center study carried out in collaboration between the neurological,
      neurophysiological and thoracic departments at St. Olavs Hospital in Trondheim.

      Participants will keep sleep and headache diaries in a baseline period of 4 weeks, then
      receive treatment (CPAP or sham-CPAP at nighttime) during 8 weeks, have a 4 week wash out
      period followed by a second treatment period of 8 weeks (CPAP or sham-CPAP). Finally there
      will be follow-up during 1 month.

      Throughout the whole study (7 months) participants keep a headache diary. Participants must
      maintain current preventive and sleep medication regimens during the whole study period, and
      may use acute medication of choice (sumatriptan, oxygen or other).

      Sleep registration in all participants will be done by polysomnography(PSG). An Ultra Wide
      Band radar/movement sensor device will be used to detect sleep patterns, together with wrist
      pulse oximetry and wrist actigraphy during PSG and the last week of each treatment period.

      Neurophysiologic tests such as temperature and pressure thresholds will be measured before
      PSG and after each treatment period.
