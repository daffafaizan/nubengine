      at least one systemic treatment regimen. The therapeutic regimen is temozolomide, 300mg,po,
      d1-5, apatinib, 500 mg, qd, po, d1-28, Every 28 days for 1 cycles, the primary end point was
      PFS, the secondary end point was OS, DCR, ORR etc. So we plan to investigate the safety and
      efficacy of apatinib combined with temozolomide in the treatment of advanced melanoma
      patients.
