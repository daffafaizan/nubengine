      clinicopathologic features on prognosis has been examined, but the relationship between
      cytologic features obtained by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and prognosis has been minimally
      studied. We retrospectively studied the cytologic features with computerized morphometry in
      83 patients with usual-type papillary thyroid cancer and followed them for more than 10 years
      except for one with metastasis at diagnosis. The cytologic features of FNA and recurrence of
      cancer were examined statistically.
