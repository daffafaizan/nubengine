      (Enterolactis® duo) effect on overall abdominal pain, bowel movements and other abdominal
      symptoms and on neuropsychological performance in patients with Parkinson's Disease. The
      investigators suppose that, due to the immunomodulatory action of probiotics, overall
      neuropsychological function will improve as well as due also to prebiotic abdominal symptoms
      will decrease following consumption of Lactobacillus casei DG (Enterolactis® duo).
