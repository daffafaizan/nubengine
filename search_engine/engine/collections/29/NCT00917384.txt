    
      Placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 study of participants with metastatic gastric cancer
      [including adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)] and disease progression on
      standard first-line chemotherapeutic regimens. Participants will be randomized on a 2:1 basis
      to receive best supportive care plus ramucirumab administered every 2 weeks or best
      supportive care plus placebo administered every 2 weeks, respectively. Participants will
      undergo radiographic assessment of disease status every 6 weeks. Participant will be treated
      until there is evidence of progressive disease, toxicity requiring cessation, withdrawal of
      consent, or until other withdrawal criteria are met.

      Approximately 348 participants, with histologically- or cytologically-confirmed, metastatic
      gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, and radiographically measurable disease as defined by the
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors or evaluable, nonmeasurable disease, will be
      randomized. Participants will be enrolled from approximately 250 study centers in North
      America, South America, Central America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.
