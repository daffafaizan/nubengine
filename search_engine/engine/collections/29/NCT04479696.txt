      I. To determine if provision of a neuro-imaging referenced symptom (NIRS) video intervention
      for patients starting radiotherapy for newly diagnosed primary brain tumors reduces patient
      anxiety during radiation compared to standard of care information.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if provision of a NIRS video intervention for patients starting radiotherapy
      for newly diagnosed primary brain tumors reduces caregiver anxiety during radiation compared
      to standard of care information.

      II. To determine if any changes in patient or caregiver anxiety early during radiation are
      sustained after the completion of radiation.

      III. To investigate whether changes in anxiety are associated with changes in quality of life
      and distress in patients.

      IV. To investigate whether patients perceive the NIRS intervention to have been helpful in
      understanding possible tumor and treatment symptoms.

      OUTLINE: Patients and their caregivers are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (NIRS VIDEO): Patients receive standard of care verbal and written education materials.
      Patients also receive a customized NIRS video which includes a description of each their
      tumor, functional areas of the brain affected, and possible symptoms from the tumor and
      radiation treatment based on the neuro-imaging features. Patients and their caregivers watch
      the video together or separately over 1.5-3 minutes before the end of the first week of
      radiation treatment. Within 2 weeks after watching the NIRS video, patients complete an
      optional survey over 5-10 minutes.

      ARM II (STANDARD OF CARE EDUCATION): Patients receive standard of care verbal and written
      education materials.

      After completion of radiation treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
