      carbohydrate (HFHC) meal on inflammatory mechanisms at the molecular level in humans, in vivo
      versus HFHC meal plus fiber. HFHC meal includes egg muffin, sausage muffin sandwiches and two
      hash browns. The Investigators have previously shown that the intake of one HFHC meal leads
      to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the expression of p47, the key
      subunit of NADPH oxidase, with a concomitant increase in intranuclear nuclear factor ÎºB
      (NFkB) binding. More recently, the investigators have also shown that HFHC meal leads to an
      increase in plasma endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) concentrations along with an increase
      in the expression of Toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4), the receptor for endotoxin, and TLR-2, the
      receptor for several products of Gram positive bacteria. In addition, it also causes an
      increase in lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), the protein which facilitates the
      binding of LPS to CD14 and TLR-4. Finally, HFHC meal also induces an increase in the
      expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling- 3 (SOCS-3) in the mononuclear cells (MNC)
      (1), which interferes with insulin signal transduction and contributes to the pathogenesis of
      insulin resistance. In contrast, an AHA meal does not induce these effects. These
      observations are important since HFHC meal not only induces oxidative stress and inflammation
      but also lays the foundations of (2) a potentially greater response to an inflammatory
      challenge through the induction of an increase in LPS concentrations and the expression of
      TLR-4 and TLR-2; and (3) insulin resistance through the induction of SOCS-3, TLR-4 and TLR-2.
