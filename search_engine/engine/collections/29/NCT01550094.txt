      blocks for your foot or ankle procedure. A nerve block involves injecting numbing medications
      around a nerve to decrease pain after surgery. An ultrasound machine is often used to help
      see the nerve before injecting the numbing medicine. When an ultrasound machine is used
      during a block it is called an ultrasound-guided block.

      Many studies of ultrasound-guided nerve blocks have involved mostly thin patients, especially
      from foreign countries. This study is different because the investigators are looking at
      patients living in America with a body mass index (a measure of the amount of body fat a
      person has) of more than 35.

      The Sciatic nerve is a large nerve that provides most of the feeling and all of the movement
      to the foot and ankle. The nerve travels under the back of the leg, and splits into two
      smaller nerves slightly above the knee.
