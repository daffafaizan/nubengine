      decompensated heart failure (ADHF) are common and portend poor prognosis. Low dose dopamine
      infusion improves renal perfusion. Whether dopamine infusion improves diuresis and/or reduces
      renal complication in ADHF is not known. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of
      high-dose furosemide (HDF, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion of
      20 mg/h for a total of 8 hours) vs. low-dose furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine
      (LDFD, 40 mg furosemide bolus IV, followed by continuous IV infusion of 5 mg/h furosemide
      plus 5Î¼g/kg/min dopamine for a total of 8 hours) on diuresis, renal function, electrolyte
      balance, and 60-day post-discharge outcomes in patients hospitalized with ADHF.
