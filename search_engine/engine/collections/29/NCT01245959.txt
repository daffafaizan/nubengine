    
      Patients presented with non-keratinizing NPC and stage T3-4N1M0/TxN2-3M0 are randomly
      assigned to receive induction chemotherapy (docetaxel+cisplatin+fluorouracil) plus concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (investigational arm) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (control arm).
      Patients in both arms receive radical radiotherapy, and cisplatin (100mg/m2) every three
      weeks for three cycles during radiotherapy. Patients in the investigational arm receive
      docetaxel(60mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin (60mg/m2 on day 1) and fluorouracil (600mg/m2 on Days
      1 to 5) every three weeks for three cycles before the radiotherapy. Patients are stratified
      according to the treatment centers and stage. The primary end point is failure-free survival
      (FFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival
      (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), initial response rates after treatments
      and toxic effects. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population;
      the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
