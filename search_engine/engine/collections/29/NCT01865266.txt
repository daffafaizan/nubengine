      was diagnosed VAP during mechanic ventilation in ICU,a sealed envelop will be opened which
      decide whether the patient is assigned to the normal dose ulinastatin group,the high dose
      ulinastatin group or the compare group.

      VAP diagnosis and treatment accord with the "Comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice
      guidelines for ventilator-associated pneumonia:Diagnosis and treatment" which was published
      in 2008 by Canadian critical care trials group.

      The aim of the present study is to determine the efficacy of ulinastatin for the treatment of
      ventilator-associated Pneumonia(VAP) and to investigate the effect to inflammatory factors in
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid .
