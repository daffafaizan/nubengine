      successful orthopedic surgical treatments. The majority of the patients gain pain relief and
      experience improved hip function. In 2017, a total of 10,691 THRs were implanted in Denmark
      (annual report 2018).

      Hip dislocation is a known complication after THR. It is a painful condition which may have
      far-reaching consequences for the patient, who may experience both physical and mental
      discomfort. Ultimately, multiple hip dislocations may result in reoperation.

      In the literature, the incidence of hip dislocation is reported at 2-6 %, and a more recent
      review reports a risk of 0.5-10 %.

      In Denmark, recurrent hip dislocation is the cause of 21 % of the reoperations per year
      according to The Danish Hip Arthroplasty Register. According to the British National Joint
      Registry (NJR) and the Australian register (AOANJRR), hip dislocation is the cause of 15.5 %
      and 21 %, respectively, of the reoperations.

      The best method to avoid reoperation due to instability is to choose the correct implant for
      the individual patient and thereby spare the patient of having to endure a painful
      complication and yet another procedure. There are multiple risk factors for instability after
      THR, and increased use of dual mobility cups (DMC) is already documented.
