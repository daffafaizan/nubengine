      etiology affecting medium-sized and large arteries usually accompanied or preceded by
      systemic inflammation. Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the p19
      sub-unit of human interleukin (IL)-23 with high affinity and blocks binding of extracellular
      IL-23 to cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL 23 specific intracellular signaling and
      subsequent activation and cytokine production. It is used in treatment of psoriatic
      arthritis, generalized pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis. The study consists of a
      screening period (less than or equal to (<=) 6 weeks), double-blind treatment period (48
      weeks), and safety follow-up period (12 weeks). This study will evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC)
      administered guselkumab in combination with a 26-week GC taper regimen for the treatment of
      active new-onset or relapsing GCA in adult participants. The total duration of the study is
      up to 66 weeks.
