    
      Approximately 18 subjects across 5 US sites will be enrolled in the study.

      Subjects will enter a screening period of up to 28 days, followed by continuous twice daily
      administration of LYC-55716 in 28 day treatment cycles. Subjects will also be administered
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks as prescribed as standard of care by the Investigator in
      accordance with the package insert.

      The study will begin with a run-in cohort of 3 subjects to assess the safety and tolerability
      of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination. Subjects in the run-in cohort will be enrolled
      singly at intervals of not less than 7 days in order to monitor for adverse reactions to the
      combination. If no subjects in the run-in cohorts has a DLT, then the study may proceed to
      the main cohort (15 subjects).

      Subjects will receive combination treatment until clinically significant disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity, or up to a maximum of 24 months.

      Primary Study Objectives:

      Run-in Cohort

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination

        -  Determine the dose of LYC-55716 that is adequately tolerated when used in combination
           with pembrolizumab

      Main Study Cohort

      â€¢ Further evaluate the safety and tolerability of the LYC-55716/pembrolizumab combination

      Secondary Study Objectives:

      Main Study Cohort

        -  Evaluate the cellular immune response in paired tumor biopsy samples

        -  Evaluate effects on circulating biomarkers in the blood of LYC-55716 with pembrolizumab

        -  Determine the objective response rate

        -  Determine the duration of response

        -  Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
