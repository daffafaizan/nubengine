      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum tolerated dose of BB-10901 in
           patients with relapsed and/or refractory CD56-positive multiple myeloma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of BB-10901 administered on
           this schedule.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BB-10901.

        -  To recommend a dose for Phase II clinical studies with BB-10901 given on this specific
           regimen.

        -  To observe any evidence of anti-tumor activity with BB-10901.

      Objectives of MTD Expansion Cohort

        -  To evaluate response rate including overall response rate (ORR) and complete response
           rate (CRR), and duration of response (DOR).

        -  To further assess time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), and
           overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive BB-10901 IV over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BB-10901 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 40 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for short term follow-up and long
      term (up to 3 years) survival status.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
