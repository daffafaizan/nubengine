      dose-finding study.

      The patients voluntarily signed the informed consent form of the clinical study and underwent
      a screening. After completing the four-week run-in period, they were randomly assigned to
      either a placebo group or one of the three SK3530 groups: 50mg, 100mg, and 150mg. The study
      was conducted in a double-blind manner. A different dose of SK3530 was administered to the
      subjects depending on the assigned treatment group for 8 weeks. Patient's visit took place at
      week 4 and week 8 after randomization and at 6 or 7days after end of study.
