    
      Patients: All patients with a diagnosis of dementia under follow-up at the out-patient clinic
      are invited to participate, if giving a written consent.

      Method: a semi-structured interview is undertaken by the doctor at the end of the
      consultation. Patients and their company are asked to name their alternative medicines (if
      any), for how long the products have been used, where and how they learned about the
      products, ant to tell about their experiences with the products (i.e if they have noticed
      effects or side-effects). After the consultation information of the the actual product's
      contents and properties are obtained and an assessment of possible interactions with the
      patient's other drugs (prescriptions and self-reported use of over-the-counter drugs) is
      made. Reported effects or side-effects are registered.
