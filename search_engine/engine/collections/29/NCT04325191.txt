      organizations such as the American Heart Association and the Dietary Guidelines for
      Americans. Excess dietary sodium damages the inside of our blood vessels in a process known
      as endothelial dysfunction. This reduces the ability of blood vessels to dilate as much. This
      type of dysfunction can lead to the development of cardiovascular disease. Animal and human
      studies have identified one potential mechanism linking high sodium consumption and
      endothelial dysfunction; that is oxidative stress. Furthermore, high dietary sodium
      consumption has been shown to increase blood pressure reactivity in animal studies. Melatonin
      is a powerful endogenous antioxidant that has reduced oxidative stress levels in clinical and
      healthy populations. Melatonin has been shown to attenuate sympathetic responses, but
      research is limited. Whether supplementation of melatonin can offset the deleterious effects
      of a high sodium diet is unknown. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the
      effect of melatonin supplementation compared to a placebo on markers of oxidative stress and
      blood vessel function in healthy young adults that consume a 10-day high sodium diet. Our
      hypotheses are that: 1) melatonin will reduce oxidative stress levels and restore blood
      vessel function and 2) melatonin will reduce the sympathetic nerve response to high sodium
      consumption.
