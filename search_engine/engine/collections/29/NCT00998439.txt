      Current treatments for In Stent Restenosis (ISR) are 'uncoated balloon only' angioplasty with
      conventional balloons (POBA), Bare Metal Stent (BMS) implantations, cutting balloons,
      rotablation and atherectomy. Their respective results to lower target vessel
      revascularizations were in part unsatisfactory and often conflicting. Also the temporary use
      of brachytherapy lead to late lumen loss (LLL) findings in the range from 0.22 ± 0.84 mm.
      Therefore, brachytherapy to treat ISR has also been abandoned because of the associated
      delayed endothelialization leading to late thrombosis.

      The use of drug eluting stents (DES) to treat ISR lowered restenosis rates in the single
      digit range. Recently, the use of matrix coated paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheters
      (SeQuent® Please, Paccocath Technology®, Bayer/Schering & B.Braun Melsungen AG) was compared
      to PES in the PEPCAD II trial which showed significantly lower 6-month LLL, 6-month MACE and
      TVR rates for SeQuent® Please (7.25%) as compared to PES for which the 12-month TVR rate was
      19.0% and therefore in agreement with prior studies (ISAR DESIRE). Since these assessments
      were done in patients with BMS in-stent restenosis, it is of paramount interest to study
      in-stent restenosis of failed DES implantations since they may cause continued chronic
      inflammatory responses caused by the non-bioabsorbable polymer in particular once the drug
      release has ceased.
