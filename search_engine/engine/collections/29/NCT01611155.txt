      I. To explore whether venlafaxine can prevent or ameliorate chronic, cumulative neurotoxicity
      associated with oxaliplatin in cancer patients receiving oxaliplatin, fluorouracil,
      leucovorin calcium (FOLFOX).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether venlafaxine can ameliorate acute neuropathy associated with
      oxaliplatin.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether venlafaxine can increase the cumulative oxaliplatin doses that can be
      delivered without dose-limiting chronic neurotoxicity.

      II. To explore whether venlafaxine causes adverse events in this setting. III. To explore
      whether the neuropathy data provided by the Rydel-Seiffer graduated tuning fork is consistent
      with patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
      (CIPN) and whether this tool might cause different results in patients receiving venlafaxine
      versus placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive venlafaxine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning on day 1 of and
      continuing through completion of FOLFOX.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID beginning on day 1 of and continuing through
      completion of FOLFOX.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months.
