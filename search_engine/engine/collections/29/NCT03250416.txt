      collected the data at beginning and first stage of noninvasive ventilation to analyze the
      efficacy of noninvasive ventilation. To manage the noninvasive ventilation easily, the
      investigator also aimed to develop a scale to predict the efficacy of noninvasive
      ventilation, and used this scale to guide clinicians how to use noninvasive ventilation.
