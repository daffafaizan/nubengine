      for apnoea indices (AI), hypopnoea indices (HI), respiratory disturbance indices (RDI) and
      respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) and to perform subgroup analyses focusing on the
      inclusion/exclusion of central apnoea patients, BMI levels, CPAP device brands, pressure
      titration modes, use of a predetermined and fixed pressure level or not, and the impact of a
      4%-PSG desaturation criteria versus 3%-PSG on index accuracy.
