      concentrations in blood and tissues, is one of the most important interventions in critically
      ill patients with infections.1,2 Cefepime is a fourth generation cephalosporin with broad
      spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria that is used as empirical and directed
      therapy for severe infections like sepsis and pneumonia. Nevertheless, administration of
      adequate antibiotic doses is a real challenge in critically ill patients because the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of these drugs may be influenced by the complex pathophysiological
      changes that occur during sepsis.2 Recent reviews described the enormous pharmacokinetic
      variability of beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill patients.3,4 Therefore, strategies
      for dose individualization are explored in an attempt to better control a patient's exposure
      to the antibiotic, thereby potentially improving the prognosis of critically ill patients
      with infection. On the one hand, several smaller studies have already shown that better
      outcomes for critically ill patients can be expected with higher drug exposures, at least for
      less severely ill patients.5,6 This conclusion was supported by the DALI study, a large
      multi-center prospective study.7 On the other hand, it was shown that insufficient antibiotic
      exposure may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.8 This link was initially shown
      with inappropriately low quinolone exposures, but more recently with other classes of
      antibiotics including beta-lactams.9,10 In addition to ensuring that plasma levels are high
      enough for optimal antimicrobial activity and suppressing emergence of resistance,
      individualized dosing might offer a perspective to prevent potential side-effects originating
      from toxic plasma levels. This seems particularly relevant for cefepime, a beta-lactam
      antibiotic, as it was shown that cefepime is an underappreciated cause of neurotoxicity,
      especially in intensive care unit (ICU) patients,11,12 patients with impaired renal
      function,13-16 and patients with brain disorders.17 Population pharmacokinetic models provide
      a quantitative view of the effect of particular individual factors on the plasma
      concentration time profile of a drug. Population PK models thereby help to establish
      individual treatment regimen in patients, depending on the specific patient covariates that
      were included in the model. As cefepime is a hydrophilic compound, drug elimination is mainly
      determined by renal clearance and to a lesser extent by non-renal clearance. Therefore, renal
      markers have been explored as the main determinant to predict cefepime variability in
      population PK models.18-24 However, none of the published PK models was developed using both
      plasma and urinary data, though having access to both matrices may be an advantage to
      identify clinically relevant covariates. Moreover, only creatinine-based markers were used as
      covariates and, up to now, it was unclear whether the newer markers to assess renal function
      (e.g. cystatine C, uromodulin and Kidney Injury Moleclure-1 (KIM-1)) are more accurate to
      predict cefepime clearance.

      In this study, a clinical trial was conducted to develop a population PK model for cefepime
      in critically ill patients assessing renal and non-renal clearance separately, based on both
      plasma and urinary cefepime concentrations. This model then served as a tool to compare the
      adequacy of six different renal markers as predictors for renal cefepime clearance. After
      integrating the most adequate predictor into the PK model, the final model was used to
      evaluate current dose recommendations for cefepime.
