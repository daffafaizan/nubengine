    
      BACKGROUND:

      -Adult patients (greater than or equal to 18 yrs of age) with tumors of the central nervous
      system who are being evaluated by the Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) for National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) primary research protocols will be entered onto this screening protocol for
      eligibility screening.

      OBJECTIVE:

      - Evaluate patients with tumors of the Central Nervous System (CNS) for eligibility in
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) research protocols.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      - Patients with tumors of the CNS or a history of a CNS tumor who are being evaluated for
      protocols within the National Cancer Institute.

      DESIGN:

        -  The screening tests and procedures that are required by the primary research protocols
           will be conducted in order to establish eligibility for these protocols.

        -  These procedures may include, but are not limited to, laboratory tests on blood, CSF,
           urine, or other specimens, and radiographic and nuclear medicine studies, which may
           require the administration of contrast or a radioisotopic tracer.

        -  This protocol will also allow for evaluation of existing tumor specimens to determine if
           targets are present, when applicable.

        -  In some cases, specific research samples required for the primary research protocol may
           be collected during the screening process in order to prevent us from having to subject
           the patient to a painful procedure on multiple occasions (e.g., bone marrow
           aspirations).

        -  Research specimens will be discarded, if the patient is not eligible for or elects not
           to enroll on the primary research protocol. A total of 3000 patients will be enrolled.
