      lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation, increased LES tone, and aperistalsis of the
      esophagus. The standard surgical treatment for achalasia is laparoscopic Heller Myotomy
      (LHM). A recent meta-analysis of 105 studies reporting on 7855 patients demonstrated that
      laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the most effective and long-lasting therapy for achalasia.
      Superior to Endoscopic balloon dilatation or Botulinumtoxin injection LHM has a one year
      therapeutic efficacy in approximately 90% of patients. Recently an endoscopic technique
      emulating the principles of LHM was developed. This technique of a purely endoscopic myotomy
      has been demonstrated by Pasricha et al. in animal experiments and Inoue et al. reported the
      first clinical study. Other pilot studies and a larger international multi-center trial have
      replicated promising results for POEM.

      Uncontrolled studies show promising short and mid term results for POEM. At present, POEM is
      considered a promising new technique with the potential to become a standard achalasia
      treatment. For this to happen, however, comparative data with LHM is required. Our study
      group intends to investigate the short and long-term efficacy of POEM for the treatment of
      achalasia as it was performed in international centers and compare outcomes with database
      assessment of LHM.
