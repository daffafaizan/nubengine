      events. Peripheral waveforms have been correlated to central waveforms. Peripheral waveforms
      can be easily measured through applanation tonometry. In this study the investigators
      hypothesize:

        1. That previously established peripheral tonometry techniques would apply to patients with
           advanced heart failure, including continuous flow LVADs and facilitate serial evaluation
           of central hemodynamics without invasive monitoring.

        2. That temporary changes in LVAD speed will be evident in frequency spectrum analysis of
           peripheral, non-invasive waveforms.

        3. That clinical events involving LVAD will have characteristic frequency spectra.
