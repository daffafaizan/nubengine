      reduced pain, lower morbidity, faster recovery and a shorter hospital stay. However, the
      optimal postoperative pain management method for patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery is still under evaluation and most of the recommendations are based on studies
      performed in open approach procedures.

      Recently, the analgesic effect of pregabalin, as a part of a multimodal analgesia, has been
      evaluated in many studies. They have shown that pregabalin may have a role in the post
      operative pain management, as an adjunct. Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and anxiolytic
      drug, which have a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile from its predecessor gabapentin.
