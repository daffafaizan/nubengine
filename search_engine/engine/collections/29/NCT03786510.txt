      strategy involving intensive and maintenance programs aimed at reducing the risk of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) in at-risk older adults.

      DESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled trial with participants assigned to three
      parallel programs: intensive plus maintenance (INT+MNT), intensive only (INT-only), and
      active control.

      SETTING: A community center for dementia in South Korea.

      PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (aged â‰¥ 60 years) without dementia, but having
      several risk factors for AD.

      MEASUREMENTS: The study subjects participated in a 4-week intensive group-based lifestyle
      modification program that focused on physical activity, vascular risk factors, dietary
      habits, cognitive activities, and social engagement. Then, the participants underwent a
      20-week maintenance program to consolidate modified habits. Linear mixed models were used to
      examine the changes in modified Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index
      (ANU-ADRI) scores in each group. Additional analyses of secondary outcomes, including
      cognitive function, were also performed.
