    
      Neuroimaging examinations will include:

        -  Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging for assessment of Brain Tissue Pulsatility (BTP)
           which reflects reactivity in brain movements and mechanical brain properties

        -  MRI with structural and functional assessments, namely brain volumes, white matter
           lesions, ASL for brain perfusion and BOLD for resting-state connectivity and brain
           pulsatility

      MRI will be performed before and after a single one-hour exposure of 50%N2O/50%O2 mixture.
      Ultrasound will be performed before, after and also during gas exposure. Changes in these
      neuroimaging parameters will constitute the primary assessment of the study. Psychometric and
      safety assessements will complete the neuroimaging outcomes.

      Follow-up will includes 1) a baseline visit for baseline MRI and Psychometric assessements,
      2) a second visit for gas exposure and neuroimaging assessements, 3) a third and fourth
      visits for psychometric and safety assessements, respectively 24 hours and one week after gas
      exposure.
