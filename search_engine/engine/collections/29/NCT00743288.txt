      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the dose-limiting toxicities
           (DLT) of panobinostat in combination with melphalan in patients with relapsed or
           refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the dose of this regimen to be used in the Phase II portion of the study.
           (Phase I)

        -  To determine the efficacy as evidenced by the response rate (combined complete response,
           very good partial response, partial response, and minimal response) in patients treated
           with this regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination of LBH589 and melphalan
           for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  To determine time to disease progression, time to response, and duration of response in
           patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  To determine progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive oral panobinostat once daily on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 and oral
      melphalan once daily on days 1, 3 and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
