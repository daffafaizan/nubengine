      treatment of head and neck cancer remains being the most problematic and irreversible
      complication despite its low incidence with no medical treatment to limit or reduce symptoms.

      Clinical trials conducted to date have shown a significant scientific evidence that the
      treatment with pentoxifylline + tocopherol achieves a certain effectiveness in the treatment
      of the tissue fibrosis that have been irradiated based on the properties of this drugs in
      increased tissue oxygenation and their antioxidant effect.

      The aim of this study is to determine if there is a clinical improvement of mandibular
      osteoradionecrosis using Pentoxifylline in combination with Tocopherol as treatment because,
      currently, there is no effective treatment to achieve bone healing and/or a symptomatic
      improvement.
