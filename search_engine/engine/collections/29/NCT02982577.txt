      and after a washout period of a month, use a spray without pilocarpine for another three
      months; Group 2 (G2) - will use a spray without pilocarpine for three months and after a
      washout period of a month, use a spray with pilocarpine for another three months (in a
      randomized, controlled, duble blind and crossover study). Participants will be submitted to
      OHIP-14, Xerostomia Inventory (XI) and salivary flow measurement before the start of therapy
      - baseline (T0), one (T2), two (T3) and three (T4) months after starting the use of spray,
      after washout, crossover occurs and the same parameters are measured for the same periods
      (T0', T2', T3' and T4'), and is measured one hour after the saliva (T1 and T1') baseline.
