      nervous system, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junctions and muscles by the distant
      influence of the tumor. No tumor cells are visible in the neuropathy. The disease is a rare
      clinical syndrome, and lung cancer is the most common type of tumor that causes PNS.If PNS
      can be diagnosed when there are no tumor symptoms, not only can the cause of PNS be
      identified, but early tumors can be found for treatment time, and measures can be taken in
      the early stages of the tumor to improve survival. Tumor free DNA (cell-free DNA, cfDNA)
      methylation detection is to determine the cancer condition and cancer type of the subject by
      detecting the methylation of free DNA released by tumor cells. In normal cells, tumor
      suppressor genes are expressed and proto-oncogenes are silenced; in tumor cells, tumor
      suppressor genes are hypermethylated and silenced, and oncogenes are hypomethylated and
      activated. The release of free DNA into the blood will be quickly cleared in tens of minutes
      to several hours, which can reflect the body's cell damage in real time, and is of great
      significance for monitoring the early occurrence and development of the disease. At present,
      the sensitivity of lung cancer cf-DNA detection technology is close to 100%, and the
      specificity is 94%, which is an effective detection technology for early detection of lung
      cancer.
