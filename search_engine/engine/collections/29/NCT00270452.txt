      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative diseases represent a wide group of bone
      marrow stem cell malignancies. Some patients can be cured with chemotherapy or by allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation. However, a proportion of patients progress following chemotherapy
      and some relapse after transplantation. Therefore, there is need for studies of
      investigational agents to improve management of these patients.

      The immunological graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect seen after allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation suggests that stimulating the patient's own T cell responses to MDS and
      leukemia with a vaccine might also retard disease progression and even achieve disease
      remissions. WT1 and PR1 were identified as target antigens because both antigens are highly
      expressed by CD34+ stem cells of most patients with myeloid malignancies but not by normal
      marrow cells. An immunotherapeutic approach to vaccinate against PR1 and WT1 antigens could
      induce T cell response against MDS and leukemic cells while sparing normal cells and by using
      a combination of two antigens the risk of disease escape by antigen down regulation should be
      further diminished.

      Therefore, we propose to evaluate a vaccine composed of peptides derived from two proteins
      over-expressed in MDS and leukemia stem cells - proteinase 3 (PR1) and Wilms tumor-1 (WT1).
      This protocol, the first in a series of planned research, will evaluate the safety of a
      single dose of a combination of two peptide vaccines, namely PR1:169-177 and WT-1:126-134 in
      Montanide adjuvant administered concomitantly with GM-CSF (Sargramostim) in select subjects
      diagnosed with MDS, AML and CML.
