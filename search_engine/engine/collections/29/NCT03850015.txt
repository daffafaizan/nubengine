      and will undergo imaging using 2 ultrasound systems. Standard clinical system (Philips IE33)
      will be used for 2D and CE imaging, followed by imaging using the Verasonics VantageTM
      research system (Verasonics Inc., Redmond, WA), using both conventional 2D and HFR modes.

      Baseline unenhanced 2D and Doppler images would initially be acquired using Philips IE33
      system and Verasonics VatangeTM unenhanced conventional 2D and HFR mode .

      Ultrasound contrast agent (Sonovue) will be then injected via the intravenous (iv) cannula
      and 3 sets rest contrast images will be acquired - using the Phillips IE33, Verasonics and
      Verasonics VantageTM platform (conventional CE and HFR CE). Both systems will be optimised
      separately on each patient before and during infusion of contrast agent. When the optimal
      imaging and destruction parameters are set, there are not modified along the acquisition.

      This is followed by dipyridamole infusion and the scans being repeated during stress - 3 sets
      contrast images will be acquired - using the Philips IE33 and Verasonics VantageTM platform
      (conventional CE and HFR CE).
