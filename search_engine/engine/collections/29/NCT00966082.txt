      rebleeding. Recently several studies compared the efficacy of EBL alone and with a
      combination of propranolol and EBL. However, the results of recent studies showed
      discrepancy. In addition, most of all recent studies included patients without previous
      endoscopic treatment for varices. This study is performed to compare the efficacy and safety
      of EBL alone and EBL combined with propranolol in patients who were previously performed
      endoscopic variceal treatment.
