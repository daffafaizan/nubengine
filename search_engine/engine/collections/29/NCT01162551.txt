      of acute leukemia while on therapy have 5-20% of long-term survival. Newer, targeted agents
      need to be identified and integrated into the present cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.
      Biologically targeted cancer agents, including signal transduction inhibitors like mammalian
      target of rapamycin inhibitors (MTIs), have shown great promise in treating hematologic
      malignancies. A Phase 1 trial of sirolimus (an MTI) alone performed at CHOP has been well
      tolerated with no DLTs and has evidence of hitting the biologic target. While signal
      transduction inhibitors may be efficacious as single agents, it is more likely that these
      targeted agents will demonstrate greater efficacy in combination with other cytotoxic
      agents.Based upon pre-clinical humanized ALL mouse models we propose to study the toxicity
      and efficacy of adding sirolimus to oral methotrexate in relapsed and refractory patients.

      Patients < 25 years of age, at time of enrollment, with second or greater relapse of ALL or
      NHL (lymphoblastic lymphoma or peripheral T-cell lymphoma) are eligible. ALL patients must
      have at least 10% blasts in their marrow and NHL patients must have radiologic or physical
      evidence of recurrence.

      Patients will be started on daily oral sirolimus that is dosed based upon goal trough levels
      and weekly oral methotrexate. All therapy can be done as an outpatient.
