      diameter) which can be applied to the skin over the liver, in the armpit, or over the neck
      blood vessels of an infant. ThermoSpot was designed as a non-invasive hypothermia indicator
      for infants. The device changes color when the baby's core body temperature changes, allowing
      it to be understood even by a non-literate parent. It has been tested and proven to
      accurately detect hypothermia in Malawi, Nepal and India. However, no large-scale studies
      have been performed on babies exposed to ambient temperatures for long periods such as those
      under FSPT.

      The main objective of the project is to determine whether ThermoSpot can be used to detect
      hypothermia or hyperthermia in babies receiving FSPT instead of thermometers. The ability of
      a parent to respond in a timely manner to the temperature indicator will help provide
      critical information on technical, as well as educational components required for FSPT
      scale-up in Nigeria and other resource-limited countries with health worker shortage.

      Specific objectives

        1. Compare the performance of ThermoSpot in the detection of hypothermia or hyperthermia
           with the standard axillary thermometer measurement.

        2. Determine if parents are able to correctly interpret the color indicators on ThermoSpot

        3. Determine whether parents carry out the appropriate action based on the ThermoSpot
           indicator.
