      with a diagnosis of pancreatitis admitted to surgical wards or ICUs at the First Affiliated
      Hospital with Nanjing Medical University and Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military
      Command from January 1, 2009, to October 31, 2015. Inclusion criteria were adult patients
      (age >18 years) with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Exclusion criteria were as follows : 1)
      lack of radiologic evidence to diagnose acute necrotizing pancreatitis, 2) presence of ARDS
      before admission to hospitals, 3) unable to partner treatment and leaving hospitals, 4)
      transferring to the investigators' hospitals after treatment, 5) missing other necessary

      For enrolled patients, general clinical characteristics were collected. Patients were
      categorized into two groups according to ARDS or non-ARDS, and the differences of these
      characteristics between two groups were evaluated. Potential risk factors were collected and
      studied by using multiple logistic regression analysis.
