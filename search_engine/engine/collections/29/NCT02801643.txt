      resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in healthy subjects. In 20 healthy adults, the
      investigators will examine DA release (measured using positron emission tomography, PET) in
      the ventral striatum, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex, as previously described. Before and
      after the task the investigators will examine RSFC (measured using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging, fMRI) between these structures, which have been shown to form functional
      pathways serving motivation and emotion regulation in rodents and nonhuman primates. The
      investigators hypothesize that DA release will impact the functional relationship between
      these and other structures as determined by changes in RSFC.

      Aim 2. To examine the relationship between dopamine release and the Reward Positivity (RewP)
      potential. Subjects will be presented with the option to participate in an event-related
      potential (ERP) study. The investigators will correlate the amount of DA release with the
      amplitude of the RewP potential, an ERP that is enhanced in reward versus non-reward
      circumstances. Based on previous studies, the investigators hypothesize that RewP amplitude
      will positively correlate with dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.
