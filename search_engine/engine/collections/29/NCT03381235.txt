      degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Exercise has also shown to improve
      conditions the eye such as macular degenerations, glaucoma, and cataracts. Mice with retinal
      degeneration which were exposed to exercise showed that it helped to slow the rate of
      degeneration. The purpose of this study is to look in humans at the relationship between
      moderate or little exercise and their potential effects on the retina in patients with
      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP).
