      tympanoplasties compared with the effect of the hemostatic sponge at the hospital of
      specialties Western Medical Center.

      Material and Methods: Clinical trial with single blind, parallel-groups and randomized
      assignation. There were included patients with a diagnosis of tympanic perforation,
      candidates for surgical treatment by performing only microscopic tympanoplasties, which
      fulfilled the selection criteria. The main variable of the study was the integrity of the
      graft.

      The statistical analysis was performed according to the nature of variables, for continuous
      data using measures of central tendency and dispersion and for the qualitative data with
      frequencies and percentages. To evaluate the effect of fibrin monomer relative to the
      hemostatic sponge, the data relating to the integrity of the graft between the groups were
      analyzed by chi-square.
