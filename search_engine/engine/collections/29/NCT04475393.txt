    
      A selection committee (composed of two independent experts in the field of cardiovascular
      surgery/cardiology and of PIs) assess the subject eligibility based on clinical and anatomic
      criteria. Clinically eligible patients will be distributed into two cohorts depending on
      their anatomic compatibility with the device:

        -  cohort 1: patients that are anatomically compatible will receive the Carmat TAH ;

        -  cohort 2: patients that are not anatomically compatible will receive standard therapy

      The efficacy and safety of the Carmat TAH will be assessed in cohort 1 and compared to a
      level of efficacy defined by the published data on the commercially available TAH; and
      adjusted for INTERMACS patient profile.

      The clinical utility and the costs of Carmat TAH will be assessed by comparing the cohort of
      subject receiving the Carmat TAH to the cohort of patients treated by standard therapy
