      agreement to invasive blood pressure measurements during anaesthesia induction and
      maintenance during surgery. In critical ill patients cardiac arrhythmia is probably a
      confounding factor affecting accuracy and interchangeability of CNAP. As systolic arterial
      CNAP pressure in comparison to mean pressure shows no statistical interchangeability with
      invasive measurements, mean pressure should be considered when making therapy decisions.

      A problem is the missing standard criterion for comparison of continuously devices with
      invasive pressure.
