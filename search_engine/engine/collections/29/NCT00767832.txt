      undergoing elective Cesarean delivery using thromboelastography (TEG). TEG is a point-of-care
      device which measures the viscoelastic properties of clot formation. This device can provide
      rapid and detailed information about coagulation changes in the perioperative period. We will
      compare coagulation data collected from the study to assess potential coagulation changes
      associated with Hemoglobin changes before and after surgery, and related to estimated blood
      loss.
