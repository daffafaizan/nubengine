      inflammation and scarring of the liver, eventually leading to chronic liver disease and
      cirrhosis. It is strongly associated with diabetes and obesity, both of which are endemic in
      Western societies.

      Carnitine enables cells in the body to use fat as a fuel, and recent studies have suggested
      that carnitine supplementation may reduce liver triglyceride content. Muscle and liver are
      the major sites in the body which coordinate glucose and fat metabolism. As well as assessing
      the effect of carnitine supplementation on liver fat, its effect on metabolic processes
      within these tissues will also be measured
