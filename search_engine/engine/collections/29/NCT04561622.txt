      controls during one assessment visit at the University Hospital of Grenoble.

      The experimentation phase takes place in three stages: first, the experimenter collects
      demographic data (age and level of study, lack of medical history and treatments that may
      interfere with the task). For bipolar subjects, it also collects the type of bipolarity, the
      type and date of the last episode, the age of the onset of the disease and the treatment.

      Secondly, the subject performs a classic Stroop task lasting 3 to 5 minutes, including
      instructions.

      Finally, the subject performs the two main tasks: the emotional Stroop task lasting about 20
      minutes and then the task of emotional stimuli categorization lasting about 15 minutes.
