      invited to participate in this protocol.

      Involvement in this study entails completion of questionnaires at 4 separate time points.
      Parents will first complete questionnaires regarding discharge teaching, care coordination
      and readiness for hospital discharge on the day of discharge from the hospital. Parents will
      subsequently complete questionnaires at 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after discharge. The
      post discharge questionnaires assess coping, family management, adherence and utilization of
      healthcare resources.

      Currently, no research has been conducted related to readiness for hospital discharge of a
      parent as the primary caregiver for a child with solid organ transplant or the sequential
      relationships between hospitalization care and the trajectory of post-discharge outcomes.
      This research will fill the gap in knowledge needed for care of solid organ transplant
      children and parents.

      The ability to identify factors in the first year after transplant that are predictive of
      decreased coping and non-adherence affords an opportunity to develop nursing and health
      interventions that have significant implications for care decisions, as well as disease
      activity and health care costs.
