      T-PLL is a special challenge.

      The overall response rates with conventional chemotherapy or Deoxycoformycin were low (about
      30% and 40%), with the monoclonal antibody Alemtuzumab response rates of 50% to 70% were
      achieved, but the duration of the response was short.

      In the previous trial (T PLL 1), the efficacy of the FMC regimen (FMC = Fludarabine,
      Mitoxantrone and Cyclophosphamide) was tested, a preliminary analysis of 16 patients revealed
      a response rate of more than 60% after FMC-polychemotherapy and 83% after the subsequent
      administration of Alemtuzumab.

      The goal of the T-PLL2-protocol is to assess if the simultaneous administration of
      FMC-polychemotherapy and Alemtuzumab with a subsequent Alemtuzumab maintenance therapy is
      capable of improving the remission rate and the disease-free survival time in patients with
      T-PLL.
