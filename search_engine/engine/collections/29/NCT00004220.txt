      gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with advanced malignancies. II.
      Determine the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine in combination with
      a fixed dose of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
