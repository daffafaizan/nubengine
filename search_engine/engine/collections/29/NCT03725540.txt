      oesophageal drainage inlet and side channels to facilitate the aspiration of gastric contents
      and an integrated bite-block. The Baska mask comes in four sizes, ranging from pediatric to
      adult. The device appeared relatively easy to insert, provided a high-quality seal with the
      glottic aperture and the incidence of throat discomfort appeared low.

      The I-gel a single use with noninflatable cuff and drain tube is being used for airway
      management during anesthesia since last few years. The noninflatable cuff of I-gel is made of
      a soft gel-like medical grade thermoplastic elastomer. The device has a buccal cavity
      stabilizer, an integral bite block and an epiglottic rest with a protective ridge, which
      prevents down folding of epiglottis during insertion.

      An oropharyngeal leak pressure or 'leak' test is commonly performed with the laryngeal mask
      airway to quantify the efficacy of the seal with the airway. This value is important since it
      indicates the feasibility of positive pressure ventilation and the degree of airway
      protection from supracuff soiling.

      Gynecological laparoscopic surgeries are associated with a decrease in thoraco-pulmonary
      compliance due to pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position. Minute ventilation needs
      to be increased to compensate for this reduction in compliance in order to maintain end-tidal
      carbon dioxide during pneumoperitoneum. This increase in minute ventilation can lead to an
      increase in airway pressures in excess of 20 cmH2O.
