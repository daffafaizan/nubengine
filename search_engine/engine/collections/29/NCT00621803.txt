      oral dose of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus, the available pharmaceutical form, or a placebo.
      Digestive tract carriage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is monitored by cultures of gastric
      aspirates. The occurrence of respiratory tract colonisations / infections is monitored
      throughout the study. Evaluation criteria are the delay and the rates of gastric P.
      aeruginosa colonisation and respiratory tract infection or colonisation. Chi-square or two
      tailed Fisher exact test are used for comparing qualitative variables and Student's t-test or
      mann-Whitney test for quantitatives variables. The mean of non-acquisition expectancy (NAE),
      length of stay without P. aeruginosa acquisition, was calculated and P. aeruginosa
      non-colonized patient rates were estimated and the two groups compared with regard to
      survival curves from grouped data using the Kaplan Meier method and the Logrank test.
      Variables with a P. value â‰¤0.15 in the univariate analysis were included in a logistic
      regression and a Cox regression model for multivariate analysis.
