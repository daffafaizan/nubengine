      empathy have been found. An increase in autistic traits has been found to be associated with
      a decrease in cognitive empathy traits but no difference in affective empathy traits, while
      an increase in psychopathic traits has been found to be associated with a decrease in both
      cognitive and affective empathy traits. The current investigation is to establish whether
      this previously observed relationship between cognitive empathy, affective empathy,
      psychopathic traits and autistic traits found in clinical populations is also found in a
      non-clinical population. This will be assessed by three self report questionnaires and one
      behavioural task (as described in 'Outcome Measures'). This investigation will also assess
      the potential link between of all of the traits measured and a specific SNP on the Oxytocin
      Receptor Gene (OXTR rs53576) to establish whether this mutation is associated with any of
      these behaviours.
