      skin that has been grit-blasted with hydroxyapatite particles resulting in an overall
      roughened surface, which, when compared to an implant with a machined (smooth) collar (narrow
      band around the top of the device) surface is thought to increase the apposition of osseous
      tissue integration and to promote epithelial attachment to the implant device.
