      women. These hormonal differences may be part of the cause of catamenial epilepsy. It is
      estimated that at least 1 in every 3 women with epilepsy have catamenial epilepsy. Although
      many antiepileptic drugs are available, it is very difficult to control these seizures. In
      the past, studies using antiepileptic drugs and hormonal agents were done to treat catamenial
      epilepsy. However, those medications did not work well and caused side effects.

      Keishibukuryogan is a traditional Japanese herbal medication. It is made of 5 natural herbs
      (cinnamon bark, hoelen, moutan bark, peony root, and peach kernel). It is used to treat
      disorders in women like menopause and menstrual cycle problems. This is the first study to
      examine the safety of Keishibukuryogan in women with epilepsy. As such, Keishibukuryogan and
      your current antiepileptic drug(s) will be given to you during the study.

      Keishibukuryogan is a dietary supplement in the United States. It can be bought without a
      prescription. The safety and efficacy of Keishibukuryogan has not been studied in epilepsy.
      However, it has been used safely in Japan and other Asian countries for years.
