      recruited. "Primary completion" is the date by which the investigators anticipate data
      analysis for the primary outcomes will be complete. "Study completion" is the data by which
      investigators anticipate data analysis for secondary outcomes will be complete.

      The investigators cannot name the hospital Trusts participating because the investigators do
      not have their consent and this would breach GDPR.
