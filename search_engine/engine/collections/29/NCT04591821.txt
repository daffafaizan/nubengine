    
      All patients who have undergone anterior resection for rectal cancer between Q1 2015 and Q4
      2017 have been identified in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry (SCRCR). Three years
      after surgery the patients were sent a questionnaire including the LARS (Low Anterior
      Resection Syndrome)-score, the quality of life questionnaire EORTC QLQ 30 and CR29 in
      addition to a questionnaire regarding prevalence of remaining stoma.The patient cohort will
      be divided into two groups operated with total (TME) or partial (PME) mesorectal excision for
      further analyses. Patients with a stoma will be analysed separately.

      Prevalence of major LARS and Quality of Life, QoL, 3 years after anterior resection will be
      assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and by calculation of LARS Score with categories "no" (0-20
      points), "minor" (21-29) and "major" (30-42). The LARS score will be dichotomized into the
      categories no/minor and major LARS.

      Stoma function will be evaluated by the stoma scale in EORTC QLQ-CR29.
