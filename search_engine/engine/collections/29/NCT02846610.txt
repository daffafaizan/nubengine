      for acute pain treatments during and after surgery.

      NRA collects preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data from treating physicians
      who complete a standard form. Data are collected concurrently with patient care by pain
      nurses or treating physicians and include detailed information about the medical conditions
      of patients having acute pain treatment along with the procedure and postoperative course.

      The registry provides the basis for large scale analyses and benchmarks for several
      parameters.

      The registry also aims at performing population-based research. Furthermore, its
      infrastructure allows for the conduct of prospective studies comparing the effectiveness of
      processes of care.
