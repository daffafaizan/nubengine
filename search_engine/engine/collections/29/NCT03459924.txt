      has been extensively reported with modified pulmonary artery catheters that measure the right
      ventricular ejection fraction. However, quantitative analysis of RVF using transesophageal
      echocardiography (TEE) are scarce in this setting.

      Methods: Nineteen cirrhotic patients who underwent OLT from April-2012 to April-2013 will be
      studied. Analysis of echocardiogram-derived parameters routinely used to evaluate ventricular
      function will be done. In particular, the RVF was quantitatively assessed by two parameters
      derived from TEE: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and right ventricular
      fractional area change (RVFAC). Exclusion criteria: pulmonary hypertension, fulminant
      hepatitis, age less than 18 or greater than 65 years old and cardiopulmonary diseases. All
      echocardiographic and hemodynamic data set have been collected at 5 stages during the
      procedure, according to Institutional Protocol: baseline, hepatectomy, anhepatic phase,
      post-reperfusion, and closure.

      Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA for repeated measurements will be used if the data have
      normal distribution, otherwise Friedman test will be used. P<0.05 is to be considered
      significant.
