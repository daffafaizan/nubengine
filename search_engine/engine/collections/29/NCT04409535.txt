      created by the COVID-19 virus; affecting the lives of all people, many of whom were
      significantly unprepared for the disruptions the emergency created in daily life. Rural
      residents are at increased risk from effects of the emergency due to numerous disadvantages
      as compared to urban living people (i.e. critical care access, food insecurity, social
      isolation). Very little is known about how people are living through a national emergency
      event affecting all people of the nation. Therefore, a significant gap in knowledge exists:
      1. How are rural-living vs. urban-living people responding physically and mentally to the
      crisis? 2. What strategies of resilience are employed by people living in rural vs. urban
      counties? 3. What are perceptions of access to critical supplies and services in urban vs.
      rural counties; 4. How is the availability and use of technology used for news, reliable
      information, and communication? and 5. Use of time: what alterations in daily life self-care,
      care of others, commerce, and valued routines in urban vs. rural counties are occurring?
