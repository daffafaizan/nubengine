      individuals with serious mental disorders and substance abuse problems; interventions
      designed to improve medical care for this population need to be developed. This study will
      develop a population-based medical case management model for improving the primary medical
      care of patients at an inner city community mental health center.

      This study will last 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive medical case
      management or standard of care (typically drug and behavioral therapy) for 2 years.
      Participants in the case management group will receive help in overcoming barriers to
      receiving primary care. Participants will also undergo 5 interviews over the 2-year study
      duration, and have annual chart reviews. Results of the interviews will be used to assess
      quality of primary care, service use, health outcomes, psychiatric symptoms, and substance
      use.
