    
      Ninety consecutive patients aged 65-85 years, visiting the cardiology clinic at Alingsås
      Hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital and primary care in the western part of Sweden will
      be asked to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria are permanent atrial fibrillation
      verified with electrocardiogram (ECG), left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 45% and no
      significant valvular lesions verified by ultrasound. Exclusion criteria: Coronary event or
      angina pectoris within 3 months prior to inclusion, stroke with residual symptoms, presence
      of pacemaker or not able to participate in functional tests due to other disabilities, or to
      read Swedish. Physical fitness will be measured by a symptom limited bicycle test and a
      muscle endurance test. Physical activity will be measured by accelerometer and the
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ),HR-QoL will be measured by Short form
      (SF-36).

      After the tests and return of accelerometer the patients will be randomized either to
      physiotherapist led group-based exercise or motivated interviewing and physical activity on
      prescription (PAP). The group-based exercise program consists of 60-minute sessions twice a
      week for 3 months, including central circulatory exercise performed on an ergometer cycle and
      muscle training, and two occasions of home-based exercise. The exercise program are designed
      after the patients requirements and with the intensity 13-17 on the Borg RPE 6-20 scale. The
      patients randomized to PAP will receive a PAP prescription and a physical activity diary. The
      PAP and physical activity diary will be followed up at 6 and 12 weeks after the inclusion.
      After three months all patients will perform the same tests as in baseline. A written
      informed consent will be obtained by the patients.
