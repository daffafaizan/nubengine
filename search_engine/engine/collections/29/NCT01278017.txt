      humans. Although most nontyphoidal Salmonella infections result in self-limited
      gastroenteritis, invasive infections such as bacteremia, meningitis or extraintestinal
      infection could also occur. Antimicrobial therapy is not recommended for routine treatment of
      nontyphoidal salmonellosis and effective antibiotic treatment is essential if NTS infection
      spreads beyond the intestine such as bacteremia, meningitis or osteomyelitis.

      Although some reports revealed that antimicrobial therapy may be beneficial for shortening
      the clinical courses of severe NTS enterocolitis, most of them were based on clinical
      observations, not based on the results of objective examinations. Thus, the use of
      antibiotics in the treatment of patients with severe NTS gastroenteritis is still
      controversial in clinical practice.

      As a third generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone has a higher concentration than conventional
      antibiotics such as ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the intestinal mucosa and
      gallbladder. Besides, ceftriaxone maintains relatively lower resistance rate in Salmonella
      than those of other conventional antibiotics. So the purpose of our study is to evaluate if
      short-course of ceftriaxone therapy could shorten the clinical courses of severe NTS
      enterocolitis in children and the excretion of Salmonella in feces. The investigators think
      that the study may be helpful for clinicians in the treatment of severe NTS enterocolitis in
      children, especially on the judgments of the choices and the treatment cures of antibiotics.
