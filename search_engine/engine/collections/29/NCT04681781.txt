    
      This is a longitudinal observational study for the natural history of SLC13A5 deficiency for
      up to 2 years. This study does not involve any therapeutic intervention. The study includes
      remote visits which will be done via telephone or remote video conferencing. Translators will
      be available during these remote visits for non-english speaking caregivers. The initial
      visit will consist of collecting a detailed medical history and medical records. Prior brain
      imaging and available EEGs will be collected and reviewed by the study neurologist.
      Neuropsychological assessments will be made using Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale version 3.
      Brief standardized videos recorded by the caregiver will be reviewed and scored by study
      personnel for movement assessment. Caregiver of ages 2 and up will be asked to complete the
      QOL Family Impact Module and the QOL epilepsy module. In addition to the initial visit,
      assessments in 1st year (every 3 months) and 2nd year (every 4 months) of enrollment will be
      made through remote interviews. Caregiver will be asked to maintain a seizure diary for the
      duration of the study to assess seizure burden. Personnel having expertise to comprehensively
      evaluate biological pathways that are perturbed by SLC13A5 deficiency will analyze the
      collected data. Improved understanding of disease pathogenesis will guide therapeutics and
      reveal clinical endpoints for use in future clinical trials. Identifying genotype-phenotype
      correlations can guide prognostication, clinical management, and genetic counseling.
