      caused by the deficiency of bilirubin uridinediphosphate glucuronosyltransferase activity CN
      patients are at permanent risk of life-threatening bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).
      Treatment of CN disease relies on daily prolonged phototherapy (10-12 h/day). To date, liver
      transplantation is the only curative treatment available. To date, no phototherapy device
      exists for teenagers and adults. CN patients use homemade systems or add several neonatal
      systems together to reach a better efficacy.

      A new device has been designed by weaving optical fibers into a sheet connected to LEDs. This
      new technology, marketed by several manufacturers of phototherapy devices, is used in
      pediatric wards for treating jaundiced newborns. A prototype of 80Ã— 100cm was thus developed,
      which combines numerous advantages : important surface of treatment, easy use and
      transportation, user-friendliness.

      Before going to a therapeutic trial for assessing the benefits of this new device in
      ambulatory current practice, it is essential to make sure of both its feasibility and
      efficiency on the control of bilirubinemia, under medical supervision.

      Hypothesis: the new phototherapy sheet is as effective as, and better tolerated than the
      usual devices used in CN patients.
