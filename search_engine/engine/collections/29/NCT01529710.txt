      the investigators will compare the efficacy and safety of Mirazid to Praziquantel as a
      treatment for Schistosomiasis. After screening, positive subjects for one of the
      Schistosomiasis will be recruited in the study. They will be treated by Mirazid as 600 mg
      oral (Soft Gelatin Capsules) for 6 consecutive days or 40mg/Kg body weight of Praziquantel as
      a single oral dose. Subjects will be evaluated for success of treatment at 12 weeks of
      treatment. Evaluation will be done by examining urine or stool samples for Schistosomiasis
      including egg counts for the positive cases.
