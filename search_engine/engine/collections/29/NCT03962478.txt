      carcinoma. In unresectable pancreatic carcinomas, percutaneous stent placement has been
      pivotal in providing relief from obstructive jaundice, improving the quality of life, and
      allowing the maintenance of anticancer treatment.

      Venous chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, or radiotherapy have been used
      to prolong stent patency and survival after stent insertion for patients with pancreatic
      carcinoma and biliary obstruction. High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation is a
      noninvasive and atoxic treatment of malignant tumor using focused ultrasound energy from an
      extracorporeal source that is targeted within the body resulting in thermally induced
      necrosis and apoptosis.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness and long-term outcomes
      between patients with pancreatic carcinoma and biliary obstruction who are treated by stent
      insertion with or without high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation.
