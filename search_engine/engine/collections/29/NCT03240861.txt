      I. To determine the safety of administering the combination of autologous peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) following a reduced
      intensity conditioning regimen, both of which have been genetically modified to express
      NY-ESO-1 TCR.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering the combination of TCR transduced autologous
      PBMC and CD34+ PBSC to patients.

      II. To determine the persistence of NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBMC and the progeny of TCR
      transduced PBSC in serial peripheral blood samples.

      III. Objective response rate (ORR).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore the use of positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging using the PET
      tracer 9-4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butylguanine ([18F]FHBG) with the goal of determining
      whether the adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBSC home to bone marrow,
      differentiate into T cells and expand in secondary lymphoid organs and tumor deposits.

      OUTLINE:

      G-CSF AND PLERIXAFOR MOBILIZED LEUKAPHERESIS: Between 6 months and 3 weeks before infusion of
      cells, patients undergo G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization of CD34+ peripheral blood stem
      cells. Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) on mobilization days 1-8 and plerixafor SC
      on mobilization days 4-7, during mobilization, patients will undergo mobilized leukapheresis
      to obtain PBSC. Patients also undergo an unmobilized leukapheresis on day -5 before infusion
      of cells in order to obtain PBMC.

      CHEMOTHERAPY CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) on days -4 to
      -2 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -3 to -2.

      Patients receive LV-NYESO TCR/sr39TK PBSC IV on day 0, and after approximately 24 hours,
      patients receive RV-NYESO TCR PBMC IV on day 1. Beginning on day 2, patients receive
      aldesleukin (interleukin-2 (IL) or IL-2) SC twice daily (BID) for up to 7 days. Patients
      undergo blood collection for safety and immune monitoring on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60,
      90, and 120. Patients receive the PET tracer 18F-FHBG IV, and after 1 hour, undergo
      PET/computed tomography (CT) on days 25 and 120.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 5 years, and annually for 15 years.
