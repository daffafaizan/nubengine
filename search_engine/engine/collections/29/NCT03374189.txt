      such as visceral organ injury, port-site hernia, infection, ascitic fluid leakage may occur
      during and after the procedure. Many devices were developed and utilized for the procedure
      and Carter-Thomason is one of the most commonly used device and validated with several
      studies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel port-site closure
      device (EZ Close) by comparing it with the Carter-Thomason device.
