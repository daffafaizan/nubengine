      enlargement of air spaces distal to terminal bronchioles accompanied by the destruction of
      pulmonary parenchyma. Treatment includes inhaled bronchodilator therapy, rehabilitation
      and/or oxygen treatment. In addition to the above, patients with severe emphysema may benefit
      from surgical lung volume reduction and/or lung transplantation. The rationale for lung
      volume reduction surgery is that reducing lung size would restore elastic recoil of the lung
      and improve chest wall and diaphragm mechanics. It has previously been shown that
      particularly patients with heterogeneous emphysema seem to benefit most from surgical lung
      volume reduction.

      Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) has recently been introduced as a less invasive
      potential alternative to surgical lung volume reduction. BLVR attempts to achieve the effects
      of surgery, by placing bronchial prostheses using a fibreoptic bronchoscope to selectively
      occlude the airways supplying the most affected hyperinflated regions of the emphysematous
      lung, while permitting exhaled gas to escape. This attempts to achieve segmental or lobar
      volume reduction, simulating the effects of surgical LVR.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate if bronchoscopic lung volume reduction by valves
      (Zephyr) would reduce native lung overinflation in patients that underwent single lung
      transplantation due to emphysema, and improve their well being and pulmonary function tests
