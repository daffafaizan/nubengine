      interval training (HIT) in a hyperbaric-hyperoxic environment with HIT alone in healthy
      subjects and to compare the effect of HIT at an intermediate altitude (SLC, UT; altitude 1420
      m) with that performed at sea-level (Durham, NC) in healthy subjects. While VO2 max is
      determined by the functional interdependence of the respiratory, cardiovascular and muscular
      systems, ultimately VO2 max is determined by mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Exercise
      training increases mitochondrial capacity. There is evidence that high intensity interval
      training (HIT) programs are effective at increasing exercise capacity. Furthermore, there is
      evidence that training while in a hyperbaric-hyperoxic environment may potentiate the HIT
      training effect through its effects on mitochondrial oxidative capacity, but this has not
      been scientifically tested. Our hypothesis is that high intensity interval training (HIT) in
      a hyperoxichyperbaric environment performed six-times over a two-week period will increase
      exercise performance compared with HIT performed in ambient conditions in healthy subjects.
      The primary outcome studied will be the effect of high-volume interval training in a
      hyperbaric-hyperoxic on VO2max.
