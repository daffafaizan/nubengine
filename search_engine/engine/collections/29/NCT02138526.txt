    
      Pazopanib (Votrient) is a multi targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial
      growth factor receptor, (VEGFR-1, -2 en -3), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR-α
      and -β), and stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT). Pazopanib is registered for the treatment of
      patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and patients with soft tissue sarcoma who have
      received prior chemotherapy. It is administered at a fixed oral dose of 800 mg OD regardless
      of size, age and clinical condition. It is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an
      oral bioavailability of ~21%. Pazopanib is practically insoluble and highly permeable. When
      ingested with high fat food the pazopanib exposure (area under the concentration time curve
      (AUC)) is doubled. Common adverse effects are diarrhea and nausea. This might be caused by
      the non-absorbed proportion of pazopanib. A dose reduction when ingested with food could be a
      logical approach to reduce these side effects; however this is not tested in patients yet.
      Therefore we want to perform a bioequivalent study to investigate what dose with a
      continental breakfast equals the dose of 800 mg in fasted conditions (study part A). In part
      B of the study we want to investigate whether the intake with food reduces the frequently
      reported side effects.
