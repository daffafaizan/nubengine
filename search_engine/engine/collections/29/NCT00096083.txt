      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with unresectable
           primary or metastatic liver cancer treated with intrahepatic arterial infusion of
           melphalan with venous filtration via peripheral hepatic perfusion.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the patterns of recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the filter characteristics including melphalan pharmacokinetics and filtration of
           cytokines and clotting factors during and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to primary tumor histology (neuroendocrine tumor
      vs primary hepatic malignancy vs adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal or other origin).

      Patients undergo peripheral isolated hepatic perfusion in which a catheter is placed via the
      groin into the hepatic artery and another into the hepatic vein. Patients then receive
      melphalan as an intrahepatic arterial infusion over 15-30 minutes. Treatment repeats
      approximately every 3-8 weeks for up to 6 total infusions in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and then
      periodically thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 105 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 years.
