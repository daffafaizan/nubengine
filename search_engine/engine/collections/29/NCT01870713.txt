      year without effective therapy methods. Recentlyï¼Œresearchers showed that type 2 diabetes
      mellitus can be partly reversed by gastric bypassing surgery. However, surgeons are still not
      clear how to chose the proper diabetes patients for surgery as the mechanism is still not
      clear, and the remission rate of diabetes mellitus is not the same among different surgical
      procedures.

      This study will enroll type 2 diabetes mellitus patients follwing Roux-en-Y gastric bypassing
      surgery and obese persons without type 2 diabetes surgery. The defferent expressions of serum
      proteins of obese persons without type 2 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients following
      gastric bypassing surgery after 10 days or 3 months were detected by serum proteomics. Blood
      samples and urine will be taken prior to surgery, 10 days after surgery and 3 months after
      surgery. The long term prognosis of diabetes mellitus for 1 years and the remission rate of
      diabetes of patients will be evaluated.
