      Ranolazine is a novel antianginal drug that reduces intracellular sodium and calcium
      accumulation during ischemia thus limiting ischemic injury.

      It has previously been shown that pretreatment with ranolazine 1,000 mg twice daily for 7
      days can significantly reduce procedural myocardial injury in elective percutaneous coronary
      intervention.

      It remains unknown, however, which of these two therapeutic approaches is more effective
      after PCI.

      Purpose

      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that twice overnight high-dose
      ranolazine loading before PCI can reduce the peri-procedural myocardial ischemic damage
      similarly to long-term pre-treatment with standard doses.
