    
      A retrospective chart review was conducted, including demographics (age and gender) and
      several parameters for both the first and second eyes, including the intra-ocular lens power
      calculation using the HofferQ, SRK/T and Holladay 1 formulas. Pentacam HR was used for
      pseudophakic anterior chamber depth measurement, and manual measurement was performed by a
      single investigator tracing a line between the anterior surface of the intra-ocular lens and
      the central corneal epithelium apex. Second eye refinement in the intra-ocular lens power
      selection for the second eye was performed using a theoretical 50% partial adjustment of the
      prediction error of the first eye. To relate refractive outcomes to pACD values, the
      investigators performed subgroup analysis based in consecutive 50Âµm increments in
      inter-ocular asymmetry of pACD (50-600).
