      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of volasertib and
      vincristine sulfate liposomal injection (VSLI) in relapsed/refractory (RR) acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of volasertib and VSLI, rate of complete remission (with
      or without complete hematologic recovery; complete response [CR]/CR with incomplete
      hematologic recovery [CRi]), duration of remission (DOR), rate of minimal residual disease
      (MRD)-negativity, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), 30-day mortality
      rate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if volasertib and polo-like kinase (plk)-inhibition down-regulates the
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.

      II. Whether plk and mTOR inhibition correlates with clinical response to treatment. III. to
      determine if volasertib acts synergistically to potentiate the bioavailability and
      distribution of VSLI.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of volasertib.

      Patients receive volasertib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and vincristine sulfate
      liposome IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      12 courses in the absence of disease progression, development of an inter-current illness
      that prevents further administration of treatment, unacceptable toxicity, patient decides to
      withdraw or treating investigator determines that the patient should be taken off treatment
      for any reason.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 28 days for up to 1 year.
