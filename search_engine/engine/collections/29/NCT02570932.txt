    
      This is a clinical trial phase II, single-center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open
      prospective follow-up of a cohort of patients with chronic spinal cord injury.

      Patients are treated with repeated administrations of in vitro expanded autologous adult bone
      marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

      The expanded cells are administered in the subarachnoid space by lumbar puncture. The minimum
      duration of the follow-up period for each patient is 10 months after the first
      administration.

      The study duration is 24 months, that include recruiting, treatment and follow period for all
      patients. For each patient at the first day will be administered the first cellular doses,
      then 3 doses will be administrated every 3 months. At the end of the clinical trial, a
      completed check of all obtained parameters will be performed.

      It is considered Day 1 for each patient the first day of the first cell administration. The
      remaining 2 doses will be administered at intervals of 3 months from the first administration
      (of the treatment period after, months 4 and 7). At the end of the study will be performed a
      full assessment of the variables collected along the study trial.
