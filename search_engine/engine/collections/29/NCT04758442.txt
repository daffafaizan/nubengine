    
      STUDY DESIGN:

      Prospective, monocentric, pharmacokinetic study.

      Adults who have been diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy, are hospitalized at
      Maisonneuve-Rosemont hospital and received at least 3 doses of intravenous vancomycin.

      Pharmacokinetic parameters: Serum vancomycin concentration measured at steady state just
      before the beginning of the infusion (trough), 1 hour after completion of the infusion (peak)
      and between 3 to 5 hours after the end of the infusion (additional blood draw during the
      elimination phase).

      RECRUITMENT PROCESS:

      A systematic daily screening of hospitalized patients diagnosed with a hematologic cancer
      will be made by the research team and the pharmacists 7 days a week. An information sheet
      will be given to all potential eligible patients at their admission. When intravenous
      vancomycin is prescribed, a member of the research team will explain the study and present
      the Information and Consent Form (ICF) to the potential participant to obtain his/her
      official informed consent.

      DATA COLLECTION:

      Three blood draws will be planned around the fourth or fifth dose of vancomycin and collected
      by the nursing team. The sampling scheme is as follows: just before the beginning of the
      infusion (trough), 1 hour after completion of the infusion (peak) and 3, 4 or 5 hours after
      the end of the infusion (additional blood draw during the elimination phase) according to the
      assigned time of the participant. The assigned time of the additional blood draw will be
      randomized at the inclusion of the subject in the study. A member of the research team will
      provide the tubes to the nurse, will write and save sampling times and will ship the blood
      samples to the laboratory.
