      the gut lymphoid tissues and gut immune function, as well as with decreased gut mucosa
      permeability, thereby diminishing the risk of organ failure. Citrulline is an amino acid
      produced from glutamine by small-bowel enterocytes. Plasma citrulline levels reflect
      functional enterocyte mass. Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP, also known as
      FABP2) is a small protein found in the cytosol of small-bowel enterocytes. Plasma I-FABP is
      normally undetectable and, when elevated, constitutes a reliable marker for enterocyte
      damage. The hypothesis underlying this ancillary study is that first-line enteral nutrition
      is associated with improved gut mucosa integrity and function compared to parenteral
      nutrition.
