      surgery with IONM. Both anterior and posterior branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerves
      were assessed separately by both electromyography endotracheal tube for adduction and finger
      palpation for detection of laryngeal twitch due to posterior cricoarytenoid abduction. The
      recurrent laryngeal nerves having motor function only in the anterior branches were defined
      as group 1, whereas the nerves having motor function both in the anterior and posterior
      branches were as group 2.
