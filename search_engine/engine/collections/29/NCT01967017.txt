      paracervical block with lidocaine to a placebo (bacteriostatic saline) block, among
      nulliparous and "functionally nulliparous" women. The investigators plan a double-masked,
      placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial. The investigators anticipate that among
      patients who have not had a previous vaginal delivery, the pain associated with IUD insertion
      will be significantly decreased after administration of a 15 mL 1% lidocaine paracervical
      block compared to patients who receive 15 mL of bacteriostatic saline (placebo).
