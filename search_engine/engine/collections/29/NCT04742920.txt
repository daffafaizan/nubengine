    
      The OTEMACS study is a prospective, multicenter clinical trial with randomized treatment
      allocation, open label treatment and blinded endpoint evaluation (PROBE), designed to
      demonstrate that MMA embolization via a minimally invasive endovascular approach combined
      with standard (surgical/conservative) management is superior to standard management alone, in
      reducing the rate of CSDH-related surgical interventions and the recurrence rate in patient
      with CSDH at 90 days.

      Eligible symptomatic CSDH patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive
      either surgical treatment plus an adjuvant MMA embolization (ST+MMAE group; the Experimental
      arm) or surgical treatment alone (ST group; the Control arm).

      Eligible symptomatic nonsurgically treated patients with CSDH will be randomized, in a 1:1
      ratio, to MMA embolization (MMAE group; the Experimental arm) or conservative management (CM
      group; the Control arm).
