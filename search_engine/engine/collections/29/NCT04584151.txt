           Compare quality of analgesia and quality of recovery between bilateral ESP bilateral
           catheters versus Opioid analgesia in adult included in an enhanced recovery program
           after liver transplantation Show that the addition of peri-operative regional analgesia
           improves the enhanced recovery program after open liver transplant in recipient patient
           .

        2. Methodology:

           •Selection criteria: Age > 18 years old Have a clinical indication for Liver
           transplantation ( list for surgeries listed in full proposal) Agree to participate in
           the trial

           •Exclusion criteria: Use of chronic opioid Contra-indication tom perform ESP catheter
           (Infection near puncture point, Severe thoracic scoliosis, allergy to local
           anaesthetics) A diagnosis of a chronic pain condition Depression or other psychiatric
           diagnosis

           • Study design: Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.

           Patients who agree to join the study will be randomized into 2 groups:

           Group 1 (Control group): standard of care in Liver donation : Intra operative analgesia
           by Opioid Sufentanil and post operative analgesia by Patient Controlled analgesia (PCA)
           opioid morphine Group 2 (treatment group): Standard peri-operative analgesia for Liver
           donation in our hospital since we use regional anaesthesia as first line treatment for
           peri operative analgesia Bilateral ESP catheters with continuous regional analgesia by
           infusion of local anaesthetic (Ropivacaine)

           Sample size: We expected to reduce the length of stay for liver receipt from 11 ± 2.22
           days in ERAS group to 8 ± 2.22 days in the ESP group The sample size of 10 patients per
           group is required to detect such changes assuming a confidence interval of 95% with a
           power of 90% and alpha = 0.05. Considering 20% of drop-out, the total sample size is 40
           patients (20 patients each group)

        3. Project outcomes:

             -  Primary outcomes Length of stay in Hospital Our estimation based on our previous
                studies for ESP and the literature for ERAS programs in open heart surgeries

             -  Secondary outcomes Time to extubation Duration of stay in ICU Time to 1st
                mobilisation Opioid consumption in relation with VAS Rest and mobilization

      Patient satisfaction:

        -  Quality of recovery scoring 15 items (QOR 15)

        -  Pain at 1 month rest and mobilization + Quality of Life scoring (QOL36)
