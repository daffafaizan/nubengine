      mortality following coronary procedures. Contrast agents cause an acute deterioration in
      renal function via the generation of reactive oxygen species. Vitamin E (alpha tocopherol)was
      demonstrated to be anti-oxidant and anti-inflammation. The present study was designed to
      evaluate the administration of antioxidant vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) as a means of
      preventing CIN in these patients.
