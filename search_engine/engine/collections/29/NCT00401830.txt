      The trial consisted of a 4-week Titration Phase, an 8-week Maintenance Phase, a 1-week Taper
      Phase, and a 2-week Safety Follow-Up Phase. If subjects met the eligibility criteria, they
      were randomized to receive either lacosamide 400mg/day or placebo during the Maintenance
      Phase. Subjects assigned to lacosamide were titrated from 100mg/day to 400mg/day at weekly
      intervals of 100mg. All subjects who completed the 4-week Titration Phase entered an 8-week
      Maintenance Phase. No dose adjustment was allowed during the Maintenance Phase. The Treatment
      Phase was defined as the combined Titration and Maintenance Phases.
