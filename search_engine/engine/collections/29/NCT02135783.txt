      approximately 2-3 million people worldwide each year. About one third of people with ICH die
      early after onset and the majority of survivors are left with major long-term disability.
      Hematoma removal (HR) surgery is the primary treatment for ICH which volume is more than
      30ml. But whether decompressive craniectomy (DC) should be employed during the HR surgery
      still has considerable controversy. Outcomes in this study will be measured at 3 months after
      surgery via a postal questionnaire including the Glasgow Outcome scale, Modified Rankin
      Scale, and Barthel index. Two hundred patients will be recruited to the trial over 36 months.
      Follow-up will take three months with analysis and reporting taking one year.
