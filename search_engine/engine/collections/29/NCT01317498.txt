      (RLS) is unknown. In developed countries, routine monitoring with CD4 count and viral load
      (VL) testing is standard practice. In RLS, however, limitations in the availability of the
      technology for VL testing, and in financial resources to pay for VL testing, mean that few
      developing countries provide VL testing as part of the routine monitoring of patients on ART.
      Instead, ART is monitored primary by clinical examination with CD4 testing where available.
      This strategy has been endorsed by the most recent WHO guidelines for ART (WHO, 2010).

      Standard laboratory monitoring of patients on ART in Vietnam includes CD4 testing every 6
      months, where available. In many rural areas of the country, CD4 testing is not available and
      only clinical monitoring is used.

      In this study we will test the hypothesis that routine viral monitoring every 6 months for
      patients on first-line ART will result in significantly higher rates of virological
      suppression and decrease the incidence of death or new or recurrent AIDS-defining illnesses
      by 50% within three years.
