      contractions when exposed to high and low doses of oxytocin (to simulate PPH treatment and
      labor induction respectively).

      The tissue will also be frozen at the end of the experiment, and Western blotting will be
      used to investigate the effect of propranolol on the expression patterns and cellular
      distribution of the oxytocin receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor and their signaling
      pathways in desensitized myometrium.
