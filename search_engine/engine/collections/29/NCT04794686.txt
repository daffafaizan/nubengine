    
      All patients with ETMR are eligible for inclusion within the registry, regardless of their
      disease status or treatment plan. Epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular data from each
      patient will be obtained following enrollment. Patients will then be followed longitudinally
      to obtain clinical outcome data. In an effort to best achieve the registry's secondary
      objectives, it is preferable, but not required, for patients to be registered soon after
      their diagnosis, prior to the initiation of any tumor-directed therapy.

      This registry protocol contains recommendations for a consensus therapy derived from the ETMR
      medical literature, the investigators' own experience, and clinical data from other infant
      brain tumor protocols. The recommended therapy can thus not be viewed as investigational, but
      rather as a consensus recommendation derived from available data. While not mandated, it is
      strongly encouraged that patients enrolled in the registry be treated according to the
      recommended consensus therapy, as this will facilitate the prospective evaluation of ETMR
      patients using a uniform treatment approach.
