      neovascularization and the resulting morbidity from neovascular glaucoma. This complication
      appears to be directly correlated with intraocular VEGF levels. Currently there is no proven
      treatment to decrease the formation of rubeosis. Current management of the disease consists
      of pan-retinal photocoagulation once significant anterior segment neovascularization becomes
      manifest. This treatment destroys peripheral retina (with peripheral retinal field) and
      presumably works by eventually lowering ocular VEGF levels which causes secondary regression
      of rubeosis.

      As ranibizumab blocks VEGF, this treatment when delivered intraocularly may prevent
      neo-vascular glaucoma while preserving peripheral visual fields in this patient population.

      A higher dose of ranibizumab may allow for both a longer duration of treatment effect and
      potentially more efficacy leading to better outcomes for patients that are somewhat treatment
      resistant and need continual therapy. Nonclinical and early clinical data indicate that
      higher doses of ranibizumab up to and including 2.0 mg are safe and tolerated by patients.
