      technique used to obtain micromotion of the implants relative to inserted tantalum markers in
      the surrounding bone. Using RSA, long-term predictions of prosthetic loosening can be made
      based on a two years follow-up. Therefore, it is recommended to analyse all (new) prosthetic
      components by means of RSA.

      Objective: The goal of this study is to study in a randomised trial the stability of the
      Delta-TT cup with polyethylene insert and the Delta-TT cup with ceramic insert both combined
      with the H-MAX femoral stem by means of RSA to assess whether the differences in stiffness of
      the cup will have an influence on incorporation and mechanical stability. It is hypothesized
      that there will be more micromotion on the short-term (<2 years) in the patients with the
      ceramic insert because of the higher stiffness, however, all components will be considered
      stable on the short and long-term. Secondary goal is to compare the stability of the C2
      femoral stem, to the H-MAX femoral stem as well as to compare it to relevant migration
      results of similar stems from the literature. These RSA results will contribute to knowledge
      about the early stability and long-term prosthetic loosening of these cementless stems.
