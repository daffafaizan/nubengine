      refractory small cell lung cancer or advanced metastatic breast cancer expressing
      somatostatin receptor. II. Determine the safety of this treatment regimen in these patients.
      III. Determine the overall survival of these patients with this treatment regimen. IV.
      Determine the quality of life in these patients with this treatment regimen. V. Determine the
      frequency of tumors which are positive (3+ or 4+) for OctreoScan scintigraphy in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive yttrium Y 90 SMT 487 IV over 10-15
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6-9 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at
      course 3, week 6. Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study.
