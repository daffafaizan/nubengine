      therapeutic target" sufficiently and to the extent that is required to produce efficacy in
      pre-clinical experiments.

      The primary endpoint markers have been selected to determine this.

      Reductions in markers of the AKT pathway and increases in markers of anti-proliferation will
      characterise the degree of biological activity arising from the inhibition of AKT across a
      range of doses of AZD5363.
