    
      The present study is designed as an open label study of patients with refractory depression
      and anxiety to evaluate longer term tolerability and early efficacy of transcranial
      ultrasound treatment. Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize validated tests
      that are appropriate for repeated measures which are not affected by practice effects. For
      patients with refractory depression, the target will be the subgenual cingulate (Brodmann's
      area 25) through a trans temporal scalp window. For patients with anxiety, the target will be
      the amygdala. Targeting will include reference to scalp fiducials based on the obtained MRI
      and Doppler waveform confirmation will be obtained because of the ability of TCD to record
      Doppler signal from the posterior cerebral artery that runs medial to the mesial temporal
      lobe.

      On the day of the ultrasound appointment, patients will undergo ten to thirty minutes of
      transcranial ultrasound treatment. The sonification device will be aimed at the subgenual
      cingulate or amygdala, depending on the predetermined condition. Targeting will include
      reference to scalp fiducials based on the obtained MRI; confirmation of target accuracy will
      either be obtained by Doppler waveform confirmation or optical tracking technology which
      co-registers patient neuroimaging with real space. Patients will undergo 8 total sessions of
      focused ultrasound. Patients will be evaluated at baseline and upon final ultrasound
      treatment using the same measures obtained upon entry. Safety and any adverse events will be
      monitored closely.
