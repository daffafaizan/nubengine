      given a low dose of CFI-400945 and are watched very closely to see what side effects they
      have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe,
      then more participants are asked to join the study and are given a higher dose of study drug.
      Participants joining the study later on will get higher doses of study drug than participants
      who join earlier. This will continue until the highest dose of study drug that can be taken
      without severe side effects is found (called maximum tolerated dose). Doses higher than that
      will not be given.

      After the best dose of study drug is found, additional participants will be asked to join the
      study and will be given the study drug at the maximum tolerated dose to further test the
      safety and the drug at that dose.
