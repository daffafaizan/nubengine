      China. The total area of the county is almost 3,000 square kilometres. The majority of the
      population of the county is engaged in farming. In terms of national GDP rankings, the study
      county is typical of less developed rural areas in China. Twenty townships (10 interventions
      and 10 control) out of a total of 55 were selected - on the basis of having sufficient health
      facilities and staff - for a controlled trial on the introduction of systematic prenatal care
      in the area.
