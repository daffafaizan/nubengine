      such patients remain a major unmet need in oncology. The investigators have recently
      demonstrated that bevacizumab (BV), a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular
      endothelial growth factor, has significant anti-tumor activity among recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme patients. Vorinostat has modest anti-tumor activity against malignant glioma and
      can potentiate the action of both chemotherapy and anti-angiogenics. The current study is
      designed to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of vorinostat when combined with BV among
      recurrent glioblastoma multiforme patients.
