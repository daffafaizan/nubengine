      disseminated MAC disease. The development of an effective regimen for the prevention of
      disseminated MAC disease may be of substantial benefit in altering the morbidity and possibly
      the mortality associated with this disease and its treatment.

      Patients are randomized to receive clarithromycin alone, rifabutin alone, or the two drugs in
      combination daily. Patients are evaluated every 4 weeks for the first 8 weeks and every 8
      weeks thereafter for the duration of the study. Patients are followed for 24 months. Per
      amendment, a pharmacokinetic substudy will be conducted.
