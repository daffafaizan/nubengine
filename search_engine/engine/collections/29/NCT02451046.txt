      of extended-criteria allografts. This complication is burdened with high mortality and
      morbidity rates among liver transplant recipients. Alpha-GST is a short-life hepatocyte
      enzyme that may be an interesting biomarker for liver injury. A recently developped ELISA
      technique may allow fast and easy measurement of alpha-GST plasma concentration (Fastpack IP
      α-GST Immunoassay, Qualigen Inc., Carlsbad, CA). This study aims to evaluate the ability of
      plasma alpha-GST measurements in liver donor to predict PDF in liver recipient. Methods:
      Observational study conducted in one center (Beaujon hospital, APHP, Clichy, France).
      Measurements of plasma levels of alpha-GST using Fastpack IP α-GST Immunoassay (Qualigen
      Inc., Carlsbad, CA) at the time of organ removal in liver donor and daily from day 0 to day 7
      after liver transplantation in recipients.
