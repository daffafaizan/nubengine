      also under active cortical control for both spontaneous as well as volitional swallowing in
      awake humans and non-human primates. A recent study found that most patients of disorders of
      consciousness (DOC) would recover their swallowing ability quickly. And there is no study
      about detecting the initiation of swallowing act in DOC patients. This study is aimed to
      detect the initiation of swallowing act in DOC patients, to find if it is a good item as a
      stimulus and to detect the relationship between the initiation of swallowing act and the
      prognosis of DOC patients. DOC patients were recruited (standard diagnosis procedure is 4
      times CRS-R testing within 2 weeks). The different four stimuli were as follows: 1) One
      command (as recommended in CRS-R) which was "open your mouth". 2) Put a spoon in front of the
      patient's mouth without a command. 3) One command with a spoon in front of the mouth, the
      command is "there is a spoon and open your mouth". 4) One command with a spoon full of water
      in front of the mouth, the command is "there is a spoon with water and open your mouth". We
      presented these stimuli orderly in front of the patient's mouth and presented any one of them
      over 4 trials at 15 second intervals.
