      can cause many diseases independently. But in internal intractable diseases, such as viral
      hepatitis, stroke, and epidemic hemorrhagic fever, blood stasis and blood heat always
      accompany with each other. So the hypothesis is raised that blood stasis with heat (YURE) is
      a compound pathogen and key pathogenesis in internal intractable diseases. This study was
      aimed to verify the role that the compound pathogen played in hemorrhagic stroke and to
      observe the progress of the key pathogenesis. A randomized and controlled trial would be
      conducted in five hospitals, where 300 hospitalized patients with hemorrhagic stroke in the
      acute phase would receive different intervention with basic modern medicine treatment or
      Chinese herbs formula combined with the former. The Chinese herbs formula, which was designed
      under the guidance of the theory system of Chinese Medicine, was supposed to cool blood heat
      and dissolve blood stasis. Clinical efficacy and safety would be evaluated after the 21-days
      intervention.
