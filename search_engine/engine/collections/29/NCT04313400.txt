    
      AMTX-100 CF drug product is formulated as a water-based, topical cream incorporating a
      28-amino acid synthetic polypeptide (AMTX-100) as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).
      AMTX-100 is a chimeric, cell-penetrating, bifunctional nuclear transport modifier (NTM), that
      is engineered to modulate nuclear transport of transcription factors (NF-κB, NFAT, AP-1 and
      STAT1) involved in activation of gene expression of key mediators of inflammation (TNFα,
      IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, MCP-1, etc.) and metabolic syndrome (ChREBP and SREBP) by importin α/β
      complex and importin β, respectively. This further leads to a reduction in pro-inflammatory
      cytokine/chemokine production and lipid metabolic products.

      AMTX-100 CF is intended for improvement of symptoms associated with mild to moderate Atopic
      Dermatitis in adults. This Phase I/II study aims to determine the Maximum Tolerable Dose
      (MTD) by maximum BSA percentage treated and to evaluate efficacy of various concentrations of
      AMTX-100 CF versus placebo (vehicle).
