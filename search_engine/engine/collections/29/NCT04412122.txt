      exercises on pain management applied after benign gynecological abdominal operations.

      Design-Setting: This was an experimental, randomized controlled trial. This study was
      conducted at the Gynecology Service of Oncology Training and Research Hospital.

      Participants: A total of 132 women, divided into 4 groups of 33 subjects each, were included.

      Methods: The sampling size was calculated with G*Power Ver.3.1.9.2 computer software. A total
      of 132 women, 33 of whom were in kinesio taping group, 33 in breathing exercise group, 33 in
      kinesio taping + breathing exercise group, and 33 in the control group, who matched the
      sampling selection criteria, were included in the study. In randomization, a table of numbers
      was created, and an equal number of women were assigned to groups with four block patterns.
      Women underwent gynecological abdominal operation were assigned to the groups randomly,
      depending on the application of two different methods of kinesio taping and breathing
      exercise. No intervention was applied to the women in the control group.

      The personal information form was filled for each individual, who agreed to participate in
      the study, before the procedure.

      Outcome Measures Pain scores of the women in all groups before, and after the procedure were
      evaluated by the researcher independent from each other using Visual Analog Scale (VAS).
