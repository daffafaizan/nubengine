    
      Patients are randomized to receive SNX-111 or placebo (AS PER AMENDMENT 1/22/98: with
      randomization weighted 2:1 in favor of SNX-111) via external pump and an intrathecal catheter
      (thin tube inserted into the spinal canal). (AS PER AMENDMENT 1/22/98: the dose is increased
      every 24 hours, in the absence of onset of analgesia or adverse events. After 2-5 days,
      patients who respond to their medication continue treatment at home for 5-8 days. Patients
      who do not respond will be switched to the other regimen (i.e., placebo to SNX-111, or
      SNX-111 to placebo). After 10 days, responding patients are unblinded and asked to enroll in
      the long-term, open-label extension protocol. Patients remain on a fixed dose at the
      therapeutic level found in the previous study. The dose may be increased or decreased at the
      discretion of the investigator. Patients may continue therapy on a long-term basis until the
      drug is approved.
