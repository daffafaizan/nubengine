      is a single site, non-blinded, non-randomized study. It will employ a retrospective analysis
      comparing the accuracy of SV and CO. The 'test sensor', CoVa Patch, which will measure SV and
      CO quasi-continuously and non-invasively, approximately every 5-30 minutes for a period of
      time lasting approximately 12-48 hours. These measurements will be compared to those from a
      'reference device', which is the pulmonary arterial catheter. It uses an invasive technique
      called thermodilution that will be made approximately every 4 hours. Measurements between the
      test and reference devices will be compared in a retrospective analysis once the study has
      completed.
