    
      Prospective longitudinal study in which survivors of severe infection with the covid-19 virus
      (need for hospitalization with supplementation of more than 3l / min of oxygen or mechanical
      ventilation) will be evaluated after 1 month, 4 months, 6 months and 1 year after hospital
      discharge through distance or face-to-face assessment.

      Patients will be included according to a convenience sample until 12/31/2020 with follow-up
      until 12/31/2021. The EQ-5D questionnaire will be collected to assess quality of life. For
      other secondary outcomes, the clinical frailty scale, daily life independence scale, MoCA
      cognition questionnaire, hospital anxiety and depression questionnaire (HADS), muscle
      strength measure by the MRC scale, dyspnea measure by the mMRC and BDI scale will be used
      -TDI, 1-minute sit-and-stand test, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure measurement.
      Return to work, occurrence of thromboembolic events, occurrence of falls, need for
      re-hospitalization and mortality up to 12 months after admission will also be evaluated.

      After 6 months of discharge, lung volume measurement will be performed by pulmonary function
      test, aerobic capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise test and evaluation of anatomical
      pulmonary sequelae by chest tomography. Patients residing close to the hospital will be
      offered a physical training program carried out by the physiotherapy team with assessment of
      functional response indicators.

      The data obtained in the follow-up will be crossed with data obtained by the Epicov study in
      order to identify risk factors related to dysfunctions.
