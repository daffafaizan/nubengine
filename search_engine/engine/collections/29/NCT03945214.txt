    
      The aim of the present study is to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention
      and/or a healthy eating intervention in a sample of UCSF employees with overweight and
      obesity (BMI>=25kg/m2) who report mild to moderate stress. We will randomize UCSF employees
      to 8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention (using the commercially available
      application, Headspace), a healthy eating intervention, a digital meditation+healthy eating
      intervention, or a waitlist control condition.

      Participants assigned to the digital meditation intervention group will be asked to download
      and use the Headspace mobile application for at least 10 minutes per day for 8 weeks.
      Participants assigned to the healthy eating intervention group will be asked to participate
      in a 50 minute motivational interviewing counseling session centered around healthy eating
      behaviors , three 10-minute booster phone calls at weeks 1, 4, and 8, and weekly
      participation in a digital mindful eating activity.

      All study participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires at baseline, week 4, week 8
      (post-intervention), and a 4-month follow-up period. Among participants who are randomized to
      the digital meditation intervention, they will also take part in a 1-year follow-up
      assessment. Physiological assessments (body composition, blood spot) will be obtained at an
      in-person clinic visit at baseline and week 8. Fitness, sleep, and mood data will be gathered
      for seven consecutive days at baseline and week 8.

      Prior to randomization, participants will go through an eligibility screening and complete
      the baseline questionnaire battery. Adherence in the digital meditation intervention will be
      tracked remotely. The goal is to recruit as many as 150 participants.
