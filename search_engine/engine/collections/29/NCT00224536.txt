      be used to improve cardiac function in patients after acute myocardial infarction. In this
      randomised trial, we aimed to assess whether intracoronary transfer of autologous bone-marrow
      cells could improve global left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 6 months' follow-up.

      After successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction, 60 patients were randomly assigned to either a control group (n=30)
      that received optimum postinfarction medical treatment, or a bone-marrow-cell group (n=30)
      that received optimum medical treatment and intracoronary transfer of autologous bone-marrow
      cells 4·8 days (SD 1·3) after PCI. Primary endpoint was global left-ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF) change from baseline to 6 months' follow-up, as determined by cardiac MRI.
      Image analyses were done by two investigators blinded for treatment assignment. Analysis was
      per protocol.

      Global LVEF at baseline (determined 3·5 days [SD 1·5] after PCI) was 51·3 (9·3%) in controls
      and 50·0 (10·0%) in the bone-marrow cell group (p=0·59). After 6 months, mean global LVEF had
      increased by 0·7 percentage points in the control group and 6·7 percentage points in the
      bone-marrow-cell group (P=0·0026).

      Transfer of bone-marrow cells enhanced left-ventricular systolic function primarily in
      myocardial segments adjacent to the infarcted area. Cell transfer did not increase the risk
      of adverse clinical events, in-stent restenosis, or proarrhythmic effects. Intracoronary
      transfer of autologous bone-marrow-cells promotes improvement of left-ventricular systolic
      function in patients after acute myocardial infarction.
