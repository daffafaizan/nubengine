      treatment required for neuroblastoma is an autologous stem cell transplant, where patients
      who are experiencing neuroblastoma will undergo an expansion of their blood system and
      collect their peripheral blood to later infuse back into them after chemotherapy and/or
      radiation. However, up to 14% of individuals experience complications with this procedure.

      Research has shown that certain drugs that cause similar effects on the body to that of acute
      exercise can elicit a more favorable donation. However, these drugs are very costly.
      Albuterol, on the other hand, is a regularly used drug that may have a similar effect on the
      body as adrenaline and is used to treat individuals who are experiencing respiratory airway
      distress. The benefit of albuterol is that it can be administered through inhalation, further
      reducing patient burden.

      The aim of this pilot study is to determine the effects of albuterol on the composition of
      immune cells in the bloodstream. Five healthy volunteers (age 21-44 years) will be recruited
      to participate in this study. Each participant will donate a 6ml blood sample before and
      during a 20-minute continuous albuterol nebulization through an IV catheter. During the last
      10 minutes of the nebulization, participants will submit to another 6mL blood draw.
