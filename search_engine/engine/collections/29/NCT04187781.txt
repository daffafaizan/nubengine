      with experienced hearing aid users.

      The external microphone streams the signal (e.g. speaker) directly into the hearing
      instrument (HI).

      The subject should rate the devices in the lab and after a hometrial. The comfort, regarding
      to the loudness and the sound quality will be tested with the two settings at home and in the
      lab. Also the speech intelligibility will be tested in the lab.

      This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG
      Headquarters based in St√§fa (Switzerland).
