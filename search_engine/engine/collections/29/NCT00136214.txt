    
      Subjects with non-cirrhotic hepatitis C will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic
      resonance (MR) spectroscopy and neuropsychological testing prior to starting interferon.
      Subjects will have repeat testing following 12 weeks of interferon therapy and again at 12
      weeks post interferon therapy.

      MR spectroscopy (MRS) will measure the cerebral metabolites, NAA (N-acetyl aspartate), Cho
      (choline), MI (myoinositol) and Cr (creatine) at 3 distinct brain regions, i.e. basal ganglia
      and 2 locations within the frontal cortex.

      Neuropsychological testing will include tests of the following cognitive domains: executive
      functioning, memory, language, motor skills and will also include questionnaires pertaining
      to quality of life (SF-36), mood (Beck's depression inventory) and a self-rating cognitive
      questionnaire (Conners' Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scales
      [CAARS]).

      Control subjects will include non-cirrhotic HCV subjects who are not taking interferon
      therapy.
