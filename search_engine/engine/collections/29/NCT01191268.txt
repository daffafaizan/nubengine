      criteria for persistent severe hyperglycemia and therapy for participants who required new
      intervention for any other reason. The latter included participants who discontinued study
      drug due to adverse events, participant decision, or any other reason. For efficacy analyses,
      participants who received rescue medication were included in the analysis population, but
      only measurements obtained prior to taking rescue therapy were included in the efficacy
      analysis. For safety analyses, with the exception of hypoglycemia, all measurements including
      those obtained after taking rescue therapy were included in the analysis.
