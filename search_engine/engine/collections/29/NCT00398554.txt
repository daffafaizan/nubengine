        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of combination chemotherapy comprising vincristine,
           etoposide, cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, prednisone, and doxorubicin hydrochloride
           (VECOPA) in pediatric male patients with previously untreated stage II-IV classic
           Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Compare the effects of VECOPA vs cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine
           hydrochloride, and prednisone (COPP) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease
      stage (IA/B[E], IIA[E], IIB, or IIIA vs IIB[E], IIIA/B[E], IIIB, or IVA/B).

        -  Stratum 1 (stages IA/B[E], IIA[E], IIB, or IIIA): Patients receive oral prednisone on
           days 1-15, vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 4
           hours on days 1 and 15, and etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 2-6 (OEPA). Treatment
           repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. Beginning at week 9, patients receive VECOPA
           chemotherapy comprising oral prednisone on days 1-14 and 21-34, etoposide IV over 2
           hours on days 1-3, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 2 hours on day 21, vinblastine IV
           and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 21, and vincristine IV on days 8 and
           29. Patients then undergo radiotherapy.

        -  Stratum 2 (stages IIB[E], IIIA/B[E], IIIB, or IVA/B): Patients receive 2 courses of OEPA
           as in stratum 1 followed by 2 courses of VECOPA (6-week courses). Patients then undergo
           radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 6 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
