    
      Multiple myeloma（MM） is one of the most common malignant diseases in the blood system.There
      is still no cure for the disease which only control the development of the disease in various
      ways.

      In recent years, the understanding of pathogenic molecular mechanism in MM , many new types
      of drugs can be used in the treatment of this disease, one of the most widely used is
      proteasome inhibitors and immune regulator.Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has also
      been shown to improve complete remission rates and prolong patient survival.Combined with the
      advantages of multiple therapies, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) have gradually
      become one of the strongest and most powerful weapons against multiple myeloma.

      CAR - T cells was taken in the form of genetic modification, and specific identified target
      antigen monoclonal antibody of single variable region (scFv) expression in T cell surface,
      and coupled with the activation of intracellular proliferation signal domain.

      When scFv recognizes antigens expressed in malignant cells, it stimulates the activation
      signal of downstream T cells and produces specific killing effects. CAR-T therapy is one of
      revolutionary targeted immunotherapy.The efficacy of CAR-T cells for the treatment of acute B
      lymphocytic leukemia has been widely recognized, and several clinical trials have been
      reported in the treatment of multiple myeloma with CAR-T cells.Throughout registration of
      clinical trials and published research results, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) as one of
      targets , its effect is more significant than other molecules.As with BCMA antigens, cluster
      of differentiation 138(CD138), cluster of differentiation 56 (CD56) or cluster of
      differentiation 38(CD38) antigens are also highly expressed in multiple myeloma cells.With
      CD138 as the target for the treatment of CAR-T cells, several clinical studies have been
      registered, and the results show that some of them are effective.

      In order to lay a foundation for the application of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma
      patients with CAR-T therapy，objects are refractory/ relapsed patients with multiple
      myeloma,and plans to into the group of the number of cases in 50 cases.The main content is
      safety, efficacy and feasibility analysis of the CAR-T cells （single CAR-T or double CAR-T
      cells with BCMA、CD138、CD56 or CD38 ) in the treatment of refractory/relapsed multiple
      myeloma.
