      HNC patients treated with definitive RT and immunotherapy or chemotherapy (cetuximab or
      cisplatin) will undergo VFSS at 4-6 and 12-24 months post-treatment. Patients enrolled prior
      to 6 months after finishing therapy will undergo a swallow study during the 4-6 month period
      AND the 12-24 month period. Patients enrolled after 6 months after finishing therapy will
      undergo a single swallow study in the 12-24 month period. The primary endpoint of PCR at
      12-24 months will be compared between patients treated with immunotherapy versus
      chemotherapy.

      All patients with HNC treated with definitive RT and systemic therapy at our institution will
      be eligible. In particular, we will recruit patients for this study from participants in two
      ongoing trials investigating the use of concurrent immunotherapy. The KEYCHAIN trial
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03383094) randomizes patients with locally advanced p16+
      HNC undergoing definitive RT to concurrent q3 week cisplatin versus concurrent and adjuvant
      pembrolizumab. NRG-HN004 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03258554) is a cooperative group
      trial that compares HNC patients that are not eligible for cisplatin undergoing definitive
      radiation therapy to concurrent cetuximab versus durvalumab.
