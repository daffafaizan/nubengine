      lymphoma and infection with Helicobacter pylori. If we summarise the reports to date on the
      results of treatment of gastric low-grade MALT lymphoma in an early clinical stage (EI) by H.
      pylori eradication we find a complete remission figure of 77% in more than 200 patients.

      As a therapy with less side effects than radiation, surgery or chemotherapy and as a
      stomach-conserving treatment, eradication of H. pylori in patients with low-grade gastric
      MALT lymphoma in stages IE & II1E should be the treatment of the choice within clinical
      trials since there are no long-term results available thus far. Besides, pretreatment patient
      selection and careful follow-up with endoscopy, biopsies and clinical staging including
      endoscopic ultrasonography is necessary. However, a five to ten year-follow-up will be
      necessary before the definitive value of Helicobacter pylori eradication can be established.
      Furthermore, since not all patients respond to this therapy research into the pathogenetic
      mechanisms of lymphomagenesis is inevitable.

      Approximately 20% of patients with antigen-positive, primary gastric low-grade MALT lymphoma
      in stage I will not respond to eradication therapy. Hence, a consecutive salvage therapy
      other than surgery is much needed. The aim of the second part of this study is to establish
      radiation therapy as a salvage therapy. Furthermore, the effect of a reduced radiation dose
      (25.2Gy) compared to the standard dose (36Gy) will be investigated with the aim of
      non-inferiority of both doses.
