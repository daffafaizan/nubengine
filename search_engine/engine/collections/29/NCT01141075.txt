      investigational drug called ataluren. Evaluation procedures to determine if a participant
      qualifies for the study will be performed within 14 days prior to the start of drug
      administration. Eligible participants who elect to enroll in the study will then participate
      in 2 drug administration and follow-up periods. Within the first period, ataluren will be
      taken 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 5 milligrams/kilograms (mg/kg)
      (morning), 5 mg/kg (midday), and 10 mg/kg (evening); there will then be an interval of
      approximately 21 days without ataluren. Within the second period, ataluren will be taken 3
      times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 10 mg/kg (morning), 10 mg/kg (midday), and
      20 mg/kg (evening); there will then be an interval of approximately 14 days without ataluren.
      During the study, ataluren activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated, and
      MMacid levels in blood and urine will be measured periodically.
