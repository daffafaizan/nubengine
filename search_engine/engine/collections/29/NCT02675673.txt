      intensive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer.
      Typically, tubes remain in place for up to 3-4 months. Whether small-bore jejunal (GJ) or
      larger bore gastric (G) tubes are used varies geographically, based on tradition, physician
      preference and availability of services. Feeding tube placement is arranged either prior to
      the start of RT, or more commonly within the first 2 weeks of RT, prior to the onset of
      severe mucositis. Patients are admitted to hospital for 1-3 days to monitor side effects of
      the procedure, and to allow our dietetic and nursing staff to provide intensive teaching on
      the use and care of the tube. Feeding tubes are kept in place through the treatment course
      and removed once patients are able to meet their calorie needs and maintain body weight
      through oral feeding. On average, feeding tubes are removed approximately 2-3 months after
      completion of RT; however, approximately 20% of patients may still require enteral feeding at
      1 year post-treatment. This study will compare the QOL in patients who use the G tube versus
      the GJ tube.
