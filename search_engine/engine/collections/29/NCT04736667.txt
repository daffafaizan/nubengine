      patients with mitral valve disease. Development of transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr)
      and transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) continues to progress with ongoing rigorous
      clinical trials of several experimental devices. However, despite being referred for TMVI,
      most patients do not pass stringent screening criteria for these investigational devices and
      are not offered TMVI.

      In this prospective multicenter registry, baseline demographics, anatomical/imaging
      characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients who fail screening for TMVI will be
      prospectively collected into a registry database.
