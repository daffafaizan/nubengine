      biopsy for detection of implant-related intra-articular shoulder infections (IISI).

      The secondary objectives are to document the frequency of pain associated with shoulder
      synovial biopsy and to determine the correlation and agreement of several indices of
      infection as a means of providing preliminary evidence toward a clinical decision rule to
      rule in or rule out the diagnosis of implant-related intra-articular shoulder infection.

      The third objective is to determine the rates of (re)infection, functional outcomes, and
      quality of life, over a two year follow up period following revision surgery.

      The fourth objective is to determine whether an association exists between the biopsy
      location within the joint and relative yield and positive culture rates.

      The fifth objective is to identify, develop, and validate tissue-specific biomarkers for the
      detection of IISI.

      It is our hypothesis that synovial biopsy is valid tool for use in the diagnosis of shoulder
      arthroplasty and fracture implant related infections.
