    
      A16-weeks randomized placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 24 patients with
      age range of 22 to 50, who were clinically diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis on the basis
      of clinical manifestations. The AS patients were divided into 2 subgroup with a block
      randomization, 12 out of 24 received a daily dose of 80 mg oral nano-curcumin and 12 patients
      received placebo as control group in a period of 4 months. Peripheral blood samples (8 ml)
      were obtained from the patients in both control and treatment groups before and after
      nano-curcumin treatment for 4 months. PBMCs were isolated from samples using Ficoll
      separation technique. Subsequently, cells were cultured in the presence of PMA. Treg cells
      associated immunological parameters such as mRNA expression levels of mir-146a, mir-27 and
      mir-17, TGF-β, IL-10, IL-6 and FoxP3 and alsoTh17 related immunological parameters such as
      mRNA expression of mir-141, mir-155 and mir-200, IL-17, IL-23 and RORγt were measured by
      real-time PCR, also Treg and Th17 frequency and their related cytokines secretion levels were
      evaluated respectively by flowcytometry and ELISA technique in both groups, pre and
      post-treatment.
