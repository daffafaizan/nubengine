      pharmacokinetics of single and multiple intravenous doses of SPR741 when administered to
      healthy adult volunteers. This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose,
      multi-cohort trial. A total of ninety-six healthy volunteers will be enrolled in 12 cohorts.
      The study will be conducted in two phases: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase, followed by a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase. In SAD, participants will receive one dose of SPR741 or
      placebo. In MAD, participants will receive multiple doses of SPR741 or placebo for 14
      consecutive days. In both parts, sequential cohorts will be exposed to increasing doses of
      SPR741.
