      using a randomized parallel wait-list control design for mothers with young children. The
      platform incorporates home based supportive group exercise sessions using video conferencing
      tools, shared online activity tracking and exercise mobile apps for individualized exercise
      routines will help mothers increase their physical activity levels and be successful at
      maintaining this increase.

      The intervention arm consists of two main parts: home based video conferencing virtual
      exercise sessions and mobile exercise apps, which women use to tailor exercise routines to
      their own skill level and preferences. Both arms will receive an activity monitor that they
      collect continuous activity data throughout the study.
