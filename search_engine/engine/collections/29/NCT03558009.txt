      by deficient (type 1) or nonfunctional (type 2) C1 inhibitor protein (encoded by SERPING1
      gene). The disorder is associated with episodes of angioedema of the face, larynx, lips,
      abdomen, and extremities. The angioedema is caused by the activation of the kallikrein-kinin
      system that leads to the release of vasoactive peptides, followed by edema, which in severe
      cases can be life threatening.

      Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in 93% of patients with HAE and may be the only
      manifestation of the disease. However, individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely
      considered for HAE and the disease can be misdiagnosed for several years.

      EHA study focuses on the gastrointestinal complications of HAE as a potential area of
      misdiagnosis leading to surgical morbidity. Aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence
      of HAE among participants experiencing recurrent abdominal pain attacks with no clear
      etiology. The HAE-positive samples in the study will be further analyzed biochemically to
      identify disease-specific biomarker that may support the development of new diagnostic tools
      for HAE disease.
