      rationale and may provide additive benzodiazepine-sparing effects. All subjects will receive
      benzodiazepine therapy as standard of care.

      The objectives of this randomized, double-blind pilot study of 20 subjects with severe
      alcohol withdrawal are to a) determine if adding ketamine 0.5 mg/kg per hour to
      dexmedetomidine 0.6 Âµg/kg per hour (both agents administered for up to 72 hours) as
      adjunctive therapies to a symptom-triggered benzodiazepine protocol reduces the dose
      requirements of conventional sedatives while maintaining patient comfort and safety; and to
      b) explore whether epinephrine, a marker of autonomic activity, is expressed differently when
      ketamine is added to dexmedetomidine as adjunctive therapies.
