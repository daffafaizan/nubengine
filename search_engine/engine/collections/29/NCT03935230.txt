      organ failure, demand exceeds supply. For many years, donation after neurological death
      represented the principal source of organs for transplantation. In the last decade,
      prevention measures, improvements in neurocritical care, and decompressive craniectomy have
      led to a significant decrease in the number of non-directed donors (NDDs). In such
      situations, alternative sources for organ donation must be identified. Cardiac-arrest
      patients could provide a solution to this organ shortage. Patients who have experienced
      unexpected in or out of hospital cardiopulmonary arrest could become organ donors. Organ
      donation following uncontrolled cardiocirculatory death is currently practiced in many
      European countries. However, in Canada, it's not yet authorized. Yet, each deceased could
      save up to four lives. The purpose of this study is to determine the organ potential for a
      cohort of patient who had died from a cardiopulmonary arrest at the CHUS in 2015 and assess
      the effect of the implementation of a uDCD program on the number of additional donors.
