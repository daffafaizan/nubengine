      to conventionally administered treatments are in need for new methods of treatment.

      While their chemotherapy had been administered up till then at the classical regimen of
      Maximal Tolerated Doses (MTD), which is aimed to directly killing maximal fractions of tumor
      cells, the present study evaluates the clinical benefit of a treatment which is based on old
      chemotherapeutic and old anti-inflammatory drugs, when these are administered at low doses,on
      daily basis and orally taken, without planed brakes (Low Dose Metronomic regimen).

      Treatments based on this type of regimen have already been studied on other models of cancer
      and showed the capacity of suppressing tumor growth by a new category of anti-tumor effects.
      Namely, by affecting factors and mechanisms which prevail in the microenvironment that
      surrounds tumor deposits, thus circumventing the resistance of their cancer cells to
      chemotherapy.
