      chemotherapy (Doxorubicine and Cyclophosfamide). We will evaluate the control of nausea and
      vomiting in the first cycle of chemotherapy, utilizing Netupitant (300mg) + palonosetron
      (0,56mg) in day 1 and Olanzapine 5mg starting on Day 0, given once a day for five days. The
      primary endpoint of this study is complete response rate (no nausea, no emesis no use of
      rescue medication).
