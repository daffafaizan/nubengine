    
      Among newly-treated Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) patients, the investigators will
      compare the systematic collection and feedback of information about patients' treatment
      experiences on changes in quality of life (intervention group) to newly treated DPN patients
      in usual care who will receive generic educational messages by phone but no active data
      collection and feedback (comparator group). The investigators have chosen usual care as the
      control to evaluate the potential for the intervention to enhance current practice.

      Aim 1: Refine and pilot test instruments for collecting the patient-reported data most
      important for guiding changes in treatment.

      Aim 2: Implement a seven-month cluster randomized trial to improve quality of life among
      patients newly treated for DPN symptoms by collecting data on patient treatment experiences
      and facilitating evidence-based patient and provider-initiated treatment titration.

      Aim 3: Examine patient and physician initiated treatment changes as secondary outcomes in
      order to inform the development of this type of rapid feedback process for guiding decision
      making about initial treatment selection among patients with DPN.
