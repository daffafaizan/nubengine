      Primary

        -  To determine the ability to administer 8 continuous weeks of therapy within the first 3
           months of enrollment with paricalcitol when given together with taxane or ixabepilone
           therapy in women with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients who successfully complete 8 continuous weeks of
           therapy as well as the proportion of patients who achieve a 'steady-state' dose.

      Secondary

        -  To determine a dose of paricalcitol that can be taken continuously that maintains a
           normal calcium level when combined with a taxane or ixabepilone.

        -  To determine if baseline levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and parathyroid hormone
           (PTH) are associated with time to treatment failure in these patients.

        -  To determine if PTH levels decline from baseline in patients treated with paricalcitol
           in combination with taxane or ixabepilone therapy.

      OUTLINE: Beginning on day 1, patients receive oral paricalcitol. The dose of paricalcitol is
      increased every 2 weeks until the serum calcium level is between 9 mg/dL and 11.4 mg/dL. Once
      this level is reached, the patient continues at that dose for the duration of the study.
      Patients also receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, docetaxel, or
      paclitaxel once a week or once every 3 weeks or ixabepilone once every 3 weeks. Treatment
      continues for at least 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
