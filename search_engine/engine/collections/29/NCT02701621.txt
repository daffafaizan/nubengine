      to falls which have a negative impact on the quality of life. It is known that aquatic
      therapy could be useful to train balance given its physical features and for reducing
      patients' fear of falls. Many studies have evaluated the efficacy of land-based physiotherapy
      in treatment of BD, but few studies have investigated the efficacy of aquatic therapy on
      balance and none of those assessed clinical measurements in a clinically, relevant follow-up
      period.

      Objective: The aim of study was to compare the effectiveness of a specific aquatic therapy
      program on balance with a land-based physical-treatment in patients with PD and to evaluate
      the long-term effects in a 6-month follow-up period.

      Methods: Thirty-four patients with PD in medium-stage of disease were randomized into two
      groups: 17 underwent Multidisciplinary-Intensive-Rehabilitation-Treatment (MIRT) and 17
      underwent MIRT associated with aquatic therapy protocol (MIRT-AT). Investigators assessed the
      Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II-III, and Timed
      Up Go test (TUG) in both groups at admission, discharge and after a 6-months follow-up
      period.
