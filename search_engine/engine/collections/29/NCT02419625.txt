      examine associations between HEV seropositivity and putative risk factors.

      3.2 Specific aims

        -  To determine the sero-prevalence of Israeli healthy population.

        -  To quantify the sero-prevalence of HEV infections in Israeli healthy population by age,
           gender, ethnicity, religion.

        -  To present the seroprevalence in five specific groups (farmers and swine veterinaries,
           unexplained acute hepatitis, immunosuppressed transplant recipients, immunosuppressed
           HIV patients) and identify if these specific population groups are at high risk of HEV
           sero-prevalence.

        -  To identify risk factors associated with an increased risk of HEV sero-prevalence in
           immunosuppressed transplant patients.

        -  To identify risk factors associated with an increased risk of HEV sero-prevalence in
           farmers and swine veterinaries.

        -  To identify the molecular characteristic of HEV in Israel and investigate the
           similarities to previously published HEV sequences.

        -  To identify the incidence of HEV seroconversion/ infection in transplant recipients.
           (sero-negative pre-transplanted patients will be tested consistently for HEV Ab's and
           HEV RNA after transplantation)
