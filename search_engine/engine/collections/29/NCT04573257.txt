      hypertension can cause left ventricular remodeling and loss of function, eventually leading
      to heart failure. Ventricular remodeling in hypertensive patients is an adaptive and
      decompensating response to persistent elevated blood pressure and increased myocardial work
      load. Exploring the early changes and mechanisms of left ventricular cardiac function caused
      by hypertension, and to identify individuals who may develop into serious heart injury, may
      play a positive role in the early prevention and control of heart failure caused by
      hypertension.Therefore, this study intend to use two-dimensional speckle tracking technology,
      a non-invasive method to measure left ventricular pressure-strain loop to quantitatively
      reflect cardiac work index , to study different hypertension patients with normal left
      ventricular ejection fraction (including hypertension without heart damage performance with
      different degree of high blood pressure, hypertension with diastolic dysfunction ,
      hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy ) the change of the global and local cardiac
      work, and the influence of aterosclerosis in thes patients to myocardial work, and explore
      their relationship with ventricular remodeling and abnormal diastolic function.To improve the
      understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension, hypertensive heart disease and heart
      failure, and to provide scientific support for the early prevention and control of such
      diseases.
