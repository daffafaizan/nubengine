      ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will be included. After amnesis patients
      will undergo blood withdrawal, blood-gas analysis and examinations concerning pulmonary
      function (Bodyplethysmography). In addition to routine blood withdrawal for differential
      blood count, 9 ml blood sample is takenfor molecular analysis of relevant prognostic chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-blood based biomarkers, an for establishing a library of
      biomaterial in form of a biobank.
