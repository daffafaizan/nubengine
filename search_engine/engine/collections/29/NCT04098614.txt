    
      Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a prevalent disease that impacts an estimated 24 million
      Americans each year. The life-altering consequences of SUD are both diverse and severe,
      influencing mortality, the workplace, and economics. The goal of this study is to determine
      how specific risk factors of relapse and barriers to recovery, including neurocognitive,
      health, personal, social, financial, and situational barriers, can be overcome or changed
      through a recovery coaching intervention. This work seeks to provide a mechanism to
      demonstrate exactly how and why this potential new model of care (recovery coaching) is
      effective, rather than simply assessing if it can work. To accomplish this aim, the change
      between baseline and 6-month assessments will be assessed. Then, the difference in the change
      between individuals assigned to the current standard of care and patients assigned to
      inpatient recovery will be compared.
