      the Quell for persons with chronic musculoskeletal low back pain. The investigators
      hypothesize that those assigned to using the device will report reduced back pain compared
      with those in the control condition; with those using the device also showing improvement in
      sleep, mood, and level of activity. The investigators hypothesize that frequency of using the
      Quell (increased tolerability and adherence) will be correlated with greater reduction in
      pain. The investigators hypothesize that the device will be safe to use and will demonstrate
      a reduction in healthcare utilization (reduced clinic and Emergency Department visits).
      Finally, based on preliminary analyses limited by few subject numbers, the investigators will
      investigate whether certain individuals report greater benefit from using the Quell than
      others and, in particular, would predict that those with more intense and longer duration of
      pain will demonstrate most benefit.
