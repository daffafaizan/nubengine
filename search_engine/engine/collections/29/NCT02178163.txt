      I. To assess the percentage of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in whom therapy
      can be initiated based on genomic analysis of tumor specimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the percentage of patients in whom genomic analysis can be performed.

      II. To assess the progression free survival and response rate in patients who start therapy
      based on the genomic analyses results.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue samples for genomic analysis via mass spectrometry,
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microarray. Based on the results of the genomic
      analysis, patients may begin therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months thereafter.
