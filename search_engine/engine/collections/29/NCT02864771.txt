    
      This is a multicenter prospective cohort study to assess the prognostic value of potential
      biomarkers for incident ventricular arrhythmias and cardiovascular events in patients with
      implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). In addition to information from the baseline
      visit and future study visits, the investigators will also register information from the
      patients medical records concerning comorbidities and previous medical events.

      The data will be summarized with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics and risk
      markers/ measurements. The final diagnosis of incident cardiovascular events will be
      established by an adjudication committee with two senior physicians reviewing all information
      available on the patients, including information on the clinical outcome of the patient. The
      investigators will use multivariate statistical models to assess the individual performance
      of biomarkers/other tests.
