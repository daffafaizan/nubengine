      the care of prehospital patients. The need for advanced airway management in critical
      out-of-hospital patients can be considered as one indicator of the severity of the patient's
      condition.

      A recent European initiative suggested advanced airway management to be included in the top
      five research priorities for physician-provided prehospital care.To our knowledge, no
      previous studies describe the long-term outcome of critical prehospital patients treated by
      an EMS physician.

      The primary aim of this study was to describe the long-term outcome of critically ill or
      severely injured patients not in cardiac arrest treated by an EMS physician. Our secondary
      aims were to determine the indications and causes for EMS physician performed prehospital
      endotracheal intubation.
