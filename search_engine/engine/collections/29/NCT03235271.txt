    
      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded, hospital-based study of patients
      presenting with acute stroke symptoms within 24 hours of symptom onset (last known normal or
      actual time) as evidenced by radiological imaging. The study will be executed in two parts:
      Study Part I and Study Part II. Each study part will consist of the same sequence of events
      and study procedures. The first part of the study is designed to enroll a smaller sample size
      to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating the BrainPulse device in the Stroke patient care
      workflow.

      Patients will be consecutively recruited and once patients have consented and met
      eligibility, they will be assigned to one of the four study Groups based on their confirmed
      clinical diagnosis. Each subject will complete one BrainPulse recording before
      neuro-intervention and within one hour of IV pharmacologic intervention. All subjects will
      also complete comprehensive neurological, cognitive and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) assessments.
      Additionally, Ischemic Stroke subjects (Group A) that receive neuro-intervention will
      complete one BrainPulse recording within four hours after intervention along with a
      neurological exam. If these procedures have been completed as part of standard of care, the
      data can be captured directly from the medical records. If such procedures were not conducted
      as part of hospital's standard of care, they will need to be completed for the purpose of the
      study.
