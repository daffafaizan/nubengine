      vessels in the brain. Older adults, in particular, are at risk for silent strokes. This type
      of stroke does not cause any of the typical stroke symptoms, such as vision problems, facial
      numbness, or walking difficulties; however, subtle changes in a person's cognitive ability or
      memory may occur following a silent stroke. It is important to diagnose this type of stroke
      because several occurrences of silent strokes can increase the risk of having a more serious,
      and possibly fatal, stroke. As women go through menopause, many choose to take HRT to relieve
      common menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and mood swings. Unfortunately, the use of
      HRT may place women at higher risk of experiencing a silent stroke. This study will assess
      whether women who take HRT, either as estrogen alone or as estrogen and progesterone
      combined, have a greater risk of silent stroke than women who do not take HRT. Study
      researchers will also examine changes in brain tissue and changes in the areas of the brain
      associated with thinking and memory.

      This study will enroll women who are participating in the WHIMS study. Participants will
      attend one study visit at which time a brain MRI scan will be completed. Study researchers
      will analyze participants' study data from the WHIMS study and the Women's Health Initiative
      Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) study, an ancillary WHIMS study that examined the effects
      of HRT on memory and cognition.
