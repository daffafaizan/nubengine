      acids (PUFAs) hypothesis of depression. Firstly, although case-control studies revealed that
      depressive patients had lower levels of omega-3 PUFAs, the abnormal findings in individual
      PUFA of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or arachidonic acid (AA) are
      not consistent. Secondly, the deficits in n-3 PUFAs are related to their metabolic enzymes.
      However, the association study of polymorphisms of PUFA-metabolism related genes in
      depression is limited. Thirdly, the active component of antidepressant effect in n-3 PUFAs is
      still in debate. Fourthly, the molecular mechanisms of n-3 PUFAs' antidepressant effects have
      yet to be elucidated in human brain functional neuroimaging or in cellular models.

      This 3-year proposal is divided into 2 clinical studies. In study 1, the investigators aim to
      test the clinical and biological effects of n-3 PUFAs (EPA: 3.5 g/d and DHA: 1.75 g/d versus
      placebo: high oleic oil) for depressive symptoms in a 12-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of patients with drug-free MDD. In study 2, the investigators will
      measure the biological and neuroimaging markers to investigate the biological mechanisms of
      EPA (3.5 g/d) versus DHA (1.75 g/d) in 12-week, double-blind, randomized-controlled trial
      with patients with drug-free major depression disorder (MDD).
