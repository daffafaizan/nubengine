      Patients in study group 1 (SG1) will have their urinary catheters removed at 48 hours
      post-operatively; Patients in study group 2 (SG2) will have their urinary catheters removed
      only after the epidural has been withdrawn in the post-operative period. We will be primarily
      examining rates of urinary retention in both groups. We will also be examining rates of
      urinary tract infection, chest infection (frequently a result of poor mobility after
      surgery), and wound infection and other complications after surgery.
