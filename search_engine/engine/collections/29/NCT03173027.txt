      explore whether the FHP could relieve pain and protect joints. 200 participants suffering
      from KOA will be enrolled and treated with FHP or placebo for 1 month. The primary outcome
      measures are the Visual analogue scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster university of
      orthopedic index (WOMAC), the Lequesne index, and MOS Sleep Scale would be measured from the
      baseline to 1 month. The second outcome measures would be the six minutes walking test, the
      Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF- 36), the X-ray of both knees, and the adverse events
      from the baseline to 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks' follow-up. In addition, the VAS score,
      the WOMAC score, the Lequesne index, and AIS Sleep Scale from the baseline to 2 weeks and 12
      weeks' follow-up are also the second outcome measures.
