      the electrically elicited blink reflex (BR) and the eye blink rate (EBR)in patients with
      craniofacial dystonia and their first degree relatives in order to determine whether
      abnormalities of inhibition can represent a marker of genetic predisposition for the
      development of dystonia. It is unclear why some relatives of patients with craniofacial
      dystonia do not develop dystonic symptoms. One possible explanation is that the development
      of dystonia is a two-stage process: first, loss of inhibition, which may be genetically
      determined, and second, exposure to an environmental trigger such as excessive repetitive
      movements. There is good evidence that focal dystonia is a genetically determined disorder,
      but the responsible gene remains undetermined. Patients, their first degree relatives and
      normal volunteers will undergo BR testing using validated electrophysiological tests of
      recovery cycle. The main outcome measure of the study is impaired inhibition in up to 50% of
      first degree relatives of patients with focal dystonia which would serve as biologic marker
      for the carrier state. A second outcome measure is the EBR. In those individuals with this
      genetic marker of impaired inhibition, future linkage analysis studies could be performed to
      identify the causative gene.
