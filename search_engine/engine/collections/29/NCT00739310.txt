      efficacy of VestÂ® therapy (HFCWO) for mucus secretion clearance in a population of patients
      with muscle weakness and restrictive lung disease with frequent pulmonary exacerbations.
      Enrolled subjects with a tracheostomy will be evaluated for microbial load and inflammatory
      status as a pilot evaluation of microbial load and inflammatory status outcomes.

      The total number of evaluable subjects to be recruited is estimated at 40. Subjects will be
      considered evaluable if they have completed at least 6 months of follow up.
