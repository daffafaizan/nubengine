      complex decongestive therapy. The components of the complex decongestive therapy are skin
      care, kinesiotherapy, manual lymphatic drainage and compression. The compression with
      multilayer bandage has proved to be the most effective of these therapies when analyzed
      separately. With the multilayer compression bandage the upper limb lymphedema volume
      decreased a 37.2%.

      The multilayer bandage produces a gradient compression on the limb where distal pressure is
      higher than proximal pressure. Several materials are needed for the multilayer bandage,
      including tubular bandage lining, digit bandages, foam under-cast padding and multiple layers
      of short-stretch bandages to cover the entire limb. The Precast Adjustable Compression Wrap
      fits each patient through a Velcro system.

      Decreasing compression is achieved by controlling the tension applied to each Velcro through
      a visual color guide. The Precast Adjustable Compression Wrap has proved to be safe and
      effective to treat lower limb lymphedema, but there is little information about its
      effectiveness in the treatment of the upper limb lymphedema.

      The aim is to compare the effectiveness of a precast adjustable compression wrap (Circaid)
      with the multilayer compression bandages in the treatment of the upper limb lymphedema.
