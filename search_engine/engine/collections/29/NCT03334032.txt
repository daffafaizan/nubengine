      (TBPr). Re-nutrition for patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) should aim to normalize body
      composition, i.e. recovery of fat mass and TBPr.

      Objective: The study intended to analyze predictors of protein status, including exercise
      status, in adolescents with AN, and to investigate whether weight gain would replete body
      protein deficits.

      Methods: The investigators assessed TBPr in a longitudinal, observational study as
      height-adjusted nitrogen index (NI) using in-vivo neutron activation analysis in adolescents
      with AN at the commencement of refeeding (T0), as well as seven months thereafter (T1), and
      in age-matched normal weight controls. Lean tissue and fat mass were assessed with
      Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). BMI, BMI-SDS and lean tissue mass were tested as
      predictors of protein status using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis.
