      single therapeutic agent and compare it to combination therapy with Veregen ™ 15% ointment
      and a single destructive treatment by cryotherapy for non-facial verruca vulgaris in the
      pediatric population. The investigators will compare the single and combination treatment
      modalities over identical time points in patients with non-facial verruca vulgaris. One of
      the current options for care for non-facial verruca includes cryotherapy, which is a painful
      and destructive method performed in the pediatric dermatology clinic. This study aims to
      establish the safety, non-invasivenature, efficiency, and efficacy of Veregen ™ 15% ointment
      as monotherapyfor non-facial verruca vulgaris in the pediatric population. The investigators
      hypothesize that Veregen ™ 15% ointment monotherapy will non-invasively treat non-facial
      verruca vulgaris with similar efficacy as combination therapy with a single cryotherapy
      treatment followed by topical application of Veregen ™ ointment. This novel treatment
      modality will be useful in the pediatric dermatology community offering a less invasive,
      painless option for treatment of non-facial verruca vulgaris.
