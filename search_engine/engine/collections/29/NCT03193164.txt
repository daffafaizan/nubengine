      patients with septic shock.

      It will be a randomised crossover clinical trial. Thirty-one patients will enrolled.The study
      will be divided in two phases, the first will be held in the first 72 hours of septic shock
      and the second after three days of first assessment. Patients will be selected, randomly, to
      the intervention Protocol (NMES) and control (positioning). After this procedure the patients
      will be allocated in Group 1 (NMES and control) or group 2 (control and NMES), with a
      wash-out period of 4 to 6 hours in between .

      The main outcome will be the study of mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).
      The secondary outcome will be the metabolic and hemodynamic data. Linear mixed model will be
      used for analysis of dependent variables and estimated values of the mean of the differences
      of each effect.

      The results of this study will allow better understanding of the effects of NMES in patients
      with septic shock.
