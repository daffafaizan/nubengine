    
      This is a prospective, open-label, non-interventional trial to evaluate HCV-RNA levels during
      treatment with Sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Participants will receive Sorafenib 400mg orally twice daily. HCV-RNA (Hepatitis C Virus -
      Ribonucleic Acid) levels will be measured at baseline, week 2 of sorafenib, week 4 of
      sorafenib, week 6 of sorafenib, week 8 of sorafenib, week 12 of sorafenib, and 2 weeks after
      discontinuing sorafenib. HCV-RNA levels will be measured by drawing about 2 tablespoons of
      blood

      During the study period, tumor assessments will be done by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
      or CT (computed tomography) scans at baseline and every 8 weeks.
