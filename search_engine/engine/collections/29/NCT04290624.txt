    
      This study is a single-center, single-blind (to the examiner(s) performing the plaque,
      gingivitis, denture cleanliness and oral hygiene assessments), randomized, stratified (by
      denture material type and baseline mean overall modified gingival index [MGI] score),
      two-treatment, parallel group, 12 week clinical study in generally healthy, adult
      participants with at least one conventional removable partial denture (RPD) and generalized,
      mild-moderate, plaque-induced gingivitis (as determined by clinical examiner) and greater
      than or equal to >=4 natural teeth in each arch that meet all study criteria at both the
      Screening and Baseline visits (including >= 30 evaluable surfaces for clinical evaluation of
      gingivitis and plaque). The study will examine the effects of twice daily use of a range of
      dental/denture products (comprising use of a dentifrice, a mouthrinse and a denture cleanser)
      compared to no intervention (participants who continue with their existing oral hygiene
      habits). There will be four visits to the study site: screening, baseline (when participants
      are randomized), and after 6- and 12 weeks use of the range of dental/denture products.
