      Treatment with imlifidase, PE and immunoabsorption (IA) all aim to reduce antibody levels.

      This study will compare the reduction in DSA levels after treatment with imlifidase and PE in
      patients diagnosed with active or chronic active AMR (according to Banff 2017 criteria)
      having at least a 25% rise in serum creatinine compared with last measurement prior to the
      AMR (Patients with delayed graft function and AMR within 10 days after kidney transplantation
      can be included regardless of serum creatinine level).

      Included patients will be randomized to receive either 1 dose of imlifidase (0.25 mg/kg) or
      5-10 sessions of PEs (IA may replace PE at the discretion of the investigator). All patients
      will receive pulse methylprednisolone for 3 days, starting before the 1st treatment, followed
      by a tapering schedule with prednisolone/prednisone. The patients will also receive high dose
      IVIg 3 days after imlifidase treatment or directly after the last PE. In addition a single
      dose of rituximab will be given 5 days after completed IVIg infusion.
