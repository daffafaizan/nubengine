    
      Patients with traumatic vertebral fractures type A3.2, A3.3, B1 and C1 of the MAGERL
      classification will be enrolled in this open study. They will be operated on in emergency to
      perform spinal canal decompression, fracture reduction and posterior fixation using fixation
      plates with pedicular screws combined with bone graft.

      During the same surgery or some days later on, percutaneous Balloon kyphoplasty of the
      fractured vertebral body (ies) using polymethylmetacrylate cement injection through a
      posterior transpedicular approach will be carried out in replacement of anterior spine
      surgery to restore vertebral body strength.Patients will be followed up for one year.

      Expected advantages of this management compared the conventional two session surgery include
      the following:

        -  decreased morbidity due to suppression of the anterior surgery

        -  improve final spine alignment and vertebral Kyphotic angle avoiding the loss in kyphotic
           angle which often occurs between the posterior and anterior surgery with the
           conventional two session surgery.
