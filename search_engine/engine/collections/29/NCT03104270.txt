    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study with six patients safety
      lead-in cohort to evaluate efficacy and safety of elotuzumab in combination with
      pomalidomide, carfilzomib and dexamethasone among high risk relapsed and refractory multiple
      myeloma patients.

      This study will enroll previously treated patients that currently show evidence of
      progressive disease and have been diagnosed with high risk multiple myeloma. Thirty-nine
      patients will be enrolled in the study.

      First, six patients will be enrolled and used as a lead-in cohort for the safety evaluation
      and MTD re-determination (if necessary). The results of the safety lead-in cohort will be
      evaluated after the 6th patient has completed one full cycle of treatment. Recruitment of
      patients will be withheld during safety data analysis. Enrollment of the remaining 33
      patients will be contingent upon safety committee's decision.

      The study consists of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day treatment cycles; 3) a
      final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle; and 4) a
      follow-up period.

      All drugs will be administered on a 28-day cycle schedule throughout the study. Subjects
      eligible for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of eight 28-day
      treatment cycles. Subjects are to be treated for 8 cycles of therapy without demonstrating
      PD.
