      all citizens to stay at home as much as possible. These measures severely limit physical
      activity. It is known that physical activity is an important preventive approach for many
      preventable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases. Restriction of physical activity,
      loss of usual routine, and reduced social and physical contact with others can cause feelings
      of distress, disappointment, and isolation.

      In the latest guidelines, increasing physical activity is recommended to prevent heart rhythm
      disorders and contribute to the effectiveness of treatment.

      The aim of our study is to examine the effect of social isolation on physical activity level,
      health literacy, and kinesophobia in heart rhythm disorders.
