      and clinically separate components: somatic pain due to trocar insertion sites , visceral
      pain due to surgical dissection and tissue handling at the gall bladder bed, and shoulder
      pain due to retention of carbon dioxide in the abdomen, which irritates the phrenic nerve and
      diaphragm. Ineffective treatment of post laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain may delay recovery
      and mandate inpatient admission and therapy and increase the cost of such care.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of Erector spinea plane block in
      comparison with peritoneal block for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Serum level of cortisol as
      a stress biomarker ,perioperative primary hemodynamics ,visual analogue scale , patient
      request for rescue analgesia and occurrence of side effects are the parameters for comparison
      between both techniques. Each patient will be followed up for 24 hours postoperatively.
