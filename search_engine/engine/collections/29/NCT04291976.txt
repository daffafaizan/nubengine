      white light endoscopy and 24% using either chromoendoscopy or high-definition white light
      endoscopy with a second examination (Imperatore et al 2019). To show non-inferiority of
      back-to-back HDWLE compared to CE, with a non-inferiority margin of 10% (power 80% and alpha
      5%,) a total of 226 patients per group is required.

      To demonstrate a superiority of back-to-back HDWLE compared to a regular HDWLE, with a 1:2
      allocation ratio of single-pass vs back-to-back , 113 and 226 patients per group are needed
      to achieve 80% power with an alpha of 5%. Therefore, the investigators will include 226
      patients in group back-to-back HDWLE, 226 in group CE, and 113 patients in group regular
      HDWLE. This amounts to a total of 560 patients. To account for any screen-failures The
      investigators will include at most 5% (of 560) additional patients until 80% power is
      reached.
