      in the brain to decrease appetite and increase long term energy usage. Leptin levels usually
      go down when people are not eating for extended periods of time. Changes in metabolism and
      certain hormone levels also occur with fasting. By studying the pharmacokinetics of leptin
      administration, we can evaluate the changes of leptin levels in response to giving different
      doses of leptin as well as acute changes of other hormones in response to leptin levels.
      Investigations such as this one have important implications for the future therapeutic use of
      leptin, including determining the appropriate dose of leptin to use in future studies
      involving leptin administration.
