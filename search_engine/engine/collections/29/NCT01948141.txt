    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of fibroblast growth factor
      receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplified squamous cell lung cancer patients treated with BIBF 1120
      (nintedanib).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the 6-month PFS rate for the entire FGFR1 amplified group versus the FGFR1
      non-amplified patients.

      II. Compare the 6-month PFS rate for each FGFR1 amplified group (low, intermediate, and high)
      versus historical controls and FGFR1 non-amplified patients.

      III. To assess the following endpoints overall and by FGFR1 group: PFS, overall survival
      (OS), confirmed tumor response rate, and adverse events.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The relation of FGFR1 gene copy number with PFS, OS, confirmed response rate, and adverse
      events.

      II. The relationship fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) polymorphisms with toxicity and
      efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks.
