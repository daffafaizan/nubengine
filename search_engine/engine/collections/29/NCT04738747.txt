      who will be randomized to either wearing a WHOOP fitness tracker or a control group.
      Participants will take two Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) surveys prior to the start of the
      intervention to set a baseline burnout score, and then at 3 months and 6 months into the
      study. Baseline cardiac status will also be established by taking a pre-intervention heart
      rate and blood pressure.
