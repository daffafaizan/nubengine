    
      Data will be collected from 120 subjects undergoing hemodialysis treatment at 3 clinical
      sites across United States (40 per site).5.5 mL blood specimen will be drawn during midweek
      treatment (Wed/Thu) to measure:

      Hemoglobin Concentration Hematocrit Red Blood Cell Count Platelet Count Reticulocyte
      Percentage Reticulocyte Hemoglobin Mean Cellular Hemoglobin Mean Cellular Hemoglobin
      Concentration Mean Cell Volume Red Cell Volume Distribution Width Mean Platelet Volume Serum
      Iron Serum Ferritin Transferrin Saturation Hepcidin Soluble Transferrin Receptor

      Weekly ESA and Iron dose delivered will also be recorded.

      From these data:

        1. a mathematical model will be established to find biomarkers most descriptive with
           respect to erythropoiesis-iron synergy,

        2. a mathematical model will be established to correlate iron dose with iron markers.
