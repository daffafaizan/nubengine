        -  Determine the activity and safety of bortezomib and cisplatin as first-line treatment in
           patients with malignant mesothelioma.

        -  Validate the use of progression-free survival rate as a primary endpoint for the design
           of phase II mesothelioma trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days
      1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study.
