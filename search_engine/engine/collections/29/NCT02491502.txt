      nodules. HIFU is a completely alternative to surgery which utilizes high-energy ultrasound to
      deliver a large amount of sound energy to a focal point to rapidly induce tissue heating to
      85-90Â°C.This initiates tissue coagulation followed by tissue necrosis ablating the targeted
      area.

      In a previous european feasibility study performed at 1 site (Bulgaria), 20 benign thyroid
      nodules were treated. The HIFU treatment was well tolerated and showed efficacy.
