      tubular injury which can lead to poor outcome. Current AKI criteria using serum creatinine
      (Cr) has some limitations to predict reversibility of renal function and discriminate renal
      parenchymal injury in cirrhotic patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether urine
      biomarkers [cystatin C, N-acetyl-Î²-D-Glucosaminidase (NAG)] can predict survival and response
      to terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with AKI.
