      estimated 15% of all children greater than 18 months of age in the United States. It is now
      recognized that AD is a disease of significant heterogeneity with respect to both disease
      severity and response to conventional pharmacologic therapies. With the recognition of this
      variability comes the understanding that, as with many other allergic disease, there exist
      many specific disease phenotypes that ultimately govern response to pharmacologic
      intervention. The characterization of these unique phenotypes and their associated biologic
      mediators is therefore of critical therapeutic importance in the development of disease and
      patient-specific treatment strategies.

      The long term objective of this research is to explore the effects of genetic, environmental
      and developmental influences on the primary determinants of histamine action in atopic
      children and to identify potential histamine "haplotypes" that may be predictive of disease
      severity, progression and/or response to therapy.

      The primary hypothesis is the presence of HNMT T314 allele and /or slow acetylation genotype
      is associated with childhood atopic dermatitis.
