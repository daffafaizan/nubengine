      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with unresectable locally advanced or
           metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or other biliary tract tumors treated with gemcitabine
           hydrochloride with vs without cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, primary site of disease (gallbladder vs bile ducts vs ampulla), prior
      therapy (photodynamic therapy [PDT] vs non-PDT therapy vs none), ECOG performance status (0
      vs 1 vs 2), and disease status (locally advanced vs metastatic). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and
           15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV
           over 1Â½ hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and after finishing treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 3 years.
