      with the synchronized analysis of the chest cavity mobility, pulmonary volume , pulmonary
      impedance and measurement of Oesophageal pressure is not known. Therefore, this study aims to
      describe the physiological behavior of maximal respiratory maneuvers through the
      synchronization between electrical impedance tomography and optoelectronic plethysmography in
      healthy men.
