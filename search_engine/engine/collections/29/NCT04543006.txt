    
      Covid-19 is associated with the onset of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; in a majority of
      patients, neutralizing antibodies are detected. However, the long-term persistence of such
      protective antibodies is not known.

      The investigators will explore adult patients with a proven Covid-19 (positive PCR) 6 and 12
      months after the diagnosis to determine whether neutralizing antibodies are still detected.

      The investigators will determine whether this persistance varies according to

        -  the severity of the Covid-19 (3 groups: no oxyegn therapy; oxygen therapy of less than
           3L/min; oxygen therapy of 3L/min or more)

        -  a treatment by steroids during the covid-19. Immunocompromised patients will be
           excluded.
