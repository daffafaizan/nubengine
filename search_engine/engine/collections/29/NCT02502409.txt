      about one in 25,000 male births. This disease is in some ways more complex than hemophilia A,
      and is less well understood. Differences include a lower incidence and a greater risk of side
      effects to treatment, for example, allergic reactions and kidney disease. This study will
      examine two groups of subjects with FIX deficiency - those with a current or history of
      inhibitors to FIX, and groups of two or more affected brothers, with or without inhibitors.
      The overall goal is to characterize the study group in terms of their medical history, their
      patterns of bleeding, their care, quality of life, and complications including the
      development of inhibitory antibodies to FIX, allergies, kidney, and joint disease.
