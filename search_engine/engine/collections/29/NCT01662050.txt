      according to Cheson criteria (2007) at the end of treatment (6 or 4 cycles). Primary safety
      end point is the occurrence of any of the stop treatment criteria or of any episode of
      relevant toxicity, as above defined.

      Secondary end points are MRD defined response, OS, PFS and DOR (Cheson 2007). Molecular
      response is the proportion of patients with molecular rearrangements at baseline that become
      negative during treatment, measured by qualitative and quantitative PCR.

      OS is measured from enrollment until death from any cause. PFS is measured from the time of
      enrollment until disease progression, relapse or death from any cause. DOR is measured from
      the first assessment that documents response (CR or PR) to the date of disease relapse or
      progression. Minimum follow up required for all patients will be 24 months.
