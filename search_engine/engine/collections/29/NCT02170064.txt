    
      This clinical study was planned to be performed as an open-label, single-centre,
      multiple-dose study, in 30 paediatric epileptic patients distributed by 3 age groups of 10
      patients each: 2-6 years [Group 1], 7-11 years [Group 2], and 12-17 years [Group 3].

      The study was constituted by a 4-week baseline phase, followed by 3 consecutive 4-week
      treatment periods with Eslicarbazepine acetate in which patients received Eslicarbazepine
      acetate once-daily at the following dosage regimens: 5 mg/kg/day (weeks 1-4), 15 mg/kg/day
      (weeks 5-8) and 30 mg/kg/day or 1800 mg/day, whichever less (weeks 9-12). At the end of each
      4-week treatment period, patients were hospitalised and serial blood samples for drug assays
      were obtained over a dosing interval.

      After the last treatment period or in the event of premature discontinuation, the dose had to
      be down-titrated during a 2-week period. After the last treatment period patient could
      continue receiving Eslicarbazepine acetate ("compassionate use") if both
      parent(s)/guardian(s) /patient and his/her physician agreed this was in the best patient's
      interest. A follow-up visit occurred approximately 4 weeks after the last hospitalisation or
      early discontinuation.
