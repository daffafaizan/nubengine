    
      Objectives :

      To investigate the effect of moderate alcohol consumption and influence of genetic variation
      of ethanol oxidation on:

        -  PPAR-Î³ activated gene expression

        -  Markers of coronary heart disease or type 2 diabetes

        -  Postprandial changes of HPA-axis activity among 36 postmenopausal women with ADH1C
           genotype associated with slow or fast alcohol metabolism.

      Design : Randomized, controlled, not blinded crossover trial with 1 week wash-out preceding
      each treatment period

      Participants

        -  Description : Apparently healthy postmenopausal women

        -  Number : 36

      Study substances

        -  Test substance : White wine (ca. 25 g alcohol/day)

        -  Reference substance : White grape juice

      Study treatments Treatment A: 250 ml white wine daily (ca. 25 g alcohol/day) Treatment B: 250
      ml white grape juice daily

      Study period

      - Duration : two periods of 6 weeks preceded by 1 week wash-out period

      Test parameters:

        -  Adiponectin mRNA expression

        -  Expression of PPAR-gamma activated genes: CD36, lipoprotein lipase, AP2

        -  Markers of cardiovascular disease (blood lipid profile, Lp-PLA2 activity, hs-CRP,
           fibrinogen)

        -  Markers of type 2 diabetes (adiponectin, adiponectin oligomers, insulin sensitivity)

        -  Parameters of alcohol oxidation (postprandial: blood alcohol and acetate, acetaldehyde)

        -  HPA-axis activity (postprandial & fasting: cortisol, ACTH, testosterone)
