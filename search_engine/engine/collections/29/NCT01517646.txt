      development for non-invasive fat reduction. The new product delivers controlled cooling via a
      conformable surface applicator, rather than the existing vacuum applicator. A range of
      treatment parameters will be investigated. At the investigator's discretion, each treatment
      area may receive up to 3 treatments, spaced 2 - 8 weeks apart. The subjects will return for
      follow-up at 2 months and 4 months after final treatment. Therefore, the entire study period
      may last up to 8 months.
