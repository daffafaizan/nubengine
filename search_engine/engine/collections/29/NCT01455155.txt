      Creative therapy refers to a group of techniques include art therapy, writing, movement
      therapy, role play, and music therapy that are expressive and creative in nature. The aim of
      creative therapies is to help patients find a form of expression beyond words or traditional
      therapy, such as cognitive or psychotherapy. These therapies use arts modalities and creative
      processes during intentional intervention in therapeutic, rehabilitative, community, or
      educational settings to foster health, communication, and expression.
