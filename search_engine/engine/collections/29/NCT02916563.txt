      the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System at an elevated altitude. 50 subjects will be
      enrolled in this study. Participation includes a 15-20 minute visit to the clinical site
      where they will be consented. The participant will then receive a fingerstick to obtain
      capillary blood used to test the performance of the BGMS and to obtain a comparative glucose
      measurement on the reference method, the Yellow Springs Instrument 2300 STAT Plus Glucose
      Analyzer.
