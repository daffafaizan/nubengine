      urination, and sometimes urinary incontinence (accidental loss of urine control) commonly in
      patients with Parkinson' disease (PD) severely impacting their quality of life.

      Unfortunately OAB in adults with PD is difficult to treat. This is largely because the
      mechanisms underlying OAB in adults with PD are not known. Recent functional MRI (fMRI)
      studies suggest that certain areas of the brain have an important role in OAB. Blood
      oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI is an imaging technique in which neural activity of a
      region of the brain can be measured by fluctuation in the BOLD signal. It is hoped that the
      findings of this study will allow the development of new treatments for adults with
      Parkinson's disease and overactive bladder.
