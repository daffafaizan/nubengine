      increased risk of oral cancer, molecular pathophysiology of OLP and its potential for
      malignant transformation in OSCC are poorly understood and remain controversial. Development
      of new analytical methods enhances research in the field of malignant disorders.
      Identification of novel biomarkers help in the diagnostic process, pre-symptomatic
      interventions or prediction of treatment response. Proteomics based on mass spectrometry
      enables analysis of novel, putative biomarkers. In this study, proteomics was used to analyse
      in more details extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and proteins related to ECM signalization
      which have a well-established role in malignant transformation and invasion of tumor cells.

      IGF2 and IGF2R are known biomarkers in cellular metabolism,but their role in oral
      precancerous lesions, namely oral lichen planus (OLP) as well as in oral squamous cell
      carcinoma (OSCC) has not been explored so far. The second aim of our study was to analyse
      IG2F and IGFR2 expression in oral lichen planus and oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues by
      comparative semiquantitative immunohistochemistry
