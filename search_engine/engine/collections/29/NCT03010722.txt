      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) tumour tissue prior to commencement of regorafenib
      multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (MKI) treatment targeting vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor (VEGFR), tumour microenvironment and oncogenic driver alterations, and again at
      development of resistance. Candidate markers of resistance will be identified in tissue
      biopsies through genetic and other molecular analysis and parallel collection of serial blood
      specimens will facilitate the identification of resistance markers and the tracking of
      resistance evolution in circulating nucleic acids. Early dynamic contrast enhanced MRI
      (DCE-MRI) along with diffusion weighted (DW)-MRI imaging at the beginning, and on day 15+/-7
      post treatment will be performed. Additionally, dual contrast enhanced CT (DECT) will be
      performed according to routine clinical evaluation time points before drug administration and
      at 8 weeks after drug administration. Disease will be monitored with serial CT scans of the
      chest abdomen and pelvis (CT-CAP) every eight weeks, until progression. The aim of the study
      is to identify novel predictive biomarkers of resistance and response to this targeted
      therapy in mCRC previously treated with oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan, using
      genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomics, proteomic and live tissue culture methods. These
      molecular analyses will be performed on metastatic tumour tissue samples taken firstly before
      commencement of regorafenib, and secondly on progression of disease, and thirdly from
      archival primary or metastatic tumour tissue. There is an additional biopsy at 8 weeks in
      patients with response or stable disease, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.
