      loss and is critical for weight maintenance. Further, physical activity has other
      physiological and psychological benefits. Obese youth often see specialists for weight loss
      treatment. Treatment in a pediatric population uses a multi-component approach, but physical
      activity if often overlooked. Combining physical activity information with physician care and
      nutritional information could improve weight loss and the overall health of these obese
      children.
