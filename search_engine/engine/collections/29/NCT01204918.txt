      double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8 week trial of adjunctive trial in treatment-resistant
      major depressive disorder (TRD). Preclinical studies have shown riluzole to modulate Glu
      release and clearance, and to have potent neuroprotective properties, promoting
      neuro-resiliency. Other preclinical data now also show the drug to have antidepressant-like
      effects in rodent models used to screen for antidepressant activity. In addition, several
      small open-label clinical studies further suggest riluzole has antidepressant and anxiolytic
      properties, even in patients who do not respond to standard monoaminergic antidepressant and
      anxiolytic medications.
