      opioids during surgery, female gender, laparoscopic surgery, gynecologic surgery, strabismus
      repair, the use of a general anesthetic, obesity, and non-smoker. Patients with four or more
      of these risk factors have an 80% occurrence rate of post-operative nausea and/or vomiting
      and are classified as "high risk". It has been shown that those who use tobacco have about a
      50% reduction in post-operative nausea and/or vomiting.
