      unresectable distal malignancy biliary obstruction. It has been pivotal in providing relief
      from obstructive jaundice, improving the quality of life, and allowing the maintenance of
      chemotherapy. Although SEMSs have been reported to be superior to plastic stents in terms of
      stent patency, they still have some debatable issues ; in uncovered SEMS, stent occlusion due
      to epithelial hyperplasia and tumor ingrowth through the metal mesh is a frequent problem,
      whereas covered SEMSs are prone to migration.

      The aim of the current study is to compare the duration of stent patency between partially
      covered and fully covered SEMS as a primary objective, and investigate overall patient
      survival, stent occlusion rate, and incidence of adverse events including stent dysfunction
      as secondary objectives.
