      weeks of pregnancy coming to the "Women E.R" at "Meir" Hospital due to spontaneous -or after
      intercourse bleeding - bleeding secretions. The women will be divided in to two groups

        1. Pregnant women (age 18-40) at 4-23 weeks of pregnancy with spontaneous bleeding or
           bleeding secretions

        2. Pregnant women (age 18-40) at 4-23 weeks of pregnancy that have appealed to the "Women
           ER" 24 hours after bleeding or bleeding secretions due to intercourse.

      The women will fill out questionnaires regarding past illness, vaginal bleeding, and
      gynecologic history. Then they will undergo full examination including ultrasound. After
      discharge, the investigators will recommend to all the women who came due to bleeding or
      bleeding secretions to avoid intercourse for two weeks after the bleeding stops. Afterwards
      they will be monitored until their delivery date (filling questionnaires a month after coming
      to the E.R. and at the end of the pregnancy) The doctor that had examined the women, will
      have to fill out questionnaires regarding the bleeding source, the time after intercourse,
      how long after the intercourse the bleeding had appeared and which kind of examination he had
      carried out.

      A month after their appeal to the E.R. and after they give birth ,the investigators will
      assess the rate of pregnancy, obstetric and embryonic complications in each of the study
      groups, by phone.
