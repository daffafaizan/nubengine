      alternative to Paravertebral block (PVB) for providing thoracic analgesia. It involves
      injection of local anesthetic into the fascial plane deep to erector spinae muscle. ESP is a
      more superficial block with a better defined end-point injection between the bony transverse
      process and erector spinae muscle. A more superficial ultrasound-guided block will be faster
      to perform and less painful for the patient. ESP does not have the same risk of pneumothorax
      as PVB.

      Epidural analgesia has become the standard of care. Although thoracic epidurals provide
      excellent analgesia for the management of rib fractures, they are limited to a certain
      population due to patient factors and side-effects. Many trauma patients have other injuries
      which contraindicate the use of epidurals, or which prevent positioning for insertion. There
      are disadvantages to thoracic epidural analgesia. They are technically challenging to insert,
      with a risk of dural puncture or spinal cord injury. Adverse effects include hypotension, and
      if opioids used, urinary retention and pruritus. Patients can develop a motor block and are
      unable to mobilize with an epidural in situ.
