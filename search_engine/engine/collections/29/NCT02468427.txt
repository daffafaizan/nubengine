      vacuum extraction is unknown. We prospectively randomize probands to a 30 min hands-on (group
      1) and a 30 min demonstration (group 2) training session teaching a standardized vacuum
      Extraction (VE) algorithm scheme on a pelvic training model. Probands are tested with a 24
      item Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scoring system after
      training and 48 hours, and 72 hours thereafter. OSATS scores are the primary outcome.
      Performance time (PT), self assessment (SA), confidence (CON), and global rating scale (GRS)
      are the secondary outcomes. Statistics will beperformed using Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square
      test, and multivariable logistic regression analysis.
