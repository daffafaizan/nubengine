      other studies. Patients continue to be treated with their current dose of Dehydrex. Upward
      dose adjustments may be made as clinically indicated. Patients undergo eye exams every 3 to 4
      months or more often. Downward dose titration will be attempted in patients who are stable,
      free of symptoms, and willing to attempt downward adjustments. In patients who are able to
      discontinue the medication, duration of healing will be determined. In those patients who
      experience a recurrence after discontinuing the medication, Dehydrex will be restarted at a
      dose higher than the minimum effective dose. After at least 8 weeks of treatment and
      resolution of symptoms, the dose may again be reduced. Further attempts to discontinue the
      medication will not be made.
