    
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label clinical study to evaluate the oral therapy
      with HMPL-689 in patients with relapsed / refractory MZL and FL. Relapse / refractory is
      defined as such a situation when a patient has not achieved response (CR or PR) after the
      latest line of systemic treatment, or has disease progress (PD) or relapse after achieving
      response. Two (2) cohorts of patients will be enrolled in this study:

      Cohort 1: approximately 81 patients with histologically confirmed MZL

      Cohort 2: approximately 104 patients with histologically confirmed FL (pathological grade
      1-3a)

      All patients are to receive monotherapy of HMPL-689 30 mg once a day (QD) continuously in
      28-day treatment cycles until PD / recurrence, patient death, intolerable toxicity,
      initiation of other antitumor therapy, the patient unable to further benefit from the study
      treatment as judged by the investigators, the patient or his/her legal representative's
      request to withdraw from the clinical study treatment, the patient lost to follow-up or end
      of the study, whichever comes first.
