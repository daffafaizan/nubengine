      (Allergan, plc). Refresh Optive ADVANCED will be compared to an investigational formula with
      additional compendial ingredients (Refresh Optive MEGA 3) in subjects with dry eye symptoms
      and lipid layer thickness < 75 nm at baseline in a randomized, cross-over (masked subject)
      design. We seek to objectively evaluate the increase in lipid layer thickness from baseline
      at 15 minutes and 1 hour after each eye drop has been instilled. The Stroboscopic Video Color
      Microscope of King-Smith is used for non-invasive lipid layer thickness measurement.
