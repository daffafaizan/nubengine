      improved our ability to detect sites of prostate cancer compared with conventional imaging
      alone. When combined with innovative radiotherapeutic and surgical techniques that can now
      safely target and ablate such disease sites, next generation imaging is now poised to
      transform the therapeutic paradigm for patients at risk of advanced cancer.

      Investigators postulate that intensification of radiotherapy or surgery based on the results
      of PSMA PET/CT will improve cancer control outcomes in a cost-effective manner, with minimal
      toxicity, and an overall improvement in quality of life in the longer term.

      Investigators expect to show that PSMA PET/CT will have a direct and profound impact on
      radiotherapy and surgery practice, translating to improved failure-free survival outcomes in
      patients at risk of advanced prostate cancer. The subset of patients potentially impacted is
      broad, including patients recurring after prostatectomy and newly presenting patients with
      high-risk features. Although PSMA PET/CT is increasingly making its way into clinical
      practice around the world, Canadian provinces will need to make an informed decision of
      whether to fund this imaging for our patients. The high-level evidence gathered in this trial
      is desperately needed to assess the impact on patient outcomes and, in doing so, justify
      broad access and reimbursement for patients with prostate cancer.
