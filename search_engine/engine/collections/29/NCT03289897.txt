      resistance and heart disease. Research has shown that fatty liver (steatosis) can lead to a
      spectrum of diseases including low grade inflammation (steatohepatitis or non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH)), cirrhosis or liver failure.

      The current method used to diagnose liver dysfunction and failure is with percutaneous liver
      biopsy. This is painful and is not without risk, as the liver is a highly vascular organ.
      Even with ultrasound guidance, it carries a 1:1000 risk of serious adverse events (e.g.
      bleeding, infection, bowel perforation). As a result of these factors, liver biopsy is not
      used in all patients with suspected NAFLD/ NASH unless moderate to severe liver disease is
      presented or other liver disease need to be excluded. Various diagnostic pathways have
      arisen, but in the absence of a clearly non-invasive discriminatory test that can stratify
      normal liver, simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, there is no standardised
      pathway.

      LiverMultiScan has been tested against liver biopsy and has been shown to be the first
      imaging test that can identify early liver disease and predict clinical outcomes accurately.
      LiverMultiScan has recently been CE-Marked and FDA-cleared, so is available for clinical use,
      but as a new test, it is not yet widely established in clinical practice. This study will
      utilise LiverMultiScan and see if it can be the basis of a viable diagnostic pathway in EU
      healthcare systems by adopting it in different EU countries, and determining the economic
      costs and benefits.
