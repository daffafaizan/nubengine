      investigational products will be given as single doses at separate treatment visits. Periods
      without Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), lasting for at least 36 hours, will separate
      treatment visits. At each treatment visit, blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be sampled
      immediately before, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes, as well as at 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2,
      3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after start of product administration. The time until complete
      tablet dissolution will be recorded. Subjects will also be monitored to capture any adverse
      events that may occur. Treatment labels will be concealed from subjects and study personnel.
