      vision, discharge from the eyes, eye discomfort, burning, redness, sandy and gritty feeling
      in the eyes, and sensitivity to light. Topical eye drops for eye lubrication (i.e.,
      artificial tear solutions) and controlling ocular inflammation through the use of topical
      immunomodulatory agents (i.e., cyclosporine [Restasis]) have been shown to be effective for
      treating dry eye syndrome, but are not curative. Recently, we have evaluated a few patients
      who had discontinued using Restasis as they had obtained better relief of their dry eye
      symptoms with a homeopathic therapy.

      Potential participants will undergo an eye examination consisting of medical history and
      physical examination (i.e., visual acuity, pupillary exam, examination of the lids, slit-lamp
      examination of the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens, and funduscopic
      examination). Participants qualifying for the study will then stop all eye medications and
      will use a common artificial tear solution for 2 weeks prior to the baseline examination. We
      will evaluate 4 measures of dry eyes at baseline and after 6 weeks of therapy: 1) tear film
      to break-up; 2) staining of the cornea by fluorescein stain; 3) measurement of tear
      production over 5 minutes by Schirmer's test; and 4) the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI).
