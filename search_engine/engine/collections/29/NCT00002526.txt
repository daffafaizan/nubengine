      patients with advanced soft tissue or gynecological sarcoma treated with high-dose ifosfamide
      and doxorubicin.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ifosfamide IV continuously on days 1-5 and doxorubicin IV on days
      1-3. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously daily beginning 24 hours after
      completion of ifosfamide infusion and continuing through day 16 (or until day 20 if blood
      counts have not recovered by day 16). Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at treatment failure and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-46 patients will be accrued for this study.
