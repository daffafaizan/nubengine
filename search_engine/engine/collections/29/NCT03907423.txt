    
      A randomized controlled trial on 60 patients with DM type 2 will be recruited from Damanhour
      national medical institute.

        -  Subjects will be divided into two group (one arm is DM-type 2 patients who will receive
           rosuvastatin -metformin-glimepiride combination (40 patients) and another arm is DM-type
           2 patient who will receive glimepiride-metformin combination (20 patients).

        -  Determination of serum levels of fetuin A and Sortilin

        -  Blood samples will be collected after 3-month after active treatment.

        -  Outcomes measurement : Sortilin ,fetuinA, Atherogenic index (AI) and coronary risk index
           (CRI) .

      Methodology

        -  Sortilin, fetuinA will be determined by ELISA.

        -  Lipid profile.

        -  FBG and Hb A1C will be measured.

        -  Atherogenic index (AI = LDL-C/HDL-C) and CRI (CRI = TC/HDL-C) will be calculated for all
           subjects.
