      test decision making process in Pacific Islander women; 2) assess the role of social support
      within the decision making process; and 3) develop and test an intervention to increase Pap
      testing among Pacific Islander women, and support among their male spouses/significant
      others. The intervention was created utilizing a Multi-Attribute Utility model and social
      support theory resulting in gender-specific educational workshops consisting of a social
      support intervention that informed both Pacific Islander women and men about cervical cancer
      and the importance of Pap testing for Pacific Islander women, and aimed to increase social
      support among their male spouses/significant others.
