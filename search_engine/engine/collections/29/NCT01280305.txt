      schizophrenia. The onset of schizophrenia is later in woman than in men, with generally a
      less severe course until after the menopause, when for many women, reductions in estrogen
      levels appear to trigger an exacerbation or illness (Hafner 2003). ERÎ± (Estrogen receptor
      alpha) expression is known to be reduced in schizophrenia (Wong, Woon et al. 2010).
      Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as an estrogen antagonist in
      breast tissue and may have agonistic actions in the brain. Several studies (Kulkarni, Riedel
      et al. 2001; Chua, de Izquierdo et al. 2005; Kulkarni, Gurvich et al. 2010) indicate that
      treatment with estrogen and raloxifene improves symptoms in females with schizophrenia, and
      recently they showed an improvement in PANSS score in post menopausal women with
      schizophrenia receiving 60-120mg/d of raloxifene compared to placebo
