      survival (OS) rarely exceeding 6 months. Less than 25% of patients are resectable at
      diagnosis and, even in this subset of patients, relapse rate is high. An improvement of OS
      and quality of life for patients receiving chemotherapy versus best supportive care was
      demonstrated in advanced disease. Recently, cisplatin and gemcitabine combination was
      identified as the new standard first-line chemotherapy, yielding a median progression free
      survival (PFS) and median OS of 8.5 and 11.7 months, respectively. Despite the outcome
      improvement, disease progression is a constant and approximately half of patients failing
      upfront treatment has a good performance status and are willing to undergo further treatment.
      No standard salvage chemotherapy regimen has been identified. Clinical trials are difficult
      to perform due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these tumors and to the lack of interest of
      the pharmaceutical industry. Fluoropyrimidines and mitomycin C have been considered the basis
      of palliative chemotherapy for a long time. The investigators decided to explore the
      activity, in terms of PFS, of capecitabine alone or combined with mitomycin C as second-line
      therapy in patients with pathological diagnosis of advanced biliary tract cancer and
      progressive disease after gemcitabine and cisplatin, by means of an open label randomized
      multicentric phase II trial.
