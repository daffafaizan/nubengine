    
      This study intends to describe antibody responses to a third generation smallpox vaccine,
      Imvanex® (MVA-BN, Bavarian Nordic GmBH; also known as Imvamune®), in cohorts of individuals
      who received the vaccine for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis against monkeypox
      during a monkeypox outbreak in the UK. In addition to quantifying anti-vaccinia virus
      antibody responses to vaccine, the study intends to demonstrate that vaccine-induced
      antibodies neutralise the specific monkeypox viruses involved in the UK outbreak, and also
      reference monkeypox viruses. The use of Imvanex® during the UK outbreak represents the first
      ever use of Imvanex® as a public health intervention for a monkeypox outbreak, and this study
      will provide an opportunity to quantify and characterise antibody responses to Imvanex®
      administered in a non-trial setting.
