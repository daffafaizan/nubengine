    
      Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. This study, PHI112844, will be the first
      administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the pharmacodynamics/efficacy, safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of repeat oral doses in anemic pre-dialysis patients with
      moderate or severe renal impairment and in hemodialysis-dependent patients.
