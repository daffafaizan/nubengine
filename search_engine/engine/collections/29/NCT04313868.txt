    
      This clinical trial will be divided into two phases: Phase IA in which the dose, route, and
      schedule of the GEN2 administration is determined and Phase IB which is designed to explore
      the activity of GEN2 in patients of a defined or several defined tumor types and stages based
      on the Phase IA data of GEN2.

      Phase IA is divided into three routes of administration: (a) Phase 1A.1 which explores
      peripheral IV infusion; (b) Phase IA.2 which investigates hepatic arterial infusion and (c)
      Phase IA.3 which examines intratumoral delivery.
