      names, which might lead to erroneous assignments to predefined drink groups in certain
      occasions (e.g. "BierlikÃ¶r - beer liquor"). Furthermore, it is hypothesized that this
      tendency is smaller the more familiar a user is with the drink. Lastly, it is hypothesized
      that drinks with relatively low use prevalence in the general population, e.g. sweet liquors
      and cocktails, and drinks that include alcohol mixed with non-alcoholic beverages (e.g.
      "Radler", a beer-lemonade mix), are more often subject to non-concordant assignment across
      participants compared to highly-prevalent drinks (e.g. "Pilsner").

      Thus, the investigators expect alcohol users to:

        1. assign >90% of the presented beverages correctly,

        2. differ from the expert assignments especially in drinks they are not familiar with,

        3. differ from the expert assignments especially in drinks with ambiguous names,

        4. do not differ in their assignments based on their gender and age group.
