      4-week daily INH/RPT regimen (1HP) to a 12-weekly INH/RPT (3HP) for the treatment of LTBI in
      HIV-infected participants without evidence of active TB. The primary objective will be
      efficacy of active TB prevention. The study will also assess safety and tolerability of the
      regimens, adherence to the treatments, and patterns of antibiotic resistance among
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates in participants who fail on these prophylactic
      regimens.

      Under this study, there is one substudy entitled, "Pharmacokinetic study of rifapentine,
      dolutegravir, and tenofovir alafenamide in HIV-infected individual with latent tubersulosis
      infection". There will be a subgroup of patients who will participate in this pharmacokinetic
      study of rifapentine and dolutegravir (DTG) / tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). Randomization is
      based on cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) categories : < 200, 200-350, > 500 cells/mm3 and
      VL <50 or >50 copies/ml.
