      trastuzumab as a single agent develop resistance within one year of treatment initiation.

      Recent studies on this population of patients show that the use of Capecitabine combined with
      Lapatinib demonstrates an improvement of TTP without an increase of serious toxic effects.

      Our study is designed to investigate whether elderly patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer over-expressing HER2 could take advantage of the combination
      lapatinib (1250mg/day) and capecitabine (1st cycle day 1 to day 14: 850mg/m2/day x2; next
      cycles day 1 to day 14: 1000 mg/m2/day x2) in term of clinical benefit, and with no adverse
      effects and no detrimental impact on functional status (part of geriatric assessment).
      Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurence.

      This is a phase II multicentric trial associated to a pharmacokinetic study which aims to
      assess the effect of age modifications (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination)
      on the combination Lapatinib-Capecitabine by measuring the Cmin-Cmax of both components in
      elderly patients.
