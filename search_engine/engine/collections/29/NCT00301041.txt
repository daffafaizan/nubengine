      Primary

        -  Compare the ratio between post- and pre-treatment plasma transforming growth factor-beta
           1 (TGF-β) in women with invasive breast cancer undergoing hypofractionated radiotherapy
           vs standard-fractionated external-beam radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Establish longitudinal serum and plasma biorepository for retrospective evaluation of
           TGF-β and other biomarkers with special relevance to radiation response.

        -  Correlate pre-treatment plasma TGF-β levels with clinical fibrosis development.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (hypofractionated radiotherapy): Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once
           daily 5 days a week for up to 3.5 weeks (16 fractions total).

        -  Arm II (standard fractionated radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I
           at a lower dose for up to 5 weeks (25 fractions total).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
