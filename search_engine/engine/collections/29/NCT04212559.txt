      cuirass ventilator increases venous return and leads to ventricular filling and increases
      cardiac output (CO); In contrast to NPV, the effect of PPV in most situations is a decreased
      venous return and leads to decreased CO. NPV improving ventilation and work of breathing in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
