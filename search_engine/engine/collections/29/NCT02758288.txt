      This will be a single center project that will take place at Loma Linda University Transplant
      Institute. All adult kidney recipients who are determined to have BK viremia with a BK PCR
      viral load over 500 copy post-transplant and meet the inclusion criteria but no exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled and observed per study protocol.

      All kidney transplant recipients are routinely assessed for BK virus nephropathy and viremia
      post transplant as part of their standard care. Patients with BK viremia or BK virus
      nephropathy will have adjustments in their immunosuppressive medication based on current
      guidelines and recommendations which include reduction in immunosuppression, treatment with
      medications with antiviral activity (Cidofovir, Ciprofloxacin, Leflunomide, IVIG) or
      switching from a Tacrolimus (Prograf)-based regimen to a Cyclosporine-based regimen.
      Retrospectively, the investigator will collect data on patients who have been diagnosed with
      BK viremia or BK virus nephropathy and have had such a management in past 66 months (from
      1/1/2010 till 06/30/2015). Prospectively, the investigator will enroll and collect data on
      patients who will be treated for BK viremia or BK virus nephropathy.

      As standard of care, all kidney transplant recipients will be seen routinely on
      weekly-biweekly basis in post-transplant clinic for up to 3 months then every 3 months for up
      to a year and yearly thereafter. All kidney transplant recipients will be monitored for BK
      viremia by having blood PCR tested on a monthly basis at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after
      transplant. Also, all patients post-kidney transplant will be tested for BK viremia if there
      is an acute rise in their creatinine.
