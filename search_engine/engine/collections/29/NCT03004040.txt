      candidate testing and improve influenza treatment approaches. The long-term goal of this
      research is to identify the T-cell responses that are surrogates (biomarkers) of serious
      complications of influenza in older adults and predict vaccine efficacy (prevention of
      influenza illness) and vaccine effectiveness (prevention of serious complications). Further,
      translating new insights into age-related immune dysfunction to the design of new influenza
      vaccines is critical to addressing this unmet need in the population aged 65 and older.

      Innovation: The study will help in the validation of clinical tools and biomarkers as
      prognostic indicators of influenza illness severity in vaccinated older adults, point-of-care
      diagnostics that would direct other preventive strategies to reduce the impact of influenza
      illness in vaccinated older adults, and correlates of protection to evaluate the potential of
      new influenza vaccines to enhance protection against the serious complications of influenza
      illness. The investigators have established that GrzB activity and the IFNg: IL-10 ratio in
      influenza-stimulated PBMC correlate with protection against influenza, and preliminary data
      to show that low GrzB activity in influenza-stimulated PBMC correlates with more severe
      disease and higher levels of frailty. The innovations of this project are the established
      methods for developing correlates of protection, the clinical insights into how frailty
      affects immune-mediated protection against influenza, and the direct translation of this
      research to provide a reasonable method for primary care clinicians to estimate vaccine
      effectiveness in an individual older person. These results will translate to the practical
      design of clinical trials to evaluate the potential for new influenza vaccines to better
      protect against the serious complications of influenza and complement those based on antibody
      titers and/or clinical outcomes alone.
