      assigned treatment), randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance), single center, single
      dose, 2-way cross-over study (all volunteers switch from one treatment to another) to assess
      the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin (a drug currently being
      investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) in healthy Indian volunteers. The
      study will consist of 3 phases: a single screening phase, a baseline phase of 2 days per
      period, and an open-label treatment phase that includes 2 treatment periods (Periods 1 and
      2). During Period 1, volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either
      200 mg (Treatment A) or 300 mg (Treatment B) of canagliflozin on Day 1. During Period 2,
      volunteers will receive the dose of canagliflozin (Treatment A or B) that they did not
      receive during Period 1. The duration of each treatment period will be 4 days and each
      treatment period will be separated by a 14 day washout period (when no medication is given).
      Each volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 45 days.
