    
      Subjects satisfying all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this trial.
      After baseline evaluation, all subjects will undergo a series of 3 facial treatments with the
      Secret Micro-Needle Fractional RF SystemÂ® at 4 week intervals.

      Blinded-investigator and subject self-assessments will be performed at Baseline and Days 28,
      56, 146, and 180 to evaluate treatment efficacy for facial wrinkling. Of note, the
      blinded-investigators will be blinded to treatment settings and technique, and number of
      treatments. Safety will be evaluated by subject diaries, as well as investigator- and
      subject-rated evaluations of adverse events at all follow-up visits. Mandatory standard 2D
      digital photography, Canfield VISIA and VECTRA 3D digital photography will be performed at
      baseline and at each office visit.
