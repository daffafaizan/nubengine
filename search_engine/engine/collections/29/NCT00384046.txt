    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, 24 week
      study to be conducted in approximately 300 patients at approximately 14 clinical sites in the
      UK, 6 sites in Australia, 5 sites in Germany, and 2 sites in Canada. Women will be randomised
      1:1 to receive 300 mcg/day TTS or placebo for a 24 week period. Consistent with previous
      phase III studies, efficacy will be assessed over 24 weeks using the Sexual Activity Log
      (SAL), and at 12 and 24 weeks using the Profile of Female Sexual Function (PFSF) and Personal
      Distress Scale (PDS). Safety will be assessed over the entire 24 weeks. Hormone data (free
      and total testosterone, total estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin) will be collected
      at Weeks -4 and 24. The total duration of treatment for each patient is 24 weeks.
