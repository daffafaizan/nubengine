      Querétaro. One hundred fifty two obese children (Z-score >2 standard deviations) aged 6-11y
      were randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: 1) 237mL/day of milk proteins and
      multiple micronutrients supplement (MPMS) plus Nutrition Education (NE) program or 2) NE
      alone for 24 weeks.

      Children in both groups were evaluated at baseline and 6 months after treatment initiated. At
      both times the following variables were evaluated:

      Visit 1 (Screening): Mothers and parents received oral and written information regarding all
      aspects of the study. Informed consent, medical history, demographic information, weight and
      height were obtained.

      Visit 2 (Clinical Laboratory testing): A blood preasure and sample was taken by an
      specialist. Blood test included Glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol
      and LDL cholesterol, Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
      interleukin-10 (IL-10), C reactive protein, insulin and leptin.
