      concentration between fresh gas entering the anesthetic breathing system and the exhaust gas
      leaving it in an otherwise closed system is used to determine total gas uptake by the
      principle of insoluble gas dilution. Oxygen and anaesthetic agent uptakes are then
      automatically determined by a computer directly linked to a rapid gas analyzer, every 15
      seconds.

      As a control, oxygen is calculated using the reverse Fick method. Measured arterial and mixed
      venous oxygen saturations were used to do this, and the cardiac output which was determined
      by thermodilution.
