      (IOP) v. standard outpatient (OP) treatment in 272 heroin-dependent African American adults
      receiving buprenorphine in 2 formerly "drug-free" programs. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two treatment intensity conditions at intake and assessed at baseline,
      3-, and 6-months post-baseline to determine treatment retention, frequency and severity of
      heroin and cocaine use, self-reported HIV-risk, quality of life, and to determine DSM-IV
      criteria for Full or Partial Remission of Opioid Dependence. Furthermore, patient factors
      potentially critical for treatment success (e.g., attitudes towards buprenorphine and average
      buprenorphine dose while in treatment) will be examined to determine their importance in
      influencing treatment outcomes. Moreover, both patient and staff attitudes and average
      buprenorphine dose will be evaluated to determine their respective relationships to treatment
      experiences and treatment retention.
