    
      In this comparative effectiveness clinical trial, primary care physicians (PCPs) will receive
      2 academic detailing sessions 6 months apart. Eligible patients (age 75 years or greater,
      type 2 diabetes, prescribed insulin or sulfonylureas [SUs], and last measured HbA1c <=8%) of
      these PCPs will be randomized to receive either a pre-visit conversation aid/communication
      tool that elicits values and preferences regarding safe insulin/SU deprescribing
      [Intervention] or a general health education handout ("Embracing Life as You Age") [Attention
      Control]. Patient-reported outcomes (e.g., self-reported hypoglycemia episodes) and clinical
      outcomes (e.g., changes in glycemic regimen) will be compared between study arms. If
      successful, this study will provide evidence to support strategies for safer treatment in
      older adults with type 2 diabetes.
