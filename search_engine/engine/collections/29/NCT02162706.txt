      health controls at bedtime, midnight and first morning waking on two consecutive nights and
      salivary cortisol levels were measured using mass spectrometry. In a patients with possible
      endocrine disorders who were going through an adrenocortiotropin stimulation test for adrenal
      insufficiency, salivary cortisol was measured prior to giving cosyntropin and 30-40 minutes
      after cosyntropin.
