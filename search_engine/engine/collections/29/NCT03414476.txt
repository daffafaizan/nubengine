      by binding to proteins, produce nonfunctional adducts inducing cutaneous aging. Is this
      mechanism, called "Carbonyl stress", also present in the scalp and can it be one of the
      mechanisms involved in the occurrence of reactive hair loss ? To demonstrate this, samples of
      hair follicles are made. The proteins are extracted from the samples and then assayed. The
      oxidized (carbonyl) proteins are labeled with specific fluorescent probes.
