      the functioning of immune system. ART is a lifelong treatment with several different
      concomitantly administered oral medications. According to studies, low adherence to treatment
      is directly related to knowledge and beliefs about ART.

      Studies have shown the success of different interventions increasing adherence to ART, but
      additional studies need to be carried out in order to determine the most effective components
      of the interventions and the methods most suitable considering the local context, that could
      be easily incorporated into the working routine of an medical institution (clinic) with
      limited extra resources.

      Primary locations to implement activities directed at improving treatment adherence are
      medical institutions, i.e. the departments of infectious diseases where persons living with
      HIV/AIDS receive their ART.

      The aim of the study is to conduct a small-scale intervention (randomised controlled) study
      implementing a brief adherence counseling targeting persons receiving ART.
