      safety and tolerability of PUL-042 Inhalation Solution in subjects with hematologic
      malignancies or recipients of a first allogenic or autologus hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant. Subjects will receive 4 doses over 2 weeks.

      Cohort size will be 3 subjects, once 3 subjects have completed treatment and follow-up at a
      dose level, subject data will be evaluated by an independent data safety monitoring committee
      prior to dosing additional subjects. The Committee may recommend increasing the dose,
      maintaining the same dose, or decreasing the dose.

      Once the maximum dose is determined, there may be up to 6 additional subjects dosed at that
      level.
