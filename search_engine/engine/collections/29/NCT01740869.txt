      the brain in the patients with spectrum autism could help in the physiopathology of the
      illness.

      It has been found that after introducing hematopoietic cells in the subarachnoid space of the
      spinal cord, these cells may be transported through the cerebrospinal fluid and can be
      delivered more efficiently to the injured area, when compared to the intravenous route.

      Patients will be stimulated for 3 consecutive days with granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) and then their bone marrow will be harvested according to their weight. Bone marrow
      will be processed in order to obtain CD34+ cells and minimize the amount of red blood cells.
      An inoculum of 5 to 10mL of stem cells will be infused intrathecally. Patients will be
      evaluated with two scales "CARS" and the "IDEA" also we will check the clinical history. On
      days 0, 30 and 180.
