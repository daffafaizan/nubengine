      of liver disease in the pediatric population. There is, however, little data specific to the
      use of this technique in children with existing data and techniques largely extrapolated from
      adult studies. Existing studies suggest that liver stiffness values may be different between
      children and adults [Etchell, Xanthakos]. As such there is an unmet need for uniquely
      pediatric data in both healthy and diseased cohorts. To address the need for such data, the
      investigators plan a multi-site, prospective study of healthy pediatric (<18 years of age)
      volunteers to determine normal liver stiffness measured by MR elastography across the range
      of MRI equipment.
