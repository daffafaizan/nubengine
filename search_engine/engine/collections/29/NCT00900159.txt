      the putative root cause of the problem-the inability of night-shift workers with or without
      SWSD- to obtain adequate daytime sleep in the face of the circadian drive for alertness that
      increases across the biological day. Even healthy, young subjects who are sleep-deprived
      overnight exhibit daytime sleep marked by frequent awakenings and low sleep efficiency, less
      slow-wave sleep, and altered sleep architecture, e.g. earlier predominance of REM sleep. Many
      night-workers routinely report 3-6 hours of habitual sleep duration for daytime sleep.
      Pharmacological interventions to decrease awakenings and improve total sleep time during
      daytime sleep could improve subsequent alertness during a night shift. Improving the
      wakefulness of night-shift workers over the nighttime could result in substantial benefits
      for the individual workers, improve workplace productivity and safety, and improve public
      health.
