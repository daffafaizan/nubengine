      mortality in Sonora, Mexico through use of an evidence-based community health worker
      intervention for adult patients with diabetes who receive care at health centers operated by
      the Secretar√≠a de Salud, an office of the Mexican government. Researchers will conduct a
      cluster-randomized trial with a total of 400 patients at 20 health centers to understand
      whether the 13-week educational intervention, Meta Salud Diabetes, can effectively reduce
      clinical, behavioral, and psychosocial risk for cardiovascular disease among adults with
      diabetes. Researchers will also conduct an implementation study that will consist of
      systematic engagement of local, state and national decision makers to identify barriers,
      facilitators, and strategies to adopt and integrate community health worker-led
      cardiovascular disease prevention interventions throughout the 209 health centers in Sonora.
