      pulmonary arteries by delivering light through the chest wall. The aim is to evaluate
      pulmonary arteries' elasticity and oxygen saturation.

      We will study adults children and neonates. We will study 20 healthy adults, 20 healthy
      children aged 2-8 years, twenty healthy neonates, 20 preterm neonates with patent ductus
      arteriosus (PDA) and 20 preterm neonates with no PDA. We will study also 20 neonates with
      pulmonary hypertension.

      Each participant will be examined for 5 minutes and PPG signal will be recorded in a computer
      and evaluated offline later on. Pulmonic saturation will be calculated from absorption
      difference between two wave lengths of infrared light that will be used.

      Our hypothesis is that the mentioned clinical conditions will affect PPG signal and pulmonary
      arterial oxygen saturation.
