      and the body. Previous study has shown that epithelium is punctuated by discontinuities named
      "gaps". Confocal laser endomicroscopy could be used as a useful tool for detecting epithelial
      gaps in vivo, and epithelial gap density in terminal ileum of IBD patients was elevated
      compared with normal control using CLE. So this study aims to determine whether the density
      of epithelial gaps in terminal ileum of patients with IBS is different from that in IBD
      patients and normal controls by CLE, and to evaluate the relationship between the density of
      epithelial gaps and IBS subtypes, and visceral hypersensitivity.
