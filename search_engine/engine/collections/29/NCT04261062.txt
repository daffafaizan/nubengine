    
      1. Recruit participants.

        2. Explain the research purpose and details, and then have the participant sign the consent
           form.

        3. Before starting the measurement, gather the participant's information such as age,
           length, and weight.

        4. Measure noninvasive blood pressure in both arms. Compared to the blood pressure in the
           arm where inserted a catheter, confirm if difference of systolic or diastolic blood
           pressure in the other side of arm is not more than 10%.

        5. Wear the wearable device on the opposite wrist from the catheter-inserted.

        6. For 10 minutes, simultaneously obtain the data: 1) invasive arterial blood pressure
           measured with a patient monitor, and 2) multi-wavelength photoplethysmography and
           pressure signal measured with the developed wearable device.

        7. For accuracy of data acquisition, repeat twice the procedure 5-7 by performing it in the
           morning and in the afternoon with the 5 hours interval.
