      cross-comparison. This will compare the clinical performance and subjective acceptance of the
      somofilcon A 1 day soft contact lens with the nelfilcon A daily disposable lens when used on
      a daily wear, daily disposable basis.

      Subjects will use each lens type for a week in random sequence. Follow-up visits for each
      lens will be performed after one week of wear. Lenses will be worn on a daily wear, daily
      disposable wear schedule.
