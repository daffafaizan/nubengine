      of human papilloma virus (HPV) per cell and inhibits HPV E6/E7 gene expression in patients
      with cervical dysplasia. II. Determine the dose of tretinoin for use in a definitive trial
      that produces the best overall modulation of these biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia classification (II vs III). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 4 arms. Arm I: Patients receive low-dose tretinoin topically via cervical cap and
      polyurethane ether foam sponge changed daily for 4 days. Arm II: Patients receive
      intermediate-dose tretinoin as in arm I. Arm III: Patients receive high-dose tretinoin as in
      arm I. Arm IV: Patients receive placebo topically as in arm I therapy. Patients are followed
      for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (45 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
