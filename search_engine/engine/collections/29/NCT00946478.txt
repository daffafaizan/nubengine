      bacteria. They also have an impaired innate immune system. Antimicrobial peptides are a
      component of the innate immune system which are decreased in atopics. In vitro, pimecrolimus
      has demonstrated its ability to increase antimicrobial peptides. This study will examine the
      ability of pimecrolimus to increase antimicrobial peptides in vivo in AD patients. Thus, the
      study will yield a better understanding of the role of pimecrolimus in regulating the immune
      system in atopics.
