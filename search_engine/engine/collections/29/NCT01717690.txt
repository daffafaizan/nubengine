      practice at Baycrest. Our previous studies have demonstrated strong MRSA-preventive
      properties of CHG bathing practice - the rate of MRSA transmission on intervention units
      dropped from 4.99 to 0.88 cases per 1,000 patient days - an overall rate reduction of 82%.

      Although CHG will continue to be used as part of an established clinical practice in our
      hospital, its impact on MRSA prevention merits further evaluation in complex continuing care
      (CCC) settings endemic for MRSA. Investigators propose a cluster-randomized, prospective,
      open-label, two-arm clinical trial (RCT) on three geographically separate, but otherwise
      comparable, CCC units - one intervention unit using CHG, and two control units using
      non-antiseptic cleanser. The RCT is expected to conclusively answer whether daily bathing
      with CHG significantly reduces incidence of MRSA colonization.

      By cluster randomization investigators imply randomly assigning interventions to the three
      patient care units. Investigators propose randomization of the units as it is not feasible to
      randomly assign the individual participants to intervention vs control arms.

      For a meaningful interpretation of the RCT findings, patient populations on the three floors
      will be compared at the beginning, during, and at the end of the study. The following
      variables will be used to compare patient populations:

        -  Colonization pressure (CP) is a measure of the MRSA reservoir on the unit. CP will be
           calculated at the onset of the RCT and then bi-weekly (Number of MRSA patient-days ร 100
           รท Total Number of Patient Days).

        -  Average Braden scale score (BSS) for patients on each unit is measured to predict a
           pressure ulcer risk. It is one of the measures of patient's clinical complexity. It is
           calculated by examining six patient criteria (sensory perception, skin moisture,
           physical activity, mobility, nutrition, friction and shear). BSS will be calculated at
           the onset of the RCT and then monthly.

        -  Average Case Mix Index (CMI) is a value reflecting the daily relative weight of
           resources used by an individual patient compared to a base resource level (the average
           resource use of the patient population). The CMI value is not a dollar amount; rather it
           is a relative value and an indirect marker of patient's clinical complexity. CMI will be
           calculated at the onset of the RCT and then quarterly.

      Patient information will be de-identified for privacy reasons, before analysis of the study
      data - logistic regression, to compare the rates of MRSA incidence and time to MRSA
      conversion on intervention and control units.
