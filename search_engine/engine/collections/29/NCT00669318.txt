      Primary

        -  To assess the rate of complete and overall response in patients with relapsed or
           refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with
           pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low-dose rituximab.

        -  To monitor and assess toxicity of this treatment regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the overall and progression-free survival, duration of response, and time
           to next treatment.

        -  To assess the correlation between individual prognostic markers (17p-, 11q-, unmutated
           VH gene, VH3-21, ZAP-70+, CD38+, CD49d, and Î²2 microglobulin, miRNA profiles,
           angiogenesis status, and karyotypes of CpG stimulated cells) and clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Course 1: Patients receive pentostatin IV on days 8 and 22; alemtuzumab subcutaneously
           (SC) on days 3-5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, and 33; rituximab IV on
           days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, and 33; and sargramostim
           (GM-CSF) SC on days 10-14 and 24-28. Patients then proceed to course 2.

        -  Courses 2 and 3: Patients receive pentostatin IV on days 1 and 15; alemtuzumab SC and
           rituximab IV on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26; and GM-CSF SC on
           days 3-7 and 17-21. After completion of course 2, patients with a complete response
           proceed to observation. Patients with a partial response or stable disease receive
           another course of therapy (course 3).

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected on days 1, 3, 8, and 10 of course 1 for monoclonal antibody studies.
      Samples are analyzed for serum concentration of alemtuzumab and rituximab by ELISA and PCR;
      CH50 assay; complement activation and cytokine levels by ELISA; NK cell activation; and NK
      cell phenotype by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months, every 3
      months for 6 months, and then every 6-12 months for up to 5 years.
