      studies of 51.6GyE/12Fx have also been carried out for SBRT. There are some differences in
      equipment and carbon ion treatment planning system used between Japan and our center.
      Therefore, we designed this phase I clinical study to explore the optimal dose of 12
      fractions of carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
