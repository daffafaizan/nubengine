      after trabeculectomy surgery. Topical anaesthetic drops to numb the eye will be given, prior
      to being given the tested medicine. Once the eye has been anaesthetized, the medication will
      be injected into the potential space created during the glaucoma surgery, also called a bleb,
      using a standard small syringe. The patient will receive an injection of either 1.25mg
      (0.05ml) of Bevacizumab or Balanced Salt Solution (BSS) into the trabeculectomy bleb that had
      been created in the surgery. Participants will be randomly (by chance) placed in one of the 2
      study groups. There will be a 50% chance of being placed in either group. There will be 60
      people who will participate in this study at 2 centres throughout the Toronto region. The
      length of this study for participants is 12 months, and the entire study is expected to take
      about 18 months to complete.
