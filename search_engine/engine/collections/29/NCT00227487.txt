      symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and flatulence have been considered
      contributing to the behavioral problems. These symptoms are associated partially with the
      deficiency of enzymes digesting carbohydrates and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      The effect of intestinal inflammation on neurological disorders experienced by autistic
      children remains unclear. We will study this problem using recently developed non-invasive
      tests based on two proteins (calprotectin and lactoferrin) analysis in children's stool.
      Activity of enzymes needed for carbohydrate digestion will be tested in small samples of
      intestinal tissue. Intestinal permeability will be assessed by measuring urinary excretion of
      carbohydrate substances (lactulose and rhamnose) administered via the endoscope. This test
      will help to determine if intestinal inflammation contributes to a "leaky" gut syndrome. The
      study will provide valuable information for understanding the association between
      gastrointestinal disease and behavioral problems in autistic children.
