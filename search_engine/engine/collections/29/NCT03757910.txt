      cerebrovascular and A related mechanisms, and this hypothesis has prompted testing strategies
      related to hyperinsulinemia and diabetes in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's
      dementia.These strategies usually entail improving insulin sensitivity to lower insulin and
      glucose levels, such as lifestyle (diet and exercise) and metformin, which were effective
      strategies for preventing diabetes in the DPPOS. There are conflicting data relating
      metformin with increased AD risk, and this needs to be clarified in DPPOS. Several laboratory
      and human studies have suggested that metformin increases the risk of Alzheimer's dementia,
      but this is countered by other studies indicating that it is beneficial. Preliminary data in
      humans and animals support the beneficial effects of metformin on Alzheimer's dementia risk.
