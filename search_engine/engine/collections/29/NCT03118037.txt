    
      Patients whom have selected the CE-marked Sonata system for treatment of fibroids will be
      approached for study participation. Participation in the trial will consist of data
      collection in the form of questionnaires prior to and after the treatment at the following
      intervals: pre-procedure, 4 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years following treatment.

      The following data points will be collected: Length of stay, time to return to normal
      activities (Treatment Recovery Questionnaire), time to return to sexual activity (Treatment
      Recovery Questionnaire), change in fibroid symptom severity and quality of life (UFS-QOL),
      change in general health outcome (EQ-5D), work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI),
      subject satisfaction and overall treatment effect (Overall Treatment Effect and Satisfaction
      Questionnaire), pregnancy occurrence and outcome, non-medical re-intervention, adverse events
      related to the device/procedure.

      Validated questionnaires are used where appropriate (UFS-QOL, E1-5D and WPAI). Double data
      entry will occur to ensure accurate capture of subject reported data. Monitoring will occur
      throughout the course of the trial to ensure adherence to the protocol.

      As an observational trial, there are no pre-specified statistically powered endpoints.
