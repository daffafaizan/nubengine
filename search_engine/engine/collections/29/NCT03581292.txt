      I. To determine whether veliparib (ABT-888), when added to radiotherapy (RT) and
      temozolomide, is efficacious for the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade
      glioma (HGG) whose tumors' molecular profile are wild-type for H3 K27M, BRAF, and IDH1/2.

      II. To determine whether veliparib (ABT-888), when added to RT and temozolomide, is
      efficacious for the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed HGG whose tumors' molecular
      profile are wild-type for H3 K27M and BRAF and harbor an IDH1/2 mutation.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore associations of genomic, transcriptomic, and/or epigenetic alterations of the
      tumors with treatment response and outcome.

      II. To explore the extent to which patients with BRCA1/2 gene alterations and other
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaged genes display tumor genomic features consistent with
      homologous repair deficiency (HRD), including large scale state transitions (LSTs),
      mutational signature 3, and an enrichment for deletions flanked by sequences of (micro)
      homology.

      III. To explore the burden of high, moderate, and low penetrant germline alterations in HRD
      genes (such as BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, Fanconi complex genes, ATM, CHEK2, RAD51B/C/D), mis-match
      repair genes (such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM), and energy metabolism genes (such as
      SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHAF2, SDHD, IDH1, IDH2, and FH).

      IV. To explore constitutional imprinting abnormalities associated with EP300 and IGF2 in
      peripheral blood from patients with HGGs.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY PHASE: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and undergo
      30 daily fractions of radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6-7 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning 4 weeks after chemoradiotherapy phase, patients receive
      veliparib PO BID and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 10 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1,
      every 4 months for year 2, every 6 months for year 3, and then once yearly for years 4-10.
