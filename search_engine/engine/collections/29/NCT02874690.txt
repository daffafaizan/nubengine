      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) with comorbid ADHD" will investigate the role of a
      non-invasive neurophysiological biomarker in an underserved population to clarify diagnosis
      and guide treatment decisions. Specifically, we will modify an existing eye tracking paradigm
      that discriminates between ADHD and typical youth, for use in an ASD cohort with (ASD+) and
      without an ADHD comorbidity. A case-control design (Aim 1) will lead into a randomized
      placebo controlled trial of MPH in children with ASD with comorbid ADHD (Aim 2). We
      hypothesize that children with ASD+ will demonstrate specific abnormalities in microsaccades,
      eye blink frequency, and pupil dilatation on continuous performance testing that will predict
      MPH treatment response on standardized clinical outcomes for ADHD. As a secondary measure, we
      will also perform a brief electrophysiological measure, short interval cortical inhibition
      (SICI), as measured by paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We have
      extensively investigated this measure as a robust predictor of ADHD diagnosis and symptom
      severity in ADHD and typical youth. We anticipate this personalized medicine-based approach
      to clarify ADHD co-occurrence in ASD will result in a novel neurophysiological biomarker will
      enhance diagnostic reliability and better match appropriate pharmacotherapy in a highly
      complex neurodevelopmental disease.
