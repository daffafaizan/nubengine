      direction and provide protection. Among them, the restriction by Miami semirigid collar was
      superior, with the least tissue-interface pressure of neck. It is one of the most used
      semirigid collars for patients' protection in the operating theatre. However, the presence of
      the semirigid collar was shown to result in a poorer view at laryngoscopy, possibly due to a
      reduction in mouth opening. Nasotracheal intubation is sometimes applied in cervical spinal
      surgeries for those receiving anterior approach for a higher cervical spine (C3) level, and/
      or combined with a short neck, or due to surgeon's preference. Glidescope minimizes cervical
      movements during laryngoscopy, facilitates nasotracheal intubation than direct laryngoscopy
      and requires less technical skill than fiberoptic tracheal intubation. The investigation was
      to assess the effect of cervical collar on nasotracheal intubation and potential hazard
      factors of prolonged time for nasotracheal intubation with Gildescope in patients scheduled
      for elective cervical spinal surgery.
