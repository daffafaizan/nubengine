    
      Patients who failed to achieve a clinical pregnancy after embryo transfer of at least three
      high quality embryos in at least two IVF or FET cycles and for whom their last failed cycle
      was a frozen embryo transfer are offered the opportunity to enroll in this study. All
      patients will follow our routine FET protocol.

      On a randomized basis, selected patients will undergo an endometrial biopsy using a Pipelle
      disposable device in the week prior to starting estrogen to prepare her endometrium.
