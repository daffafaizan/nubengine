      objective of this study (Cohort 1) is to determine if the pharmacokinetics of a single dose
      of GSK2336805 are affected by co-administration with repeat doses of omeprazole, a
      proton-pump inhibitor that is commonly used by chronic hepatitis C patients .

      The second objective of this study (Cohort 2) is to determine if the pharmacokinetics of a
      single dose of GSK2336805 are affected by co-administration with repeat doses of ritonavir, a
      HIV protease inhibitor drug that is a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4.
