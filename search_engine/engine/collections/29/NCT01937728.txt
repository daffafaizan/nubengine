        1. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 36-week versus 48-week regimen of PEGASYS®
           (peginterferon alfa-2a, PegIFN) plus standard-dose of ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C
           virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected, treatment-naïve CHC patients who have high viral loads
           (HVL, defined as baseline HCV RNA ≧ 400,000 IU/mL) and achieve a rapid virologic
           response (RVR) (defined as seronegativity of HCV RNA at week 4 of treatment)

        2. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 48-week versus 72-week regimen of PegIFN plus
           standard-dose of RBV in HCV virus genotype 1 infected, treatment-naïve CHC patients with
           PCR-seropositive of HCV RNA at week 12
