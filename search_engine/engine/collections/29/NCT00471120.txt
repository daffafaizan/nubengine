      screening and early detection of uterine cancers in women using novel inventions and
      biotechnology methods for collection and assay of uterine cells. Results of P2X7 assays using
      tissues obtained from women with known uterine cancer and from women with histologically
      normal endometrium will be compared. These data will also serve as basis for future studies
      to test the predictive value of the method in population-based studies.
