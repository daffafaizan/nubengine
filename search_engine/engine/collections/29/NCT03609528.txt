      the bowel wall to reach the prostate. Bacteria in the bowel inevitably enter the urinary
      system and blood stream. A significant number of men develop infections despite preventative
      antibiotics (1 in 10 develop fevers/shivers and 1-2 in 100 get a life-threatening infection).
      It is crucial we find a safer biopsy method for suspected prostate cancer as over 1 million
      rectal biopsies occur each year.

      A safer alternative device was developed, performed under local anaesthetic using the
      transperineal route: CamPROBE (Cambridge Prostate Biopsy Device). CamPROBE biopsies are taken
      through the perineum (the area under the testicles), so there is no infection risk, and it's
      just as good at diagnosing prostate cancer. This investigation progresses from a prototype to
      a disposable, single use device that any UK hospital can use. The study will assess
      CamPROBE's ability to reduce infections from prostate biopsies and its usability as an
      alternative to the current standard biopsies.

      Men recommended to undergo a prostate biopsy will be eligible for this multi-centre study.
      For each patient, the study will take approximately 30 days, consisting of: recruitment, 1
      day for the procedure (replaces the standard biopsy pathway) and questionnaires on day 1, 7
      and 30. This timeframe will not introduce delays in the patients' normal standard care
      pathway. Patients will have a transperineal biopsy with CamPROBE instead of the current
      transrectal method. Biopsy samples will be treated the same as standard procedure. Patients'
      acceptability of the procedure and complications will be measured using patient self-reported
      questionnaires.
