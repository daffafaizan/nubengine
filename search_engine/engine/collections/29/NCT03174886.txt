    
      The non-fluent variant of Primary progressive Aphasia (nfvPPA) is a chronic progressive
      neurodegenerative disorder of the brain. Over the course of the disease, pathological
      proteins accumulate in the brain, damaging neurons, thus causing them to lose their
      connections and die.

      No treatments are currently available; symptomatic medications are used off-label in nfvPPA.

      AADvac1 is designed to raise antibodies against pathological tau protein (the primary
      constituent of neurofibrillary pathology, which is the underlying cause of disease in ~80% of
      nfvPPA cases). These antibodies are expected to prevent tau protein from aggregating, to
      facilitate the removal of tau protein aggregates and prevent the spreading of pathology,
      slowing or halting the progress of the disease.
