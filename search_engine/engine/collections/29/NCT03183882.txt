      prescription drug abuse and diversion. On August 24, 2016, Pennsylvania initiated its
      mandated PDMP. In prior research, we found that ED providers reduced opioid prescribing by
      17% immediately after PDMP went live. Still, there is variability between providers in the
      frequency of opioid prescribing even after PDMP initiation. Changing clinician prescribing
      behavior is difficult, but recent research has shown that using peer comparisons can assist
      behavior change (Meeker D et al., JAMA, 2016). In this study, we will randomize a convenience
      sample of ED providers to receive either their opioid prescribing history data with peer
      comparative data or without peer comparative data. We will examine the effect on immediate
      perceived norms as well as impact on opioid prescribing in the subsequent 3 months. Results
      could inform behavioral feedback to alter clinician prescribing behaviors
