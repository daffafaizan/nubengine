      arms according to their disease status. A disease assessment will be performed every 8 or 9
      weeks (Â± 3 days) depending on the treatment arm assignment. The assessment will be based both
      on changes in clinical symptoms, and radiographic images. Subjects without evidence of
      disease progression may continue to receive treatment based on their original treatment
      assignment until disease progression or intolerability. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4
      weeks after the last dose infusion of AGS-8M4.
