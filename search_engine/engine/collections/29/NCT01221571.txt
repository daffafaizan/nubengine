      The overall objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and activity of single cycles of AFM13 in patients with CD30 positive
      refractory and/or relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of single cycles of AFM13
           monotherapy.

        2. To determine the OBD (Optimal Biological Dose) or MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) of AFM13;
           whichever is reached first.

        3. To define the pharmacokinetic profile of AFM13.

        4. To analyse immunological markers e.g. ADCC (Antibody dependent cell mediated
           cytotoxicity), NK (Natural killer) cell activity, complement activation and depletion,
           and cytokine release.

        5. To assess the immunogenicity of AFM13.

        6. To assess the activity of AFM13.
