      of coumadin. Eligible patients were invited to use in a prospective cross-over mode two weeks
      of celecoxib, rofecoxib, acetaminophen and placebo with two weeks of wash out between drugs.
      Their international normalized ratio (INR) were measured before and during the use of each
      study drug. The interaction with coumadin was evaluated according to increases or decreases
      on the INR after each medication.
