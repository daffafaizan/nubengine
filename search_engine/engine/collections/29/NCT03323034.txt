    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      pevonedistat administered as an intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 10, and 12 of a 28-day
      cycle (cycle 1), and on days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21-day cycle (cycle 2 and beyond) in
      combination with irinotecan (administered as an intravenous infusion on days 8-12 of cycle 1
      and days 1-5 of cycles 2+) and temozolomide (administered orally on days 8-12 in cycle 1 and
      days 1-5 of cycles 2+) in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including
      central nervous system (CNS) tumors and lymphoma.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of pevonedistat administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of pevonedistat in children with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of pevonedistat within the confines of a
      phase 1 study.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of pevonedistat.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of pevonedistat.

      Patients receive pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 10, and 12,
      temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 8-12, and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 8-12
      of cycle 1. Beginning cycle 2, patients receive pevonedistat IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 3,
      and 5, temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5, and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for cycle 1 and 21 days for subsequent cycles for up to 17
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
