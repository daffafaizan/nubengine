      bleeding from endoscopic images, evaluated by a blinded third-party. The study will include
      60 total consecutive cases of individuals undergoing a planned laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy (LSG). The LSG procedure will be performed according to institutional
      standard-of-care and all subjects will undergo standard preoperative evaluation as well as
      post-operative care.
