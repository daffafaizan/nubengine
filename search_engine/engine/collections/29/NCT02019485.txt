    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the
      study medication is assigned by chance), 2-way crossover (method used to switch participants
      from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study), single-dose, and single-center study.
      The study consists of 3 phases: the screening phase, treatment phase, and end-of-study or
      withdrawal assessment phase. In the treatment phase, participants will receive a single dose
      of new tapentadol ER 100-mg TRF tablet (Treatment A) and current tapentadol ER 100-mg PR2
      (Treatment B) under fasted conditions in 2 treatment sequences (AB and BA). Administration of
      the study medication will be separated by a washout period (no treatment) of 7 to14 days.
      Approximately 64 participants will be enrolled in this study. Safety will be evaluated by the
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and
      physical examination. The duration of participation in the study for an individual
      participant will be approximately 5.5 weeks.
