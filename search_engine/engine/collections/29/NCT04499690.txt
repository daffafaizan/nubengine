      advanced cancer and their loved ones. Research conducted over the past decade has shown that
      CALM is a feasible, acceptable, and effective therapy for patients with advanced or
      metastatic cancer.

      The CALM Training Program was developed to train oncology clinicians in the delivery of CALM.
      The training program consists of: 1) introductory workshops, which provide foundational
      training in the intervention; 2) advanced workshops, which support the development of
      advanced therapeutic skills; and 3) ongoing case supervision, delivered in small-group
      format, either in-person or online, which provides an opportunity for continuing improvement
      and refinement in the delivery of CALM.

      To evaluate the implementation of the CALM Program at the clinician and organization levels,
      we will approach clinicians engaging in the CALM Training Program and invite them to
      participate in this research study, which includes completion of quantitative measures at
      baseline, 1 year (primary endpoint) and 2 years (study endpoint), participation in
      qualitative interviews, and collection of feasibility data. Implementation science frameworks
      will be applied to assess participants' perceived individual- and contextual-level barriers
      and facilitators to implementing CALM through qualitative interviews.

      Sites involved in the Global CALM Program will conduct pilot studies of CALM in their setting
      to evaluate CALM at the patient- and caregiver-levels. We will not be involved in the
      collection of prospective patient- and caregiver-level data, however data will be pooled and
      analyzed to assess the cross-cultural generalizability of the CALM intervention.
