      investigate the placebo modulation of brain activity associated with orthodontic pain using
      fMRI. 23 voluneers were recruited in a longitudinal fMRI experiment. At both the baseline and
      the one-month follow-up, orthodontic separators were placed between right lower molars 24
      hours before MRI scans. At baseline, the subjects were scanned without placebo while all
      subjects took placebos half an hour before the scan at follow-up. Scans include a
      bite/non-bite task fMRI and a followed resting state fMRI. A generalized linear model was
      used to identify pain-regulating network from task fMRI, and functional connectivity analysis
      of pain related brain regions was performed to study the possible modulation of placebo on
      connectivity of pain-regulating networks using resting-state fMRI.
