    
      Vilanterol trifenatate (VI) is a potent and selective long-acting β2 agonist; Umeclidinium
      bromide (UMEC) is a long-acting, inhaled, muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA). Both
      compounds are in development once daily for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD).

      This study is a randomized, open label, three-period crossover, balanced incomplete block
      study which will assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of UMEC (62.5µg
      and 125µg) and VI (25µg) as monotherapies and combinations in 20 healthy Chinese subjects.
      Each subject will receive three of five possible treatments for 10 days each.

      Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at designed timepoints. Safety will be assessed
      by measurement of ECG QTcF, heart rate, blood pressure, and safety laboratory data and review
      of adverse events.
