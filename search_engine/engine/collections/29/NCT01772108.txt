      in the treatment of clinically significant functional mitral regurgitation in patients with
      chronic heart failure. The objective was to further study the safety and effectiveness of the
      MitraClip System for the treatment of clinically significant functional mitral regurgitation
      in New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV chronic heart failure patients.

      Due to lower than expected recruitment rate, Abbott Vascular sponsorship of the trial was
      terminated early.
