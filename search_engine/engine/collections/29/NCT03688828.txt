      bismuth-based proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics for 14 days. But, eradication
      has become less successful due to low compliance and high resistance to the antibiotics.
      Therefore, it is necessary to develop new treatment strategies that increase the eradication
      rate and reduce adverse effects. Several studies previously suggested that probiotics could
      be effective for improving Hp eradication rate or reducing adverse events with PPI-based
      triple therapy. But, their effect for eradication of Hp is not yet conclusive. And the
      experiments now available about efficacy of Saccharomyces Boulardii were mainly combined with
      triple therapy. The aims of this prospective study is to investigate the efficacy of
      Saccharomyces Boulardii sachets for eradication of Hp, compared with standard quadruple
      therapy.
