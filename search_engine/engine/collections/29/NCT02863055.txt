    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, double blinded, randomized, two-arm phase II trial aiming
      to evaluate nintedanib treatment as switch maintenance in patients with unresectable MPM.

      After signing of the informed consent and upon confirmation of all eligibility criteria,
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to:

        -  Arm A: twice daily nintedanib at a dose of 200 mg until progression or unacceptable
           toxicities.

        -  Arm B: matched placebo.

      Response evaluation will be performed through CT scans every 8 weeks.
