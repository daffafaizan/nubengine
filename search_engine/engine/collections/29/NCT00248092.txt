      children with ADHD as compared to the conventional stimulant products.

      Currently, the top line amphetamine product Adderall XR(R) for the treatment of children with
      ADHD involves a once-a-day morning dosing of up to 30 mg per day per Adderall XR(R) Package
      Insert. Adderall XR(R) has potential for abuse and is hence is classified as a schedule II
      product.

      As part of the development of NRP104 for treatment of children with ADHD, it is important to
      evaluate the abuse potential of NRP104 in comparison to immediate release d-amphetamine. A
      previous exploratory dose ranging study (NRP104.A01) with NRP104 demonstrated that doses of
      NRP104 up to 150 mg are safe and produce effects equal to or less than 40 mg of immediate
      release d-amphetamine. When compared with those of d-amphetamine, diethylproion produced
      effects qualitatively similar to those of d-amphetamine but were significantly less potent.
      Intravenous and subcutaneous routes diethylpropion was less potent as compared to oral route
      (Jasinski et al; 1974). This larger study is designed to compare the abuse potential of
      NRP104 with the Schedule II d-amphetamine sulfate and the Schedule IV diethylpropion
      hydrochloride. Data collected from this study will be used to evaluate the abuse potential of
      NRP104.
