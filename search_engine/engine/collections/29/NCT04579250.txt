    
      Design:

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-FLUNPF0103-00-VP in 2 regimens. The hypotheses are
      that the vaccine is safe and tolerable and will elicit an immune response. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine in
      healthy adults. Secondary objectives are related to immunogenicity of the investigational
      vaccine and dosing regimen.

      Study Products:

      The investigational vaccine, VRC-FLUNPF0103-00-VP (H10ssF-6473), was developed by the Vaccine
      Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and is
      composed of Helicobacter pylori non-heme ferritin assembled with influenza virus H10
      haemagglutinin (HA) insert to form a nanoparticle displaying eight HA stabilized stems
      trimers from A/Jiangxi/IPB13/2013 (H10N8) influenza. The vaccine is supplied in single-use
      vials at a concentration of 180 mcg/mL. VRC-PBSPLA043-00-VP consisting of sterile phosphate
      buffered saline (PBS) will be the diluent for H10ssF-6473. Prepared study product will be
      administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle via needle and syringe.

      Subjects:

      Healthy adults between the ages of 18-70 will be enrolled; adults born between 1965 and 1970
      will be excluded from the trial.

      Study Plan: This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 1 or 2
      doses of H10ssF-6473 in a dose-escalation design. In Group 1, the first 3 subjects will
      receive a single low dose (20 mcg) of H10ssF-6473 on Day 0. If assessed as safe and tolerable
      two weeks after vaccination of the third subject, enrollment will continue for the additional
      subjects in Group 1 and begin for Group 2A. For Group 1, the protocol requires 1 vaccination
      visit, 8 follow-up visits, and a telephone contact after vaccination.

      Groups 2A and 2B are stratified by age as shown in the vaccination schema. In Group 2A, the
      first 3 subjects will receive a higher dose (60 mcg) of H10ssF-6473 on Day 0. If assessed as
      safe and tolerable two weeks after vaccination of the third subject, enrollment will continue
      in Group 2A, begin for Group 2B, and subjects may receive the second vaccination at week 16.
      For Groups 2A and 2B, the protocol requires 2 vaccination visits, 10 follow-up visits, and a
      telephone contact after each vaccination.

      For all groups, solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated using a 7-day diary card.
      Assessment of vaccine safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of
      hematological and chemical parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.
