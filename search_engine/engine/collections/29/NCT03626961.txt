      signs and inspired gases by the patient. A higher NEWS indicates severity of illness and risk
      of adverse outcomes. The use of NEWS values to select the appropriate patients for tertiary
      ICU discharges has not been tested. Our aim is to test the value of NEWS on discharges
      tertiary ICU.
