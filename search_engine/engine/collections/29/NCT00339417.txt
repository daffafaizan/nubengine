      lymphatic filariasis in Africa. Although the drugs have been donated, the cost of such
      programs is very high and has proven to be a major impediment to the success of programs in
      many countries with limited financial resources. Data from albendazole treatment of other
      filarial infections and one study comparing single to multi-dose DEC/albendazole in lymphatic
      filariasis suggest that increased dose and/or frequency of albendazole dosing may be more
      effective in clearing microfilariae. Furthermore, the optimal dose of ivermectin for the
      treatment of lymphatic filariasis is greater than that being used in the current mass
      treatment program. In this study, 50 volunteers with microfilaremic Wuchereria bancrofti
      infection will be randomized to receive standard annual therapy (albendazole 400 mg +
      ivermectin 150 mcg/kg) or semiannual therapy with an increased albendazole dose (albendazole
      800 mg + ivermectin 400 mcg/kg). If adequate numbers of microfilaremic subjects are
      recruited, an additional 25 volunteers will receive annual therapy with the increased dose
      combination. Microfilarial levels, as well as measures of adult worm burden (circulating
      antigen, ultrasound identification of adult worm nests) will be followed every six months for
      three years to assess the effects of the treatments.
