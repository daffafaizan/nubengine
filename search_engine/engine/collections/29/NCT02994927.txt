      anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the orally-administered, selective C5aR inhibitor CCX168 (avacopan) in
      inducing and sustaining remission in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
      (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) treated concomitantly with Rituximab or
      Cyclophosphamide/Azathioprine.
