      However, attempts to improve results for resistant subtypes of ALL, such as Ph+ ALL, have
      been largely unsuccessful. Imatinib, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases, is currently
      being tested in several phase I, II and III trials covering most Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
      patient populations and patients with overtly relapsed or refractory Ph+ALL. Pediatric
      patients with Ph+ALL will receive Imatinib, added to intensive, post-induction BFM-type
      chemotherapy. The endpoint will be the evaluation on the long-term clinical outcome, in
      particular on the Disease Free Survival (DFS).
