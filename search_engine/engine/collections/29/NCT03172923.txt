      specified by the CONSORT statement as possible. This will include secure randomisation,
      intention to treat analysis, full reporting of outcomes and follow-up by a person who is
      blinded to the prosthesis used. The trial will follow the code of good clinical practice as
      specified by the hospital trusts Research and Development Committee.

      In Peterborough all hip fracture patients are admitted to the acute trauma ward and
      transferred to the care of MJP. Those patients that are willing to participant in one of our
      randomised trials are consented prior to surgery. Treatment follows standard evidence based
      protocols with follow-up of all patients in a hip fracture clinic. A comprehensive database
      is maintained for all patients containing both audit and research data. Included in this is a
      standardised assessment of outcome.

      The sliding hip screw used if of a standard design that has been in use at Peterborough for
      the last fifty years. The intramedullary nails used will be the Targon PFT nail. This nail is
      very similar to the Targon PF nail used in the earlier trial on this topic. Bases on the
      results of the previous study and the experience of other users the nail has undergone minor
      modifications that are primarily aimed at making the nail easier to use with improved
      instrumentation and also a change to design of the cross screw aimed at reducing the risk of
      fracture fixation complications occurring.
