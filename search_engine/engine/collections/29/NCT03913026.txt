      This is a multi-center open label phase II clinical trial. Patients with high and very
      high-risk acute leukemia/myelodysplasia will receive a single 5-7/8 HLA matched ECT-001
      (UM171) expanded cord blood after an ablative conditioning regimen. This group of patients
      would be expected to have poor progression free survival (PFS) after a conventional
      allogeneic transplant (bone marrow-peripheral blood).

      Investigators key primary and secondary objectives include:

        1. To confirm low Transplant Related Mortality (TRM)

        2. To evaluate relapse free survival (RFS)

        3. To analyze kinetics of hematologic engraftment;

        4. To evaluate the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD

        5. To evaluate the safety of the procedure

        6. To evaluate incidence of infectious complications

        7. To analyze duration of hospitalization

        8. To evaluate the incidence of pre-engraftment/engraftment syndrome (PES/ES)

        9. To analyze the effect of cryopreservation of the expanded CD34+ fraction on safety and
           efficacy endpoints
