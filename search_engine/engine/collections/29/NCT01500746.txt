      major drawback to pulse irrigation is that it is extremely messy and can easily contaminate
      the patient's surroundings, putting other patients and the person operating the device at
      risk. In order to obtain the benefits of pulse lavage, we have created a device that will
      contain the water spray from the lavage and protect both the patient and their surroundings.
      Due to the fact that frequent (multiple times daily) pulse lavage therapy has not been
      possible previously, it is unknown how effectively serial pulse lavage irrigation reduces
      bacterial counts. This study evaluates the effectiveness of serial pulse lavage therapy in
      decreasing bacterial counts in chronic wounds.
