    
      Multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase II trial, with 2 parallel groups. After
      pre-operative chemotherapy and surgery of the primary tumour and lung metastases (if
      applicable), patients presenting high-risk osteosarcoma (defined as metastatic osteosarcoma
      at diagnosis or localised osteosarcoma with poor histological response) will be randomised
      between 2 arms:

        -  Control arm: post-operative chemotherapy alone (with regimens adapted to the age of
           patient)

        -  Experimental arm : post-operative chemotherapy combined with mifamurtide

      This randomised trial is part of a study recruiting all patients â‰¤50 years old with a newly
      diagnosed high-grade osteosarcoma.
