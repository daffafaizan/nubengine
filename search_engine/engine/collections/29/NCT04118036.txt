      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease.

      "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      Many brain cancers show over expression of a protein called cyclin D1. That means that the
      body makes too much cyclin D1, which affects enzymes called CDK 4 and CDK 6. Enzymes are
      substances in the body that help reactions between cells happen. Too much cyclin D1 triggers
      CDK 4 and CDK 6 to make more cells than normal. This extra cell production leads to the
      growth of tumors.

      In laboratory studies, abemaciclib was able to enter the brain, stop CDK 4 and CDK 6 from
      making cells, and slow growth of glioblastoma in mice.

      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) has been studied in lab experiments and in other types of cancer.
      Information from these studies suggests that Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) may be beneficial
      inrecurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody.
      An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance.
      Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. Antibodies can also be
      produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients; an antibody that is made in the lab
      is also known as a humanized monoclonal antibody that is designed to block the action of the
      receptor, PD-1. PD-1 works to help tumor cells continue to grow and multiply. There are now
      several approved antibodies for the therapy of cancer and other diseases.
