      Cardiometabolic disorders including Cardiovascular disease, Metabolic syndrome, and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. The investigators investigated the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on
      metabolic profile in overweight or obese women.

      A double blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in 77 premenopause overweight or obese
      women. Participants were classified into two groups : vitamin D supplementation [1000 IU/day
      as cholecalciferol tablets (n=39)] or placebo (n=38). Vein blood samples were taken after at
      least 12 hours overnight fasting. Selected anthropometric measures, blood pressure Lipids,
      lipoproteins and glycemic indices were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. Body fat mass
      was determined using BIA. Also the investigators assessed dietary intake using 24 hours food
      recall and semi-quantitative food frequency and physical activity using IPAQ questionnaires.

      The investigators conducted the study between October 2009 and March 2010 at the Medical
      school, Tehran, Iran. Recruitment began in October 2009 via advertisements and was terminated
      in October 2009. The investigators excluded patients with a history of Cardiovascular
      disease, Liver disease, Gastrointestinal disease, Kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and
      Osteoporosis. Moreover, pregnancy, lactation, vegetarianism, and intake of dietary
      supplements were the exclusion criteria.
