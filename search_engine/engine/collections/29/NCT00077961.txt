      subcutaneous CAMPATH (SQ) given 3 times per week in combination with weekly doses of
      rituximab (375mg/m2) for a maximum of 8 weeks in order to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD). In Phase II patients will be treated with SQ CAMPATH at the MTD plus weekly
      rituximab (375mg/m2)for a maximum of 8 weeks with primary objective of defining Overall
      Response (OR) to this combination.
