      reducing the hospitalization length and clinical severity scores. Among the questions
      remaining, treatment length is still being discussed in the literature. The trial hypothesis
      is that the efficiency of a 24 hours treatment by 3% hypertonic saline is not inferior to a
      72 hours treatment, in acute bronchiolitis in infants. The primary objective of the study is
      to compare the efficiency of a 24 hours treatment by 3 % hypertonic saline, versus a 72 hours
      treatment maximum, on clinical remission, judged by the Wang score measured 72 hours after
      starting treatment, in children younger than 12 month hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis.
