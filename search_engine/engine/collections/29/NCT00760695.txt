    
      The goals of this study are to reveal through a pilot trial if treatment of patients with
      severe chronic AN with Marinol® (dronabinol, a CB1 agonist) has significant effect on:

        -  Weight

        -  Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) scale

        -  Motor and inner restlessness (estimated by accelerometry)

        -  Endocrine parameters (see below, paragraph 4.4) This study is a randomized, double
           blinded, placebo controlled cross over study. 24 patients with chronic AN meeting the
           inclusion criteria will be randomized either to receive Marinol® or placebo. After four
           weeks the two groups will undergo a wash-out period and after that will receive the
           opposite therapeutic regime for another four weeks.
