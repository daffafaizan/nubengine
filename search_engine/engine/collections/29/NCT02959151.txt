      leukapheresis, and then activated and re-engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors
      (CARs). There are three options for CAR-targets: GPC3 for hepatocellular carcinoma;
      mesothelin for pancreatic cancer metastatic; CEA for colorectal cancer metastatic. Cells are
      expanded in culture and returned to the participant by vascular interventional therapy or by
      intra-tumor injection at the dose of （1.25~4）×107 CAR positive T cells/cm3 tumor bulk. The
      volume of cell products and the time of cell perfusion process lasted would depend on the
      ways of cell perfused.
