      collection point which is the appropriate effective time after chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
      targeted therapy. The second phase, which is the expansion of the first phase, is to
      determine the precise leading time of ctDNA relative to tumor biomarkers or image evaluation
      in determining the efficacy of advanced NSCLC cancer therapy. Both stages were divided into
      three subgroups: the chemotherapy group, the radiotherapy group, and the targeted therapy
      group.
