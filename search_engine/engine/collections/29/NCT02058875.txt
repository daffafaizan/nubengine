      Will treating kidney transplant recipients with maximum MPA dosages (in the form of EC-MPS or
      Myfortic®) along with judicious CNI exposure (cyclosporine/Neoral®) lead to improved
      cardiovascular outcomes, as measured by the Framingham Risk Score, 7-year major adverse
      cardiac events (MACE) score and cardiovascular risk inflammatory biomarker profile?

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To improve the Framingham Risk Score and 7-year MACE score for renal transplant
           recipients, which estimate risk for cardiovascular disease.

        2. To improve the cardiovascular risk inflammatory biomarker profile.

      Hypothesis:

      The more consistent drug exposure and lower Cmax noted with monitoring cyclosporine using the
      2h levels (C2) combined with full dose Myfortic® will decrease Framingham Risk Score, MACE
      score, as well as markers of inflammation in kidney transplant recipients because:

        1. CNI minimization protocols are widely accepted as a strategy to ameliorate allograft and
           vascular injury.

        2. Chronic allograft injury and vascular disease are known inflammatory conditions.

        3. The MPA derivatives possess significant anti-inflammatory properties.
