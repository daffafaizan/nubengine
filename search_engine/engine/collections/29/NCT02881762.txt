      demonstrated that maraviroc, a medication that is used in human immunodeficiency (HIV)
      therapy, appears to have significant hepatitis C antiviral effect, comparable to sofosbuvir-a
      potent anti-hepatitis C medication. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the
      antiviral effect of maraviroc on hepatitis C virus in people infected with both hepatitis C
      and HIV, and whom have never been treated for hepatitis with direct antiviral agents.
      Participants will take maraviroc for 4 weeks in addition to their regular HIV antiretrovirals
      (ART). The investigators will measure the hepatitis C viral load before, during, and after
      the 4-week maraviroc time.
