      combination to treat HER2+ gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer. This study has two
      parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. The Dose Escalation phase of the study will
      evaluate safety of escalating doses of the combination treatment. The Dose Expansion phase
      will evaluate safety and activity of the combination in patients with gastric or
      gastroesophageal cancer once the final dose and schedule are defined. In addition, a cohort
      of patients with HER2+ 3+ gastric cancer patients will be enrolled in the Dose Expansion
      Phase.
