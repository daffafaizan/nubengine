      undergoing cardiac imaging to estimate radiation exposure levels as well as their biological
      effects (i.e. to determine the degree of genotoxicity by measuring the amounts of DNA
      double-strand breaks).

      The secondary objective is to investigate whether the use of in-plane breast shielding in
      female patients undergoing CT angiography (CCTA) limits the radiation exposure of breast
      tissue and subsequent DNA damage in blood lymphocytes and hair follicle cells.
