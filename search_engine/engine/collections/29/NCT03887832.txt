      primary care intervention can increase empathy in mothers of newborns from low-income
      backgrounds compared to the current standard of care. During their newborns' stay in the
      nursery following recruitment, eligible mothers will be assigned to the intervention or
      comparison group. Mothers in the intervention group will download the SMBI smartphone app
      onto their phone and be trained by a research assistant (RA) on the functionality of the app.
      Mothers will be shown a video from the app, and shown how to share videos with others, to
      respond to prompts, and to rate the video. These activities represent what mothers are asked
      to do at home throughout the intervention. After departing the hospital, mothers in the
      intervention group will receive a media package (video, associated prompt/s, and activity)
      via the SMBI app every week for six months. Mothers will be asked to watch the videos,
      respond to the prompts, do the activities, and rate the value of videos via the SMBI app.
      Mothers will be encouraged to share questions and comments with the child's pediatrician and
      to share the videos with their support network. Mothers in the comparison group will receive
      the standard of care.

      Mothers in both groups will be asked to complete a questionnaire at the end of recruitment
      and at 6 month visit and at the 6 month visit the investigators will also video tape and code
      a five minute play interaction. In addition, a focus group will be conducted with some
      mothers in the intervention group.

      As of April 2020 in compliance with institutional COVID-19 policies all recruitment and
      interventions are being done without in-person contact.
