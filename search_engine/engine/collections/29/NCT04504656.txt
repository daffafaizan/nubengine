      defects or following complications of primary esophageal anastomosis, as well as in patients
      with trauma and scarring to the esophagus following caustic ingestion. It is widely accepted
      that the ideal esophageal replacement is one that resembles the function of the native
      esophagus with minimal deterioration over time. Several techniques of esophageal replacement
      have been developed. These have focused mainly on the use of native tissues (including the
      stomach, jejunum, and colon) as conduits (1), attempts to use a synthetic prosthesis have
      been largely unsuccessful. In an attempt to reduce the trauma and morbidity associated with
      laparotomy and thoracotomy incisions, minimally invasive techniques are increasingly used.
      (2-4). Meta-analyses of adult esophagectomy for the treatment of esophageal cancer support
      the use of minimally invasive surgery (5) however, equivalent comparative studies in the
      pediatric population are lacking. As such, it is unclear whether minimally esophageal
      replacement is as safe as the open procedure in children. The present study aims to address
      this question by comparing the postoperative outcomes of children who underwent minimally
      invasive versus open esophageal replacement procedures at single-center and multicenter
      levels.
