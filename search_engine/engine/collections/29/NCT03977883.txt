      morbidity. However, curative treatment remains unclearly established. In fact, there are no
      specific recommendations for new onset atrial fibrillation in ICU and only few studies have
      assessed this topic.

      The PAF-ICU trial is an observational, prospective, multicenter, transversal trial. The main
      objective is to evaluate the management of paroxytic atrial fibrillation that occur in ICU.

      The investigators want to document 2500 episodes of paroxystic atrial fibrillation in 50 ICU
      centers. In each center, the episodes are included consecutively until the required 50
      episodes are obtained for each center.

      A patient can present several episodes and each episode can be included in the study. A new
      episode is considered as such if it occurs more than one hour after the previous episode.

      The follow-up period for each patient corresponds to the ICU stay.
