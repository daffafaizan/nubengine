      Therapy Management on clinical outcomes among preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestation
      with iron supplementation. As a result, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of
      Pediatrics (AAP) recommends daily oral iron supplementation, of at least 2-4 mg/kg/day from 2
      weeks of age, to prevent iron deficiency in extremely premature infants. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate clinical outcome in the PPMTM program compared with usual care in an
      integrated health care system.
