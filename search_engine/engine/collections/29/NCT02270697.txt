    
      The nail specimens from patients with suspect onychomycosis were analyzed.

      Collection:

      Samples were collected as part of standard patient care from the Department of Dermatology,
      National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH, a tertiary referral hospital), Tainan,
      Taiwan.

      Nail samples were collected as subungual scrapings, clippings, or curettings. Samples were
      immediately transported in sterile Eppendorf tubes at room temperature to the laboratory of
      Department of Dermatology, NCKUH, for KOH stain and routine fungal cultures.

      Sample Prepare:

      Each sample was cut into small pieces with a surgical blade and homogenization by 2-ml glass
      homogenizer. The suspension treated by lyticase at 37Â°C for 30 min and extracted DNA with
      Blood & Tissue genomic DNA kit.PCR program and array hybirdization same with previous study.

      Analysis:

      If the results between array and culture method, discrepant analysis with re-sequencing, KOH
      mount and the patient's outcome of after antifungal treatment. The performance evaluation of
      the array and culture methods with Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative
      predictive value (NPV) were calculated after discrepant analysis. Significant difference was
      estimated by Fisher's exact test.
