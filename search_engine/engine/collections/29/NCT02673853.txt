    
      Post-operative residual paralysis may be defined as the incomplete recovery of muscle
      function following intra-operative administration of neuromuscular blockers (NMBs). This
      condition is associated with many negative patient outcomes such as: increased risk of
      aspiration; upper airway obstruction; and delayed Post-Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU)
      discharge, amongst others. Despite the increasing use of shorter acting agents, the
      prevalence of residual paralysis in the PACU remains high at 20-50%. NMBs are commonly used
      to facilitate endotracheal intubation and insertion of the supraglottic airway by obtunding
      airway reflexes. Given the increasing use of mini-dose NMBs without post-operative reversal
      in clinical practice, there is a need to evaluate the incidence of residual paralysis in the
      patient population who have received mini-dose atracurium during the supraglottic airway
      insertion.
