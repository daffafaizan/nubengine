    
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by
      the growth of numerous tumors in different body parts related to dysregulation of the
      mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The overall incidence of TSC is estimated to
      be as high as 1 in 6000 to 10,000 live birth.The main aspects of TSC that influence the
      quality of life are associated with the brain: seizures, evelopmental delay, intellectual
      disability, and autism. However, the incidence and severity of the various aspects of TSC can
      vary widely.

      TSC is generally caused by pathogenic variants in the tumor suppressor genes: TSC1 and TSC2.
      Confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is performed via TSC1 and TSC2
      sequencing.

      There is no cure for TSC, therefore symptomatic therapy is the best possible choice,
      including mTOR inhibitors, vigabatrin and other antiepileptic drugs for the seizures, and
      neurosurgery in cases of life-threatening neurological symptoms.

      The aim of the study is established TSC specific biomarker/s. Such biomarkers aim to
      facilitate the diagnosis, treatment personalization and monitoring.
