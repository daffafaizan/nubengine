      need for its treatment is even rarer. In comparison, patients who suffer rotator cuff tear
      accompanied by shoulder impingement syndrome often complain of acromioclavicular joint pain.
      However, often patients who complain of severe pain have no positive findings on X-ray or
      MRI, or any sign of impingement. On the other hand, there are patients with positive findings
      on X-ray or MRI who have only little pain. Even a patient who in the out-patient-department
      complained of acromioclavicular joint pain on pressure may feel pain on pressure in the
      physical exam performed for rotator cuff tear surgery. The opposite is very frequent as well,
      so it is often different depending on the time and the performer. In the literature, there
      are some authors who maintain that a distal clavicular resection must be done when surgery is
      used to treat the impingement syndrome, while on the other hand, there are those who endorse
      only complaining (an operation to trim the distal clavicle and the protruding part of adjust
      the plane acromion in order to level their plane), and also those who propose an all or none
      approach to either perform a distal clavicular resection or not at all. Thus, there are
      varying opinions depending on the authors; moreover, these are all observational studies, and
      none report on the rotator cuff tear injury. The authors of this study hypothesize and will
      prove that since the osteoarthritic change and pain of the acromioclavicular joint is
      secondary to impingement syndrome, distal clavicular resection on rotator cuff repair surgery
      will have no long term effect.
