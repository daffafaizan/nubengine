        -  Compare the effect of a smoking cessation intervention comprising behavior intervention
           and nicotine replacement with or without bupropion on 12-month quit rates in patients
           with completely resected stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer who are current
           smokers.

        -  Compare the predictors of smoking cessation success in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine the relationship between smoking cessation and standard outcome measures
           (e.g., second malignancies, survival, and symptom status) in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the effect of these treatment regimens on emotional functioning in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender, prior neoadjuvant or concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy and/or
      radiotherapy (yes vs no), and time since prior surgery (less than 6 months vs 6 to 12 months
      vs more than 12 months). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      All patients receive behavioral intervention comprising smoking cessation advice and
      education on day 1. Patients quit smoking on day 8. Patients then receive a nicotine
      transdermal patch once daily on days 8-77.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral bupropion once daily on days 1-3 and twice daily on days
           4-77.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12
           months and then annually for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 468 patients (234 [117 men and 117 women] per arm) will be
      accrued for this study within 3 years.
