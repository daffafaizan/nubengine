      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo on the change in serum
      AFP-L3% from baseline to 6 months following treatment initiation in patients with liver
      cirrhosis who have a current model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) =< 20.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months on the
      change in:

      Ia. Serum AFP. Ib. Serum IL-6. Ic. Serum bile acid levels. Id. Liver stiffness. Ie. Fibrosis
      4 index (FIB-4) score. If. MELD score.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD).

      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD.

      In both groups, treatment continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days.
