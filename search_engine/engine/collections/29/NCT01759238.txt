      preclinical studies consistently show an increase in radiosensitization with combined
      treatment. It is well described that hypoxia or HIF-1 expression is associated with a lower
      radiation response and progression in solid tumors. Radiation itself induces transient tumor
      hypoxia, which in turn stimulates VEGF production and VEGFR-2 expression what may also serve
      as a paracrine proliferative stimulus that promotes out-of-field growth. The combination of
      radiotherapy with an antiangiogenic agent (e.g. bevacizumab) thus offers the potential to
      enhance the effect of radiation, and avoid further spread of disease. Furthermore, targeting
      tumor vasculature improves the delivery of cytotoxic drugs (e.g. capecitabine) leading to
      increased efficacy of chemoradiation. Combination with cytotoxic drugs could additionally
      limit treatment-induced hypoxia (Senan and Smit 2007; Mazeron, Anderson et al. 2011).
