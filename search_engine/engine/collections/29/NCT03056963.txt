      intervention is an active intervention; the other is intended to be inert. These
      interventions were developed based on extensive research indicating the efficacy of using
      imagery in depression, and a perceived lack of treatments targeting biased self-referential
      processing.

      This protocol aims to develop a novel intervention which can be used on its own or as an
      adjunct to existing treatments. Common treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are
      diffuse; this paradigm instead aims to specifically target negative self-schema, a part of
      the cognitive model of MDD. This study focuses on participants with elevated depressive
      symptoms.
