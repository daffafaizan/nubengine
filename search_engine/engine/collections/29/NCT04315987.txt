      rising. The novel coronavirus attacks the human body by attaching to the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a protective enzyme against lung damage. In addition,
      the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for HCoV-19 Spike protein priming is also essential for
      the host cell entry and spread. Coronaviruses can be deadly, in large part because they cause
      "cytokine storms." These storms result from imbalances between pro-inflammatory and
      anti-inflammatory proteins called cytokines, which can cause extreme inflammation and
      respiratory complications. Respiratory distress kills hundreds of thousands of people each
      year worldwide, and hundreds of clinical trials are testing drugs to treat it.

      MSCs have been widely used in cell-based therapy, from basic research to clinical trials
      Safety and effectiveness have been clearly documented in many clinical trials, especially in
      the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

      NestaCell® is a mesenchymal stem cell therapy produced by Cellavita and proved to be safe in
      previous clinical trials.

      The aim of this study is assess the efficacy of NestCell® as an add-on therapy to standard
      treatment to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. .

      Patients included will be randomized to receive 2x10^7 cells (20 million cells) on days 1, 3,
      5 and 7.
