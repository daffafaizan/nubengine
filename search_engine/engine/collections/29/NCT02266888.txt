      Rejection occurs when the new lung triggers the body's defense (immune) system. When the
      immune system is triggered special cells are sent out to destroy the new lung and eventually
      the lung may not be able to function as it should. These special cells include B cells. B
      cells are an important part of the immune system and help the body fight infection. One way B
      cells fight infection is by producing antibodies. B cells and the antibodies they produce are
      involved in some kinds of rejection after organ transplantation.
