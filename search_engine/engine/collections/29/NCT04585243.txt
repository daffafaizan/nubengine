      from cervical cancer in 2018 (Siegel et al., 2018). Screening can reduce cancer mortality by
      (1) detecting malignancies when they are more treatable and (2) for some tests, identifying
      precancerous lesions for removal (Shieh et al., 2016). Guidelines recommend cytology and/or
      HPV testing for cervical cancer screening among women ages 30-65 years, but screening rates
      are suboptimal (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2018; Saslow et al., 2012).

      To help bridge these gaps in screening, HPV self-sampling would be an alternative to
      clinical-sampling for HPV testing. However, there are concerns about the comparability and
      acceptability of self-sampling kits.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the test characteristics of the human
      papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling kit versus clinician-sampled HPV testing for cervical
      cancer screening. Potential participants will be identified from the Penn State Family and
      Community Medicine and OBGYN clinics after it is determined that they have abnormal findings
      on their (clinician-sampled) Pap/HPV test and require a follow-up colposcopy. The patient
      will be pre-screened by a study team member. If they are found to be eligible, a study team
      member will invite them to participate in the study.

      After a participant enrolls in the study, a self-sampling kit is mailed to their home along
      with a Summary Explanation of Research consent form and instructional sheet. Participants
      will be asked to complete the kit two weeks before or after their colposcopy, giving them a
      28 day collection window. Study team members will perform a follow-up survey after the sample
      is collected and provide reminder phone calls if needed.
