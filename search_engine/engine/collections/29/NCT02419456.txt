      priority. IVRs are currently being studied as a method to deliver HIV ARV drugs in women.
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of two IVRs containing different
      doses of a combination of two HIV ARV drugs, vicriviroc (VCV) (MK-4176) and MK-2048, in
      healthy, HIV-uninfected women.

      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected women, 18 to 45 years old. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive either the low dose MK-2048A IVR or the original dose
      MK-2048A IVR. Participants will receive their assigned IVR at the enrollment visit, and the
      IVR will be removed on Day 28. Participants will attend study visits at screening, enrollment
      (Day 0), and Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 35. Study visits may include
      medical history reviews, physical examinations, blood collection, pelvic specimen collection,
      urine collection, and counseling and adherence assessments.
