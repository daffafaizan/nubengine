      has been observed to be associated with numerous health conditions, but current
      methodological studies suggest that collection method, laboratory handling, bioinformatic
      processing of the data, and other factors can greatly affect microbiome study findings. In
      cohort studies, samples are typically collected at baseline, but are often not processed
      until sufficient cases have accumulated. This type of study design will require that samples
      remain frozen for likely many years prior to laboratory handling for microbiome measurements.
      To our knowledge, no study has considered the impact of long term storage of oral samples on
      oral microbiome characteristics. Therefore, we will evaluate the effect of long term storage
      of two oral sample collection methods (OMNIgene ORAL and Scope mouthwash) from 30 individuals
      who work at the NCI on oral microbiome characteristics. We will request that each participant
      will provide samples on 6 separate days over the course of two weeks. Participants will also
      fill out a short questionnaire. We will create aliquots from the pooled OMNIgene ORAL and
      Scope mouthwash samples from each individual, and immediately extract the DNA one aliquot.
      The remaining aliquots will be frozen at -80 degrees C and DNA will be extracted after one
      month, three months, six months, and one year after collection. The remaining aliquots will
      remain in the -80 degress C freezer for even longer term testing and other future studies. We
      will compare the microbial profiles from the stored samples to the immediately extracted
      samples to determine the effect of storage on oral samples.
