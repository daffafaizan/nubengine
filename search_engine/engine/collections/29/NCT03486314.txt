      Parts: Part A and optional Part B. Part A will have a drug-drug interaction (DDI) assessment.
      In Part A, participants will be assigned to:

      â€¢ Pevonedistat 50 mg/m^2 + Rifampin

      Eligible participants from Part A will continue treatment in optional Part B with
      pevonedistat in combination with SoC chemotherapy, docetaxel or carboplatin plus paclitaxel.
      The investigator will decide which SoC combination partner a participant will receive.

        -  Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 + Docetaxel

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 18 months. Participants will make a final visit to the clinic 30
      days after receiving their last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent therapy.
