        -  Assess the response rate of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with
           gemcitabine and cisplatin.

        -  Assess toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin
      IV over 60 minutes on day 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 29-38 patients will be accrued for this study.
