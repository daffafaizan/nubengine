      randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), crossover (method used to switch
      patients from one treatment arm to another in a clinical study) study. Approximately, 24
      healthy volunteers will be enrolled in the study. Eligible volunteers will be randomly
      allocated to either Sequence A group or Sequence B group. On Day 1, volunteers from Sequence
      A group will receive imported mizolastine tablets and volunteers from Sequence B group will
      receive domestic mizolastine tablets. There will be a washout period (no treatment) of 7
      Days. On Day 8, the two sequence groups will be switched. Volunteers from Sequence A group
      will receive domestic mizolastine and volunteers from Sequence B group will receive imported
      mizolastine tablets. Safety evaluations will include assessments of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination, which will be
      measured throughout the study. The maximum study duration for each volunteer will be
      approximately 16 days.
