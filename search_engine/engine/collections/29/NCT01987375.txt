    
      This study will be a conventional 3+3 phase I study evaluating three escalating dose levels
      of intravenous infusion of cetuximab-IRDye800 for patients who tolerate a 100 mg test/loading
      dose of unlabeled cetuximab as part of the screening process. Two cohorts will be added that
      do not include a 100 mg unlabeled test/loading dose of cetuximab, but will include a 10 mg
      test dose prior to enrollment. One cohort of 6 patients will be added that includes a 100 mg
      unlabeled test/loading dose of cetuximab and a fixed 50 mg dose of cetuximab-IRDye800.
