      Lamivudine in nucleoside-naïve CHB patients. The prompt switch from Lamivudine to Entecavir
      in patients who have insufficient hepatitis B virus suppression (HBV DNA ≥ 60 IU/mL by PCR)
      may lead to full viral suppression to undetectable level by PCR method. The prompt switch
      from Lamivudine to Entecavir in patients who have insufficient hepatitis B virus suppression
      (HBV DNA ≥ 60 IU/mL) may preclude development of drug resistance. The results of this study
      will provide a rationale for switch treatment from one antiviral to another one, especially
      from LAM to ETV.
