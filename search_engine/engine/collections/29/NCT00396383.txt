      well tolerated in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. In addition, this study determines if 240
      µg/kg plerixafor alone can be used to mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) for
      transplantation in MM patients. The minimum number of CD34+ cells to collect is 2*10^6 CD34+
      cells/kg and the target is ≧4*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg. Success of transplant engraftment will be
      measured by the number of days to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and platelet (PLT)
      engraftment. Durability of engraftment will be assessed for a minimum of one year.
