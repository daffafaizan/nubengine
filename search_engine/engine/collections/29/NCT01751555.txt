      3TC are nucleotide analogues that can inhibit both HIV and HBV DNA polymerases. There is
      higher risk to cause drug resistance in treating HBV or HIV infection with 3TC or TDF
      monotherapy than combination trerapy. Combination tharapy could decreases drug resistance.
      China's HIV epidemic remains one of low prevalence overall, but with pockets of high
      infection among specific sub-populations and in some localities. China has a very high
      endemicity for hepatitis B too. A substantial proportion of HIV-infected individuals are
      co-infected with HBV. TDF + 3TC + EFV will be a common regimen for HIV/HBV co-infected
      Chinese individuals.

      The purpose of this study of this study is to determine whether TDF will be safe for patients
      with HIV and HBV co-infection and the combination of TDF+3TC+EFV will suppress HIV and HBV
      viral load below LDL at week 48 of treatment in patients with HIV and HBV co-infeciton.This
      study will enroll 100 adult subjects and follow these patients for 48 weekes.There will be
      one enrollment visit(baseline) and visits at 2,4,8,12,24,36,48 weeks after initiation of the
      study regimen.
