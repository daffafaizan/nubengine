      the experimental diet. Through a series of monthly small-group sessions, intervention
      patients received education in reducing dietary calories (if needed), personal goal-setting,
      and self-monitoring using food diaries. Behavioral and psychological counseling was also
      offered. The dietary advice was tailored to each patient on the basis of 3-day food records.
      The recommended composition of the dietary regimen was as follows: carbohydrates, 50% to 60%;
      proteins, 15% to 20%; total fat, less than 30%; saturated fat, less than 10%; and cholesterol
      consumption, less than 300 mg per day. Moreover, patients were advised to consume at least
      250 to 300 g of fruits, 125 to 150 g of vegetables, and 25 to 50 g of walnuts per day; in
      addition, they were also encouraged to consume 400 g of whole grains (legumes, rice, maize,
      and wheat) daily and to increase their consumption of olive oil. Patients were in the program
      for 24 months and had monthly sessions with the nutritionist for the first year and bimonthly
      sessions for the second year. Compliance with the program was assessed by attendance at the
      meetings and completion of the diet diaries.
