      tracheal aspirates and blood samples will be obtained within 24 hours of intubation, then
      twice more every 3 -4 days, and then once a week until the patient is extubated. If the
      primary treatment team performs bronchoscopy with BAL, then an aliquot of residual BAL fluid
      will be obtained.
