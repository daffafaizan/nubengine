      ascertained by CTA and carotid artery ultrasound. Patients will receive and intravenous
      injection of the radiolabeled PET tracer,[F-18]RGD-K5, and will undergo PET imaging of their
      carotid arteries bilaterally. PET images will be analyzed to determine the standard uptake
      value (SUV) of [F-18]RGD-K5 uptake by the carotid artery plaque and this will be compared to
      the SUV of the background (blood pool in the aorta). This will be expressed as a target to
      background ratio (TBR). Investigators expect to find a significant uptake of [F-18]RGD-K5 by
      carotid artery palque and investigators therefore expect to find a TBR that is significantly
      >1. Investigators also expect to find that plaque from patients who show a TBR >1 will also
      be enriched for histologic markers for inflammation and angiogenesis.
