        1. To confirm and quantify the presence of hypotestosteronemia in critically ill male
           patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation via
           endotracheal intubation.

        2. To correlate serum testosterone levels with disease severity, short-term outcomes, and
           survival in mechanically ventilated male patients.

        3. To determine if demographic patient characteristics, such as age, admitting diagnosis,
           or the presence of co-morbidities, affect serum testosterone levels during mechanical
           ventilation.
