      during MAT clinic visits for 4 weeks.

      Attentional bias: Attentional bias will be assessed during MAT clinic visits using the visual
      probe task, which is considered the gold standard to evaluate vigilance to salient cues. In
      the standard attentional bias task, a drug or pain-related word is presented next to a
      neutral word for 500ms. Subsequently, a probe (i.e., a "q" or "p") replaces the drug/pain
      word or the neutral word at an equal rate. The participant's task is to indicate the location
      of the probe as quickly as possible by pressing "q" or "p". Attentional bias is calculated
      from the difference in reaction times (i.e., neutral cue minus drug/pain cue) to indicate the
      location of the probe, with higher values indicating greater attentional bias. For all tasks,
      opioid and pain words will be presented in separate blocks in counterbalanced order. Neutral
      words paired with opioid or pain words will be matched for length and frequency of use in the
      English language. Opioid (e.g., syringe, needle, high, blues) and pain sensory (e.g., stuff,
      throbbing, shooting, burning) and affective (e.g., miserable, tiring, unbearable, exhausting)
      words will be taken from prior research demonstrating attentional bias in OUD and chronic
      pain patients.

      CBM treatment: In CBM, the task presentation and timing is the same as attentional bias,
      except the probe always replaces the neutral word. It ensures that: 1) the duration of CBM
      and control training should not differ; 2) CBM and control participants receive equal
      practice on the motoric aspects of the task; and 3) CBM and control participants are exposed
      to the same word cues. Based on previous data, duration of CBM and control trainings will be
      about 10 minutes.
