      mostly feel older than their actual age and this felt age may be associated with depression,
      anxiety, fatigue, sleep, quality of life or cognition. After power analysis, study sample
      calculated as 262 patients, the present study will use 2016 revised American College of
      Rheumatology criteria to diagnose fibromyalgia.
