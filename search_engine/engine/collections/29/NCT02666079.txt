    
      Female subjects with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer scheduled to have wide local
      excision (WLE) +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)
      will be screened and receive 18F-FDG plus LightPath® Image. Subjects will have standard of
      care WLE. Extra cavity shaving due to positive 18F-FDG LightPath® Images is at the discretion
      of the surgeon.

      Subjects will receive an intravenous injection of up to 5 MBq/kg, to a maximum 300
      MegaBecquerel (MBq) of 18F-FDG prior to surgery.

      Following resection, the WLE specimen will be examined using the LightPath® Imaging System.
      If the surgeons detect a positive signal they may perform cavity shavings of the resection
      cavity area corresponding to the positive signal area (up to a maximum thickness of 10mm).

      Axillary SLNB will be performed according to local practice. At sites where 99mTc is used: In
      the 18F-FDG + LightPath® a higher dose of up to 150 MBq technetium-99m (99mTc) nanocolloid is
      necessary to avoid 18F-FDG masking the signal from 99mTc. Blue dye will be used according to
      local practice at sites where it is considered standard of care.

      Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) will be examined using the LightPath® Imaging System. Where
      clinically indicated, ALND will be performed as per standard of care. At the time this
      protocol was finalised, LightPath® data involved lymph nodes sufficient to support
      recommendations were not available. For this reason, LightPath® Image results will not be
      used to direct ALND.

      All LightPath® Images will be performed between 60 and 180 minutes post injection of 18F-FDG.

      The WLE specimen, cavity shavings (where performed) and SLNs (where performed) will then
      undergo standard of care histopathological analysis. Lymph nodes will also be examined
      according to standard of care histopathological analysis. The results of the
      histopathological analysis will then be correlated with the LightPath® Images.

      All staff in the operating room will wear badge dosimeters. Staff handling surgical specimens
      in theatre will also wear ring dosimeters. Histopathology analyses should be delayed to allow
      for radioactive decay of tissue samples to suitably low levels.

      Subjects will be evaluated at screening and enrolment into the study. Data will be collected
      until the decision by the study site's MDT to recommend re-excision or mastectomy because of
      a positive margin on histopathological analysis (approx. 1-6 weeks post surgery)
