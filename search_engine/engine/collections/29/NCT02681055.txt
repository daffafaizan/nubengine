      weeks), and a Follow-up visit (within 1 week after the last dose). A total of 40 male and
      female subjects â‰¥18 years of age are planned to be enrolled. During the Screening Phase,
      subjects will be assessed for study eligibility. After signing the informed consent form, the
      following assessments will be performed: medical history including review of prior and
      current medications, physical examination including height and body weight, waist
      circumference, vital signs and an electrocardiogram. Clinical labs, routine chemistries,
      hematology, coagulation profile, urinalysis and a serum pregnancy test will be collected as
      well as cytokeratin-18 (CK-18), a biomarker for NASH diagnosis. An alcohol consumption
      questionnaire will be administered and a MRI scan of the liver will be performed. Serum
      fibrosis markers, the Fib-4 index (age, AST, ALT, PLT) and NAFLD fibrosis score (age, BMI,
      AST/ALT ratio, IFG/DM, PLT, Albumin) will be calculated.
