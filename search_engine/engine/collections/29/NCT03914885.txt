    
      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy:

      The patient will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of bendamustine 70mg/m2/day over 3
      consecutive days and fludarabine 30mg/m2/day over 2 consecutive days. Bendamustine and
      fludarabine will be administered concomitantly. Dose reduction of bendamustine may occur per
      treating physician discretion based on prior toxicities and the clinical status of the
      patient.

      Administration of ATLCAR.CD30 T cells:

      Post lymphodepletion, if the patient meets eligibility criteria for cellular therapy, then
      will receive ATLCAR.CD30 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer ATLCAR.CD30 T cells post lymphodepletion at a dose
      of 2 x 10^8 cells/m2.

      Duration of Therapy:

      Therapy under this compassionate use protocol involves 1 infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 cells.

      Duration of Follow-up:

      The patient will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first.
