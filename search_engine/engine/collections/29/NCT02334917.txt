    
      Prospective randomized controlled split-scar observer-blinded study.

      After dermatologic surgery on the face, surgeons have a choice between using non-absorbable
      or absorbable sutures for skin closure. A dermatologic surgeon favoring absorbable sutures
      for wound closure will consider many factors in material selection, including ease of
      manipulation, cost, and absorption time. However, there have been no randomized trials
      comparing the most important measure: aesthetic/cosmetic outcome.

      Study endpoint/outcome: use three validated scar assessment tools.
