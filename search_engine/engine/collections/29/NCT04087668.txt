      may experience anxiety, discomfort and suffer different degree of pain. So, anesthesia and
      analgesia are essential for this invasive procedure, especially therapeutic ERCPs. Thus, we
      compared the efficacy of using monitored anesthesia care (MAC) with deep sedation versus
      general anesthesia (GA) to perform this procedure and the incidence of complications
      associated with these methods of anesthesia.

      Previous studies have concluded that intubation is possible without the use of neuromuscular
      blockade. We assume that the use of propofol and adjuvants short-acting opioids may provide
      adequate conditions for tracheal intubation. It was also hypothesized that it may also be
      useful in facilitating ERCP under general anesthesia without neuromuscular blockade.
