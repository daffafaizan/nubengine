      diseases. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts that do not result in death cause many
      social and emotional problems, but they are the most important risk factors for the next
      suicide attempt and death resulting from suicide.[1,2] It has been reported that 90% of the
      completed suicide attempt cases are accompanied by a psychiatric disease and depressive
      disorders are seen at a highest level. [3] Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is
      a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity
      that is seen as of childhood.[4-6] ADHD disrupts the individuals' functionality in many
      fields such as academic, social and business life.[7] It also increases the risk of
      comorbidity of many psychiatric diseases.[8-10] In the studies carried out, it has been
      reported that depression is seen in rates ranging from 16% to 31% in cases with adult ADHD
      [11] and it was accompanied by ADHD in 15% of cases with depression.[12] In depressive adults
      with ADHD comorbidity, resistance to depression treatment develops and the longitudinal
      progress of both diseases is adversely affected.[13-14] In the literature review, it has been
      reported that suicide risk increased in children,[15] in university students,[16] in young
      women,[17] in ADHD and depression comorbidity and the clinical progress of depression was
      adversely affected.[18] Studies examining the relationship of suicide in ADHD and depression
      comorbidity in adults have been mostly carried out in young adults and it has been suggested
      by researchers to investigate the association of ADHD and depression in older adults.[19-22]
      The aim of this study was to compare the suicidal behavior, the onset age of depression and
      the respond to the treatment of the depressive disorder inpatients in the psychiatry service
      who are with and without comorbid ADHD. Hypothesis of this study is that the following will
      be observed in the adult depression patients with ADHD comorbidity; depression starting at an
      earlier age, having much more suicide attempts (number of suicide attempts in the past) that
      are much serious (requiring medical treatment) and having more severe depression (depression
      scale scores) and worse self-functionality during discharge from the hospital.

      Material & Methods Complying with DSM-IV criteria and Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS) being
      over 16 points during hospitalization have been determined to be the criteria for inclusion
      in the research. In total, 96 patients were included in the study. All cases were interviewed
      with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I).[23] Other
      comorbid psychiatric disorders were excluded. Adult ADHD diagnosis has been confirmed by two
      different researchers for each case (DHD, EE). In the retrospective investigation of ADHD
      diagnosis, cases who got the score of 36 and above in the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS)
      have been included in the study.

      Investigators evaluated suicidal behavior in a similar manner to the methods used in some
      previous studies.[20,24,25] In the sociodemographic data form, suicidal ideation in the past
      (Have you ever thought about ending your life before? / Yes or No), suicide attempt (Have you
      ever attempted suicide before? / Yes or No) and number of suicide attempts have been
      recorded. Material

      Socio-demographic data form:

      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) [26] Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale (HDRS): [28] Adult ADD/ADHD DSM IV- Based Diagnostic Screening and Rating Scale
      (A-ADHDS) has been developed by Atilla Turgay in Canada.[29,30] Wender Utah Rating Scale
      (WURS): [31,32] Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP): [33,34] Statistical analysis:
      SPSS Statistics Version 22.0 has been used for data analysis. The distribution
      characteristics of the variables have been evaluated by using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
      Student-t test has been used to compare normal distribution parameters and Mann-Whitney U
      test has been used for abnormal distribution parameters. According to the ADHD comorbidity,
      suicide attempt has been compared with the Pearson chi-squared test. P values below 0.05 have
      been considered to be statistically significant results.

      Results The mean age of the patients was 39.1Â±10.4. 57% (n=55) of all patients were females.
      31% (n=30) were single / never married, 53% (n=49) were married / living with a spouse, 16%
      (n=17) were divorced or living apart There was no statistically significant difference found
      between patients with ADHD comorbidity (ADHD+) and patients with only MDD (ADHD-) in terms of
      gender, age, marital status and education.

      In the ADHD+ group, depression started at an earlier age than the ADHD- group (p= .011). The
      average HDRS scores during admission to hospital and discharge from the hospital were
      significantly higher in the ADHD+ group (p<.000). Moreover, the average PSP scores of the
      ADHD+ group at admission to hospital was lower than the ADHD- group and there was a
      statistically significant difference between them (p = .002). There was no difference between
      the groups during their discharge with regards to PSP scores (p = .46).

      Suicidal ideation (p = .018) and suicide attempts (p = .013) throughout life were higher in
      the ADHD+ group than the ADHD- group. In the ADHD+ group, the rate of suicide attempts that
      require medical intervention was higher (p = .001). A comparison of the suicidal behavior
      characteristics of ADHD+ and ADHD- groups is presented in Table 3 and it has been shown
      graphically whether the cases have attempted suicide according to ADHD comorbidity throughout
      their lives.

      Discussion n ADHD+ group, depression has started at an earlier age, the severity of
      depression has been higher during discharge from the hospital and suicidal ideation, number
      of suicide attempts and suicide attempts requiring medical intervention throughout their
      lives were found to be high. Depressive disorder patients with ADHD comorbidity in our study
      have got their first depression diagnosis at an early age. Similar results have been found by
      other researchers.[17,35, 36] Another result of study was that the discharge HDRS scores of
      the depressive patients with ADHD comorbidity were higher. Resistance to depression treatment
      has been reported in the association of ADHD and depression.[38,39] ADHD causes disruptions
      of the individuals' functionality in many areas of their lives starting from childhood
      [40,41] and it has also been reported that there is a decrease in social skills and
      self-esteem of adolescents with ADHD.[42] It has been suggested that in the event of frequent
      recurrent depressive attacks, inability of remission, continuation of residual symptoms and
      inadequate response to classical therapies of cases with depression, a retrospective
      investigation of ADHD[38,39] and treatment planning for ADHD should be made.[18,36,43] As a
      result of the study, the rate of suicidal ideation throughout life and number of suicide
      attempts were found to be higher in ADHD+ group. As mentioned literature, 90% of the cases
      who attempted suicide are accompanied by a psychiatric disorder where depressive disorder is
      the most common one.[3] It has been reported that suicide attempts are related to depression
      duration or impulsivity.[43] In addition, as a result of the research, in the association of
      ADHD and depression, the number of suicidal behaviors that are serious enough to require
      medical care is also higher. This finding has also been reported by other researchers when
      literature is evaluated.[16,25] In adults, suicide is more common in ADHD and MDD comorbidity
      and suicidal attempts may lead to more dangerous consequences (such as being in the intensive
      care unit, causing disability).
