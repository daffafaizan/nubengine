    
      Subjects will receive a single dose of HMPL-689 or matching placebo during Day 1. The planned
      dose levels are: 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 30 mg (about 7 cohorts of 8 subjects). In each
      dose cohort, 8 subjects will be randomized to receive HMPL-689 (6 subjects) or placebo (2
      subjects) under fed condition with a standard meal.

      For the first dose Cohort (1 mg), a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1 HMPL-689 and 1 placebo)
      will be dosed 24 hours prior to the planned dosing of the remaining six subjects. The
      decision of dose escalation or study termination will be made jointly by the principal
      investigator and the sponsor based on the clinical data (safety, tolerability, available PK
      data and clinical laboratory values). Any dose level may be repeated, reduced or split into 2
      doses if deemed appropriate by the Principal Investigator and Sponsor's medical Expert.
