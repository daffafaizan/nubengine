        1. to determine whether genomic effects on antidepressant response differed by class of
           drug,

        2. whether genomic differences between drug responders and nonresponders predict the
           response of antidepressant and

        3. to construct the prediction model for antidepressant treatment in order to aid to select
           the their genetically matching drugs.
