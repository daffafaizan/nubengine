      of two Clinical Centers, will be randomized to either a 6-month intensive behavioral weight
      control program or to usual care (no weight reduction intervention) and followed for 18
      months. Efficacy of weight reduction as a treatment for urinary incontinence will be examined
      at 6 months following the intensive weight control program, and the sustained impact of the
      intervention will be examined at 18 months. To increase the maintenance of weight reduction
      and facilitate evaluation of the enduring impact of weight loss on urinary incontinence, we
      propose to study a motivation-based weight maintenance program. At the end of the intensive
      weight control program, women randomized to the weight loss program will be randomized to
      either a 12-month skill-based maintenance intervention or to a motivation-based maintenance
      intervention. The maintenance interventions maximize the potential for sustained weight loss
      and will allow us to determine if long-term weight reduction will produce continued
      improvement in urinary incontinence.
