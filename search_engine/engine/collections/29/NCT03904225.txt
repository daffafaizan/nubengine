      chemoradiation will be randomized to the observation group and treatment group (60 mg bid,
      p.o.，d1-28，q6wks; continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or over 1
      year). The primary endpoint is distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), Secondary end points
      include overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), progression-free
      survival (PFS) and toxic effects,. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the
      intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive
