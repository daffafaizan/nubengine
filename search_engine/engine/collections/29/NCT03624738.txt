      sternal entry poses the risk of possible injury to vital structures. These include laceration
      of the myocardium, especially the right ventricle, injury of great vessels or crossing
      coronary bypass grafts as the internal mammary grafts in particular, or dislodgement of
      emboli from patent vein grafts. To minimize the risk associated with sternal re-entry, the
      investigators adopted the method of establishing femoral artery-femoral vein cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB) in order to achieve cardiac drain prior to sternotomy. Also, femorofemoral
      bypass support the hemodynamics in cases of redo emergency cardiac surgery.
