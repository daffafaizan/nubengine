    
      MPS II is a rare, X-linked, lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme
      iduronate-2-sulfatase. Because of this deficiency, glycosaminoglycans (GAG) accumulate in
      multiple tissues and organs, resulting in progressive cellular and organ system dysfunction.
      The purpose of this study is to determine if one year of therapy with iduronate-2-sulfatase
      enzyme replacement therapy, at a dose of 0.5mg/kg, weekly or every other week, is safe, and
      results in clinically meaningful improvement in multiple organ function, compared with a
      placebo group. Upon completion of the study, patients will be eligible to enroll in an
      open-label maintenance study.
