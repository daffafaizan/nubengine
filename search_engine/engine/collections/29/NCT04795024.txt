      increasingly important in Western medicine in the last few decades. A special form of
      acupuncture is "Yamamoto's New Skull Acupuncture" (YNSA), which was developed by Toshikatsu
      Yamamoto. Here, the needling is limited to the skull.

      Acupuncture is a safe and almost painless procedure that is usually well tolerated. One
      indication might be the therapy of neurological diseases. Schockert and colleagues examined
      the effectiveness of YNSA in a placebo-controlled study. To investigate the effectiveness of
      cranial acupuncture, three fMRI sequences were performed: 1) without acupuncture, 2) sham
      acupuncture (acupressure without needling) and 3) YNSA acupuncture. The subjects (17 stroke
      patients with right hemisphere lesions and 19 healthy controls) were instructed to
      alternately make a fist (3s) and close it again (2s). There were a total of five blocks, each
      with a duration of 120s. Compared to sham acupuncture, cortical activations in motor,
      premotor and supplementary motor areas were observed during YNSA acupuncture.

      In contrast to Schockert and colleagues, the planned study uses resting-state fMRI to
      determine whether YNSA acupuncture is associated with changes of functional connectivity
      within different resting-state networks.
