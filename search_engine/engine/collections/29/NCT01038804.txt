    
      This is an outpatient study. All subjects enrolled in this study will receive a combined
      regimen of YM155 and docetaxel or docetaxel alone given during 21 day cycles. Each subject
      will be assessed at the end of each cycle to determine if the subject can continue to the
      next cycle. Each subject assigned to receive YM155 in combination with docetaxel will be
      eligible to continue receiving the combination regimen in this study until one of the
      discontinuation criteria is met.

      If a subject discontinues treatment with at least stable disease (SD) that subject will
      complete follow-up visits every 12 weeks for 2 years or until initiating another systemic
      anti-breast cancer treatment, exhibiting progressive disease (PD), or death.

      Each subject will be contacted by the study site every 12 weeks for survival following the
      End of Treatment Visit. The contacts will continue until death or for no more than 2 years.
