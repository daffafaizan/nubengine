      test pulse oximeter measurements to saturation measurements made by a multi-wavelength
      CO-oximeter taken from arterial blood samples from healthy human subjects. Following arterial
      cannulation, hypoxia is induced by reducing the percent of inspired oxygen the subject
      breathes while simultaneous measurements are recorded from the test pulse oximeters and
      arterial blood samples at targeted levels of saturation.
