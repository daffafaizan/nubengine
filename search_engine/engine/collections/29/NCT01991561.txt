      one injection at Days 0 and 21 of either a low, medium or a high dose of H5 VLP Influenza
      vaccine combined with AlhydrogelÂ®, or a low or high dose of H5 VLP Influenza vaccine combined
      with GLA-SE, or the placebo preparation (100 millimolar (mM) phosphate buffer + 150 mM Sodium
      Chloride (NaCl) + 0.01% Tween 80). Seven-day (7) safety data after the first immunization of
      the first 25% study subjects enrolled (98 subjects) will be tabulated and reviewed by the
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), prior to permitting the first immunization of the
      remaining study subjects and the second immunisations. Also, based on medical expert opinion
      and on safety criteria defined in the protocol, a DSMB review might be necessary on the
      seven-day safety data of the same 25% study subjects following administration of their second
      dose, before proceeding to the second immunizations of the remaining study subjects.
      Twenty-one (21) days after each immunization, key safety and immunogenicity data will be
      collected and analysed. All subjects will be followed for safety until Day 407.
