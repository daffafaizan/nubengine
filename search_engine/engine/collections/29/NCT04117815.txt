      CT-induced alopecia in numerous European countries. Originally, crashed ice was used to cause
      vasoconstriction and consequently diminish CT uptake to hair follicles during CT. Soon, this
      method turned out impractically and has been displaced by cooling caps which allow a constant
      cooling of the scalp while easy handling.

      However, effectiveness of scalp cooling depends on different factors such as hair texture,
      chemotherapy regimen, dose of chemotherapy, cooling time, and compliance of the patient.

      Recent studies focused on alopecia prevention more than on patients' quality of life and
      satisfaction. Therefore, data on routine use of cool caps with a focus on efficiency in daily
      routine and patients' acceptability are missing.

      Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide results assessed by the use of a patient's report
      about his or her own health condition "without amendment or interpretation by a clinician or
      anyone else" and are a valuable source of information when evaluating clinical interventions
      or treatment toxicity in intervention studies in oncology. PROs can be perfectly used to
      evaluate the implication of scalp cooling regarding hair preservation but also quality of
      life outcome which seems even more important.

      Women with breast- or gynecological cancer receiving taxane- or anthracycline-based
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy are included in the study. Chemotherapy can be neoadjuvant, adjuvant
      or palliative. Up to two lines of chemotherapy are allowed. Scalp cooling with a maintenance
      temperature of 17Â°C will be initiated 30 minutes prior to each chemotherapy cycle and stopped
      90 minutes after CT. Patients are assessed for alopecia and qualitiy of life.
