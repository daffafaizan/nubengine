    
      This prospective clinical study is designed to evaluate the real-world diagnostic performance
      of an AI model in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR, defined as more than mild
      NPDR), by evaluating its sensitivity and specificity compared to the clinical reference
      standard- seven-field stereoscopic photography.

      The subjects enrolled in this study are patients with T1DM or T2DM. Qualified color fundus
      images and seven-field stereoscopic photography images of each eyes of the subject are taken.
      The fundus images are graded for RDR by the algorithm under test, and seven-field
      stereoscopic photography images of the same eye are graded by ophthalmologist, which serving
      as the gold standard to compare the algorithm performance against.

      The trial plans to enroll 1000 subjects. With a 95% confidence interval, the sensitivity is
      expected to be at least 87% whereas the specificity at 89% or above.

      The quality of fundus images are assessed according to the National DR Screening Imaging and
      Grading Guideline published by Chinese Ophthalmological Society and Chinese Medical Doctor
      Association in 2017.

      The grading of RDR is based on the National DR Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline
      published by Chinese Ophthalmological Society in 2014.

      A brief overview of the clinical protocol is as follows:

      Candidate recruiting phase: recruiting qualified participants; Clinical phase: imaging and
      diagnosing by AI and ophthalmologist ; Statistical analysis phase: comparing two outputs;
      Closing phase: final report and archiving
