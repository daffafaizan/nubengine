      that will help low income patients achieve and maintain goals within established treatment
      guidelines regardless of geographic location. This randomized clinical trial will employ the
      innovative FORA system, an inexpensive, off-the-shelf, state-of-the-art technology comprised
      of a 2-in-1 Blood Glucose and Blood Pressure monitor, coupled with nurse case management
      (TACM) to optimize diabetes care for low income, rural adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
      The target population will be low income patients served in Federally Qualified Health Care
      Centers (FQHCs) with poorly controlled T2DM residing in coastal South Carolina. Two hundred
      patients will be randomly assigned to two groups of 100 patients each; Group A (Usual Care)
      and Group B (Technology-assisted Case Management, TACM). Each patient will be followed for 6
      months, with study visits at baseline, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcome will be
      Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 months post-randomization while the secondary outcomes will be
      blood pressure control and quality of life (qol) at 6 months post-randomization.
