    
      Cellulitis is a common skin and soft tissue infection in the pediatric population.

      Although most of the time treatment could be administered on an ambulatory setting ,
      sometimes it may require hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic administration. Using
      corticosteroids during antibiotic treatment may reduce inflammation and length of stay.

      Objective: to evaluate the efficacy of using corticosteroids as adjuvant treatment during the
      first 48 hours of treatment after hospitalization in patients with cellulitis.

      Patients and methods: this is a double blind, randomized, controlled trial that will take
      place at pediatric hospital, during one year. It will include children aged 1 month to 18
      years, admitted due to cellulitis. Once included in the clinical trial, the patients will be
      randomized to receive dexamethasone 0,6 mg/kg/day or placebo (saline solution) during the
      first 48 hours. Considering an average stay of 4 Â± 2 days, we calculated a sample size of 124
      children (62 children per group) to detect a 25% difference (1 day reduction) in the length
      of stay, with a power of 80% and a confidence of 95%.
