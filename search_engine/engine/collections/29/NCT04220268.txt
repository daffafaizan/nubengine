      glass nodules have been found. Meanwhile, presenting as Ground-glass nodule (GGN), the
      early-stage lung adenocarcinoma patients with lung cancer family history have been emerging
      increasing in recent years in East Asian.

      This prospective cohort study, with both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal part, will
      include patients with pulmonary ground glass nodule, which were proven malignant disease.

      All participants will be asked to complete questionnaire to build the clinical database of
      GGN patients with detailed family history. Furthermore, blood and surgical tumor samples will
      be collected as a specific biobank. And the blood samples of other family members of
      participants will be collected, with their consent and knowledge.
