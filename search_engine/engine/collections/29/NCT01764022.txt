      Russia) in combination with paclitaxel used as the therapy of inoperable or metastatic
      HER2(+) breast cancer in comparison with HerceptinÂ® (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Switzerland)
      in combination with paclitaxel. The objectives of the study is to evaluate efficacy, safety
      and pharmacokinetics of BCD-022 compared with reference trastuzumab by 1. overall response
      rate and other efficacy parameters; 2. incidence and severity of adverse events; 3. serum
      concentration after the first and multiple trastuzumab administration; 4. incidence and
      concentration of anti-trastuzumab antibodies.
