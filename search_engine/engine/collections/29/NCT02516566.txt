      been evaluated in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. We aim to investigate the effects
      of positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation on intracranial pressure assessed by
      sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic
      prostatectomy.
