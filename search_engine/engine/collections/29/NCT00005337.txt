      Sophisticated electrophysiologic monitoring approaches were used to: 1) show greater
      sensitivity in nonhostile young men to T-wave attenuation effects of isoproterenol infusion
      following vagal blockade; 2) show that vagal enhancement reduced and shortened the T-wave
      attenuation effects of isoproterenol infusion more in hostile young men; 3) evaluate these
      effects of vagal blockage and enhancement in middle-aged men and in young and middle-aged
      women; and 4) relate the T-wave effects in these studies to other measures of vagal tone and
      other biobehavioral mechanisms of coronary-prone behavior.

      Four studies were conducted in normal young and middle-aged men and women selected as high
      and low on hostility, evaluating vagal tone measures and effects of isoproterenol infusion on
      EKG T-wave and ST response after pretreatment with saline, neostigmine, and atropine.
      Demonstration that hostility was associated with deficient vagal anatagonism of SNS effects
      on the heart, especially in middle-aged as compared to younger persons, suggested that
      diminished vagal tone was one pathway whereby high hostility contributed to increased CHD
      risk. Clinical studies were then conducted to determine whether weaker vagal tone predicted
      increased myocardial ischemia and/or poorer outcomes in coronary heart disease patients.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
