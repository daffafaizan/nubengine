      pejorative event. Biomechanical and morphological unknowledge about the loss of the walk
      ability in children with DMD is an obstacle in reeducative, pharmacological or surgical
      therapeutic targets. We suppose that there are muscular characteristics and predictive
      parameters of the loss of walk ability. The identification of these potential therapeutic
      targets would improve the surveillance and the clinical care but would also guide future
      clinical and fundamental trials too.
