      is a regulatory strategy, which refers to making plans on when, where, and how to perform an
      intended behavior. In dyadic planning, a target person is setting plans together with a
      partner on when, where, and how the target person will individually engage in behavior
      change. The concept of dyadic planning differs from the conceptualization of collaborative
      plans, where two individuals make plans on how to enact a behavior together.

      The study will evaluate the effects of a short-term planning intervention. The intervention
      includes a total of six sessions: two face-to-face sessions with the experimenter (delivered
      over two weeks) and three sessions delivered over phone (over the following three weeks), one
      face-two-face session (delivered at one month after the third session delivered over the
      phone). The delivery has an individual format (the experimenter + the dyad). The total time
      from first to sixth session is 2 months. The setting for the interventions will include
      physician's offices and participant's home. The same format, schedule, delivery, and setting
      will be used for conducting active control group procedures.
