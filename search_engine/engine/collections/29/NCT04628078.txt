    
      Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) has established itself in clinical practice
      as a safe and efficient therapeutic option for atrial fibrillation patients with a
      relative/absolute contraindication to oral anticoagulation. The purpose of this observational
      study is to prospectively collect procedural and follow-up data of all patients submitted to
      a clinically indicate LAAC in order to assess the impact of patient characteristics,
      procedural technique (imaging used to guide/plan procedure, device implanted, post-procedural
      drug regimens, etc.) on procedural safety and efficacy. The endpoints will be assessed by
      means of clinical follow-up at 1-3-5 years after LAAC and imaging exams (TEE at1-3 months,
      CCTA at 1-13months).
