      to the patients to identify the independent predictors of urethral stricture recurrence after
      augmentation anterior urethroplasty using dorsal onlay buccal mucosal graft.

      A retrospective review of medical records will be performed to identify patients who
      underwent augmented anastomotic anterior urethroplasty with dorsal onlay graft at Al-Azhar
      University Hospitals in Egypt since 2010. Patients will be included only if they were two or
      more years out of surgery. The data will be recorded without patients' identification.

      Data to be collected are patient age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, diabetes status,
      overall comorbidity, stricture etiology, prior endoscopic treatment and open urethroplasty,
      urethral stricture length and location, degree of urethral obliteration, urethral plate
      width, presence and degree of spongiofibrosis. estimated intraoperative blood loss, catheter
      size, overall operative time, hospital stay and early postoperative complications.

      The diagnosis of urethral stricture recurrence is based on the radiological and endoscopic
      features of stricture recurrence. Time to recurrence will be calculated from the date of
      surgery till the date restricture diagnosis.

      Univariate and multivariate regression analysis will be performed and factors predicting
      urethral stricture recurrence will be identified.
