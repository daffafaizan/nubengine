      LBP and sCD14 will be determined by means of ELISA. HPLC will be used to determine nitrate,
      nitrite, albumin fractions, albumin binding capacity, iNOS expression and energy status of
      neutrophils. For investigation of oxidation driven by leukocyte derived myeloperoxidase, mass
      spectrometry analysis will be used. Carbonyl contents of proteins will be detected by ELISA.
      Neutrophil function and TLR2, 4 and 9 expression will be studied by flow cytometrical
      analysis. For cell culture tests, freshly isolated neutrophils or differentiated HL60 cells
      will be used and incubated with albumin and/or endotoxin. Stool samples will be used for
      16srDNA sequencing of the gut microbiome.
