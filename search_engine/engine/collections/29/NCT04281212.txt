      100 interventional cardiology centers in France, will be conducted in two steps:

        -  1st step: This collection will be done over one month, the objective of which will be to
           photograph the therapeutic choice in the management of CTO (drug, surgical, endovascular
           approach).

        -  2nd step: a second collection will be carried out over a period of two months, the
           objective of which will be to evaluate, in patients presenting a CTO with an attempt at
           angioplasty, the success of the procedure.
