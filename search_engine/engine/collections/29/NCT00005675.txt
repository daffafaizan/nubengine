      damage the skin and other organs. This study will determine if a daily oral dose of bovine CI
      will improve the condition of patients with SSc.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group will receive 500 mcg
      bovine CI daily for 15 months; the second group will receive placebo. Study visits will be
      conducted at Months 4, 8, 12, and 15. Patients will undergo physical examination and blood
      tests at each visit. Patients will also be evaluated for modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS)
      and will be given health assessment questionnaires. A chest x-ray will be conducted at study
      entry and pulmonary function tests will be conducted at study entry and Month 12.
