      (with four distinct interventions) were selected to undergo a one-year pilot assessment in
      the community. Preliminary findings from the feasibility study suggest that the
      youth-developed interventions have the potential to impact HIV testing as well as uptake of
      sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing among young people in Nigeria. As a result, the
      investigators identified key components from the four interventions to form a single
      intervention that will be evaluated in the next phase of the research. Thus, the current
      protocol is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of a combined, youth-developed
      intervention on HIV testing and other HIV prevention outcomes (i.e. condom use, PrEP
      referral, STI testing).

      Using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design, the I-TEST intervention
      package will be implemented sequentially across 30 local government areas (LGA) whereby each
      LGA will be exposed to a pre-intervention (control), intervention (implementing the
      intervention), and post-intervention condition, according to a randomized schedule. Young
      people between the ages of 14-24 years will be recruited from the selected 30 local
      government areas through in-person events, social media platforms, and online advertisements,
      clinics, and community centers that cater to young people. Upon enrollment, the study team
      will collect baseline data on HIV testing history, sexual behavior history, youth
      participation experience, and other related outcomes from the study participants. Two trained
      youth alongside one trained supervisor will implement the I-TEST intervention at the LGAs.
