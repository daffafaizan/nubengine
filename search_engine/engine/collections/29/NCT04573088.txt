    
      Introduction: Uncertainty, fears and anxiety are common reactions to an upcoming colectomy
      for colorectal cancer patients and are related not only to cancer disease, but also to the
      inevitable change in colon anatomy, affecting their preoperative psychological and functional
      condition and their postsurgical recovery.

      Purpose: We aim to evaluate the psychological and functional recovery of colorectal cancer
      patients, who undergo colectomy, after an acceptance-based nursing intervention. The scope of
      this brief preoperative intervention is to enable patients to cope more efficiently with the
      upcoming surgery and their health status, as it is expected to reduce anxiety and have
      positive effect on postsurgical psychological and functional recovery.

      Methods: The study includes histologically diagnosed patients with colorectal cancer,
      regardless of stage, who are scheduled to undergo colectomy. Patients will be divided into
      two groups-the experimental and the control group-by simple randomization. Both groups are
      going to complete a set of same questionnaires regarding quality of life, sleep, anxiety,
      depression and functional status. Patients in the control arm will then receive
      treatment-as-usual while patients in the experimental arm will also receive an
      acceptance-based intervention before surgery. Postoperatively, for both groups, apart from
      the self-reported symptoms, we will assess objective recovery factors, such as postoperative
      complications
