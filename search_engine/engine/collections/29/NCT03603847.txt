    
      ALK-positive anaplastic large cell (anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, ALCL) is a rare adult
      disease for which almost all published studies are retrospective. The overall survival (OS)
      at 5 years varies from 70 to 87%. A recent international pooled analysis showed that the
      International Prognostic Index (IPI) had good predictive value for the PFS and the OS.

      In children, new prognostic factors have been identified: the titre of circulating anti-ALK
      antibodies (inverse correlation between the antibody titre and the prognosis), the detection
      of a NPM-ALK transcript in the blood at diagnosis (minimal disseminated disease, MDD);
      correlation between MDD positivity and pejorative prognosis) and its minimal residual disease
      (MRD), and the histological subtype (common versus small cells / lymphohistiocytic).

      The predictive value of the oncogenic profile of ALK-positive ALCL and circulating tumor DNA
      will be studied in this study.

        -  At diagnosis (before starting treatment):

        -  Cycle 2 Day 1 (before starting cycle 2 treatment):

        -  At the end of treatment evaluation:

           40 patients treated with 6 cycles of CHOEP every 3 weeks and 1 lumbar puncture at
           diagnosis with intrathecal prophylaxis with methotrexate will be included prospectively.

      During a 2-year period, relapses / progressions and patient deaths will be monitored for the
      calculation of the incidence of relapse / progression, progression free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS).
