      lung disease during infancy and early childhood, in order to potentially delay or prevent
      irreversible lung disease. Yet, aside from antimicrobial therapies, the CF community has no
      clinical trial evidence base with which to guide pulmonary therapies in children <6 years of
      age. Hypertonic Saline (HS) is the most attractive chronic maintenance therapy to investigate
      in these young children because it addresses defective mucociliary clearance, an early step
      in the cascade of events leading to CF lung disease that is expected to be abnormal prior to
      the onset of airway infection and inflammation.

      This study is a randomized, parallel group, controlled trial to assess the efficacy and
      safety of 7% HS inhaled twice daily for 48 weeks among young children with CF 4 to < 60
      months of age at enrollment. The primary hypothesis is that, compared to isotonic saline
      (IS), HS will decrease the number of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations during the 48
      week treatment period. The results of the proposed trial may for the first time provide
      evidence for early initiation of HS, which, by improving mucociliary clearance, may delay or
      hinder the cycle of infection and inflammation responsible for progressive airway damage in
      CF lung disease.
