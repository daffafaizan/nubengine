    
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major medical problem throughout the world. The most common and
      potentially most blinding of these complications is proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

      Panretinal photocoagulation is established as the gold standard of treatment, supported by
      the data of the Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS).This study found that laser treatment
      reduced the rate of severe visual loss by 50%. Currently the green 532nm laser is the most
      common wavelength used. However, this conventional green laser has some complications such as
      pain, vitreous haemorrhage, choroidal effusion and visual field loss.

      Due to the complication of conventional lasers, the yellow laser (577 nm)with peak absorption
      of oxyhemoglobin and good absorption of melanin is postulated to be more effective at
      producing retinal laser burns with a lower power and less pain compared to the green laser.
