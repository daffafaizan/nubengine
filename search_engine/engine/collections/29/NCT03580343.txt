    
      This study is a prospective, single-site, open-label investigation of tofacitinib for
      refractory uveitis. The study will be for 24 weeks, with potential 1-year extension for
      treatment responders. The patients will self-administer the medication.

      Eligible patients would be those patients with a diagnosis of uveitis who meet the following
      criteria:

        1. Disease sufficiently severe to require treatment with systemic corticosteroids, and

        2. Referred from Ophthalmology to Rheumatology or Uveitis specialist for a steroid-sparing
           agent

      For patients naive to oral steroid-sparing therapy (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, or
      mycophenolate), tofacitinib will be initiated as monotherapy. For patients who have failed or
      had only a partial response to oral steroid-sparing therapy, tofacitinib will be initiated as
      an add-on therapy. For patients intolerant to a conventional agent, tofacitinib will be
      initiated as replacement monotherapy. For patients who have failed biologic therapy (e.g.
      adalimumab), biologic therapy will be discontinued and tofacitinib will be initiated as
      replacement therapy without change to concurrent conventional steroid-sparing agents. Study
      visits will occur at baseline/enrollment, and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, & 24 (+/- 2 weeks). Clinic
      visits may occur more frequently as determined by the treating physician. Laboratory
      monitoring (Table 1) will be obtained according to standard of care for drug toxicity
      monitoring. Clinical responses will be evaluated at 24 weeks, with the primary outcome
      defined as treatment failure.

      All patients will undergo a predetermined oral steroid taper starting at 60mg of prednisone
      (or equivalent) and tapering over 14 weeks (Table 2). All patients will undergo a
      predetermined topical steroid drop taper starting at their current dose (Table 3).

      Patients will have an ophthalmological evaluation by their treating ophthalmologist at
      Washington University. Steroid sparing therapy will be managed by rheumatologists or uveitis
      specialists at Washington University. All patients will be evaluated for an associated
      systemic rheumatologic condition.
