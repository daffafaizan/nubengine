    
      Hyperventilation syndrome has been described as a cause of dyspnea in the general population
      and in several chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma with 20 to 40% of asthmatics
      affected. However, Hyperventilation syndrome has never been sought in a population with PAH.
      Hyperventilation syndrome, although complex pathophysiology, may be simply corrected by a
      management of respiratory physiotherapy based on the control of respiration.
