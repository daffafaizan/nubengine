      HIV-1 vaccines. In the best-case scenario, these vaccines may prevent infection (sterilizing
      immunity). However, current viral vaccines are thought to limit, but not prevent, virus
      replication after infection. In the latter case, it is important to document the effect of
      the immune response on the disease course as reflected by viral load, the evolution of the
      viral quasi species, and clinical symptoms over time. Understanding the evolution of the
      immune response in vaccinees after subsequent exposure and HIV infection will potentially
      result in valuable information for the subsequent design of preventive and therapeutic
      vaccines. This will be studied here using HIVNET 014 participants at higher risk for HIV-1
      infection.

      Participants discontinue HIVNET 014 vaccinations upon confirmation of HIV-1 infection and are
      enrolled in this study. Participants undergo clinical and laboratory examinations every 3
      months for the first year of follow-up and every 6 months for at least 4 years thereafter.
      Additionally, HIV-infected partners of HIVNET 014A participants undergo clinical and
      laboratory examination at enrollment, and may be asked to donate additional specimens at a
      later time. Study endpoints include various virologic, immunologic, and clinical parameters,
      such as viral load, cellular immune response, and virus phenotype and genotype.
