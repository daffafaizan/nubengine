      multicenter, prospective, open-label registry of the management of patients treated in the
      hospital for acute heart failure in China. The objective of this study is to investigate the
      clinical features and prognosis of patients with heart failure, and discover the
      characteristics of high-risk heart failure patients, and elucidate critical factors which
      predict the development and outcomes of symptomatic heart failure patients.

        1. To elucidate the clinical characteristics and prognostic risks of patients with heart
           failure.

        2. To study the characteristics of high-risk heart failure patients and predict the key
           factors for the development of symptomatic heart failure patients.

        3. To elucidate the compliance of patients with heart failure and the incidence of adverse
           drug effects.

        4. To investigate the effect of self-management on outcomes in patients with heart failure.

        5. To elucidate critical factors associated with the development and outcomes of heart
           failure.

        6. To investigate hospitalization expenses for heart failure.
