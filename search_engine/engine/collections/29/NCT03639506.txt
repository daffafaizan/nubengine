      transplantation for improving oocyte quality.

      Design: randomized controlled trial. Setting: Assisted reproductive technologies unit.
      Patients: patients who is in accordance with the inclusion criteria, and not meet the

      control group, both groups are conducted with the GnRH-a super-long protocol for IVF
      treatment. MIT group injects autologous mitochondria from bone mesenchymal stem cells into
      oocyte.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome of the study is live birth rate. The secondary
      outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate, number of oocytes retrieved, fertility rate, normal
      fertilization rate, rate of transferable embryo and good quality embryo rate.
