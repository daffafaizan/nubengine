      treatment of moderate/severe disease is mainly supportive, including oxygen therapy and
      invasive mechanical ventilation when impending respiratory failure is established. Moreover,
      the associated mortality among mechanically intubated patients is overwhelmingly high. Prone
      position relieves the dependent lung regions from the compressive forces of the mediastinum's
      weight, leading to homogenization of the gas:tissue ratio between ventral and dorsal lung
      regions. According to a few case series, and observational non-randomized studies with small
      sample sizes, there is a consistent improvement in oxygenation in COVID-19 patients during
      prone positioning, however there are no clinical evidence that this improvement is associated
      with a decrease in the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation. Considering that prone
      positioning is a low cost, low risk and widely available therapy, more high quality evidence
      is needed, to determine if the benefits of prone positioning in awake patients also include a
      lower requirement of mechanical ventilation.
