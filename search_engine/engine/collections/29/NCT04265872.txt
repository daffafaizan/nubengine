      by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation. HRD leads to
      upregulation of the activity of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) error-prone pathway
      that repairs DNA double strand breaks, a process required for TNBC survival. The hypothesis
      of this pilot trial is that administration of bortezomib will inhibit NHEJ in metastatic TNBC
      leading at the time of disease progression to metastases that are HR-deficient and sensitive
      to pembrolizumab and cisplatin therapy. A patient with an exceptional complete and durable
      response of her primary-refractory metastatic TNBC with PI3K pathway inhibition followed at
      disease progression by nab paclitaxel/cisplatin provides the clinical rationale for the
      present trial which will utilize bortezomib to inhibit HR proficiency prior to administration
      of pembrolizumab and cisplatin in pretreated metastatic TNBC patients.

      Patients will receive bortezomib until PD, followed by pembrolizumab and cisplatin until PD
      or a maximum of 6 cycles on study. If patients are responding, they may continue
      pembrolizumab at the physician's discretion off study. Metastatic TNBC patients will undergo
      core needle biopsies of a metastatic lesion at study entry and at disease progression from
      bortezomib for NGS, RPPA, and other molecular analyses.

      Patients whose disease does not respond to pembrolizumab and cisplatin may be treated with
      standard of care breast cancer therapies off study, at the recommendation of the treating
      physician.
