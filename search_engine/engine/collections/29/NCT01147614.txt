      prevalent and produce added costs to health systems. This two-site randomized controlled
      trial will test the effects of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) protocol (8-12
      sessions) in a large sample (N=210) of children and adolescents (age 8-16) presenting with
      anxiety and/or depression in primary care. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of BCBT will be
      compared to a plausible public health alternative - enhanced referral to specialty mental
      health care (SMHC). This investigation is noteworthy in adopting a deployment-focused model
      and testing this intervention early in its development within a real world context (primary
      care) and against a plausible public health comparison condition (SMHC) relevant for future
      treatment dissemination.
