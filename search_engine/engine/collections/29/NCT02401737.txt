    
      The Phase 1b assessments of the dose-related safety, PK, and initial antiviral efficacy of
      NVR 3-778 in hepatitis B patients will also be conducted at approximately 14 different sites
      to meet enrollment goals of 54-84 chronic hepatitis B patients.

      To promote objective safety and tolerance assessments during this trial, study subjects, and
      site personnel administering the study drug and performing the clinical assessments on the
      subjects, will be blinded to individual subjects' treatments assignments (active NVR 3-778 or
      placebo doses), for all treatment cohorts in the study. Study advancement to subsequent
      patient cohorts will require satisfactory interim reviews of available cumulative safety data
      by the Safety Review Committees (SRC), using the safety criteria and review procedures
      described in the protocol. Also, there will be one interim review of safety data by an
      independent Safety Monitoring Board (SMB), as described in the protocol.
