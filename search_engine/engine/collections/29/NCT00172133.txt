    
      Effects of ALX1-11 on bone mineral density (BMD) have been documented in a dose-finding Phase
      II clinical trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women, supplemented with calcium and Vitamin
      D3 but without any other treatment for osteoporosis. The anabolic effects of ALX1-11 in the
      lumbar vertebrae were statistically significant after the 12-month treatment period and more
      pronounced than any approved therapy. Additionally, animal studies have shown that the new
      bone formed by treatment with ALX1 11 is of good quality both histologically and
      biomechanically.

      The primary objective of this OLES is to evaluate the safety of continued dosing with
      ALX1-11, up to a maximum of 24 months, in postmenopausal osteoporotic women who participated
      in Protocol ALX1-11-93001. A secondary objective is to assess the change in vertebral BMD and
      compare the changes observed in patients who received ALX1-11 or placebo in Protocol
      ALX1-11-93001.

      Patients will receive 100 Âµg/day of ALX1-11 daily via subcutaneous injection in this study.
      Patients should continue the study drug dosing frequency they were following at the end of
      Protocol ALX1-11-93001.

      To enhance their safety, all patients will continue to take their daily supplements of 700 mg
      calcium and 400 IU Vitamin D3 prior to and during this OLES. Patients whose calcium
      supplement was discontinued during Protocol ALX1-11-93001 should maintain that
      discontinuation during this OLES. However upon completion of ALX1-11 dosing in the OLES, oral
      calcium supplement at a dose of 700 mg each morning should be restarted and maintained for
      the remainder of the OLES. Additional supplemental calcium and/or Vitamin D3 will not be
      permitted. A daily multivitamin supplement may be taken during the study. However, the
      multivitamin must contain no more than 200 mg/day calcium and 400 IU/day Vitamin D3. Patients
      will be monitored for the development of hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria and managed as
      described in Appendices 4 and 5.

      There will be a stopping rule in this OLES. Any patient who reaches a BMD T score of -0.5 or
      above, at the site or sites (vertebral, total hip, or femoral neck) that were used in the
      qualification of the patient for Protocol ALX1 11-93001, will stop ALX1-11 treatment. The
      patient must continue on calcium and Vitamin D3 and be followed for the remainder of this
      18-month OLES. At the time of discontinuation, the patient must complete the Month 18
      evaluations (Appendix 1A or 1B).

      The Clinical Advisory Board (CAB) used in Protocol ALX1-11-93001 will be involved in
      reviewing any patient issues that arise in this OLES. This group will provide not only
      continuity of care for all the patients, but also enhanced and consistent safety monitoring
      for patients participating in the OLES.
