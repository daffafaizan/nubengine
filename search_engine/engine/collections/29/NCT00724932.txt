      avoid unwanted muscular activity, anesthesiologists may use a more profound NMB until the end
      of surgery, e.g. in open abdominal procedures or during laparoscopic procedures in order to
      improve surgical conditions. Reversal with sugammadex at a dose of 4.0 mg.kg-1 at 1-2 PTC
      after an intubation dose of 0.6 mg.kg-1 or maintenance dosing rocuronium has been found to be
      both safe and efficacious in previous clinical trials but has never been investigated
      exclusively in participants undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy or appendectomy.

      With sugammadex profound muscle relaxation may now be provided right up to the end of the
      surgical procedure. This may lead to improved Patient Outcomes, such as improvement in the
      time from end of surgery to the discharge to the PACU. In this multi-center, randomized,
      parallel-group, active-controlled, safety-assessor blinded trial such benefits will be
      further investigated.
