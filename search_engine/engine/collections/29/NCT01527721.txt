      was used for the sake of the study.32 patients with keratoconus were included in the study.
      Of them, 19 patients underwent CxL treatment (CxL group), while the rest 13 patients
      underwent CxL combined with t-PRK (tCxL) [tCxL group]. If both eyes were eligible, only one
      eye was enrolled in the study.Regarding Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam Classic, Oculus
      Optikgerate GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, software version 1.14r04 ) measurements, acceptable
      maps had at least 10.0mm of corneal coverage. Moreover, images with extrapolated data in the
      central 9.0mm zone were excluded.

      For both anterior and posterior corneal surfaces, Pentacam-derived HOAs parameters for both
      pupil diameters of 4mm and 6mm were calculated, as well as the HOA root mean square
      (RMS)values. Pentacam-derived HOA measurements were obtained one day prior to treatment and
      then one year post-op.The impact of the surgical technique (either CXL or tCXL) on
      spherocylindrical error was evaluated by power vector analysis as described before.
      Furthermore, manifest refractions comprising of sphere (S), cylinder (C) and axis (Ï†), were
      converted into three dioptric powers (M, J0 and J45). Moreover, we calculated the overall
      blurring strength (B) of the spherocylindrical error by measuring the length of the produced
      vector.
