        1. Determine whether belimumab used in combination with MMF is safe and tolerable in the
           treatment of patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (Disease duration
           < 3 years).

        2. Determine whether belimumab used in combination with MMF is more effective in the
           treatment of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis than MMF alone, as measured by change
           in modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), forced vital capacity (FVC), hemoglobin corrected
           diffusion capacity (DLCO), Medsger Severity Scale (MSS), and by other physician and
           patient derived outcome measures.

        3. Determine the biological activity of Belimumab/MMF as assessed by effect on histology of
           skin, change in B-Cell profiles, effect on BLyS levels, and effect on serological and
           cutaneous biomarkers of disease activity.
