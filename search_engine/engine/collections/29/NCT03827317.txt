      Primary:

        -  To determine the uptake in tumour lesions and normal tissue of [18F]GE-226 and compare
           the difference between patients with HER2 positive and HER2 negative lesions. Uptake
           will be quantified by semi-quantitative (SUV, AUC) and fully quantitative parameters (Ki
           in the case of irreversible uptake, and binding potential in the case of reversible
           uptake)

        -  To determine the optimal imaging time point for [18F]GE-226

      Secondary:

        -  To determine the safety and toxicity of [18F]GE-226 PET in humans

        -  To determine if [18F]GE-226 can distinguish between HER2 amplified and HER2
           non-amplified breast tumours

        -  To determine the metabolism of [18F]GE-226 in human subjects

      Exploratory:

      • To explore circulating biomarkers that may be related to [18F]GE-226 uptake and to
      investigate if treatment modulates [18F]GE-226

      Endpoints

      Secondary:

        -  Safety and toxicity of [18F]GE-226 measured by adverse events from administration of
           [18F]GE-226 injection throughout the study period, and clinically significant changes
           from baseline measurements in serum biochemistry, haematology, coagulation, immunology,
           urinalysis, vital signs, ECG, injection site and physical examination findings.

        -  The association between [18F]GE-226 tumour uptake and standard HER2 pathological testing
           (HER2 amplified and HER2 non-amplified breast tumours)

        -  Proportion of metabolised [18F]GE-226 at scheduled time-points compared to baseline

        -  Normal tissue uptake of [18F]GE-226 will be quantified in the appropriate regions
           depending on the field of view.

      Exploratory:

      • To perform preliminary biodistribution analysis, to compare [18F]GE- 226 uptake to [18F]FDG
      uptake in tumour lesion
