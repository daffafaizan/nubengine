      intravenous infusions of autologous volume and red blood cell reduced nucleated umbilical
      cord blood cells as compared with placebo in neonates with neonatal encephalopathy undergoing
      hypothermia treatment. Efficacy will be estimated by one year survival and score on Bayley
      III scores in all three domains equal to or greater than 85. This will be a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled multi-site trial of up to 160 infants who qualify for
      cooling.
