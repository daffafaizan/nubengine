      life. The investigators aim to investigate the effects of laser acupuncture therapy for
      patients with dry eye.

      Methods: 200 subjects with dry eye are enrolled at two ophthalmic centers and randomly
      assigned to a laser acupuncture group and control group under conventional treatment with
      artificial tears. The subjects are treated at acupoints including BL2, TE23, ST2, LI4, ST36,
      and GB37 using verum or sham laser acupuncture during 3 sessions per week. After 4 and 12
      weeks of treatment, the differences in the Tear film break-up time, Schirmer test, visual
      analogue scale, Ocular Surface Disease Index of the patients are analyzed, and compared
      between the laser acupuncture and control groups using paired t-test and one way ANOVA.
