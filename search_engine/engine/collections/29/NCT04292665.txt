      promising for physiological parameters such as respiratory rate, pulse, blood pressure in
      heart failure patients. On the other hand, research examining effects of these approaches on
      physical symptom status that is including dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue, chest pain, peripheral
      edema, sleep problems and dizziness and quality of life is limited. The present study
      investigates the effects of classical massage and Benson relaxation exercise in a
      single-site, 3-arm, randomized, controlled study of 96 patients with heart failure. Arm 1:
      Classical massage; Arm 2: Benson relaxation exercise; Arm 3: Control. The investigators
      hypothesize that Classical Massage and Benson relaxation exercise will decrease frequency,
      severity, discomfort of symptoms and improve quality of life.
