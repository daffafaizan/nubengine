      Aim 1: Determine insulin secretion and sensitivity in subjects with MAS-associated diabetes.

      Aim 2: Measure gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in MAS-associated diabetes to investigate a
      potential role for excess glucagon signaling.

      Aim 3: Determine if IPMN development is associated with impairment of insulin secretion prior
      to development of overt diabetes.

      The authors expect that this study will:

        1. Establish the etiology of diabetes in FD/MAS

        2. Increase understanding of the role of IPMNs in pathogenesis of diabetes

        3. Provide critical insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes in FD/MAS
