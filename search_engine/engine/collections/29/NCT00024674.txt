      continuous intravenous infusion.

      II. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 given by
      continuous intravenous infusion for ten days in patients with advanced malignancies.

      III. Evaluate response of selected advanced malignancies to continuous intravenous infusion
      of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 for ten days at doses near the MTD.

      IV. Characterize the plasma kinetics of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 administered by continuous intravenous
      infusion.

      V. Determine the appearance of serum antibody to SS1(dsFv)-PE38.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: To exclude immediate allergic hypersensitivity reaction, each patient will
      receive a test dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38, and be observed for 30 minutes prior to receiving the
      continuous infusion on Day 1 of each treatment course. Each treatment will be given by
      continuous intravenous infusion for ten days. After the first 24 hours of infusion, at the
      Investigator's discretion, patients will be allowed to leave the hospital on day pass per NCI
      policies. After the end of infusion patients will be observed overnight. The first patient at
      each dose level must be observed for development of toxicity for at least 14 days after the
      beginning of treatment before additional patients are enrolled. At least three patients will
      be accrued at each dose level. Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.
