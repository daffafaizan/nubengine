    
      Patients with middle or low rectal cancer who have T3-4 and/ or N+ will be included. Patients
      will receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation in the form of pelvic irradiation by 50.4 thousands
      grays together with radio sensitization by 5-FU or oxaliplatin, 8 months after completion of
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation patients will be assessed clinically and radiologically. Complete
      clinical response is diagnosed if clinically no tumor is felt or just small scar and no tumor
      appears in MRI. Of these patients who achieve complete clinical response we will pick up
      cases who have split scar sign in the pelvic MRI. Patients will have total mesorectal
      excision 8-11 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and pathologic complete
      response will be assessed. Correlation will be done between preoperative clinical response
      and postoperative pathologic response
