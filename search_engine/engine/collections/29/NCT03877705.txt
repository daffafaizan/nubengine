      tablets versus xylitol chewing gum with bedridden geriatric patients ,as an alternative to
      tooth brushing and mouth rinsing, in increasing salivary pH and decreasing bacterial count in
      both saliva and interdental plaque.plaque and salivary sampling will be taken in certain time
      ,at baseline T0, then after 5minutes T1, then at 15 days T3. Salivary pH will be measured by
      using pH meter and streptococcus mutans bacterial count will be calculated through culture in
      mitis salivarius bacitracin
