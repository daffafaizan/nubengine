      28%. Behavioral "nudges" may increase the effectiveness of immunization reminder mailers at
      little or no added cost. Past psychology research has demonstrated that prompting people to
      form an implementation plan of the form, "When situation x arises, I will implement response
      y," increases attainment of desired goals because the desired behavior is linked to a
      concrete future moment. We study whether adding a planning prompt to a vaccination reminder
      mailer increases immunization rates.
