    
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, phase 2 study to assess safety and immunogenicity of
      Panblok H7 vaccine at three antigen dose levels (3.75, 7.5, and 15 Î¼g) adjuvanted with AS03
      or MF59. The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and ability of the
      recombinant Panblok H7 influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 or MF59 to generate an immune
      response after 2 doses separated by 28 days in healthy males and nonpregnant females, aged 18
      to 49 years, inclusive. The expected study duration is approximately 13.5 months per
      participant.
