      improvement in magnetic resonance (MR)-imaging techniques have stimulated a renewed interest
      to the question whether in patients with complete or good response the overall benefits of a
      'wait-and-see policy' or transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) combined with intensive
      follow-up may outweigh the benefits associated with conventional surgery (total mesorectal
      excision (TME) or abdominoperineal resection (APR)). On the one hand, less invasive
      strategies will expose subjects to more diagnostic procedures and possibly a slightly higher
      risk of local failure and the need for salvage surgery. On the other hand, mortality and
      morbidity associated with radical surgery (e.g. anastomotic leakage, relaparotomy, wound and
      pelvic infection, chronic wound healing disturbances, abscess, colostomy, faecal or urinary
      incontinence and sexual dysfunction) can be avoided. The investigators believe that
      wait-and-see policy for complete responders and TEM for good responders after chemoradiation
      is a feasible alternative to standard surgery, provided these patients are intensively
      followed.
