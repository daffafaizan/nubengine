      photodynamic therapy versus only photodynamic therapy on aqueous humor vascular endothelial
      growth factor level in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy patients to establish the vascular
      endothelial growth factor expression after photodynamic therapy and the direct effect of
      Lucentis™ on this increased vascular endothelial growth factor level. Additionally the
      investigators want to examine the vascular endothelial growth factor , tumor necrosis factor
      alpha, interleukin-2, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 level of aqueous humor in symptomatic,
      active polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy patients.
