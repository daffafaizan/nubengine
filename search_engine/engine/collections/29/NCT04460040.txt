      and women (n=8) aged 21 to 45 years will exercise for 3 months in a moderate intensity
      regimen of 20 kcal/week/kg body weight that reflects current recommendations for weight
      management. The volume of various organs will be measured pre- and post-exercise intervention
      using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A cycling ergometer with a varied workload will be
      used to assess muscle metabolic efficiency. Changes in overnight SMR and 4 hours post
      breakfast DIT will be evaluated by whole human room indirect calorimetry ("metabolic
      chamber"). In addition, free-living Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) will be measured for ten
      days pre- and post-intervention by doubly labeled water.
