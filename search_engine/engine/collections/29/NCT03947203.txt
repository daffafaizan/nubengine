      pilot study will be conducted with adolescents and their parents in the greater Richmond
      area, including Petersburg, and examines whether disseminating oral health information to
      adolescents via Facebook will have a greater impact on their sharing of the message to their
      parents than providing them the information in written format- using a pamphlet. We
      hypothesize that parents in the Facebook arm of the intervention will be more likely to
      report receiving the oral health message from their child than those in the pamphlet arm.
      Further, this study investigates whether parents whose adolescents re provided the
      information via Facebook will have greater increase in intent to schedule dental appointments
      and dental appointment scheduling behaviors than parents whose children are in the pamphlet
      group. We hypothesize that parents in the Facebook group will report greater increase in
      dental appointment scheduling than those whose adolescents are in the pamphlet group. Lastly,
      we would like to explore whether parents and adolescents in the Facebook arm will have
      greater increase in oral health knowledge and greater decreases in perceived barriers to oral
      health activities, both which may be related to increases in parents' dental appointment
      scheduling.
