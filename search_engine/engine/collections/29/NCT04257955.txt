      the disease already at an advanced stage and without a progressive approach to it. The
      clinical interview in which the diagnosis and the first information regarding treatment
      options and prognosis are communicated assumes a strong relevance, since it is an unexpected
      diagnosis with a poor prognosis.

      Doctor-patient communication is an integral part of the care itself and poses the basis for
      the construction of the therapeutic alliance, an essential condition for compliance of the
      patient with reference to the treatments proposed by the physician.

      Many recent studies claim that a good level of patient engagement is an essential condition
      for building a solid therapeutic alliance; in this regard, objective measurement scales of
      the patient engagement level have been developed, and have been demonstrated to be useful for
      quantifying the patient's involvement within the care process Among them is the Patient
      Health Engagement Scale (PHE-SÂ®)-Scale, a recently validated assessment scale of simple and
      non-invasive use, that requires only the administration of a questionnaire to the previously
      informed patient who gives his consent.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the clarity of the communication between the treating
      physician and the patient, and the level of understanding by the patient of the information
      conveyed by the doctor, in particular at the time of diagnosis largely influences the
      construction of a solid therapeutic alliance between the treating physician and PDAC patients
      and consequently the patient's engagement and compliance in the care process.

      Our hypothesis is that the clarity of the communication between the treating physician and
      the patient and the degree of comprehension by the patient, especially during the first
      phases of the cure, are associated with the level of engagement and consequently with the
      compliance of patients with PDAC.

      If the present pilot study will support the initial hypothesis, further action to improve the
      clarity of the clinical communication will be promoted.
