      About one in six hospital inpatients suffer Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), also called acute
      renal failure. About a third of patients with AKI die. The large majority of patients with
      AKI are managed by doctors who are not kidney experts. Effective AKI advice and treatments
      are available but not currently integrated into routine care. A recent National review of the
      care of patients who died from AKI showed poor management of many patients. Early diagnosis
      of AKI can avoid complications, dialysis (which affects the quality of life of patients, and
      is costly) or death. AKI is diagnosed by a change in a blood test. We have developed computer
      software to diagnose AKI earlier. It sends a warning or 'Alert' about the test to our team of
      kidney experts. We will further develop the settings of the Alert system. It needs to send an
      Alert for the right patients. We will also study the best way to make clinicians pay
      attention to their patients who are developing AKI. When our expert Outreach team receive an
      Alert, they will call the doctor or nurse looking after the patient with AKI. We will advise
      on the best treatment for that patient, to reduce their risk of death, dialysis and other
      complications. We will do a pilot study in one large hospital, to further develop the system,
      and check it reduces the risk of death or complications from AKI. We will use this work to
      develop a larger trial of this new system of care for patients with AKI in different
      hospitals. This will convince the wider NHS of the need to change, and show how to prevent or
      reduce AKI. Ultimately we aim to improve patients' lives by reducing avoidable death and
      illness from AKI , and also save the NHS money.
