      Primary

        -  To identify genetic variation, as measured by single nucleotide polymorphisms, that is
           associated with musculoskeletal adverse events in specimens from postmenopausal women
           with hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant aromatase
           inhibitors and enrolled on clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MA27.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      DNA from tumor tissue and blood specimens that have been previously collected from patients
      are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms.
