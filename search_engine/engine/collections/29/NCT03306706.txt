    
      A randomized, controlled, cross-over study designed to examine the postprandial glycaemic
      response and appetite related sensations to peas in muffins will be conducted at the I.H.
      Asper Clinical Research Institute in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Eligible participants who have
      provided consent will be asked to attend 4 clinic visits in a fasted state. Participants will
      be given muffins containing peas at 2 visits and muffins without peas at 2 visits. At each
      visit participants will provide 7 venous blood samples via indwelling catheter, 7 capillary
      blood samples via finger poke, 2 urine samples, 5 questionnaires about their appetite and a
      questionnaire about the acceptability of the products. At the end of each visit, participants
      will eat pizza ad libitum, and the amount of pizza consumed will be measured to determine if
      the peas influenced the amount of calories consumed at lunch. Participants will record their
      food/beverage intake for the rest of the day. Each visit will last approximately 3h and be
      separated by 3-14 days.
