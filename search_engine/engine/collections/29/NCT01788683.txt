    
      Prospective, randomized, controlled to include 34 subjects treated with Regenexx SD and 17
      subjects treated with Exercise Therapy alone (2:1 randomization).

      Subjects will have a non-retracted supraspinatus tendon tear comprising at least one half the
      tendon thickness in the anterior-posterior and/or superior-inferior planes as evidenced with
      positive diagnostic imaging such as arthrogram, ultrasound and/or MR.

      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to Regenexx-SD injection or initiation of
      exercise therapy and take part in follow-up visits for two years following treatment. A
      preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment; follow-up visits will occur at the
      clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post injection.

      The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted once all subjects reach the 3 month endpoint.
      At that point, subjects enrolled in the Exercise Therapy group will be given the option of
      crossing over to the Regenexx SD treatment groups. Subjects will continue to be followed
      through the 2 year endpoint with data analysis performed at the 1 year and 2 year time
      points.

      Subjects will complete the study following the 2 year follow-up visit.
