      coronary intervention (PCI). Blood samples will be taken just before the procedure and one
      day after the procedure and analysed on Multiplate function analyser. Assessing aspirin and
      clopidogrel resistance incidence using Multiplate platelet function analyzer we will also try
      to find resistance correlation with the incidence of major adverse cardiac events in a one
      year follow up.
