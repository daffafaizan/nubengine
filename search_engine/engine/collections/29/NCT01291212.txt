      follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) on folliculogenesis. Our previous clinical studies
      demonstrated the usefulness of pretreatment with transdermal testosterone in low-responder
      IVF patients.

      There is controversy on the usefulness of recombinant luteinizing hormone (LHr) added to FSHr
      in ovarian stimulation of low responder patients. Thus, our present study has been designed
      to compare ovarian stimulation with FSHr alone versus LHr added to FSHr when transdermal
      testosterone pretreatment is used.
