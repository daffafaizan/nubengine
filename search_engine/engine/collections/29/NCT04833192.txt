      of adrenal incidentaloma (AIs) has been increasing and now approaches the 8.7% incidence
      reported in autopsy series. subclinical hypercortisolism (SH) is noted in up to 30% of
      patients with adrenal incidentalomas. Several groups have reported adverse clinical sequelae
      in individuals with SH, with recent studies highlighting an increase in cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. Accurate exclusion or
      confirmation of a diagnosis of SH is therefore a key step in the investigation and management
      of patients with AIs. Suppressed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and low
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels are frequently found in SH patients. Present
      study added new evidence for the limitations of ACTH and confirmed the usefulness of DHEAS
      for the detection of SH especially with unsuppressed ACTH in AI patients. On one hand, in the
      cross-sectional study, biometric measurements and sex hormones (including DHEAS, 24h-UFC,
      ACTH and cortisol) are analysed to explore the differences among SH patients, and
      nonfunctional adrenal adenoma patients. One the other hand, in the longitudinal study,
      changes in DHEAS, ACTH and cortisol in SH with surgical management and SH with conservative
      management both at baseline and different follow-up months after their different treatment
      management are collected to explore the changes of DHEAS and ACTH of SH patients.
