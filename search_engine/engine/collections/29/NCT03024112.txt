      the rate of post-operative pulmonary complications in thoracic surgical patients. The
      Investigators hypothesis is that prophylactic HFNC oxygen, as compared to standard oxygen
      treatment, will reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, improve
      post-operative pulmonary function, and reduce ICU and hospital length of stay.
