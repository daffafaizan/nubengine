      (LT-BWST) used progressively increased speed each week. Novel (discrete) robot-assisted
      LT-BWST used progressive decrease in speed. The novel approach of slowing down the treadmill
      reduced momentum. If speed had been increased (standard approach), momentum would have
      increased (momentum = mass * velocity); and the resulting, passive propulsion of momentum
      would have diminished the role of cortical skills needed to plan, initiate, and overtly
      control gait. In sum, the novel protocol used a slower-than-standard treadmill speed in order
      to provide a window of time sufficient for the corticomotor system to process information,
      learn, and adjust its response to internal and external feedback (eg, proprioceptive input;
      therapist input) during robot-assisted LT-BWST.
