      pathogenesis remains unknown, and few studies have assessed chronic pain as the primary aim
      of the study. Lidocaine infusion could be a possible approach to reducing the prevalence of
      chronic pain after herniotomy. Recently, a meta-analysis concluded a modest but statistically
      significant reduction of pain severity in the first four postoperative hours measured by the
      visual analogue scale (mean difference, -0.84; 95% CI, -1.10 to -0.59). However, a more
      recent meta-analysis found that only limited clinical data and biological plausibility
      support lidocaine infusions for the prevention of postoperative persistent pain (odds ratio,
      0.29; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.48). This study was designed to investigate whether lidocaine
      infusion after inguinal herniotomy would lower the incidence of chronic postoperative pain.
