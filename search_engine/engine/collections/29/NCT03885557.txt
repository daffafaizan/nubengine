    
      This was a single blind randomized control trial conducted at District Head Quarter teaching
      hospital Sargodha, Sargodha institute of health sciences Sargodha, Sadiq hospital Sargodha
      (march 2018-June 2018). Sample size of 83 individuals was calculated through Open Epi tool
      version 3 with 95 % confidence interval (CI), and power 80%. 83 individuals were screened out
      on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals of this selected population
      were randomly allocated as 42 individuals in Dynamic Oscillatory Stretch(DOS) group and 41
      individuals in Static Stretching(SS) group by sealed envelope method.

      After the application of hot pack treatment of 7-10 minutes to both groups dynamic
      oscillatory stretch technique (30 repetitions each of 2 seconds stretch duration in one
      session) was applied to DOS group and SS stretching (2 repetitions each of 30 seconds in one
      session) was applied to SS group.

      Assessment was done at baseline, immediate post-intervention levels (immediately) and
      post-intervention level after 1 hour. At baseline and immediately post-intervention level
      there was no dropout but after 1 hour post-intervention level there were two dropouts from
      DOS group and 1 dropout from SS group. 40 individuals were analyzed in each DOS and SS group.
      Data analysis was done through Statistical Package of Social Sciences(SPSS) version 20.
      Normality of different variables was assessed. Shapiro-Wilk test provided the basis for
      normality distribution of data.
