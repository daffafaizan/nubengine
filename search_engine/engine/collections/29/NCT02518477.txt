      in this study is to examine if lymphedema can be prevented with early progressive strength
      training focusing on the arm, and close monitoring of pre clinical lymphedema in the 1 year
      exercise period. The primary outcome is lymphedema, and secondary outcomes are pain,
      self-reported symptoms of swelling, sensory disturbance, physical and psychological
      functioning, fatigue, depression, anxiety and health related quality of life.

      158 patients operated for breast cancer with axillary node dissection, will be invited from
      three hospitals in Denmark, Sealand (Rigshospitalet, Ringsted Hospital, and Herlev Hospital),
      while on the surgical wards. Two weeks later upon consent they are recruited, baseline tested
      and randomized to either exercise intervention or usual care control.

      The exercise intervention consists of progressive resistance training, combined with a
      stretching programme, with a total duration of 60 minutes per session. The group attend
      supervised exercises twice a week and a once weekly home exercise programme of 45 to 60
      minutes duration. After 20 weeks, exercises are converted to home exercises, and they are
      monitored by a weekly sms-service. At 12 months, follow-up measurements are taken for both
      groups. Lymphedema is defined as 3% limb volume change from the baseline measurement.
