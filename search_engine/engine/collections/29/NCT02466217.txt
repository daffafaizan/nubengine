    
      The family of inflammatory/autoimmune systemic diseases (IAD) represents a large group of
      human diseases. For most if not all of these IAD, the pathophysiological processes or exact
      causes remain poorly understood. Progresses in molecular understanding of these IAD have led
      to realize that these are not two distinct categories of diseases. Rather they form a
      continuum from pure inflammatory diseases to pure autoimmune diseases, encompassing a large
      panel of inflammatory diseases with some autoimmune components, and vice versa.

      Using systems biology, the investigator aims to improve the understanding of these diseases,
      to identify novel genes/pathways involved, specific or across the diseases, and to discover
      biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.

      The investigator will study adult patients with at least one of the following IAD: Rheumatoid
      Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus/Antiphospholipid Syndrome,
      Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) /Tumor
      Necrosis Factor-receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), Vasculitis, Uveitis, Myositis,
      Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative colitis, Type 1 Diabetes. This panel will be completed by
      controls groups: healthy volunteers, and patients with arthritis (knee and/or hip) or
      muscular dystrophy.

      The biological investigations will notably comprise: immunomics (comprehensive evaluation of
      peripheral blood cell subsets and serum immunoproteomics, including autoantibodies);
      transcriptomics; Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-phenotyping; genomics; T-Cell Receptor (TCR)
      sequencing and microbiota studies.

      After signing the informed consent, the subject attends only one visit (Day 0) during which
      all biological samples will be taken and all clinical information collected.
