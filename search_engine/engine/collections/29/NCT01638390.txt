    
      This is a prospective multi-center clinical trial in which a total of 360 eyes of consecutive
      subjects will be enrolled, treated with the VisuMaxâ„¢ Femtosecond Laser, and followed for a
      12-month period. The study will be conducted at up to 8 clinical sites.

      Enrollment will be phased such that 100 eyes will be initially enrolled and followed. When 50
      of the initial eyes have reached the 3-month follow-up exam, an interim clinical study report
      will be submitted to FDA along with a request to continue enrollment up to 360 eyes.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility, and informed consent will be obtained from those
      who meet screening criteria and are interested in participating in the study. Eligible
      subjects will be examined preoperatively to obtain a medical history and to establish a
      baseline ocular condition. Baseline and postoperative measurements will include manifest
      refraction, cycloplegic refraction, distance visual acuity (best corrected and uncorrected),
      slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, corneal topography, central corneal pachymetry,
      mesopic pupil measurement, wavefront analysis, mesopic contrast sensitivity, and intraocular
      pressure (IOP).
