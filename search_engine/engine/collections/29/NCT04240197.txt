    
      40 patients who had an epidural functioning catheter previously positioned for anesthesia or
      analgesia will be enrolled. After removing the epidural filter and after having zeroed the
      instrument, the investigator will connect in a random fashion sequence, a standard pressure
      transducer attached to a standard invasive blood pressure monitor or to the CompuFlo
      CathCheck instrument to observe and record the occurrence of epidural pulsatile waveform.

      The investigator will also note and evaluate:

      The volume of saline priming necessary to obtain the waveform The effects of patient's
      position on the occurrence and amplitude of epidural pulsatile waveform
