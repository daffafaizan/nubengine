      who experiences a rising level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after initial treatment is
      increasing, affecting approximately 50,000 patients each year.

      These three drugs are commercially available. Thalidomide is an angiogenesis inhibitor which
      blocks the development of new blood vessels. GM-CSF stimulates the body's immune response to
      fight cancer. Docetaxel is the most active chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of
      prostate cancer. GM-CSF and thalidomide have proven activity in suppressing PSA values.

      This study design offers an opportunity to add cytotoxic therapy (docetaxel) in combination
      with an active pathobiologic regimen (GM-CSF plus thalidomide) to eradicate micrometastatic
      disease, thus potentially offering a significant delay to clinical failure as measured by a
      rise in PSA or radiographic involvement. Additionally, delays in the use of hormone therapy
      has the potential to be of significant benefit.

      GM-CSF will be administered at a fixed dose 3 days per week by subcutaneous injection for 12
      months. Participants will receive a fixed dose of thalidomide orally at bedtime daily without
      interruption for 12 months. Docetaxel will be administered intravenously over 1 hour on week
      1 of every cycle (every 3 weeks) for 18 weeks.
