      around 11% of the population globally. Several factors have been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of IBS, including psychological stress, gastrointestinal motility, and diet.
      More recently, it has become clear that the gastrointestinal microbiota may play a critical
      role in the pathophysiology of this functional GI condition.

      Gut microbiome manipulation, for example through the use of probiotic and prebiotic
      supplements, has shown some promise in the treatment of IBS. However, the research in this
      area is still in its infancy, and it remains unclear what type of intervention that is the
      preferred choice in cases of IBS. Many, if not most, probiotic supplements on the market
      today contain bacteria that are incapable of colonizing the human gut, which may partly
      explain why the health effects associated with the use of probiotics tend to be temporary,
      rather than permanent.

      Several studies have investigated how the use of probiotic supplements containing
      Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli affect the clinical outcome of patients with IBS. However, to
      date, no studies have assessed whether fermented vegetables, a "natural" source of probiotic
      bacteria, are useful in the treatment of IBS. Moreover, little is known about how other types
      of probiotic bacteria, such as those belonging to the genus Escherichia, affect symptoms of
      IBS.
