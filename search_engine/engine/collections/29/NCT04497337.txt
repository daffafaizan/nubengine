      patients with superficial lesions around the auricle, i.e., periauricular (preauricular,
      auricular, and postauricular) during the period extending between 2017 and 2019, who were
      primarily diagnosed and operated. Data were retrieved, reviewed, and analyzed. The primary
      analysis outcome measures were patient history (age, gender, complaint, medical advice
      clinic, and associated medical diseases), lesions examination (site, laterality, clinical
      presentation, and the number of lesions). Also, the needed investigations for diagnosis, type
      of intervention, postoperative patient satisfaction were evaluated. Evaluation of the
      patients' follow up was done.
