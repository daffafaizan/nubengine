      waveforms. Originally the piston-driven mechanical ventilators generated a quasi-sinusoidal
      flow waveform, whereas the newer electronically controlled ventilators can also produce
      constant and decelerating waveforms. According to several theoretical,animal and clinical
      studies,the inspiratory flow waveform affects the distribution of the inspired gas as well as
      respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. However, other studies failed to show any significant
      effect.But there is no study interested to the effects of inspiratory flow waveforms on
      cardiac preload. Thus, the clinical usefulness of inspiratory flow pattern manipulation
      remains unclear, though the capacity for selection of different inspiratory flow waveforms is
      provided by most modern, microprocessor-equipped ventilators. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study was to compare the effects of flow patterns (sinusoidal, constant and decelerating) on
      dynamic measurements of cardiac preload dependence such as arterial pulse pressure variation
      (Î”PP) and distensibility index of the inferior vena cava (dIVC).
