      completed. The de-identified CT Scan data will be transferred to the Clemson University
      Bioengineering Department, and a 3D modeling software will convert it to a computer model
      that will then be 3D printed. During the doctor-patient pre-operative consultation, the 3D
      Printed model will be used to assist the doctor in describing the patient's pathology and
      upcoming surgical procedure. In this pilot study, the surgeon will make measurements and
      estimates of resection for the femoroplasty and acetabuloplasty off of 2D CT scan, MRI, and
      x-rays. This will then be compared quantitatively to the results of the 3D model/3D printing
      measurements. Surgeon debriefings will occur postoperatively to determine the benefit of the
      model and how well it matched up to what the surgeon experienced during the surgery.

      FAI involves complex anatomic morphology which can be unique to each patient. A thorough
      understanding of the type and specifically location of impingement is paramount to successful
      results if surgery is required. 2D imaging has limitations when analyzing a 3D anatomic
      lesion. 3D printed hip models have the potential to provide superior preoperative planning
      and subsequent surgical results. In addition, 3D models can potentially improve patient
      understanding, expectations, and outcomes.
