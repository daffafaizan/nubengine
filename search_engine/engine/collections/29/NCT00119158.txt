      cream BID versus fluticasone cream daily and placebo cream BID for the treatment of acute
      flares of atopic dermatitis.

      While pimecrolimus cream 1% has been proven to be effective in mild and moderate Atopic
      dermatitis (AD), there is a need for a fast control of severe skin lesions. On the other
      hand, reducing the duration of the topical corticosteroid treatment is a reasonable approach
      to minimize the occurrence of adverse effects.

      Because pimecrolimus and topical corticosteroids exert their activity by different
      mechanisms, there may be a synergistic effect of the combination therapy. Therefore, a
      combination therapy may provide a faster resolution of severe skin lesions and consequently
      reduce the duration of the topical corticosteroid treatment. Another benefit of the
      combination therapy maybe the use of a lower potency corticosteroid to achieve the same
      degree of clearance.

      In vitro data have demonstrated that a combination of steroids and tacrolimus has synergistic
      effects on in vitro human lymphocyte proliferation. In addition, it has previously been
      reported, in a pilot investigation in two subjects, that a combination regimen of
      pimecrolimus 1% twice a day and fluticasone propionate cream 0.05% once daily was superior to
      fluticasone propionate cream 0.05% once daily in the acute treatment of atopic dermatitis
      (AD).

      This study is conducted to validate these findings in a larger number of patients.
