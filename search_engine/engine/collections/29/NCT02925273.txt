      response in patients with dementia or suspected frontal lobe dysfunction. The proposed study
      is to perform two techniques to elicit grasp response in patients with dementia or suspected
      frontal lobe dysfunction and observe the presence or absence of the response and prominence
      of the response on a proposed rating scale. Future goals will be aimed at aiding clinicians
      in refining their clinical techniques to be more sensitive for diagnosing frontal lobe
      dysfunctions.
