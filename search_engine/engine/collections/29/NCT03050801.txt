      modulation by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in paradigms intended to
      improve memory and learning. Ancillary outcomes include the effects of rTMS on the
      interaction between the explicit implicit memory systems.

      Study population: Healthy adult volunteers

      Design: The study contains two experiments. Experiment 1 is designed to establish the number
      of rTMS sessions required to produce a meaningful change in resting parieto-hippocampal FC in
      healthy subjects. Experiment 2 will replicate a prior experiment which used rTMS to enhance
      the explicit memory system in healthy subjects, and look for potential effects on the
      implicit system. This intervention will be contrasted with a negative control condition
      (vertex stimulation) in a between-groups design.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the change in FC produced by serially
      applied rTMS and improvement in explicit memory. We will explore whether enhancement of the
      explicit system has effects on resting state connectivity in the implicit system and whether
      white matter integrity predicts changes in FC in healthy subjects.
