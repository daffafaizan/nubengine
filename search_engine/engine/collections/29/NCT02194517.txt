      106 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients will be randomly assigned
      into two groups: the group A (n=53) using ELKa system for food exchange counting and the
      group B (n= 53) using standard method.

      The glycated hemoglobin levels will be measured in both groups at the beginning, after 3 and
      6 months of observation. The group A also will be asked about the frequency of using the
      toolset. We will also assess secondary endpoints (mentioned below).
