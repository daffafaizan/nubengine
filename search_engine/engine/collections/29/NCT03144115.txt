      the rewarding effect of compliment to women in a romantic context.

      The study employs a double-blind, within-subject, placebo-control design. Women will be
      administered with the same drug twice (oxytocin or placebo) respectively the fertile and
      luteal phase followed by a MRI scanning. During fMRI participants will rate men's attraction
      based on their facial pictures of average attractiveness associated with compliments of
      different combination of form and topic. Each male face will be paired with two sentences of
      the same kind. After the fMRI participants will recall the judgment followed by a memory test
      during which they have to indicate whether the they have seen the face during scanning (old)
      or whether it is an unknown face (new).
