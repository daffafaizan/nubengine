      with high-dose cytarabine plus a single high dose of idarubicin in patients with previously
      untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). II. Identify cytogenetic, molecular, or
      immunophenotypic markers in AML patients for use in the study of residual disease.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive high dose cytarabine for 5 days and idarubicin on the third day
      as induction chemotherapy. Patients who achieve a complete remission (CR) proceed to
      consolidation chemotherapy, as follows: cytarabine and etoposide for 5 days; and, for
      patients aged 60 and under, cytarabine for 4 days, with idarubicin on the third day. Patients
      eligible for the second consolidation course may have peripheral blood stem cells collected
      following this regimen. Patients with an HLA-compatible donor then proceed to allogeneic bone
      marrow transplantation, while patients over age 60, those with the t(8;21) or inv16
      cytogenetic abnormality, and those without an HLA-compatible donor receive maintenance
      therapy with the humanized monoclonal antibody M195 twice weekly for 3 weeks, then monthly
      for 5 months. G-CSF is administered with each chemotherapy regimen. Patients are followed for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be entered over 3 years.
