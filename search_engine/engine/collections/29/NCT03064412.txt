      progesterones (the main female sex hormones and the most important in menstrual ,
      reproductive cycles and pregnancy) . However there is little information about androgens in
      pregnant women. It is known that certain illnesses, chemicals and dietary products might
      change the amount of androgen and its actions, which could affect the mother and her baby. It
      is also known that there are differences between the androgen levels in different people, and
      in different ethnic groups. These differences are mostly due to genetic factors. The goal of
      this study is to learn about the androgen levels in healthy pregnant women and if genetic or
      clinical factors (for example age, trimester of pregnancy, parity, ethnicity, etc.) play a
      role in changing the androgen amount and action, throughout pregnancy and after delivery.
