      (LLS-ICP) is superior to treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of psychotic symptoms of
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The investigators hypothesize that
      the LLS-ICP will be superior to TAU and result in 1.higher rates of response, 2. shorter
      times to response, 3. less side effects, 4. and better functional outcomes. The LLS-ICP study
      will be the first randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy of an ICP in patients
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in this region. If successful, it will lead to
      the development of new and innovative approaches to health care delivery to patients with
      chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder not just within this institution but also
      at other sites in the community. The nature of ICPs as algorithmic and systematic in
      providing assessments and treatments render them ideal to be disseminated to medical practice
      outside of the institution of where they have been developed. These settings can include
      primary care clinics, supportive living environments, and long-term care homes where patients
      with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder are being cared for.
