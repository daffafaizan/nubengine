    
      The Lung and Heart meridians are chosen as two specific studied meridians. 120 participants
      will be enrolled and divided into the healthy control group, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) group and healthy intervention group. Laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) will be
      used to assess the microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomena for the Heart and
      Lung meridians. The site specificity for the meridian-visceral association will be
      investigated by comparing the microcirculatory difference between the Heart and Lung
      meridians in the healthy control group and COPD group. Besides, participants in the healthy
      intervention group will receive two sessions of moxibustion in the Heart meridian and Lung
      meridian respectively to explore the site specificity for the surface-surface association.
