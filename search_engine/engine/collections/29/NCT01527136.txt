      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CBLB502
      (entolimod) in patients with advanced cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess any preliminary evidence of efficacy with the CBLB502 in patients with advanced
      cancers.

      II. To evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of CBLB502 in patients
      with advanced cancers.

      III. To characterize the effect, if any, of intramuscular or subcutaneous CBLB502 on QTcB.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate pre-treatment tissue expression of toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) with clinical
      activity (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] tumor response) and PD
      response (as measured by cytokine levels) of CBLB502.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive entolimod intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 and subcutaneously (SC) on days 4,
      8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
