    
      This is a Phase 3 study aimed at investigating the effects of a personalized exercise program
      (PEP) in NSCLC patients (stage I, II, IIIa) and secondary lung cancer patients undergoing
      surgical treatment at the University of Utah and comparing the intervention to the current
      standard of care (no exercise program).

      Eligible patients will be randomized between two arms (1:1 ratio) prior to the surgery and
      will be followed for approximately 6 months post-surgery:

        -  An Intervention Arm (referred to in materials as Group 1) which features pre- and
           post-surgery PEP interventions.

        -  A Control Arm (referred to in materials as Group 2) which does not include a
           personalized exercise program (the standard of care). Patients randomized to the Control
           Arm will be given the opportunity to participate in a PEP-intervention session providing
           exercise counseling after the 6 month assessment and will receive a free activity
           tracker for their participation.
