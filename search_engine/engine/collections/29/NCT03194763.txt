      prescribed a coronary angiography CT as part of their follow up for a known or suspected
      coronary artery anomaly.

      Computed Tomography acquisitions are performed on a Revolution CT (GE Healthcare) using a
      wide detector aperture (160 mm), last generation of iterative reconstruction algorithm and
      specific reconstruction software reducing cardiac motion artefacts. A rotation time of 0.28
      sec is used, with a slice thickness of 0.625 mm and a 0.625 mm reconstruction interval. The
      acquisition is ECG-gated (prospective) with kV and mAs depending on BMI, heart rate and heart
      rate variability of patients.
