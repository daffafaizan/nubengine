    
      This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label study comparing the OmezaÂ® Products Bundle
      versus standard of care treatments for 2 different types of chronic ulcers (venous leg ulcers
      and diabetic foot ulcers). The treatment period will be 12 weeks, with subjects coming into
      the study site weekly for evaluations, photography and formal measurements of the target
      wound, and dressing changes. There will be a total of 13 study site visits. The Screening
      Visit (Day 0) will occur 1 week prior to randomization and will include routine labs and
      vascular assessment to determine inclusion/exclusion of the potential subject from the study;
      followed by weekly treatment visits (Week 1 through Week 11); randomization will occur at
      Treatment Visit Week 1; the Treatment Visit Week 12/End of Study Visit will include end of
      study labs. Target wounds will be photographed and measured, and vascular assessment will be
      done at each of the 13 visits.

      If the wound closes before Week 12, the subject will continue to come in for all the
      remaining study visits until study completion. If the wound does not close by Week 12, the
      subject will be immediately exited from the study and no further follow-up will occur as part
      of the study.
