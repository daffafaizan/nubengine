      energy metabolism, contribute to chronic inflammation, disposing individuals to metabolic
      disease and overall decreased later-life health. Prominent metabolic changes include a
      decline in NAD+ content and deterioration in muscle NAD+ mediated signalling and
      mitochondrial function, ultimately compromising skeletal muscle and whole body energy
      homeostasis.

      The most efficient means to boost NAD+ in muscle appears to be oral delivery of NR, and
      participants will be supplemented with 1000mg NR (2x x250mg tablets twice daily) for 3 weeks.

        -  Hypothesis: elevating skeletal muscle NAD+ bioavailability using NR supplementation will
           increase markers of mitochondrial function and that will manifest as a more favourable
           metabolic profile.

        -  Study Setting: the study will be carried out at the NIHR/Wellcome Trust Clinical
           Research Facility, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.
