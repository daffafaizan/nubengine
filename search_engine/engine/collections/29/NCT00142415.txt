      111-Indium-DOTA-cG250 (111-In-DOTA-cG250) antibody (an imaging dose). Whole body and blood
      measurements of radioactivity were obtained on at least 3 occasions for 1 week to determine
      targeting and dosimetry. If at least one known and evaluable metastatic lesion was visualized
      with 111-In-DOTA-cG250, a single dose of therapeutic 177-Lu-DOTA-cG250 was administered the
      following week. In the absence of disease progression and after recovery from toxicity,
      subjects may have been retreated no sooner than 12 weeks after the previous treatment with a
      dose of no more than 75% of the previous dose, for a total of not more than 3 treatments.
      Only subjects with normal pharmacokinetics on the diagnostic 111-In-DOTA-cG250 study
      (indicative of human anti-chimeric antibody [HACA] negativity) were eligible for
      re-treatment.

      Subjects in the initial cohort were enrolled sequentially to receive 30 mCi/m^2 of
      177-Lu-DOTA-cG250 (fixed dose of 10 mg cG250). In the absence of a dose-limiting toxicity,
      the dose was escalated in each subsequent cohort in 10 mCi/m^2 increments of 177-Lu. At least
      3 subjects per dose level were followed for up to 12 weeks with imaging, biochemical, and
      hematologic tests. Safety was monitored continuously throughout the study.
