      hormone levels, particularly in the eyes. Corneal tissue can be affected by many biochemical
      and hormonal factors, and many ocular surface and systemic diseases can affect the
      cornea.Hyperthyroidism has been shown to cause symptoms such as conjunctival chemosis,
      proptosis, increased intraocular pressure, limitation to globe movements due to the
      restriction of extraocular muscles, increased orbital volume, increased risk of glaucoma with
      inflammation in the trabecular meshwork and exposure keratopathy, especially in Graves'
      disease. In the case of hypothyroidism, studies have shown fluid retention and edema in all
      body tissues, thereby resulting in increased thickness in the cornea, as well as a decrease
      in corneal hysteresis, which increases the risk of glaucoma. In this study, it is aimed to
      assess whether thyroid hormone changes affect those parameters by objectively measuring
      corneal changes via corneal topography, corneal densitometry and corneal aberrometry.
