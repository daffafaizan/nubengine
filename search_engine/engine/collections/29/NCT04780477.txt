      pre-portioned entrées (2 entrées per day months 1-3, 1 entrée per day months 4-6) and
      strategic nutritional instruction to guide participants to integrate legumes into a healthy
      high-fiber diet pattern. The research will target a population at high risk for colorectal
      cancer, overweight and obese participants with a history of a colon polyp in the past 3
      years, to test whether a high-legume, high-fiber diet will simultaneously increase weight
      loss and suppress intestinal biomarkers of cancer risk compared to a control diet (healthy
      American). In addition, it will explore potential mechanisms through which the high-legume
      intervention diet facilitates weight loss and intestinal health.
