      Vertical mattress sutures were used following resective periodontal surgery performed by one
      operator. Four suture materials were selected for evaluation: 5-0 silk; 5-0 polypropylene;
      5-0 polyglycolic acid (PGA), and 4-0 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Seven days after the
      surgical procedure, the surgeon assessed suture loosening and removed the sutures. A blind
      researcher clinically evaluated erythema and edema.
