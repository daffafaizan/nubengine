      decision-making processes are disrupted in patients with treatment-resistant depression, and
      (2) the neural and behavioral changes associated with treatment-resistant depression can be
      assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging paired with computationally constrained
      adaptive decision-making games.

      The investigators will use computational modeling of incentivized decision-making tasks,
      brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI), and standard clinical
      assessments, to characterize patients referred to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center for ECT.
      Characterization will occur over multiple visits to be aligned with the normal course of
      patient care.

      Data collected may be used in hypothesis driven analyses to:

        1. classify treatment resistant depression versus healthy controls

        2. predictors of ECT treatment success versus failure

        3. characterize brain and behavioral changes consistent with treatment success versus
           failure

        4. predict who will need maintenance ECT therapy

        5. determine what changes in decision-making behavior are apparent in patients who require
           ECT maintenance therapy versus those who do not.
