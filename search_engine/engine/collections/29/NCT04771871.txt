      among indigenous blacks, such as Nigerians, and younger women are more susceptible Patients
      with TNBC generally experience a more aggressive clinical course with faster disease
      progression and poorer overall survival. There is no targeted treatment available beyond
      conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy . Unfortunately, standard chemotherapy is only effective
      in about 40% of patients with pathological complete response (pCR) achieved only in 20%-30% .
      Local relapse occurs early. Therefore, chemo-resistance is the main cause of chemotherapeutic
      failure and leads to suboptimal response rates . There are no biomarkers of response for
      close monitoring of TNBC patients to identify chemotherapy failure early. This one-stage
      phase II study with a single arm is designed to assess the response rate and toxicity of
      Epirubicin-Cyclophosphamide with Paclitaxel-Carboplatin (ECPC) and examine the potential of
      using circulating microRNa and circulating tumor cells as a surrogate marker of chemotherapy
      resistance in Nigerian women with triple negative breast cancer. A total of 42 patients will
      be enrolled into the trial. Each participant will receive Epirubicin (60mg/m2),
      Cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2) , Paclitaxel (120mg/m2) and Carboplatin (6AUC) . Blood microRNA
      and circulating tumor DNA will be determined before and after therapy. Tumor response will be
      measured by breast ultrasound and described using RECIST criteria while toxicity will be
      graded using CTCAE criteria. Quality of life (QoL) of participants while on chemotherapy will
      also be assessed using EORTC quality of life questionnaire - (General and Breast cancer
      specific).
