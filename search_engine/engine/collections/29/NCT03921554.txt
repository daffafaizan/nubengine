    
      Aicardi Gouti√®res Syndrome (AGS) is a multisystem heritable disorder of the innate immunity
      resulting in excessive interferon production. Most characteristically, AGS manifests as an
      early-onset encephalopathy that results in severe intellectual and physical handicap.
      Interferon is thought to cause injury not only to the brain, but also the skin, liver, lungs,
      heart and many other organs. Treatment with Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors offers the promise
      of decreasing interferon signaling and limiting the morbidity of this devastating disorder.

      The primary objective is to determine if the administration of baricitinib to patients with
      AGS results in an improvement or stability of the AGS scale at baseline at 52 weeks.

      Secondary objectives will include longitudinal stability of safety measures, improvement of
      interferon signaling scores, improvement of GMFM-88 and functional measures of neurologic
      disability, and improvement of a daily disease severity scale, for the duration of the
      treatment period.
