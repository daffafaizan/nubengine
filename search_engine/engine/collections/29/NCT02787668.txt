      there is no treatment for NAFLD. In adults, weight loss through caloric restriction is
      commonly recommended to improve fatty liver. Weight loss is particularly difficult for
      children to achieve and significant caloric restriction may not be a prudent recommendation
      in developing children and adolescents. Because of this difficulty with weight loss in
      children, many children go on to develop cirrhosis and eventually undergo liver transplant.
      Data on the effectiveness of diet to reverse fatty liver and prevent progression to cirrhosis
      in children is urgently needed. To date, no studies have been done examining how changes in
      diet composition without intentional caloric restriction influences NAFLD in children. Data
      from previous studies in adults support the hypothesis that consumption of lower-CHO,
      higher-fat food sources rich in high-quality proteins and essential fatty acids has
      beneficial effects on metabolic health in adults without restricting calories. This study
      aims to test the hypothesis that a low CHO higher- fat diet will induce rapid reversal of
      fatty liver while also depleting of total and abdominal adiposity, preserving lean mass, and
      reducing inflammation in adolescents with obesity and NAFLD.
