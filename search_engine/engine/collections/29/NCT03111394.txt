    
      This is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of a mobile application "myMS™" to collect
      active clinical tasks (questionnaires, 6Mapp™, COGapp™, VISapp™), magnetic resonance imaging
      information and conduct genome-wide association studies in subjects with multiple sclerosis.
      Participants will be self-referred to this study from different sources; patient advocacy
      groups, social media tools, clinicaltrials.gov, and flyers.

      Specific aims of this pilot study are:

        1. To determine the feasibility and work flow in prospectively collecting surveys, clinical
           tasks, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) information for up to 200 self-referred adult MS
           participants, using mobile app myMS™.

        2. To determine the feasibility of using interface between myMS™ and 23andMe® DNA Kits and
           23andme password protected mobile app platform (GSR Dashboard) in collecting one
           biological (saliva) sample and distributing the genetic result (using commercially
           available results only, distributed by 23andme®), for up to 200 self-referred adult MS
           participants. This aim is for testing the system interface only. 23andme® has their own
           independent consent form and IRB coverage for their commercial product.

        3. To estimate the percentage of registered participants that will meet eligibility
           criteria for MS.

        4. To estimate the percentage of participants that a) complete all clinical tasks; b)
           complete all surveys; c) provide genetic information; and d) provide MRI scans.
