      it is not possible to implant the cochlea or if the cochlear nerve, which conveys neural
      signals from the cochlea to the brainstem, is damaged or absent. The latter device is usually
      used in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) who develop bilateral benign inner ear
      tumours called vestibular schwannomas as well as other neurological tumours1. These patients
      often become bilaterally profoundly deaf either as a result of the disease or because of
      surgery to remove the tumours and require an ABI.

      Patients with NF2 require monitoring of their tumours. In the absence of an auditory implant
      it is possible to use magnetic resonance imaging. This is the gold standard imaging technique
      as it gives excellent views of the soft tissues of head. However, there has been concern
      regarding the use of MRI in patients with auditory implants until recently because of
      potential problems such as demagnetisation of the magnet within the implant, implant magnet
      displacement and risk to the integrity of the implant electronics. In addition, the magnet
      field of the implant magnet results in imaging artefact (manifesting as a signal void) around
      the implant site that limits the information that can be obtained.
