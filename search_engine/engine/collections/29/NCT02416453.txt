    
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase
      2 study evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 2-dose heterologous
      regimens using Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo administered to healthy adults participants in
      Europe. The study involves a screening period of up to 12 weeks, a vaccination period in
      which participants will be vaccinated with Ad26.ZEBOV (dose 1) followed by vaccination with
      MVA-BN-Filo (dose 2) 28, 56 or 84 days later, and a post-vaccination phase until 6 months
      post dose 2 visit (Days 209, 237 or 265). After unblinding, only participants who received
      Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo will continue the study until the Day 365 visit (or until the
      start of the roll-over study or for an additional 12 months [whichever comes first] for
      participants in France who agree to continue the long-term follow-up after Day 365) to assess
      long-term safety and immunogenicity. Participants will enroll into 3 cohorts: that is, Cohort
      1 (Participants will receive Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo in an open-label fashion), Cohort 2
      (Participants will be randomized to receive the 2-dose heterologous vaccine regimen with
      either Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo, or placebo in a 14:1 ratio) and Cohort 3
      (Participants will be randomized to receive the 2-dose heterologous vaccine regimen with
      either Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo, or placebo in a 10:3 ratio). In Cohorts 2 and 3,
      core immunogenicity assessments (humoral and cellular assays) will be performed. In Cohort 2,
      additional immunogenicity assessments will be done. In Cohort 1, plasma blast response
      kinetics will be evaluated. Safety will be monitored during the study.
