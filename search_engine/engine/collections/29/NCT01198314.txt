      patients who have the high potential for obtaining operational tolerance using biomarkers.

      Then, we will gradually reduce immunosuppressants and monitor biomarkers as well as
      biochemical tests. The course of tapering off immunosuppressant will take about 1 year.

      During withdrawal of immunosuppression, participants will be closely monitored for liver
      enzyme, immunological profile.

      If there are some signs of rejection, liver biopsy will be undertaken and participants will
      be treated using immunosuppressant.

      After complete withdrawal of immunosuppressant, participants will be followed for at least of
      1 year.
