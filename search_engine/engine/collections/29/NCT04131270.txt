      plans to replace sedentary behavior with physical activity) will be investigated among
      participants from three age groups: adolescents (12-17 years old), adults (18-60 years old),
      and older adults (>60 years old). Compared to education only, forming plans about how to
      replace time spent on sedentary activities with physical activity is expected to result in a
      significantly larger change (a reduction) of sedentary time at the follow-up. Accelerometers
      will be used to evaluate short-term and mid-term changes in total sedentary time and the
      relative proportion of time spent on sedentary behavior vs light-intensity and
      moderate-to-vigorous- intensity physical activity.

      Additionally, the study will observe changes in if the cognitions included in the Health
      Action Process Approach model (HAPA), such risk perception, self-efficacy, outcome
      expectancies, intention, action control, as well as changes in behavioral habit, presence of
      sedentary behavior cues in physical environment, and physical activity behavior. The
      observations will be conducted three times, at the baseline (before the intervention), the
      2-month follow up, and at the 8-month follow-up.
