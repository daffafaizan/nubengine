      HIV infection were enrolled in Francistown and Gaborone, Botswana. They were provided with
      free male and female condoms, repeated individualized risk-reduction counseling, diagnosis
      and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and women will be provided with a choice of
      effective family planning methods. In addition, volunteers were randomized to receive either
      Tenofovir and emtricitabine (in a single pill) or a placebo pill to take once a day.
      Volunteers were seen monthly for at least 12 months to monitor for side effects and
      toxicities and to test their HIV status. Persons who become HIV infected during the trial
      received ongoing supportive counseling, CD4 and viral load monitoring, education about HIV
      infection/disease, and access to HIV care including free antiretrovirals when clinically
      indicated. Volunteer safety was monitored by a local ethics committee, Centers for Disease
      Control Institutional Review Board (CDC IRB) and an independent data safety and monitoring
      board
