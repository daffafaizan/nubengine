      depression and anxiety in patients with chronic diseases such as renal failure, however the
      combination of therapeutic approaches that include not only pathological but also another
      more positive approach (as the resilient model), represents a novel proposal for the
      treatment of negative psychological symptoms and improvement of the quality of life in these
      patients.

      The inclusion of the resilient model in a cognitive behavioral intervention serves as a
      possibility of therapeutic target that could enhance the effectiveness of the treatment.
