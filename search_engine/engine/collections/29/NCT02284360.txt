    
      APOSEC™ is a human product derived from lyophilized conditional medium of peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) following 24 hours cultivation after irradiation with 60Gy. The
      soluble factors produced by these factors (secretome) have regenerative functions and enhance
      wound healing due to the activation of signaling cascades involved in the cell migration,
      proliferation and cell survival. The product also possesses strong angiogenic properties as
      well in vivo and in vitro. APOSEC™ is intended for topical use only, to promote healing of
      wounds in association with standard wound care. Standard wound care includes initial
      debridement, avoidance and treatment of wound related infections and a non-weight-bearing
      regime to decrease the pressure on the wound.

      The verum APOSEC™ is processed as lyophilisate and resuspended in Nugel for the final
      formulation. It will be compared with a placebo, a cell-free parallel produced cell-free
      control lyophilisate that is finally formulated in Nugel as well.

      10 eligible healthy volunteers will consecutively be allocated to 2 different dose groups of
      APOSEC™ in a dose escalation scheme. The first 5 subjects in group A receive the low dose of
      APOSEC™ (12.5*10^6 lyophilized PBMC/mL), the subsequent 5 subjects in group B will receive
      the high dose of APOSEC™ (25*10^6 lyophilized PBMC/mL). Each volunteer will receive both
      Verum and Placebo on two artificial wounds on the inner upper non-dominant arm. The location
      of application of the Verum and Placebo (proximal or distal) is subjected to randomization.
