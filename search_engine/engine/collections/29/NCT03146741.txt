    
      Open-labelled pilot clinical trial of Zepatier (MK-5172 and MK-8742/Grazoprevir + Elbasvir)
      in at least 20 HCV-negative subjects receiving a heart transplant from a HCV-positive donor.
      Eligible subjects will receive a heart transplant from a deceased-donor with genotype 1 or 4
      HCV, and then will receive 12 weeks of Zepatier after heart transplantation when infection
      with HCV is confirmed in these heart transplant recipients. Treatment will be complete after
      12 weeks.
