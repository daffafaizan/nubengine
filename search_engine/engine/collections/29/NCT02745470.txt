      obese (BMI more than 26 kg/m2) subjects with type 2 diabetes treated by diet and/or
      metformin, SU(sulfonylurea), DPP4-inhibitors(Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor) will be
      recruited. Every subject will be studied on 2 separate days in random order with 1-2 week
      intervals. These participants will be injected either normal saline or 10 mcg of lixisenatide
      in a cross-over fashion. Neuroimaging composed with resting-12-min, visual stimulation
      task-12-min, T1-5-min, and diffusion tensor image-12-min will be proceeded. Ad lib buffet
      will be provided to every participant and the intake will be measured. Surveys about appetite
      and mood will be done before and after neuroimaging test and buffet eating.
