      design assessing the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus coated BxTM VELOCITY stent to
      the bare metal BxTM VELOCITY stent, both mounted on the Raptor√¢ Rapid Exchange Stent Delivery
      System. A total of 220 patients will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 1:1
      basis. Patients will be randomized to the coated or uncoated BX VELOCITY stent. Therefore,
      neither the Investigator nor the patient will know which stent will be implanted. Patients
      will be followed for twelve months post-procedure, with all patients having a repeat
      angiography at 6 months. An ancillary study with in-stent IVUS measurements at 6 months
      follow-up will be performed in all patients of 6 pre-selected clinical sites. It is assumed
      that these sites will enroll more than 90 patients.
