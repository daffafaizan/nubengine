      kidneys in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus have been recognized.

      The purpose of this study is to reverse hyperglycemia and insulin dependency, by islet cell
      transplantation, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who have a stable kidney
      allograft.

      The study primary efficacy endpoint is graft survival defined as insulin independence and
      HbA1c < 8% at 1 year post first transplant. Secondary outcomes are graft function and
      metabolic control

      The immunosuppression protocol for the kidney graft was converted to sirolimus+tacrolimus
      regimen 6 months before islet transplantation to exclude negative effects on kidney graft
      function.
