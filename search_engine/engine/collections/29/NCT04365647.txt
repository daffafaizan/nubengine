      had been undertaken previously. Objectives: We planned to evaluate the change in tumor
      dimensions of intraaxial parenchymal tumors after craniotomy by comparing the tumor size on
      intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUSG) with pre-operative CECT and CEMRI brain. Study Design:
      This was a prospective observational study. Participants: Patients aged 15-65 years
      undergoing surgery at SKIMS for intraaxial parenchymal intracranial tumors were included.
      Methods: Standard pre-operative CECT and CEMRI brain were done to measure tumor dimensions
      and compared with IOUSG.
