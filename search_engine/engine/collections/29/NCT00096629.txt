      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of vaccination with human and mouse
           prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) DNA in patients with renal cell carcinoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine antibody responses to human PSMA in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Assess antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) DNA vaccine
           intramuscularly (IM) once every 3 weeks for 3 doses (doses 1-3). Patients then receive
           mouse PSMA DNA vaccine IM once every 3 weeks for 3 doses (doses 4-6).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive mouse PSMA DNA vaccine IM once every 3 weeks for 3 doses (doses
           1-3). Patients then receive human PSMA DNA vaccine IM once every 3 weeks for 3 doses
           (doses 4-6).

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive additional booster
      vaccinations with the second form of PSMA DNA vaccine received (for doses 4-6) every 8 weeks
      for up to 4 additional doses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients per arm receive escalating doses of human and mouse PSMA DNA vaccine
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
