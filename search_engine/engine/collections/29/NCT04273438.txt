      vision. It involves a patient fixating on a central target and pressing a button when they
      see a spot of light in their peripheral vision. It is an important way of deciding whether
      Glaucoma is progressing or not. Next generation virtual reality (VR) technologies offer an
      exciting new way of conducting perimetry in either a clinical or home environment, allowing
      more affordable and more frequent monitoring of disease progression in glaucoma, and an
      easier and more comfortable experience for patients. The investigators propose to create a
      perimetry test using a commercially available head mounted display for VR, and to assess its
      accuracy in glaucoma patients in relation to standard automated perimetry.
