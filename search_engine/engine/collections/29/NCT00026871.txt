      fiberoptic radiation dosimetry system to ionizing radiation in a clinical radiotherapy
      environment. Present systems measure only total dose or have limitations, such as
      instability, non-linearity, excessive size or a decoupled measurement system, making them
      unsuitable in a variety of clinical applications. This fiberoptic coupled dosimetry system is
      a new and innovative technology application which allows on-line measurement of instantaneous
      dose rate and total dose never before achievable. It offers a clear advantage in patient
      treatment delivery, allowing on-line corrections essential to a new generation of
      radiotherapy treatment machines with development of beam intensity modulation as an adjunct
      to 3D conformal therapy. It also has the advantage of submillimeter size and is minimally
      invasive, making it ideal for brachytherapy.

      This system has the potential for stable, accurate, reproducible, clinically feasible
      measurements of total dose and dose rate. The output of this system will be measured under
      various clinical conditions encountered in a clinical setting and compared against existing
      thermolumeniscent and diode dosimetry standards. Initial measurements will use a tissue
      equivalent phantom for depth dose and accuracy measurements. Additional studies will include
      dosimetric measurements of routine clinical treatment setups on patients receiving
      therapeutic irradiation.
