      inclusion into the study. Informed consent will be obtained and patients will be randomized
      to the placement of either Angioseal or a Starcloseï€  vascular closure device to achieve
      hemostasis after the PCI procedure. The randomization will take place after a femoral
      angiogram has confirmed the suitability of the femoral artery for placement of arterial
      closure device. All patients will be monitored for bleeding or hematoma formation for twelve
      hours after the procedure. Patients will be ambulated at two hours after placement of the
      arterial closure device. A complete blood count and a vascular ultrasound will be performed
      in all patients before discharge to assess blood loss and detect vascular complications such
      as hematoma, arteriovenous fistula or femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. A written quality of
      life survey will be completed before discharge and at four weeks. A nursing survey will be
      completed by the nursing staff to determine nurse-sensitive outcomes and nurse resource
      utilization.
