      that the image of one's environment is projected in front of the retina (rather than directly
      on the retina, which is ideal). Of course, glasses can be used to correct the image disparity
      that is created by being near-sighted (that is why a lot of people need glasses for blurry
      vision). However, glasses and spectacles and contacts do not correct the underlying problem.
      Most near-sightedness is due to the eye being "too long" and therefore the image projects in
      front of the retina. Ideally, if we could prevent the eye from becoming abnormally "long",
      then we could prevent the progression of near-sightedness. Indeed, a child may only be
      slightly near-sighted early in life, but as he/she continues to perform activities within an
      arms length of their environment, they can become progressively near-sighted. Besides
      spectacle correction, people have tried topical atropine drops (medicated eye drops) and
      rigid contact lenses (orthokeratology) to attempt to correct near-sightedness. Atropine drops
      take a lot of cooperation from parent and child. Orthokeratology also requires a lot of
      cooperation, but also, does not permanently stall myopic progression. The investigators
      suggest a different means of potentially preventing near-sightedness from getting worse (and
      thus prevent the eye from getting "too long"). The investigators plan on using riboflavin (a
      Vitamin that can easily be taken orally each day) and having the children involved in the
      study play outside (where there is UV light created by the sun) in order to prevent the eye
      from becoming progressively more near-sighted.
