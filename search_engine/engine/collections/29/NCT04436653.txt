      valve replacement with LuX-Valve. A series of physical, imaging and laboratory exams will be
      performed to determine whether a subject has severe tricuspid regurgitation with high
      surgical risk. Subjects who meet the criteria will then receive LuX-Valve implantation if an
      informed consent is obtained.
