      genetic risk factors for adult onset MS play an important role in susceptibility to
      pediatric-onset MS. Our study design is based on the hypothesis that genetic influences,
      specifically variation at HLA-DRB1 and other confirmed non-MHC MS loci, as well as
      environmental exposures including EBV infection and tobacco smoke, contribute to disease
      risk. In addition, we will also examine the relationship between serum levels of 25(OH)
      vitamin D3 and prior vitamin D status, and risk for pediatric onset MS. Finally, we will
      investigate whether specific G x E, and other multivariable relationships influencing risk
      exist for pediatric-onset MS. There are 16 collaborating sites other than UCSF that will
      enroll cases and controls for this study.
