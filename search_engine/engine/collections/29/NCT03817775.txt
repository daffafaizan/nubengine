      followed during their coronary angiography procedure and with no follow-up. Patients will be
      recruited from the coronary angiography patient pool of the American Hospital of Paris and
      assigned to one of 2 groups in a non-randomized manner. It is expected to enroll around 100
      patients and this is estimated to be obtained in a period of 2 months approximately. Patients
      will be placed in the control group, without music intervention, or assigned to the music
      group. Assignment will be done in this manner due to limited availability of the hardware and
      software to the investigation team. Patients in both groups will be matched based on age,
      sex, weight, height, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, and prior medical
      history, including diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and stroke. Each patient
      will receive a standardized sedation in the traditional manner and at the discretion of the
      investigator to reach Bispectral index (BIS) score below 90 and sedation score â‰¤ 1. The
      primary study end points will be the consumptions in analgesics and hypnotics. Secondary
      study end points will be pain and anxiety scores as measured the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS),
      the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale
      (APAIS).
