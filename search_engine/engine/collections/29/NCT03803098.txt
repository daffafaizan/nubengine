    
      Primary objective : Evaluate, in patients consulting for polysomnography, respiratory
      functional explorations or osteodensitometry, or as part of a day hospital cardiology. The
      accuracy of the measurement provided by a connected object in relation to the "gold standard"
      measurement made during the visit. The parameters studied will be:

        -  For polysomnography, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR) and respiratory
           rate (RF), sleep quality (efficacy, duration of mild slow sleep, deep slow sleep and REM
           sleep)

        -  For bone densitometry, body composition in lean mass, fat mass and bone mass, weight â€¢
           For respiratory function tests, pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR)

        -  For day hospitalization in cardiology, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and heart
           rate, existence of rhythm disorders or conduction

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluate the ease of use of the device (evaluated by an ad-hoc questionnaire completed
           by the nursing staff)

        -  Describe the temporal evolution of the recorded parameters (excluding osteodensitometry
           for which the measurement is unique)

        -  For day hospitalization in cardiology, evaluate the diagnostic performance of objects
           tested on the existence of cardiac rhythm disorders (sinus bradycardia, sinus
           tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, presence of extrasystoles) or conduction disorders
           (atrioventricular block). -ventricular, branch block)
