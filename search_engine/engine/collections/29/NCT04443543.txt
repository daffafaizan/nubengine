           Evaluate the CCR rate of low rectal cancer using adaptive and optimized chemotherapy and
           radiotherapy strategies (all population and dMMR/MSI-H subgroup)

        2. Secondary objectives:

           2.1 Evaluate the 2-year anal preservation rate, recurrence rate, quality of life, DFS
           and OS 2.2 Explore the subgroup of patients suitable for observation.

        3. Outline:

      Patients after long-course chemoradiation are grouped based on their MSI-H/dMMR status. For
      patients with MSI-H/dMMR, consolidation immunotherapy of Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) will be
      assigned. For patients with MSS/pMMR, consolidation chemotherapy will be given according to
      their tumor response. After completion of consolidation therapy, those who reach clinical
      complete response will receive organ preservation (watch and wait) strategy in place of
      radical surgery. During treatment, once local regrowth occurs or poor tumor response, total
      mesorectal excision (TME) surgery will be performed.
