      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood
      pressure among people with mild hypertension. Forty-one subjects with systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) between 130 and 179 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 85 and 109 mm
      Hg were randomized to receive either AC mycelia or starch placebo for 8 weeks, and had
      follow-up observation for an additional 2 weeks. SBP in the subjects given GABA, adenosine
      and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia significantly decreased compared to those who received the
      placebo (p<0.05). DBP also decreased after the intake of AC mycelia. Compared to the placebo,
      AC mycelia significantly reduced plasma renin activity by a maximum of 25 % and 36 % on week
      8. This suppression suggested that AC mycelia is a potent inhibitor of renin, and its
      bioavailability is sufficient to produce BP reduction after a short term of oral
      administration. Neither adverse events nor abnormal laboratory findings were noted throughout
      the study period, suggesting that GABA, adenosine and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia
      significantly decreased borderline hypertension, which may support its consideration as a
      safe alternative treatment compared to conventional anti-hypertensive medications.
