      type 2 diabetes mellitus. In contrast to the findings of the observational studies, the
      supplementation trials in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) do not report any definitive
      conclusions, but it does suggest that supplementation at an early stage in the development of
      diabetes may be of benefit in delaying progression to clinical T2DM by increasing the
      pancreatic insulin release and improved insulin resistance plus impaired glucose
      tolerance.There is also speculation on role of vitamin D in physiology of weight loss and
      body composition.However, there have been multiple inconsistencies within the reported trial
      i.e. sample size, dose of vitamin D, frequency of supplementation, and population studied.

      Hence the randomised clinical trial was undertaken to study the effect of vitamin D
      (Cholecalciferol) supplementation on metabolic markers and obesity parameters in the vitamin
      D deficient obese type 2 diabetic subjects.
