    
      Open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trial in healthy, hookworm-naïve adults:

        -  Study site: George Washington Medical Faculty Associates, Washington, DC

        -  Number of participants: 40 in 2 cohorts of 20.

      In Cohort 1 five (5) volunteers will receive 30 µg Na-APR-1 (M74) /Alhydrogel®, five (5) will
      receive 30 µg Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel® plus 2.5 µg GLA-AF, and ten (10) will receive 30 µg
      Na-APR-1 (M74) /Alhydrogel® plus 5 µg GLA-AF. In Cohort 2 five (5) volunteers will receive
      100 µg Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel®, five (5) will receive 100 µg Na-APR-1 (M74) /Alhydrogel®
      plus 2.5 µg GLA-AF, and ten (10) will receive 100 µg Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel® plus 5 µg
      GLA-AF.

      The cohorts will be enrolled in a staggered fashion with safety data assessed prior to the
      Na-APR-1 dose escalation from 30 to 100 µg. In addition, within each cohort, vaccinations
      will be staggered such that formulations containing 0, 2.5, and 5 µg GLA-AF will be tested
      sequentially: for example, those receiving Na-APR-1 (M74)/Alhydrogel® in combination with 2.5
      µg GLA-AF will be vaccinated no sooner than 3 days after the last volunteer is vaccinated
      with the formulation containing no GLA-AF, whereas those vaccinated with Na-APR-1
      (M74)/Alhydrogel® plus 5 µg GLA-AF will be vaccinated no sooner than 7 days after the last
      one receives the 2.5 µg GLA-AF formulation.

        -  Immunization schedule: Study days 0, 56 and 112.

        -  Route: IM in the deltoid muscle.

        -  Doses of Na-APR-1 (M74) to be tested: 30 and 100 µg.

        -  Doses of Alhydrogel®: 240 and 800 µg for the 30 and 100 µg doses of Na-APR-1 (M74),
           respectively.

        -  Doses of GLA-AF to be tested: 2.5 µg and 5 µg.

        -  Study duration: 44 weeks (10 months) per study participant; total duration of the study
           estimated at approximately 13 months.
