      If left untreated, it results in decreased quality of life and increased risk of heart
      problems. Only half of these people are able to use the main treatment (CPAP) which involves
      wearing a mask and hose at night. A new, well-tolerated treatment - tongue stimulation - is a
      device which opens the airway during sleep and can provide treatment for patients unable to
      use the mask and hose treatment. The study will evaluate the effect of this new treatment on
      blood pressure and heart-related measures to see if it lowers patients' risk of heart
      problems.
