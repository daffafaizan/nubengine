      is associated with pathological cardiovascular changes including left ventricular
      hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and diffuse interstitial fibrosis. These combine to confer
      an elevated cardiovascular risk, including an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

      The cause of this increased cardiovascular risk is not clear but it is thought that coronary
      microvascular dysfunction may play a role. Coronary microvascular dysfunction is prevalent in
      many myocardial disease states, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure with
      preserved ejection fraction, that share pathological similarities with uraemic
      cardiomyopathy.

      Coronary flow reserve, a marker of coronary microvascular function, can be assessed
      non-invasively using echocardiography techniques. Previous studies have shown a reduction in
      coronary flow reserve in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, it is not clear if
      kidney donors - individuals who have a reduced kidney function but do not have progressive
      kidney disease - also demonstrate microvascular dysfunction. Similarly, although there is
      some evidence that patients on dialysis have improved coronary flow reserve compared to
      patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease stage 5, there has been limited
      investigation into the role of peritoneal dialysis on coronary flow reserve.
