    
      This registry is a multi-centre, prospective, observational program that will gather and
      analyze data on patients being treated with biologics in Korea. In contrast to a controlled
      clinical trial, there is no imposed experimental intervention and solely the patients'
      physicians will determine the patient's treatment. Thus, the data captured and reported in
      this registry will reflect a "real world" approach to the treatment with biologics. There
      will be no additional visit or laboratory test done outside the routine clinical practice.
      Selection of biologic agent, dosing and treatment duration are at the discretion of the
      investigator. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient prior to the collection of
      any data.
