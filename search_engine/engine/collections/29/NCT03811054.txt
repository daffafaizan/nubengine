      treat NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation as first-line therapy. However, a large proportion of
      patients would become acquired resistant of EGFR-TKI after about one year although initially
      sensitivity. Previous studies demonstrated that the anti-angiogenesis combined with EGFR-TKI
      in slow-progressed EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer achieved good efficacy
      and disease control rates, prolonged the progression free survival. The present study is aim
      to expand the number of samples to monitor resistance-related genes and tumor cells.
      Furthermore, to investigate the mechanism of anti-angiogenesis combine with EGFR-TKI and
      provide the theory for the use and promotion of clinically protocols. In this study, the
      primary objective is the objective response rates and the secondary goal are disease control
      rates, overall survival, progression free survival and drug safety.
