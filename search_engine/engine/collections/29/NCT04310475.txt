      Each participant will set one or more SMART goals for therapy (e.g. be able to use public
      transport, attend a social gathering or to feel less anxious in social situations) which are
      worked on both in the therapy sessions and through homework tasks.

      This is a feasibility study. The aim is to recruit between 6-10 participants to pilot the VRT
      with. The results of this study will inform future research and practice, by helping to
      assess if service-users find the new VRT acceptable (e.g. recruitment, retention, drop out
      rates, participant experiences), and if it is effective (e.g. reduction in symptoms or
      distress, and improvement in social functioning).

      It is really important that the clinical care of anyone who chooses to participate in the
      study is not affected by their participation in this study. The researchers will work closely
      with clinical teams to ensure this. Clients who engage with the study will still be eligible
      for all aspects of TAU including psychological interventions, should this be appropriate.

      The VR technology and environment has been used extensively before in research studies, which
      have proved that it is safe and effective. However, it has not been used within the NHS
      context before or embedded within a therapy course before.
