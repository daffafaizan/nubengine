      Cohort C1 includes COVID19 (+) patients admitted in ICU in whom the diagnosis of COVID19
      pneumonia was confirmed.

      Cohort C2 includes COVID 19 (-) matched patients also admitted in ICU.

      Cohort C3 is a control group. Patients with few comorbidities, ASA 1, recruited during
      preoperative assessment for elective surgery.

      Eligible patients are included within 72 hours of ICU admission (C1, C2) or during the
      preoperative assessment (C3). Oral consent is needed after complete explanation of the
      protocol.

      During inclusion visit (V0), patient characteristics as treatments, medical history, clinical
      and biological data are registered.

      Microcirculation is assessed for each patient directly after inclusion.

      For patients in C1 and C2 a follow-up is planned. This visit (V1) occurs when the patient is
      discharged from ICU or the day of his death if it occurs in ICU. In case of prolonged stay in
      ICU, V1 is carried out 2 months after inclusion. During V1, arterial and/or venous
      thromboembolic events and mortality in ICU is registered.

      For Patients in C3, no follow-up is planned.
