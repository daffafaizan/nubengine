    
      This is a prospective randomized control study which will be conducted at six large
      ambulatory pediatrics clinics from the Jerusalem district. All of the children diagnosed with
      IDA would be eligible to join the study after informed consent will be obtained. Ethics
      committee approval is obtained. Analysis of stool samples will be carried out by the HP Stool
      antigen EIA (HpSA, Premier Platinum HpSA, Meridian Diagnostics inc, Cincinnati, OH, USA). All
      children enrolled will be treated with standard Fe therapy. Children with positive HpSA will
      be randomized, controlled for age and clinic, to receive or not receive antibiotics
      treatment. Assessment of response to iron therapy will be done at eight weeks later. The
      prevalence of HP infection in children with diagnosed with IDA would be reported. Statistical
      analysis will compare the baseline data between HP-positive and -negative children and the
      response to Fe between the three study groups.
