      Smoking Study (1972-1977) characterised as hypercholesterolemic in 1972.

      Measurements of the outcome variables were performed at baseline and after 36 m; blood
      sampling also after 6 and 18 m.

      In addition to the main outcome variables, a biobank was established for future analyses.

      Clinical events were also recorded.
