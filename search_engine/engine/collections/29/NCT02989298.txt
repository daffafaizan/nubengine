      patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment, and developing a PD database in China.
      Patients' demographic characteristics (including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, smoking,
      drinking, and education, etc), clinical characteristics (primary cause of ESRD, dialysis
      prescription, patient's condition and lab measurements of serum, urine, and dialysate), drug
      information, complications and scores of quality of life at the baseline will be collected.
      Patients will be followed up every 3 months. Demographic and clinical characteristics,
      complications, drug information of patients will be collected at each visit. The patients'
      clinical outcomes, such as mortality (including all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
      disease mortality), technical survival, kidney transplantation, transfer to hemodialysis,
      hospitalization, occurrence of peritonitis, etc. were also followed up till the end of the
      study. The data of patient survival, technical survival, peritonitis rate, hospitalization
      rate, clinical lab parameters, longitudinal changes of residual renal function and peritoneum
      function, peritonitis rate, hospitalization rate, clinical lab parameters and quality of life
      for PD patients will be analyzed using the PD database.
