      survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety. We assessed the tumor response
      according to the RECIST 1.1.

      Efficacy was evaluated by computed tomography with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and
      pelvis. We performed tumor assessments with the use of imaging studies at baseline and every
      six weeks until the end of treatment. We also used such assessments to confirm a response (at
      least 4 weeks after initial documentation) and whenever disease progression was suspected.
      All imaging scans were evaluated by an independent imaging-review committee (IRC) blinded to
      study treatment. Patients who had inadequate data for study assessment was regarded as
      nonevaluable.

      Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) version 3.0. Safety was assessed by physical examination and laboratory tests.
      Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were performed at baseline and every six weeks until the end of
      treatment.
