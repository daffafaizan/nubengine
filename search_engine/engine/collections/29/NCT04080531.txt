      I. Demonstrate an absolute 25% increase in seroprotection, defined as hemagglutination
      antibody inhibition (HAI) > 40 against all strains, at week 21 in the experimental arm
      compared to the control arm.

      II. Determine correlation between HAI, predefined risk of influenza-like illness (low,
      moderate, high), and progression-free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measurement of B & T-cell subsets and flu-specific responses as a way of understanding
      immunosuppression in this patient population, correlating with influenza-like illness.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at weeks 1, 9, and
      17, and pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine IM at week 5 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine IM at week 1 and pneumococcal 13-valent
      conjugate vaccine IM at week 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks and then periodically
      for 2 years.
