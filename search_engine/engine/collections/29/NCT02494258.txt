    
      The open-label, multicenter, multinational rollover study is intended to evaluate the safety
      of CC-486, while providing continued treatment with CC-486 for subjects who are receiving
      single agent CC-486 at the time of transition to the rollover study and tolerated the
      protocol prescribed regimen in Celgene-sponsored trials, and whom in the opinion of the
      Investigator may derive clinical benefit from continuing treatment with CC-486. Subjects'
      survival will also be followed if required by the parent CC-486 study protocol. If approved
      by Celgene, subjects from any ongoing or future Celgene sponsored CC-486 studies in solid
      tumors and hematological disorders will be included in this protocol.
