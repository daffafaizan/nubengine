      behaviour and fitness levels in children with autism. Local primary schools who have an
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) class will be approached to participate in the project. The
      age profile of the children will be 4-12 years of age and they will have mild-sever levels of
      autism. The exercise intervention programme will be delivered 3 times per week in the schools
      over an 8 week period.

      Children will be fitness tested to assess the change in fitness levels over the 8 week
      period. Questionnaires will be given to the parents and teachers of the children at the
      beginning and at the end of the programme to assess changes in behaviour levels as a result
      of the exercise intervention programme.
