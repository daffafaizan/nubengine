      population, as well as dysfunctions of the heart conduction system. In an attempt to treat
      and correct heart conduction system dysfunctions, Cardiac Electronic Implantable Device
      (CEID) was developed. Most people with CEID have a perception of describing the lifestyle due
      to a limitation of daily activities and physical exercise, besides the consequences in the
      psychological aspects such as anxiety and depression. These changes in the psychosocial
      conduct of patients with CEID are due to the lack of knowledge and the lack of effective
      guidance, being of fundamental importance to elaborate the resources of education in health
      for patients with CEID. Health promotion through educational intervention is a recognized
      strategy and an Internet approach to the mobile health proposal is a recognized and promising
      practice.

      This randomized controlled study is been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the Mobile
      Health of lifestyle that focuses on aspects of physical functional, psychosocial, and quality
      of life of patients with CEID. The hypothesis is that the use of Mobile Health of lifestyle
      provides greater physical functional, psychological aspects, and quality of life to patients
      with CIED.
