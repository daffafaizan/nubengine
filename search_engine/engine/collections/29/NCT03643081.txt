      the near infra-red light. Parathyroid glands emit at 822 nanometers when they are stimulated
      by a laser of 785 nanometers. Fluoptics Company (Fluoptics SAS, Grenoble, France) will
      provide a camera called "Fluobeam", facilitating the visualization of the parathyroid glands.
      The fluorescence intensity of the parathyroid glands is much more elevated than that of the
      surrounding tissues.

      Preliminary work showed the interest of this technique. Benmiloud and collabortors have shown
      that the utilization of the "Fluobeam" enable to decrease the post total thyroidectomy
      hypocalcemia rate by a better visualization and preservation of the parathyroid glands.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the value of "Fluobeam" in the localization,
      visualization of the parathyroid glands for patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism.
