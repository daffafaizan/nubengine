      be randomized into one of three intervention groups: dual-belt treadmill exercise,
      traditional treadmill exercise, or non-contact control.

      Prior to and following 16 weeks of therapy, we will observe the participants' performing
      several functional movements (walking, standing from sitting, sitting from standing, walking
      up and down stairs) and measure their muscular activity. These performance-based measures
      will be obtained to determine whether their movement function improves as a result of
      therapeutic intervention. The participants' absolute performance on any of these tasks does
      not matter as much as that they make the very best effort on each of the tests. They are
      welcome to take a break at any point in the testing or training.
