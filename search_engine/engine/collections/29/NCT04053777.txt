      advances in mechanical ventilation technology in the past 30 years. Currently, NPPV has
      become an essential respiratory support technology in hospitals, and it is used in different
      fields, including respiratory and critical care, emergency care, anesthesia, and
      rehabilitation. Applications of NPPV are also gradually expanding from intensive care units
      (ICUs) and respiratory wards to use in other medical departments and at home.

      This is an observational study of recording the respiratory parameters of patients when
      receiving non-invasive ventilation and analyze the relationship between those parameters and
      clinical outcomes.
