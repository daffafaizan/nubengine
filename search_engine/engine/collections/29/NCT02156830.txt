    
      The project consists of qualitative interviews with all the members of the obesity team
      (endocrinologist, bariatric surgeon, dietician, psychologist,..) in different Flemish
      hospitals. These interviews have the aim to gain insight into the current practice about
      counseling patients with bariatric surgery, with a focus on medication counseling. We will do
      a benchmarking and also qualitative analyses of the interviews using Nvivo 10.

      This will make it possible to assess the strengths and weaknesses in the current practice of
      obese patients who will undergo and have undergone bariatric surgery.
