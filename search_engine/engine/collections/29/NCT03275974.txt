      I. To establish and validate a 11C-glutamine (11C-Gln) and fluorine F 18 L-glutamate
      derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG) PET image guided gene signature to predict response to
      EGFR-targeted therapy in patients with advanced wild-type RAS colorectal cancer (CRC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 11C-glutamine intravenously (IV) and undergo PET imaging over 120 minutes.
      Beginning 2 hours to 7 days after 11C-glutamine PET, patients receive fluorine F 18
      L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 IV and also undergo PET imaging over 120 minutes. During
      each of the 11C-Glutamine and 18F-FSPG PET/CT scans, venous blood draws will be performed.
