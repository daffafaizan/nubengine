      under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study and reviewed. The experimental group
      included patients who were treated with at least one pulpotomy, and the control group was
      treated with dental fillings only. The Wong-Baker FACES scale was used to evaluate
      self-reported pain and the need for rescue analgesia. The data were analysed using the
      Kruskal-Wallis test, two sample t- tests, chi-square tests and Pearson's correlation
      analysis.
