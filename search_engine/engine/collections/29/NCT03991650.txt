      patients, one control and one with anxiety disorder and alcoholic abuse disorder using sensor
      data from mobile devices and wearables. This data, collected by sensors, will be compared to
      the data presented by three clinical questionnaires: State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI),
      the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and the Beck's Depression Inventory
      (BDI-II) in order to determine the feasibility of using remote collected data in routine
      clinical practice. Furthermore, patient satisfaction with the app will be evaluated after the
      data collection phase.

      This is a unicentric, case-controlled, longitudinal, evaluational, national study with two
      groups, one control of healthy individuals without symptoms of anxiety or depression, and
      another experimental group in which participants fulfill the given selection criteria for the
      trial. There are a total of 60 participants split evenly between the two groups.
