      evidence of clinical activity and minimal toxicity. The underlying hypothesis of this
      research is that immunization against tumor neoantigens is effectively required to elicit
      antigen-reactive T cells capable of recognizing and eliminating cancer. Moreover, both
      quantitative and qualitative improvements in CD8 immunity are necessary (but not sufficient)
      for clinical response and improved survival. The goal of this study is to build on our prior
      clinical trial results in melanoma by studying the immune response to tumor neoantigens in
      patients with stage 1 NSCLC.
