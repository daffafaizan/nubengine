    
      This multicenter, randomized, open-label exploratory study will be performed in approximately
      200 healthy females undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Each study center will follow
      its study center standard practice for in vitro fertilization (IVF) within the study
      parameters as noted in this protocol. The study centers will use marketed products purchased
      from Schraft's Pharmacy for all phases of the study (down-regulation, stimulation, ovulation
      induction, and luteal support). Subjects will be randomly assigned prior to the start of
      stimulation to highly purified menotropin (Menopur®) or follitropin beta (Follistim Pen®) for
      stimulation and progesterone vaginal insert (Endometrin®) or progesterone in oil for luteal
      support. Subjects will return to the study center for regular scheduled clinic visits as
      required per in vitro fertilization (IVF) protocol at the site and at specified time periods
      during the cycle for estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
      tests, and first serum pregnancy test. All subjects will be required to complete a final
      study visit at completion of luteal support or negative serum pregnancy test following embryo
      transfer.
