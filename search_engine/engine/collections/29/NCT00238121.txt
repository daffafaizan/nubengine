      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with advanced or recurrent uterine
      cancer treated with sorafenib.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology
      (carcinoma vs carcinosarcoma).

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
