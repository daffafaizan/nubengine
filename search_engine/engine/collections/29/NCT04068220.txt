      varying levels of postoperative visual dysfunction. For instance, surgical resection of
      suprasellar meningiomas has been shown to worsen visual function in 14 - 28% of patients and
      surgical resection of craniopharyngiomas worsen visual function in 3 - 11.5% of patients.
      Manipulation of the optic nerve and interference with the microvasculature during surgical
      dissection is thought to be responsible for the visual loss.

      Through intraoperative monitoring and prompt identification of flash visual evoked potentials
      (FVEPs) deterioration, corrective surgical measures could be undertaken to improve or
      stabilize postoperative visual dysfunction. Furthermore, intraoperative FVEPs monitoring may
      influence surgical decision-making thus contributing to predict and prevent postoperative
      visual dysfunction as well as allowing more total resection of a tumour when the monitoring
      is stable.

      This study's aim is to determine if intraoperative continuous FVEPs monitoring can predict
      and prevent or minimize possible visual pathway injury that may appear during minimally
      invasive endoscopic skull base surgery.
