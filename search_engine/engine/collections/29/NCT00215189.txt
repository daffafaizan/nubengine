      illness. Participants in the program are assigned a health mentor who assesses individual
      lifestyle habits and health status, identifies goals for lifestyle change, and serves as a
      motivator and physical trainer. The individualized components of the In SHAPE program are
      supplemented with group-level positive reinforcement and motivational incentives. This
      evaluation project systematically evaluates the In SHAPE health promotion intervention.
