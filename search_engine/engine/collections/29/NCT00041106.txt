      I. To describe the overall response proportion in patients with advanced carcinoma of the
      urothelial tract treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and ZD1839
      (gefitinib), given on a 21 day schedule, followed by maintenance ZD1839.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival in
      patients with advanced carcinoma of the urothelial tract treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine
      and ZD1839, given on a 21 day schedule, followed by maintenance ZD1839.

      II. To evaluate the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression level on
      overall response rate and progression-free survival in patients with advanced carcinoma of
      the urothelial tract treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine and ZD1839, given on a 21 day
      schedule, followed by maintenance ZD1839.

      III. To assess the toxicity of the combination of cisplatin, gemcitabine and ZD1839 given on
      a 21 day schedule, followed by maintenance ZD1839 in patients with advanced carcinoma of the
      urothelial tract.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin
      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive gefitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD)
      beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission,
      partial remission, or maintain stable disease continue gefitinib PO QD for 5 years or until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1 year and then at least every 6 months
      until disease progression or relapse.
