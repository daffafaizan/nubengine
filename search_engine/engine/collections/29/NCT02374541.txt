      under-diagnosed and under-treated in young children, particularly in minority and
      disadvantaged populations. Although screening for ASD in the primary care setting is
      recommended as best practice, inadequate attention has been paid to addressing important
      obstacles to early recognition of ASD, including barriers to referral after positive
      screening, completion of diagnostic evaluations, and receipt of treatment. Patient navigation
      was originally developed to reduce health care disparities. The patient navigator guides
      patients with suspicious findings (e.g., a positive screening test) through and around
      barriers to care to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment. Patient navigation has improved
      receipt of preventive care among low-income, minority children but has not been tested for
      improving early identification and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The goal of this
      study is to test the effectiveness and feasibility of patient navigation to facilitate autism
      screening follow-up, diagnostic evaluation, and linkage to early intervention in a very
      young, disadvantaged, minority population. To increase patient navigation's potential for
      widespread application and public health impact, this study uses the Reach, Effectiveness,
      Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, a set of criteria for
      translating research into action, to guide planning and evaluation. The intervention's Reach,
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance over time will be examined.
