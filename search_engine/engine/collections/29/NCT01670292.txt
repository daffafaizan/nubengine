      participant will be treated 12 times over the course of 6 weeks. The following data will be
      collected: participant characteristics that may predict outcome or be modifiers of force used
      by provider (gender, age, height, weight, and Body Mass Index); spinal segment load during
      the pre-load and thrusting phases (force and moment in the pre-load phase, peak load, and
      loading rate); physiological measures (posterior-anterior global stiffness and
      flexion-relaxation); patient-centered outcomes of back pain and function; and adverse events.

      Study participants (n= 80) will be recruited from the Quad Cities metro area. A team of
      experienced chiropractic clinicians working at the Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research
      will treat study participants. Each of the study participants will receive 2 High Velocity
      Low Amplitude Spinal Manipulation treatment visits per week over a 6 week period. The
      physiological assessments will be performed immediately before and after Spinal Manipulation
      delivery during treatment visits 1, 5 & 12 (6 sets of assessments in total). During these
      same treatment visits, we will also capture the kinetic measures during Spinal Manipulation
      delivery for spinal segment load analysis. Participant patient-centered outcomes will be
      measured at baseline 1, and treatment visits 6 and 13. For simplicity, data collection time
      points will be named as baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 6 weeks.
