      with febrile neutropenia (FN) is unknown. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)
      recommends maintaining AT at least until the neutropenia is recovered, because literally
      "years of experience have proven this approach to be safe and effective". This recommendation
      is likely to cause unnecessarily prolonged treatments, and is against the urgent need of
      optimizing the antimicrobial therapy proposed by IDSA. The main objective of this study is to
      establish whether an individualized clinical protocol is better than the standard criteria
      (recovery of neutropenia as the criterion to suspend the empirical AT in hematological
      patients with FN).
