      Incidence is increasing and HCC has risen to become the 5th commonest malignancy worldwide
      and the third leading cause of cancer related death, exceeded only by cancers of the lung and
      stomach. HCC prevalence is higher in sub-Saharan Africa, central and Southeast Asia.Serum
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels is an indirect marker of tumor hypoxia, angioneogenesis
      and worse prognosis. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), which is a glycolytic enzyme, composed of
      four polypeptide chains, each one encoded by separate gene (M and H), exists in various types
      of human tissue and neoplasms. LDH is a key enzyme in the conversion pyruvate to lactate
      under anaerobic conditions .Five isoforms of LDH have been identified as a result of the five
      different combinations of polypeptide subunits.

      Hypoxia represents a clinical biological mechanism for treatment resistance in cancer cells
      via the formation of new blood vessels. Furthermore, a growing body of evidence indicates
      that hypoxia might actually promote cancer development.
