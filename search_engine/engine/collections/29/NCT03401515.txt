      environmental stimuli. To differentiate sympathetic storming from similar conditions,
      symptoms and signs have to occur in TBI patients a minimum of 1 cycle per day for 3
      consecutive days (body temperature of 38.5 °C or more, heart rate at least 120 beat / min,
      systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg, respiratory rate > 20 breaths / min, in presence of
      dystonia, diaphoresis, agitation and laboratory investigations confirm elevated serum
      catecholamines. Beta blockers has a cardio protective effect via lowering heart rate, stroke
      volume and mean arterial blood pressure which limits myocardial O2 consumptions and guards
      against myocardial infarction. They also have neuron protective effects via reducing cerebral
      blood flow thus lowering O2 and glucose consumption as cerebral metabolism is reduced.
      Propranolol a nonselective B receptor antagonists works on β1 receptors in brain, heart, and
      kidney and β 2 receptors in lungs, liver, skeletal muscles, eye and arterioles.We suppose
      that using Beta - adrenergic receptor blockers as propranolol blunts the sympathetic storming
      phenomenon as it is a nonselective β inhibitor and has a lipophilic property which enables it
      to penetrate blood brain barrier.
