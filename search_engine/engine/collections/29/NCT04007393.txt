    
      This is a single site, 2-staged sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) that
      will systematically examine: 1) the optimal timing (12- versus 24 weeks) for identifying
      non-responders to lifestyle modification therapy (LSMT) before starting adjunct
      pharmacotherapy with phentermine and 2) for non-responders to phentermine+LSMT, the relative
      effect of adding topiramate to phentermine+LSMT versus switching to topiramate
      monotherapy+LSMT. All participants will receive a total of 48 weeks of intervention.
      Participant characteristics that differentially predict outcomes and mechanisms that may
      account for the relative effects will also be examined.
