    
      Our study investigates the influence of automatic remote patient monitoring on quality of
      life (QOL), anxiety and depression in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators
      (ICDs), and frequency of (un-)scheduled patient-physician contacts. The study also evaluates
      monitoring-induced changes in patient mobility and in patients' perceptions of ICD therapy.

      The patients will receive BIOTRONIK Lexos-T or Lumos-T ICD models, with the integrated Home
      Monitoring capability. The latter allows wireless, everyday transfer of the essential status
      and therapy data from the ICD memory to a website accessible by the attending physicians. The
      website is managed by BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring Service Center.

      Patients will be randomised into:

        -  Group 1: Home Monitoring is established from the outset.

        -  Group 2: Home Monitoring is introduced 9 months after ICD implantation.

      Follow-up for both groups is 18 months.

      Study Hypothesis: Home Monitoring improves the Hospital Anxiety Score in ICD patients.

      Preoperatively, HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), Questionnaire on Type D
      personality (DS 14), and SF-12 Questionnaire will be applied. At follow-up visits every 3
      months, HADS, SF-12 Questionnaire, Shock Sensation Questionnaire, number of shocks since
      preceding follow-up visit, and medications (cardiovascular drugs, psychopharmacological drugs
      and barbiturates) will be evaluated. Home Monitoring ICD Impact Questionnaire will be
      collected at the final 18-month follow-up.
