      smokers.

      At week 0, participants attend three outpatient visits at baseline. Each participant is
      randomized to one of four groups: Resistance Training(RT)/Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT),
      RT/No NRT, No RT/NRT, and No RT/No NRT. Those receiving RT work with a certified personal
      trainer 3 times per week for 12 weeks at 60 minutes each session. Those receiving NRT use the
      nicotine patch daily for 12 weeks and call the California Smoker's Helpline for smoking
      cessation counseling. Those in the control group do not receive any intervention and maintain
      their current lifestyle and habits.

      At week 13, participants return for three post-intervention assessments.

      At week 26, survey data is collected to assess changes in lifestyle habits.
