    
      STRIDER Canada is one of a consortium of STRIDER randomised controlled trials (RCTs) each of
      which is designed to determine whether or not maternal treatment with oral sildenafil citrate
      improves perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by EO IUGR without increasing risks to
      the mother.

      STRIDER Canada is designed as investigator-initiated double-blind, randomised
      placebo-controlled trial of 90 women with a diagnosis of early-onset intrauterine growth
      restriction with an intention-to-treat analysis. 90 Women with affected pregnancies will be
      recruited and randomised to receive either sildenafil or placebo.

      Women reviewed in the participating fetal medicine with a diagnosis of a pregnancy affected
      by early-onset IUGR between 18+0 and 27+6 weeks of gestation and serum PlGF levels less than
      5th percentile for gestational age will be considered for randomisation. In Canadian STRIDER,
      the treatment with either sildenafil or placebo (25 mg 3 times per day) will be applied from
      the time of randomisation until delivery, or up to 31+6 weeks of gestation whichever comes
      first.

      All patients randomly assigned to one of the treatments will be analysed together, regardless
      of whether or not they completed or received that treatment, on an intention to treat basis.
