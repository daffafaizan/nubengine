      I. Safety and tolerability of administering carfilzomib in combination with hyper-CVAD
      chemotherapy.

      II. Recommended dose of carfilzomib in combination with hyper-CVAD chemotherapy for the
      future phase II trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rate of remission after 2nd and 4th cycles. II. Incidence of minimal residual disease by
      flow cytometry at 4th cycle.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of carfilzomib.

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 0, 1, 7, and 8.
      Patients also receive hyper-CVAD comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours every 12 hours
      for 6 doses beginning on day 1, vincristine sulfate IV on days 4 and 11, doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 2-24 hours on day 4, and dexamethasone orally (PO) on days 1-4 and
      11-14 (courses 1 and 3) and methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1, cytarabine IV over 2
      hours every 12 hours for 4 doses starting on day 2, leucovorin calcium IV or PO every 6 hours
      beginning 36 hours after the start of methotrexate infusion, and methylprednisolone IV every
      12 hours for 6 doses beginning on day 1 (courses 2 and 4). Patients with cluster of
      differentiation (CD)20 positive disease also receive rituximab twice daily on days 1 and 11
      of courses 1 and 3 and days 1 and 8 of courses 2 and 4. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
