      measurable lesion at least. After general assessment, MUC-1 CART treatment was given to the
      participants. Objective remission rate, disease control rate, duration of overall response,
      progression-free survival, overall survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints
      events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the MUC-1 CART could or couldn't effectively
      control the progress of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
