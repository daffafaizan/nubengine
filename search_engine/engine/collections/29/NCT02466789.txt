      of a novel screening assay as a diagnostic screening assay for VWD variants: Type 1C, 2A, 2B,
      2M and 2N. Once the subject is enrolled into the study, a minimum of 0.5ml of citrated plasma
      will be collected and analyzed at the Bleeding and Clotting Disorders Institute Laboratory in
      Peoria Illinois. Results will be collected: phenotype function profiles will be determined,
      statistically analyzed and compared to the qualitative data from Blood Center of Wisconsin.
      Data is expected to correlate as previously shown in prior studies and will confirm the
      utility of this assay.
