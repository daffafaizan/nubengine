      hospital stay, hospital cost, and cognitive impairment. Occupational Therapy (OT) improves
      independence at discharge, and reduction in delirium in patients undergoing mechanical
      ventilation. This study compares the efficacy of non pharmacological standard prevention
      (control group) versus intensive nonpharmacological prevention (experimental group) in the
      delirium duration in older admitted CCU.
