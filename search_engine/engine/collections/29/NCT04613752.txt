      management of the most severe patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It
      allows to provide a protective lung ventilation by reducing the level of airway pressures
      generated by the ventilator. The objective is to minimize the harmful effects of mechanical
      ventilation in the lungs and to provide adequate gases exchanges. This strategy requires a
      deep sedation to allow a perfect synchrony between the patient and the ventilator. Such a
      synchrony puts the respiratory muscles - in particular the diaphragm - completely at rest.

      Given the prolonged duration of this strategy, the question of its impact on the occurrence
      on diaphragm dysfunction has been raised. Such a dysfunction has been associated with
      prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and poor outcomes but its effect in patients
      with veno-venous extracorporeal oxygenation membrane has never been evaluated so far.
