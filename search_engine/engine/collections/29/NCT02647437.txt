      epilepsy; these doses are generally well tolerated (Patsalos, 2000). Most relevant to the
      proposed study, LEV (125 mg twice-daily, two week administration) has been shown to reduce
      hippocampal hyperactivity and improves cognition in patients with mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI).

      The proposed study will administer 125 mg of immediate release LEV twice-daily for two weeks.
      This dose was chosen to potentially maximize efficacy while minimizing side effects. The
      proposed dose is substantially lower than the most common dose used clinically for epilepsy
      treatment of 3000 mg/day.
