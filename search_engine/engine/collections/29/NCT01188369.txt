    
      Levosimendan or placebo will be infusion for approximately 4 hours prior to aortic valve
      replacement in patients with severe hypertrophy of the left ventricle and echocardiographic
      signs of diastolic dysfunction. Outcome measures will be obtained at some of the following:

        -  Approximately 4 hours prior to surgery. Baseline. Start of levosimendan/placebo infusion

        -  Immediately before surgery

        -  After induction of anaesthesia and before "knife time" = start of surgery.

        -  At the end of surgery: Levosimendan infusion will stop.

        -  Approximately 4 hours after surgery immediately before extubation.

        -  Approximately 21 hours after surgery

        -  Approximately 96 hours after surgery (day 4)

        -  6 months after surgery

      Outcome measures are comprised of invasive measurements, blood samples, transthoracic
      echocardiography and transoesophageal echocardiography focusing on measures of systolic and
      diastolic function of the heart.

      Interim analysis will be conducted after 30 included patients.
