      problem. Brief interventions for alcohol (BI) for injured ED patients have been demonstrated
      to be effective, and perhaps more so for MVC patients.

      Telephone interventions have been utilized in varying ways in health care. We compared the
      delivery of two brief interventions by telephone against an assessment only condition.
      Participants who received the BI and the assessment only condition were contacted 3 and 12
      months after recruitment. Data about alcohol use, injuries and high risk behaviors, including
      drinking and driving behaviors were collected at the 3 and 12 month follow-up assessments.
