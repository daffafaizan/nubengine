      radiotherapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become the standard treatment for patients
      with high risk factors cervical cancer. However, the treatment modality in patients with
      low-risk (lymph node negative) is still disputable. It is not yet known whether
      cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy are more effective than radiotherapy alone in treating
      these patients.

      Therefore, the investigators are going to perform the efficacy and safety study of
      postoperative concurrent paclitaxel/cisplatin chemoradiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone in
      lymph node negative patients with early-stage cervical cancer following radical hysterectomy.
