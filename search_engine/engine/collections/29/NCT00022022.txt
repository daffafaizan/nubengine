        -  Compare the quality of life of patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer
           treated with 2 different schedules of docetaxel as second-line therapy.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the response rate, time to progression, and survival of these patients treated
           with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), response to prior chemotherapy (partial or
      complete response vs stable disease vs progressive disease), and prior cisplatin-containing
      chemotherapy regimen (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a
           maximum of 6 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment continues every 8
           weeks for a maximum of 2 courses.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and days 22 and 43-56 for arm I, and at baseline and
      days 22 and 43 for arm II.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
