      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of vaccination with human and mouse gp100 DNA in
           patients with stage IIB, IIC, III, or IV melanoma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Compare the antibody and T-cell response in patients treated with two different
           vaccination schedules.

      Secondary

        -  Assess antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, crossover, dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive human gp100 DNA vaccine intramuscularly (IM) once in weeks 1, 4,
           and 7. Patients then receive mouse gp100 DNA vaccine IM once in weeks 10, 13, and 16.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive mouse gp100 DNA vaccine IM once in weeks 1, 4, and 7. Patients
           then receive human gp100 DNA vaccine IM once in weeks 10, 13, and 16.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6-9 patients (at least 3 per treatment arm) receive escalating doses of human and
      mouse gp100 DNA vaccines until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 9 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 weeks and then annually for
      15 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9
      months.
