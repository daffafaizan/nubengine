      Respiratory Syncytial Virus(RSV), a virus that causes mild 'common colds' in adults, but can
      cause lung inflammation and difficulty breathing in infants and the elderly. In 2005, nearly
      34 million cases in children <5 years occurred, resulting in 3.4 million hospital
      admissions,and around 120,000 deaths. There is no vaccine, and some previous vaccines
      actually made the disease worse.

      The investigators have been trying to understand why for 40 years. Advances in immunology
      have given us a completely different way of looking at inflammation: rather than studying
      what causes it, the investigators now want to know what regulates it. Much of what the
      investigators know about how what causes and regulates inflammation has come from studies of
      animals, however, these do not exactly predict what happens in man.

      The investigators therefore plan to infect healthy adult volunteers with RSV, and observe
      what happens in humans after RSV infection. The investigators will collect samples of blood,
      fluid and cells from the nose, throat, and lungs, and a diary of symptoms over four weeks.
      The investigators will analyse the blood, fluid, and cells to determine the important
      mechanisms that regulate inflammation in human RSV infection.

      Studies like this have been conducted previously with no severe side effects. The
      investigators anticipate that the discoveries made in this research project will help us
      achieve a better understanding of what causes and regulates inflammation in RSV so that the
      investigators can learn ways to control it, with the aim of developing vaccines and
      treatments.
