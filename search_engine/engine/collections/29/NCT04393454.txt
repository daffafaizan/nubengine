      patients with metastatic mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors remain scarce.
      Pre-clinical data suggests that dMMR tumors are susceptible to rapamycin (sirolimus), a mTOR
      inhibitor. In these tumors, characterized by higher levels of oxidative stress, sirolimus can
      exert a cytotoxic effect, led by the failure to repair DNA damage by inhibition of
      antioxidant enzymes such as FOXO3a triggered by Akt hyperactivation.

      This proposal presents a phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of
      sirolimus in patients with dMMR solid tumors after immunotherapy. The investigators
      hypothesize that sirolimus will increase the overall response rate (ORR) by 20%.
