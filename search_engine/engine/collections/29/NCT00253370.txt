      I. To evaluate the response rate (complete response and partial response) of the combination
      of BAY 43-9006 with docetaxel and cisplatin or oxaliplatin in patients with gastric and GEJ
      adenocarcinoma.

      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.

      III. To evaluate the toxicities of BAY 43-9006 in patients with advanced and metastatic
      gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma combined with docetaxel/cisplatin or docetaxel/oxaliplatin.

      IV. To evaluate Raf status in the tumor and to correlate response and PFS to the presence or
      absence of an activating mutation in B-Raf.

      V. To analyze the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic properties of BAY 43-9006 including
      angiogenesis, monooxygenases, polymorphisms and multidrug-resistance (MDR). This study will
      be conducted via the E1Y03 mechanism.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      Siewert's tumor location (I vs II vs III) and extent of disease (locally advanced
      unresectable vs distant metastases).

      Patients receive oral BAY 43-9006 twice daily on days 1-21. Patients also receive docetaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

      An addition of an arm containing oxaliplatin was proposed after meeting the accrual goal but
      did not move forward and the study was closed to accrual in July, 2007 with a final accrual
      of 44 patients.
