    
      The key objective of this observational registry is to prospectively collect data to
      facilitate the quantification of potential short- and long-term benefits of
      Renaissance-guided spine surgery. It establishes a common framework for collaboration between
      surgeons performing Renaissance-guided spine surgeries in either minimally invasive (MIS) or
      open surgical approaches.

      The main endpoints that will be collected are surgical endpoints (e.g. complication rates),
      patient reported outcomes (e.g. VAS, ODI), imaging parameters (e.g. coronal and sagittal
      alignment, mainly in reconstructive surgeries for spinal deformities) and technical
      parameters (e.g. use of intraoperative fluoroscopy, ratio of planned vs. executed screws).
