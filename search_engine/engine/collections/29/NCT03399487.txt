      clinically selected population (never smokers) and 5% in genetically selected population
      (EGFR-/ALK-wild-type). These data strongly suggests that ROS1 rearrangement is a potential
      therapeutic target with relatively high incidence. In this study, investigator confirmed the
      presence of ROS1 fusion by RT-PCR and correlation between FISH and IHC (Cell Signaling
      TechnologyÂ®).

      LDK378 is an orally highly selective and potent ALK kinase inhibitor. In preclinical studies,
      LDK378 has much lower IC50 values than crizotinib in cell lines engineered to express ROS1
      rearrangement (0.15 nM versus 3 nM) and is approximately 20-fold more potent. LDK378 is a
      potent inhibitor of tumor growth in rodent models of both ALCL and NSCLC.

      Investigators suggest a phase II trial of LDK378 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      patients with ROS1 rearrangement. The aim of current trial is to evaluate the antitumor
      efficacy and safety profile of LDK378.
