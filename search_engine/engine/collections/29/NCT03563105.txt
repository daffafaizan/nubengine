      (MI) next generation Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) system, "The Ox-Imager Mini".
      Potential circulatory compromise will be imaged in healthy volunteers using both the subject
      and predicate devices (Ox-Imager CS) in a Vascular Occlusion Test (VOT) model. The VOT model
      is an established paradigm to introduce transient ischemia in skin and the the subjects will
      be imaged during this time. The primary endpoint will be to measure significant decrease in
      tissue oxygen saturation after occlusion for both predicate and subject devices.
