      in 1/500 to 1/1000 live births . It was first described in 1942 as an endocrine disorder
      characterised by small, hard testicles androgen deficiency, gynaecomastia and increased
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Osteoporosis is a progressive bone remodelling disorder
      in which bone loss exceeds bone formation. The resulting micro-architectural defects and bone
      fragility are associated with increased fracture risk and mortality. In KS, testosterone
      deficiency is associated with decreased bone mass and low bone mineral density (BMD) , and a
      positive correlation of total serum testosterone and BMD has been reported . There are some
      exceptions ; however, most studies have reported that KS increases the risk of osteopenia and
      osteoporosis compared with age-matched control groups.
