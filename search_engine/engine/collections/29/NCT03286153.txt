    
      This is a randomized, prospective, multicenter, open-label, crossover study to examine
      whether or not the current recommended factor dosing strategy, i.e., dosing by actual body
      weight in overweight and obese patients, may deliver more clotting factor than necessary to
      cause bleeding to stop in participants with Hemophilia A who use Factor VIII (FVIII). This
      study also examines ways to prevent delivering too much factor by using a participant's ideal
      body weight as a new dosing strategy compared to the current dosing strategy. The hypothesis
      being tested is that factor dosing based on ideal body weight will result in hemostatic
      factor levels.

      The study will be conducted at the Washington Center for Bleeding Disorders (WCBD) at
      Bloodworks Northwest, Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), Seattle Children's Hospital
      (SCH), and Providence Sacred Heart Children's Hospital (SH). Cumulatively across the four
      sites, up to 20 participants will be enrolled. Randomization will be performed centrally at
      WCBD.

      Participants will provide their own factor. Prior to the first study-related dose,
      participants will stop taking any FVIII products for either 48 hours if currently using a
      short-acting FVIII product or 72 hours for a long acting FVIII product. Factor levels will be
      measured immediately before and at multiple points after two different factor doses. Subjects
      will be randomized to start their dosage based either on actual body weight or ideal body
      weight first and then crossover to receive dosage based on the other category.
