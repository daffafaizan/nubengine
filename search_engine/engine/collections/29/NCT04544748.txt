    
      GNR-051 is a monoclonal antibody, targeting the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) membrane receptor
      on T lymphocytes and other cells of the immune system. The anti-PD-1 antibody, preventing the
      binding of the PD-1 receptor with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, reactivates the pool of
      tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment and, thus, reactivates
      the antitumor immunity. GNR-051 is able to block the signaling molecule PD-1, which
      suppresses the antitumor immune response, for the treatment of cancer.
