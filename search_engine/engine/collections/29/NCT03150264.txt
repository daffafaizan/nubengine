      phenomenon. More and more obese patients are undergoing bariatric surgery every year.

      Obesity results in a series of physiological changes particularly the respiratory system. The
      decrease of lung compliance and the limited total lung capacity, vital capacity, functional
      residual capacity are all contributed to intraoperative hypoxemia and postoperative lung
      complications. Presently study mainly discuss lung protective ventilation strategies from
      four aspects: tidal volume,ventilation modes,positive end-expiratory pressures and lung
      recruitment maneuvers.

      This prospective study will compare two ventilation modes in obese patients undergoing
      bariatric surgery:pressure-controlled ventilation(PCV) and pressure-controlled ventilation
      volume-guaranteedï¼ˆPCV-VG).

      The total of 100 patients will be divided into two groups randomly. The patients will be
      ventilated with PCV or PCV-VG modes plus positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5cmH2O
      throughout the whole operation.

      The respiratory and hemodynamic parameters in six time points will be recorded, and the
      postoperative chest computerized tomography (CT) will be checked to identify the
      postoperative lung complications.
