      known for it's causative effect of chronic pancreatitis and nonbeneficial effect on quality
      of life. Clinical equipoise regarding the impact of alcohol and smoking cessation still
      exists, due to the non existence of well designed clinical trials. The aim of the REAPPEAR
      study is to investigate the effect of cessation program of alcohol and tobacco use on the
      recurrence of acute pancreatitis.

      The REAPPEAR Study is a combined clinical trial involving a randomized multicenter clinical
      trial (REAPPEAR-T), which assesses the effect of the cessation program on the recurrence of
      the acute pancreatitis, and a cohort analysis, which investigates the effect of smoking and
      alcohol cessation on the recurrance of acute pancreatitis. Daily smokers, hospitalized with
      alcohol-induced pancreatitis will be included in the trial. Standard cessational intervention
      will be provided for all patients before enrollment. Laboratory testing, measurement of blood
      pressure and BMI will be performed, while also hair, urine samples and blood will be
      retrieved for later biomarker measurement. The evaluation of motivation to change, addiction,
      quality of life and socioeconomic status will be recorded at every visit, which will take
      place every 3 months or yearly according to the random allocation. For patients, who present
      at visit of every 3 months a brief intervention will be provided, together with a laboratory
      testing to provide feedback. The primary composite endpoint of this study will be the
      recurrence rate of acute pancreatitis irrespective of etiology and all-cause mortality in a 2
      year timeframe. The cost-effectiveness will be also evaluated.
