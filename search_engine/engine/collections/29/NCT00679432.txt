    
      Each patient will receive one of the following regimens in the morning after breakfast:

        1. one budesonide-MMX™ 6 mg tablet plus two placebo Asacol® over encapsulated tablets, or

        2. one budesonide-MMX™ 9 mg tablet plus two placebo Asacol® over encapsulated tablets, or

        3. two placebo Asacol® over encapsulated tablets plus one placebo budesonide tablet, or

        4. two Asacol® 400 mg over encapsulated tablets plus one placebo budesonide tablet, daily
           for 8 weeks.

      Each patient will also receive on each day after the midday meal and after the evening meal
      either:

        -  two Asacol® 400 mg over-encapsulated tablets (Group 4), or

        -  the equivalent placebo Asacol® over-encapsulated tablets, (Groups 1, 2 and 3)

      Hence, each patient is to take seven tablets per day of active or placebo study medication as
      per the randomization schedule. Placebo tablets of budesonide-MMX™ and placebo
      over-encapsulated tablets of Asacol® will be used to maintain the study blind using a
      double-dummy technique.

      During the study, five visits to the clinical center are scheduled: one at Screening and
      three in the double-blind treatment period (Day 1, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 56). A safety
      follow up visit will take place about 2 weeks after the final study visit. If a patient is
      withdrawn from the study before Day 56, they will be asked to attend the study center as soon
      as possible thereafter so that the Final visit assessments can be conducted.
