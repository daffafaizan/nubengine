      comorbidities to that of duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Inspite of its
      encouraging results, the pretended feasibility of the operative procedure can be associated
      with a remarkable operative morbidity. The main reason is gastric leakage from stable line
      which occurs in about 0-20% of the cases. The main accepted cause of leakage is formation of
      a high gastric tube pressure. Injection of BTX-A into the pyloric sphincter intraoperative
      will cause temporal paralysis of pyloric sphincter muscles postoperatively; so the pressure
      inside the gastric pouch will be decreased abolishing the formation of high pressure tube
      with subsequent leakage.
