        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated
           with etoposide, ifosfamide with mesna, and cisplatin.

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to number of prior chemotherapy courses for
      metastatic disease (0 vs 1).

      Patients receive etoposide IV over 60-90 minutes, cisplatin IV over 30 minutes, and
      ifosfamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Mesna is administered IV over 15 minutes 30
      minutes prior to and 4 hours after ifosfamide, then orally at 8 hours post infusion.
      Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 36 patients (16 per stratum) will be accrued over 36 months.
