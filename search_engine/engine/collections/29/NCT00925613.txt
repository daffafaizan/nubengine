      lung and proper exposition of the surgical site during thoracoscopies and thoracostomies.
      Unfortunately, because of the length and diameter of the double lumen tube, it is known to
      cause more irritation in the upper airways thereby inducing cough at emergence. In turn,
      cough has been associated with numerous multisystemic complications. Severe respiratory
      complications include laryngospasm or upper airway obstruction, desaturation, vocal cord
      injury, tracheal and bronchial ruptures. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      exchange of the double lumen tube before emergence with a laryngeal mask airway (Proseal) or
      a tracheal tube will reduce cough at emergence.
