    
      Randomization is in the ratio of 1:1 to either Sym004 (Arm A) or TAS-102 (Arm B) in
      genomically-selected patients with chemotherapy-refractory or relapsed metastatic colorectal
      carcinoma (mCRC) and acquired resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy.

      Following consent, centralized genomic analysis will be conducted on blood samples obtained
      from each potential patient. Double-negative (DN) results as defined in trial inclusion
      criteria will be required for initial eligibility prior to randomization. Patients with
      DNmCRC will continue in the screening process. Once deemed fully eligible, patients will be
      randomized to either Arm A or Arm B (collectively referred to as protocol therapy).

      Dosing cycles of 28 days with the assigned protocol therapy will continue until a
      protocol-specified discontinuation criterion is met. Following treatment discontinuation,
      patients will continue to be followed for OS.
