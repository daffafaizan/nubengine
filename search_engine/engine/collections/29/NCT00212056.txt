      are limited by reperfusion injury. In animal models, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) reduces
      infarct size, so the Japan-Working groups of acute myocardial Infarction for the reduction of
      Necrotic Damage by ANP(J-WINDANP) designed a prospective, randomized, multicenter study, to
      evaluate whether ANP as an adjunctive therapy for AMI reduces myocardial infarct size and
      improves regional wall motion.

      Twenty hospitals in Japan will participate in the J-WIND-ANP study. Patients with AMI who are
      candidates for PCI are randomly allocated to receive either intravenous ANP or placebo
      administration. The primary end-points are (1) estimated infarct size (Î£creatine kinase and
      troponin T) and (2) left ventricular function (left ventriculograms). Single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be associated with the function of ANP and susceptibility of
      AMI will be examined. Furthermore, a data mining method will be used to design the optimal
      combinational therapy for post-MI patients.

      J-WIND-ANP will provide important data on the effects of ANP as an adjunct to PCI for AMI and
      the SNPs information will open the field of tailor-made therapy. The optimal therapeutic drug
      combination will also be determined for post-MI patients.
