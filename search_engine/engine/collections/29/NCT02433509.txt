      a stem cell) isolated from UCB (blood obtained at birth from the umbilical cord blood of
      babies). StemCyte, a leading accredited UCB banking company with branches in the United
      States and Taiwan, will provide the units of UCB that match at least 4 out of 6 HLA (human
      leukocyte antigens) for transplantation. The HLA-matching is the same as that used to match
      cells and organs for transplantation so that the body does not reject the cells. Then cells
