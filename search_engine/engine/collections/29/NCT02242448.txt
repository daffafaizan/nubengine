      subjects with disease will be used to test, develop and optimize CT protocols. The results of
      this optimization will be used to evaluate the performance of new imaging methods and
      equipment, and to provide essential ground work for research and development for use in
      future patient CT studies. CT imaging is a noninvasive technology. As appropriate, MRI scans
      will be used to compare to CT imaging findings to help validate the CT methods.
