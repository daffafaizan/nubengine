      safety of Revanesse Ultra versus the approved product Restylane in the cutaneous correction
      of NLFs. Randomization followed a 1:1 within-subject control model of augmentation correction
      of NLFs. Given that the implants have been shown to not migrate, the within-subject model was
      ideal and had already been shown in previous studies to detect differences. Subjects with
      signs of NLFs who met the entry criteria were enrolled. All subjects were followed for
      efficacy and safety for 6 months. Subjects could have open-label retreatment as needed with
      Revanesse Ultra at 6 months if their baseline WSRS scores had returned to baseline, or as
      needed to achieve optimal correction if their baseline WSRS scores had not returned to
      baseline and were followed for a total of 12 months. The study design was appropriate for the
      indication studied.
