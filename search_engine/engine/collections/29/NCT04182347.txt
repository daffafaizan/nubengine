      Special Olympics to create capacity building working groups. Groups will collaborate to
      develop stakeholder training modules focused on leadership, research fundamentals, and
      health. Collaboratively developed trainings will be piloted to support revising of the
      Toolkit for the engagement of people with IDD in research. A range of stakeholders will be
      essential members of the team to design and provide critical feedback on the effectiveness of
      the Toolkit, research priorities, and ecologically valid methodologies. Finally, research
      priorities will be refined, and the research engagement Toolkit will be nationally
      disseminated to Special Olympics and relevant community organizations. The toolkit will
      include necessary training for people with IDD, as well as paid and unpaid caregivers to be
      engaged partners in research.
