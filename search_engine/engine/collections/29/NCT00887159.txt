      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with extensive stage small
      cell lung cancer (SCLC-ED) treated with cisplatin and etoposide (CE), CE with hedgehog (HH)
      inhibitor GDC-0449 (vismodegib), and CE with insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R)
      monoclonal antibody (IMC-A12) (cixutumumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response rate, overall survival, and toxicity for each arm. II. To explore
      putative correlates of clinical benefit from combination therapy in tumor and circulating
      tumor cells in patients treated on this protocol.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A (CE): Patients receive cisplatin (75 mg/m^2) intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on day 1
      and etoposide (100 mg/m^2) IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B (CE +GDC-0449): Patients receive cisplatin and etoposide as in Arm A and vismodegib
      (GDC-0449; 150 mg tablet) orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then receive vismodegib alone QD in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C (CE + IMC-A12): Patients receive cisplatin and etoposide as in Arm A and cixutumumab
      (IMC-A12; 6 mg/kg) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive
      cixutumumab alone once weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.
