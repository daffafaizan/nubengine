      CMV-specific, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
      (CTL) clones (CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones) and CD4+ CMV-specific T-helper (Th)-cell clones
      is effective in preventing CMV viremia and disease in CMV-positive patients with malignancies
      requiring allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. II. Determine
      whether the transfer of CD4+ CMV-specific Th-cell clones to patients with deficient responses
      can reconstitute CD4+ Th-cell activity and augment adoptively transferred CD8+ CMV-specific
      CTL clones.

      OUTLINE: Allogeneic CD8+ CMV-specific, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted
      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones (CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones) and CD4+ CMV-specific
      T-helper (Th)-cell clones are harvested and cultured in vitro at least 2 weeks before bone
      marrow or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation. Bone marrow or PBSC are infused
      on day 0. Patients receive the first infusion of CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones beginning
      between days 28 and 45 posttransplantation, followed 8 days later by the second infusion,
      followed 2 days later by the first infusion of CD4+ CMV-specific Th-cell clones. Patients who
      receive prednisone posttransplantation or have deficient CD8+ CTL responses (i.e., less than
      50% of the response measured in the immunocompetent bone marrow donor) after the second
      infusion of CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones receive a third infusion of CD8+ CMV-specific CTL
      clones and a second infusion of CD4+ CMV-specific Th-cell clones before day 67.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
