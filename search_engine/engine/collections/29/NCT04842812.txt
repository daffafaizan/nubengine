    
      1. Choose appropriate patients with advanced lung or other cancers, with written consent
           for this study;

        2. Perform biopsy or collect cancerous effusion in thorax or abdomen to obtain TILs by
           standard protocol;

        3. Grow TILs and engineered the tumor-effective TILs with CRISPRA-CAS9 technique to
           knockdown PD1 and electronic-transfection strategy to express scFvs that target PD1 and
           CTLA4; amplify the engineered T cells as needed, test the quality and killing activity
           of the TILs and then transfuse them back the patients via systemic or local injections
           via standard protocol, and follow up closely to collect related parameters as needed;

        4. To enhance the killing capability, tumor-noneffective TILs have also been genetically
           engineered to express various CARs targeting HER2/Mesothelin/Lewis-Y/PSCA/MUC1/
           GPC3/AXL/EGFR/Claudin18.2/B7-H3/ROR1/GD2/AXL/Claudin6-DAP10 with knockdown of PD1/HPK1
           as appropriate;

        5. Evaluate the clinical results as needed.
