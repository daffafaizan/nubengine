      dysfunctions are frequent in fibromyalgia syndrome. Kinesiophobia is defined as fear and
      avoidance of physical activities, and it can lead to increased disability in patients with
      chronic pain. Although there is a relationship between cognitive functions and physical
      performance in Fibromyalgia Syndrome, the relationship between kinesiophobia, fibrofog, and
      quality of life are required to be investigated.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. To compare the kinesiophobia and cognitive functions in Fibromyalgia Syndrome with
           healthy volunteers

        2. To examine the relationship between the severity of kinesiophobia, cognitive functions,
           disease activity, quality of life, physical activity level, depression and anxiety
           severity in Fibromyalgia Syndrome.

      The hypothesis is, the patients diagnosed with Fibromyalgia Syndrome have higher
      kinesiophobia severity and worse cognitive functions, and also that kinesiophobia severity is
      associated with cognitive dysfunction, disease severity, physical activity level, and
      psychiatric symptoms in patients with Fibromyalgia Syndrome.
