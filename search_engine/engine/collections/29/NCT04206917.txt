    
      A prospective non-randomized feasibility study involving acute testing of MPT in subjects
      with paroxysmal and persistent AF during clinically indicated atrial fibrillation catheter
      ablation procedure.

      Subjects will be split into 2 cohorts depending on status at time of procedure.

        1. In Atrial Fibrillation at time of procedure (Clinical AF)

        2. In Normal Sinus Rhythm at time of procedure

      Subjects will be evaluated at the visits for the Clinically-Indicated Procedure per standard
      of care. A single follow-up at up to 30 days post-procedure is required to assess subjects
      for adverse events.
