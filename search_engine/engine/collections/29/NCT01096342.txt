      I. To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) of single agent SCH 727965 in patients
      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities associated with use of single agent SCH 727965 in patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To evaluate the response duration and progression free survival among patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma undergoing treatment with single agent SCH 727965.

      III. To study the effect of SCH 727965 on myeloma cell proliferation, apoptotic rates and to
      assess the ability of the drug to inhibit drug targets (cyclin dependent kinases, cdk in the
      myeloma cell.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for correlative studies. (US sites
      only)

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 3 years.
