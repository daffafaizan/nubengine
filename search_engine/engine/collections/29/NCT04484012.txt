      I. Evaluate the safety of adding CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched
      T-lymphocytes (CD19 CAR T cells) to acalabrutinib treatment. (Safety Lead-in) II. Estimate
      the complete response (CR) rate within 6 months after adding CD19 CAR T cells to
      acalabrutinib treatment. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess best response, time to and duration of CR. II. Estimate the 1-year progression free
      survival (PFS) rate and overall survival (OS).

      III. Describe the full toxicity profile.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess CD19-CAR T cell persistence. II. Assess CD19-CAR T cell activity as measured by
      CD19 B cell aplasia. III. Describe the duration of CR from completion of acalabrutinib. IV.
      Describe immunogenicity of CD19-CAR T cells in the presence of the BTK inhibitor.

      V. Characterize CD19 expression on tumor cells. VI. Describe cytokine profile after CD19-CAR
      T cell infusion. VII. Determine BTK and PLCG2 mutational status prior to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -5 to 28 of cycle 1 and
      on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive CD19 CAR T cells intravenously (IV)
      on day 0. Treatment with acalabrutinib repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have not attained CR
      after the first disease assessment and tolerated the initial CAR T cell infusion may receive
      a second CAR T cell infusion in cycle 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months, then
      yearly for up to 15 years post CAR T cells infusion.
