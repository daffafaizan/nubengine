      breast cancer, downstaging or the achievement of a complete pathologic remission before
      definitive surgery has been associated with the lowest risk of recurrence of breast cancer.
      In order to achieve a better response in these patients in the preoperative setting, this
      study combines 3 potentially synergistic agents. Letrozole blocks the synthesis of estrogens
      and, in doing so, deprives the tumor from hormones which drive its growth. Everolimus is a
      drug that blocks growth factor signaling which is essential for tumor cells to maintain their
      growth and proliferation. Everolimus has already been shown to work very well in this subtype
      of breast cancer in the recurrent and metastatic setting. TRC105 is an investigational agent
      that prevents the formation and growth of new blood vessels that support tumors by providing
      oxygen and nutrients.

      The study has 2 components. First the investigators will determine the ideal in terms of
      tolerance combination of doses of the 3 agents. Once the ideal regimen is determined, more
      patients will be treated with the investigational combination. During this second stage, the
      investigators will get a preliminary idea of how effective the investigational therapy is.
      Further studies will need to be done to confirm the efficacy of the investigational
      combination.
