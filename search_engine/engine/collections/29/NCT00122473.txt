      primary and locally relapsed dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a cutaneous
      neoplasm well known for its overexpression of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).
      Herein, imatinib provides a systemic treatment option that offers the possibility of a
      reduction of the wide surgical margins used today in surgery of primary DFSP, or even of a
      complete avoidance of surgical treatment in this disease. Since imatinib exerts its function
      via interference with protein tyrosine kinase activities, it inhibits the platelet-derived
      growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) signaling cascade that plays a crucial role in the
      pathogenesis and tumor growth of DFSP. Since imatinib has been shown to shrink metastatic
      lesions of DFSP, there is a strong rationale to expect that it also decreases cell
      proliferation and tumor growth in primary DFSP.
