      lymphoma. However, in particular in aggressive B-cell lymphoma, only very few, small studies
      have investigated the role of bendamustine in the treatment algorithm. The aim of the current
      B-R-ENDA trial is to investigate efficacy and toxicity of the combination treatment of
      bendamustine and subcutaneous rituximab in old patients or in elderly patients with high
      comorbidity who do not qualify for a CHOP like treatment. The results of this study will form
      the basis of a larger, prospective randomized phase III trial.
