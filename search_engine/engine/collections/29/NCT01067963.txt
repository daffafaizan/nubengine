      counseling methodology. The combined intervention involves computer-aided education alongside
      telephone counseling via motivational interviewing. The computer-aided education is tailored
      to the diagnoses of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease and designed in a learning
      module approach to facilitate goal-setting and discussion of health concerns with greater
      efficacy and in a more informed way during the brief office visit. Such Computer-aided
      education has been used to improve diabetes self-management and glycemic control in
      middle-aged to older adults with moderate success. The inclusion of CKD information will
      augment current diabetes self-management intervention. The telephone counseling using the
      evidence-based behavioral change approach of motivational interviewing is a patient-centered
      approach of partnering with patients by eliciting their health-related concerns. This
      approach tailors the SMaRT intervention to include collaborative goal-setting with guidance
      based upon the patient's readiness for change.
