      to diagnose and is often missed entirely. The natural progression of SL instability has been
      suggested to lead to osteoarthritis. The management of SL instability can be broadly divided
      into conservative and surgical, with the former being the first option taken by most medical
      professionals, which primarily involves physiotherapy. The evidence base for physiotherapy
      management of SL instability is limited; however cadaver research has identified loading some
      of the wrist tendons may stabilise the scaphoid and lunate.There is currently no research as
      to whether this clinically makes any difference to the patients symptoms, or how to do it.
      This research therefore aimed to test the protocol and methods, and act as a platform for
      larger studies, to investigate this.

      Two different exercises approaches were tested; one to strengthen the tendons in static
      positions and the other to strengthen the tendons whilst the wrist is moving.
