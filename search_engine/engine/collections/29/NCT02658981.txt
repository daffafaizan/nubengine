    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine a maximum tolerated dose or maximum administrated dose of anti-lymphocyte
      activation gene-3 (LAG-3) antibody (BMS-986016) (anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016)
      and anti-cluster of differentiation 137 (CD137) antibody (BMS- 663513) (urelumab) given
      independently and in combination with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody (nivolumab,
      BMS-936558) safely in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate overall survival. II. To estimate 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) rate.
      III. To estimate radiographic response (radiographic assessment in neuro-oncology [RANO] and
      immunotherapy response assessment for neuro-oncology [iRANO]).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-LAG-3 antibody (BMS-986016), anti-CD137
      antibody (BMS- 663513), and/or anti-PD-1 antibody (BMS-936558) on biomarkers in peripheral
      blood, including the T cell compartments, and serum proteins (cytokines and other immune
      modulators).

      II. To assess the pharmacodynamic activity in tumor tissue and peripheral blood in treated
      subjects who undergo optional tumor biopsies.

      III. To explore potential associations between biomarker measures and anti-tumor activity by
      analyzing markers of inflammation, immune activation, host tumor growth factors, and
      tumor-derived proteins in the pre-treatment and on-treatment setting.

      IV. To further characterize the occupancy and immune cell function at multiple dose levels of
      anti-LAG-3 antibody (BMS-986016), anti-CD137 antibody (BMS-663513), and/or anti-PD-1 antibody
      (BMS-936558).

      V. To explore characteristics of tumor immune microenvironment changes after the treatment of
      anti-LAG-3, anti-CD137, and its combination treatment with anti- PD-1 in surgically indicated
      patients undergoing tumor resection

      OUTLINE:

      PART A: This is a dose-escalation study of the monotherapy of Anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody
      BMS-986016 and Anti-CD137 (urelumab). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 intravenously (IV) on days
      1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive anti-CD137 (urelumab) IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for up to 15 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PART B: This is the dose-escalation combination therapy portion study of Anti-LAG-3
      monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 plus Anti-PD-1(nivolumab) and Anti-CD137 (urelumab) plus
      Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab). Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) IV over 60 minutes and anti-LAG-3 monoclonal
      antibody BMS-986016 IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
      urelumab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      (2pts enrolled before the Anti-CD137 antibody (BMS-663513 - urelumab) treatment arm closed by
      BMS on 10/16/18 due to closure of BMS Urelumab development program. Subjects currently on
      treatment may continue.)

      INTRATUMORAL STUDIES: Patients enrolled on the Intratumoral Studies surgical arm
      pre-operatively receive either anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016 as in Part A Arm I,
      urelumab as in as in Part A Arm II, nivolumab and anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016
      as in Part B Arm I, or nivolumab and urelumab as in Part B Arm II. Within 45 days of surgical
      resection, patients post-operatively receive either anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody BMS-986016
      as in Part A Arm I, urelumab as in as in Part A Arm II, nivolumab and anti-LAG-3 monoclonal
      antibody BMS-986016 as in Part B Arm I, or nivolumab and urelumab as in Part B Arm II.

      (3pts enrolled before the Anti-CD137 antibody (BMS-663513 - urelumab) treatment arm closed by
      BMS on 10/16/18 due to closure of BMS Urelumab development program. Subjects currently on
      treatment may continue.)

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60 days, every 2 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter. Patients taken off treatment for other reasons
      than disease progression are followed up every 2 months for 1 year.
