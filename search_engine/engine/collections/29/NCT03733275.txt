      plan to investigate the effect of preoperative lidocaine spray and lidocaine-bupivacaine
      mixture-soaked nasal packing for the patinets undergoing nasal closed reduction under general
      aensthesia, compaing to the control group (normal saline spray and normal saline-soaked nasal
      packing).
