    
      Bortezomib is a standard therapy of newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma and is also approved for
      relapsing disease, requiring the patients to travel to the outpatient-hospital (OH) once a
      week for several months. Hospital-at-Home (HaH) might be an attractive and suitable
      alternative in this situation.

      This study aim to perform a cost-utility analysis of two different strategies in several HaH
      structures within the Grand Est region in France: exclusive hospital-based Bortezomib
      administration versus combined administration in both OH and HaH.
