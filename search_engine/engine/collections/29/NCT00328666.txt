      safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of structured IY vs. enhanced usual care in adults with
      high-normal to stage I HTN. All potential subjects will be screened first by telephone and
      then by an outpatient visit at the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at either the
      hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) or the Presbyterian Medical Center (PMC).
      Eligible subjects will then make 4 visits to the GCRC where, during 3 visits, they will be
      admitted overnight to have non-invasive 24 hour recordings of blood pressure and heart rate
      variability as well as periodic blood and urine collections. In order to assess durability of
      biologic effects once the formal intervention is stopped, we added a 4 week follow up visit.
      The entire study duration is 18 weeks (16 weeks post-randomization) and includes a total of 5
      visits. Subjects will be randomized to either the IYP or Blood Pressure Education Program
      (BPEP) which will be incorporated into off-site, small group classes.
