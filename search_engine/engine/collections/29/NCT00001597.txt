      treatment, and many are managed poorly. Basic and applied research on pain treatment is
      hampered by the unobservable nature of pain sensation and the lack of validated measures of
      this perception.

      The purpose of this protocol is to develop and validate improved subjective measures of pain
      sensation and use these measures to evaluate pain sensitivity in clinical populations. Normal
      volunteers rate experimentally-evoked pain sensations before and after double-blind
      administration of the opioid fentanyl or saline placebo. Patients rate experimentally-evoked
      pain sensations without any drug administration.
