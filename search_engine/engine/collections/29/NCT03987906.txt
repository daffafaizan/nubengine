      early to specialized palliative care teams, they had improved QOL, symptom control, and
      greater satisfaction with their cancer care. Such routine specialized palliative care
      intervention, while effective, may be challenging to enact broadly with widespread shortages
      of palliative care physicians. STEP systematically identifies patients with the greatest
      need, using symptom screening at every outpatient visit, with triage and targeted referral to
      palliative care. This could reduce resource use while directing care to the most vulnerable.

      Consenting patients from Breast, Lung, Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, and Gynecology
      medical oncology clinics will be assigned randomly either to receive STEP or to follow usual
      symptom screening. All patients will complete questionnaires measuring outcomes of QOL,
      symptom control, depression, and satisfaction with care at recruitment, 2, 4 and 6 months.
      The investigators will measure the impact of STEP on these outcomes, compared to screening
      alone.
