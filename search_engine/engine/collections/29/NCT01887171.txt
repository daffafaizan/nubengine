      transplantation with resource consuming and costly treatment, increased risk of multiorgan
      failure and 6-months mortality.

      Ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) is a main reason for early allograft liver dysfunction.
      Inflammatory response to brain death in donor can precipitate the extent of dysfunction after
      reperfusion in recipient (1). Clear inflammatory pathways in response to IRI have been
      reported to be associated with early allograft liver dysfunction (2,3). It was shown that ex
      vivo intraportal tacrolimus perfusion suppressed inflammation and immune response in the
      transplanted liver on a genome-wide basis (4).

      We hypothesize that Tacrolimus added to HTK solution given through intraportal and
      intraarterial back-table infusion is capable of reducing the degree of early allograft liver
      dysfunction, as assessed by incidence of postreperfusion hyperfibrinolysis, postoperative
      levels of AST,ALT, during 1-7 postoperative days as well as serum and histochemical markers
      of liver injury and inflammation compared to no intraportal and intraarterial back-table
      infusion.
