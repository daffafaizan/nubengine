      until their retinas (membrane at the back of the eye which collects and transfers light) is
      fully grown. These exams are done to see if they have developed ROP, a disease which can lead
      to blindness if not treated.

      The ophthalmologist (eye doctor) looks through the enlarged pupil (opening at the front of
      the eye) to see the retina. The drug that is used to dilate the pupil, Cyclomydril, has been
      shown to have side effects in premature infants. No literature has shown what the optimal
      dose is for premature babies. Nursery policy is to give 3 drops of Cyclomydril in each eye,
      at 5 minute intervals, 45-60 minutes before a scheduled eye exam. We sought to reduce the
      dose without delaying the exam for an under-sized pupil.

      In the study, each infant is randomized at the time of the exam to receive either 0, 1 or 2
      drops of Cyclomydril in the left eye and 3 drops in the right eye to serve as their own
      control. The zero-drop group was created to test the contralateral (opposite eye) effect of 3
      drops in the right eye. Pupil dilation size is measured using the Colvard pupillometer by a
      Pediatric Ophthalmologist examiner (G.V.V.) who was not masked to study group assignment.

      Measures of pupil size are done at baseline (before any drops given), 45, 90 and 120 minutes
      after the first drop was given. ROP screening exam is done at the first opportunity to
      visualize the posterior and peripheral retina.

      Additional drops are given at 120 minutes if the observer is unable to complete the exam
      prior to that point.
