    
      This study is a prospective, pilot study using the Attune Medical esophageal heat transfer
      device to actively cool the esophagus during RF ablation procedures. This design is
      appropriate to gather the data needed regarding overall procedural time, compare this to
      historical controls, and estimate a sample size for a larger study powered for statistical
      significance.

      The subjects will undergo preparation and anesthesia procedures following standard practice.
      Once the patient is intubated, the esophageal heat transfer device will be placed into the
      esophagus according to the Instructions for Use (IFU). The device will remain in place until
      the ablation procedure is completed and will be removed before extubation. Posterior left
      atrial wall ablation using standard parameters will only be performed when the esophageal
      heat transfer device has reached a temperature of 4-6 degrees C for at least 2 minutes. The
      device will be set to neutral or warming temperature (37-42 degrees C) during other aspects
      of the procedure (such as mapping and anterior wall ablations).

      All patients will be followed up in total for 6 weeks (Long Term Follow-up visit) after the
      procedure to document any clinical complication related to thermal esophageal injuries if
      applicable.
