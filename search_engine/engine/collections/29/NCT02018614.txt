      The methodology of the validation of our translation procedure consists of studying the
      reliability of the scale in two major steps:

        -  Data from a sample of 50 patients will be used to explore the test-retest reliability of
           the scale administered by the same trained clinician, on two occasions four hours apart,
           without any treatment in between. The ALGOPLUSÂ® scores obtained from the patients at a
           time t will be compared with their (t + 4 hours) scores to assess test-retest
           reliability.

        -  For a sample of at least 50 patients, two physicians trained for the use of ALGOPLUS,
           will assess pain independently. A statistical test will be used to compare the results
           for the inter-rater reliability.
