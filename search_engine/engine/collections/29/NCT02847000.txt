      induced DNMT1 protein level decreases with an effect size of 1 using a paired t-test and
      alpha=0.05. The effect size is defined as the difference in mean DNMT1-protein levels between
      post-treatment and pre-treatment divided by the standard deviation and is thus a metric of
      change in the natural units of the distribution, its standard deviation. Our goal is thus to
      detect drops in DNMT1 of at least one standard deviation.

      Secondary Objectives Secondary goals include correlating DNMT1 decreases with clinical
      response (measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST1.1]), using
      logistic regression; time to relapse, using a Cox model; tolerability and safety assessment
      by toxicity characterization using CTCAEv4.

      Study Design Single-arm, open-label, proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer that has progressed on one or more lines of systemic therapy.
