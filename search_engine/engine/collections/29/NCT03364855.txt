      affects physically active young adults and causes pain front of the knee. Patients with PFPS
      has bilateral impairment in proprioception, as well as more in the affected knee than the
      normal; also the decrease of muscular strength, range of motion, and neuromuscular control
      are known to result with impaired static and dynamic balance. We aimed to investigate the
      efficacy of a-four week YDT balance exercises on pain, quality of life and functional state
      in patients with PFPS with impaired balance.

      Patients with PFPS diagnosed will included in the study. Participants will randomized into
      the YDT exercise group (n = 24), the KAT 2000 exercise group (n = 24) and the combined
      exercise group (n = 24). Before the study, all groups of patients will given exercises such
      as quadriceps, vastus medialis oblique (VMO), hip abductor, extensor and external rotator
      strengthening exercises. All patient groups received balance training for four weeks, three
      days a week.

      Pain intensity will be measure on Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Functional capacity will be
      evaluated by using the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Kujala
      Patellofemoral Score (KPS). Static balance performance will be evaluated by using Kinesthetic
      Ability Trainer 2000 (KAT 2000) and dynamic balance performance will be evaluated by using
      Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and KAT 2000. The quality of life will assessed using Nottingham
      Health Profile (NHP).
