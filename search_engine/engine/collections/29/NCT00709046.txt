      bleeding. Endoscopy serves as a tool for initial diagnosis and triage and also a tool for
      immediate hemostasis, especially for high-risk lesions. High-risk lesions include peptic
      ulcers with active spurting vessel, oozing vessel, or NBVV, nonbleeding visible vessel.
      Current modalities of endoscopic hemostasis include epinephrine injection, endoscopic
      coaptive thermocoagulation, hemoclipping. Endoscopic hemostasis has been documented by a
      number of clinical studies to be effective in decreasing rebleeding, need for emergency
      surgery, decreasing hospitalization days. Current evidence also shows that combination
      therapy with epinephrine injection and heater probe thermocoagulation/hemo-clip hemostasis is
      more effective than epinephrine injection alone or than heater probe thermocoagulation alone,
      or than hemoclip hemostasis alone. Studies showed a high dose intravenous proton pump
      inhibitor infusion after initial endoscopic hemostasis reduced recurrent ulcer bleeding.
      However, it was still controversial whether an adjuvant use of standard-dose proton pump
      inhibitor therapy to endoscopic therapy had similar benefit. We hypothesized that an adjuvant
      use of standard dose of proton pump inhibitor after combined endoscopic hemostasis therapy
      offer similar benefit as high dose proton pump inhibitor did.
