    
      This is a prospective, single blind, randomized, multi-center cross-over trial in patients
      with Primary Immune Deficiency. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of primary Immune
      Deficiency will be treated with two daily infusions given 3-4 weeks apart at the fixed
      individual IGIV dose regimen (400-600 mg/kg) established prior to entry into the study. Any
      subject with an established dose in the range of 200-399 mg/kg will be assigned to receive
      400 mg/kg during the course of the study during the same dosing schedule established prior to
      entry into the study.

      After a screening period lasting not more than four weeks, patients will be randomized into
      one of two cross-over groups. Patients randomized to Group 1 will receive their first IGIV-C,
      10% dose at a rate of 0.08 mL/kg/min and their second infusion at a rate of 0.14 mL/kg/min,
      whereas patients randomized to Group 2 will receive IGIV-C, 10% at a rate of 0.14 mL/kg/min
      on the first infusion day and then 0.08 mL/kg/min on the second infusion day. All patients
      just prior to each IGIV-C, 10% infusion will receive the same volume of 5% dextrose as
      calculated for their IGIV-C, 10% infusion and given at a target rate according to the schema
      below.

      Group 1:

        -  Infusion #1 (Week 0)Dextrose (0.14 mL/kg/min), then IGIV-C, 10% (0.08 mL/kg/min)

        -  Infusion #2 (Week 3-4)Dextrose (0.08 mL/kg/min), then IGIV-C, 10% (0.14 mL/kg/min)

      Group 2:

        -  Infusion #1 (Week 0)Dextrose (0.08 mL/kg/min), then IGIV-C, 10% (0.14 mL/kg/min)

        -  Infusion #2 Dextrose (0.14 mL/kg/min), then IGIV-C, 10% (0.08 mL/kg/min)
