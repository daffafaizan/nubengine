    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose of RO4929097 in
      combination with temozolomide and radiotherapy in patients with glioblastoma or malignant
      gliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of RO4929097 when given in combination with temozolomide
      (correlative study C1).

      II. To evaluate brain and tumor penetration of RO4929097 when given in recommended phase II
      single agent schedule and when given at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination
      with radiotherapy and temozolomide (correlative study C2).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of RO4929097 in the resected specimens, and comparison
      with specimens obtained from untreated patients.

      II. Effects of RO4929097 on the cancer stem cell population (correlative study C4).

      III. Effects of RO4929097 on angiogenesis (correlative study C5). IV. To evaluate the
      combined effects of RO4929097, radiation and temozolomide in explants established from
      patients' tumor specimens (correlative study C6).

      V. To evaluate the effects of RO4929097 on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters
      (correlative study C7), including dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI perfusion, diffusion
      weighted imaging and volumetric analysis.

      VI. Preliminary evaluation of efficacy of this treatment regimen: 6 month (6m) and median
      progression-free and overall survival, and response rates.

      VII. To evaluate potential biomarkers of gamma-secretase and Notch inhibition activity
      (correlative study C8).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      PRE-SURGERY TREATMENT: Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor
      RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 of week 1 and day 1 of week 2.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgery 2-3 hours after administration of gamma-secretase/Notch
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 on day 1 of week 2.

      TREATMENT CONCURRENT WITH RADIOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-4 weeks after surgery, patients undergo
      conventional focal (intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT] or 3-D conformal)
      radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6 weeks. Patients also receive
      gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD for approximately 10 weeks
      beginning the day of radiotherapy and temozolomide PO QD for approximately 6 weeks beginning
      the day before radiotherapy.

      ADJUVANT TREATMENT FOLLOWING RADIOTHERAPY: Approximately 4 weeks after completion of
      radiotherapy, patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097
      PO QD on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
