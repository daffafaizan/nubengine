      unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI
      114). II. Determine the objective tumor response rate, time to objective tumor response, and
      duration of response in these patients (if retrospective data is available, time to tumor
      progression while on prior gemcitabine is determined). III. Determine the clinical benefit of
      MGI 114 as measured by pain improvement, performance status, and weight. IV. Determine the
      survival rate at 3, 9, and 12 months in these patients. V. Gain additional information on the
      toxic effects and safety profile of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive
      6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI 114) IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment is repeated
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      followed monthly for up to 1 year after therapy initiation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
