      effectiveness of micro-osteoperforations to accelerate tooth movement. The study sample
      consisted of 22 consecutive subjects - 12 females and 10 males - between the ages of 18 and
      35, who were selected for ortho-surgical treatment and pre-molar extraction assigned for
      decompensation. The participants were randomly allocated to two groups: control (anterior
      retraction was performed using implant-assisted sliding mechanics with self-ligating
      brackets) and experimental (micro-osteoperforations were performed in the activation
      appointments for anterior retraction using implant-assisted sliding mechanics). For immediate
      and follow-up assessment of patients' perceptions, comparing regular orthodontic activation
      and activation with Accelerated Orthodontics, subjects were asked to complete an electronic
      questionnaire OHIP-14, to assess the participants' comfort level, experiences, and QoL
      impact.
