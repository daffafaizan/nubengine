      in each study arm. This investigation is a single blind randomized control trial
      investigating the post-procedural analgesic effect of adding a corticosteroid (Triamcinolone)
      as an adjuvant to a SHNB that contains bupivacaine for patients undergoing UAE, compared to
      patients undergoing nerve block for pain control following UAE with local anesthetic only.
      Before and after the procedure, patients will be asked to complete online surveys in order to
      record their pain score (measured on the Visual Analog Pain Scale), opioid and other pain
      medication use, and other symptoms, such as nausea.
