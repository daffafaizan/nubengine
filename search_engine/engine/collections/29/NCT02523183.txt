      substance on medically refractory epilepsy in children. The risks associated with this use
      are not well known. There have recently been reports of stroke, liver dysfunction and altered
      anticonvulsant levels. In addition, there have been long term risks reported of decreased
      memory function, cognitive problems and executive function abnormalities. This study does not
      condone or advocate the use of the substance but merely seeks to document the short term
      effects of the use in this population. It should be noted that providers at Children's
      Hospital Colorado are not registered providers for medicinal cannabis; therefore, this will
      be an observational study of effects of this substance as prescribed by other physicians
      outside of our institution.
