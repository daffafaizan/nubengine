      bypass (CPB), and are associated with many deleterious consequences, including increased
      pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), reduced
      myocardial contractility, and ultimately right ventricular failure. Right ventricular failure
      during weaning from CPB increases the risk of mortality and morbidity, especially in patients
      with elevated PAP prior to cardiac surgery. Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been
      shown to decrease PVR and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and improve right ventricular
      function in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In animal models, ERAs have been
      shown to decrease the incidence of post-bypass pulmonary hypertensive crises. The primary
      objective of this trial is to demonstrate that tezosentan, a dual ERA, reduces the incidence
      of clinically relevant right ventricular failure in patients with pre-operative pulmonary
      hypertension, due to left heart disease, undergoing CPB.
