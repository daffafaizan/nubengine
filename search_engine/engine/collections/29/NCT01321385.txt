      Primary

        -  To validate the accuracy of a pre-specified acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction
           response classifier or the My Profileâ„¢ AML Induction Therapy Assay (run in a Good
           Laboratory Practice [GLP] laboratory using Good Manufacturing Practice [GMP] reagents)
           in predicting response to cytarabine-based induction chemotherapy in pediatric patients
           with non-M3 AML.

      Secondary

        -  To validate the continuous score from the pre-specified induction response classifier as
           a predictor of response to induction chemotherapy, after controlling for the
           simultaneous effects of clinical variables at base-line and/or pre-induction therapy
           (e.g., age, WBC, and percentage [%] of blasts), and tests commonly available after the
           start of induction therapy (e.g., cytogenetics and molecular markers).

        -  To validate the accuracy of the pre-specified induction response classifier as a binary
           predictor of induction response using a pre-specified cutpoint to assign patients to no
           response (NR) or complete response (CR) groups.

        -  To validate the accuracy of the pre-specified induction response classifier as a binary
           predictor of induction response using a pre-specified cutpoint to assign patients to NR
           or CR groups, after controlling for the simultaneous effects of clinical variables at
           base-line (pre-induction therapy) (e.g., age, WBC, % blasts) and clinical variables,
           including tests commonly available after start of induction therapy (e.g., age, WBC,
           cytogenetics).

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved bone marrow mononuclear cell specimens are analyzed by cell networking
      profiling assays. Results are then compared with patient outcomes and demographics from
      COG-AAML03P1 and COG-AAML0531 studies.

      Molecular markers analyzed include Flt3ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, and MRA.
