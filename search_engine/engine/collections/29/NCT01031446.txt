    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Safety profile of cisplatin, paclitaxel, and everolimus (RAD001) in patients with
           metastatic breast cancer. (Phase I)

        -  Progression-free survival (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Overall response rate

        -  Time to progression

        -  Number of patients with worst-grade toxicities Tertiary

        -  To determine p53, p63, p73, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) levels by
           immunohistochemistry (IHC).

        -  To screen for exon 9 (E542K and E545K), exon 20 (H1047R), and phosphatidylinositol
           3-kinase (PI3K) (p110Î±) mutations in DNA extracted from paraffin blocks.

        -  To correlate IHC results with clinical outcome and with the different subtypes of breast
           cancer determined by molecular classification (basal-type vs luminal A vs luminal B)
           based on microarrays of RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks.

        -  To generate microarrays of RNA extracted from fresh-frozen core biopsies (when
           available) to identify a pretreatment gene signature that mirrors the established p63
           and p73 gene signatures that predict response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline for correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
