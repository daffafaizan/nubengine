      commonly used medicine to treat swelling which is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration) for use in children; 2. A solution of table sugar in water (simple syrup);
      and 3. Ora-Plus, which is a solution that can be added to medicines. Ora-Plus is considered
      safe for use in children's formulas and all of the ingredients of Ora-Plus are on the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) list. About 1 ml of each
      substance will be placed directly onto the tongue. Each substance will be tasted for 5-10
      seconds and then, expectorated. Participants and investigators recording responses will be
      blinded with regard to the identity of test substances.

      Facial expression will be recorded prior to administration of the taste substances and for
      approximately 2 minutes thereafter. An audio recording of the participant's voice will also
      be made during this time. At about 5 and 10 minutes after a given taste substance is
      administered, participants will be asked to identify a face on a 5-point facial hedonic scale
      which shows the participant's taste perception. Participants will also be asked to describe
      the taste sensation experienced as sweet, bitter or neutral (no apparent taste).

      Participants will have a 30-minute rest period after administration of each taste substance
      which will include the administration of water and a neutral food to enable cleansing of the
      palate. The procedure above will be repeated in the same way for each of the 3 test
      substances.
