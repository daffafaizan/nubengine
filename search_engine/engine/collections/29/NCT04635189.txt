      dexamethasone, given upfront in newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible patients with myeloma.
      Patients participating in the study will be recruited from the Wilmot Cancer Institute,
      University of Rochester in Rochester, New York and all University of Rochester community
      affiliates.

      Patients will be treated with 1800 milligrams of Daratumumab subcutaneously or 16
      milligrams/kilograms daratumumab intravenously (IV) weekly for 8 treatments, followed by
      every 2 weeks for 8 treatments, followed by every 4 weeks. Patients will be treated with 25
      milligrams of Lenalidomide days 1-21 out of a 28 day cycle (dose adjustments for creatinine
      clearance) and 20 milligrams of Dexamethasone at least 60 minutes prior to first infusion of
      daratumumab. Each cycle consists of 28 days (4 weeks).

      Response assessments by International Myeloma Working Group criteria for myeloma will be
      performed every 4 weeks while on therapy.
