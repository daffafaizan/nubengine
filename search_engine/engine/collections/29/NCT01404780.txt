      to be a very safe and useful device. It is a particularly useful for patients with difficult
      airways as it has a camera attached to the blade. Despite being used for double lumen tube
      (DLT) intubations, research of its effectiveness and safety, is lacking. The study aims to
      determine the speed and safety of the GVL for DLT insertion. This information will assist
      anaesthetists in choosing the appropriate laryngoscope for DLT intubation of their patients.
