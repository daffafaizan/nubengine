    
      This is a double-blind, single ascending dose administration study of four doses of CTP-499.
      Following dosing safety and tolerability will be assessed. Blood and urine samples will be
      taken for pharmacokinetics (PK) and bioavailability. Safety assessments will include
      monitoring of adverse events, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and
      oral temperature), clinical laboratory findings, 12-lead ECGs, and physical examination
      findings.

      The plasma concentration time data for CTP-499 and its metabolites will be analyzed using
      noncompartmental methods. Actual dosing and sampling times will be used for analysis. The
      primary pharmacokinetics parameters are: Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, AUClast and AUCinf for plasma;
      relative bioavailability; and Ae and CLr for urine.
