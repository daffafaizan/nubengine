      consciousness. At present, the underlying neurological determinants of recovery in patients
      with disorders of consciousness (DOC) after a severe TBI are not well understood, and
      individual prognosis is very limited. Moreover, the rate of misdiagnosis between different
      states of altered consciousness by standard clinical scales is high, which further impacts on
      the clinical prognosis. In this project, multimodal neuroimaging measures will be applied and
      whole-brain data will be obtained from patients recovering from severe TBI in a longitudinal
      fashion. Patients will be examined at four time points during the sub-acute stage:
      immediately after admission to the neurorehabilitation unit, after ten weeks of admission, at
      discharge, and after one year of the TBI episode. Brain connectivity will be assessed with
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) combined with electroencephalography (EEG),
      structural MRI, diffusion MRI, high-density EEG (hdEEG) alone, and hdEEG combined with
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (EEG-TMS), and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography (FDG-PET).

      The overall aim of the study is to find reliable biomarkers for the recovery of consciousness
      based on changes in cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical brain connectivity. In order to
      explore this, patients that suffered a severe TBI as well a matched healthy participants
      group will be included in the study.
