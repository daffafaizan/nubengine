    
      1. To determine levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in liver
           transplant patients during post-transplant period

        2. To correlate changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of oxidative stress to
           acute renal failure and acute rejection

        3. To determine the impact of using N-acetylcysteine on cytokines and markers of oxidative
           stress and the incidence of acute renal failure post liver transplantation
