      medications for relief being hormonal preparations. Non-hormonal medications have
      demonstrated efficacy but at a far lower level than estrogen replacement therapy. For women
      with a history of breast cancer, hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and is
      not an option for women receiving endocrine therapy including tamoxifen (TAM) and aromatase
      inhibitors (AI). Breast cancer survivors, and women receiving endocrine therapy in
      particular, have a high rate of problematic hot flashes. In an open label Phase 1 study of
      the safety and activity of Q-122 in breast cancer patients taking TAM or an AI, 8 of 9 women
      who received at least 1 dose of 100 mg and 10 of 11 women who received at least 1 dose of 200
      mg had a reduction in hot flashes of 2 or more per day, the FDA criteria for anti-VMS
      activity. This study will define the effect of Q-122 versus placebo in a population of women
      with a history of or current breast cancer who have an average of 50 or more moderate to
      severe hot flashes per week.
