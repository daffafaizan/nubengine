      by Mallinckrodt® is a disposable polyvinyl chloride plastic tube that has one hooded Murphy
      tip eye at the end of the tube. The Murphy tip eye is to help with ventilation and air
      passage if the main end is occluded with mucus or a foreign body. Another type of (ETT) is
      the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT), which has a soft flex-tip that is configured to pass easily
      through the airway anatomy and has two Murphy tip eyes. Currently there are no published data
      comparing the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT) with standard Mallinckrodt® (ETT) when the GlideScope®
      is used. The data are limited concerning the ease of intubation when using the Parker
      Flex-Tip® (ETT). The study is a two-factor randomized block intervention study design.
      Subjects assigned to the first group will be intubated using the standard Mallinckrodt®
      (ETT). The subjects assigned to the second group will be intubated using the Parker Flex-Tip®
      (ETT). Randomization will be accomplished using the sealed envelope technique. There are six
      anesthesia providers who will be using ETTs to intubate. A block design will be used to make
      sure each anesthesia provider receives the same number of patients randomized to the
      Mallinckrodt and to the Parker Flex-Tip® (ETT)s.
