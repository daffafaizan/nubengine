      with epinephrine 1:200000 via epidural cathetes at L2-3 or L3-4 in a volume suffient to
      achieve a T4 sensory level bilaterally.

      After the umbilical cord was clamped,patients were assigned randomly to three groups.The
      placebo group,N-5 group,and N-10 group received 4 ml epidural solution containing morphine 4
      mg plus either saline, nalbuphine 5 mg, and nalbuphine 10 mg respectively.At the post
