      subjects. In order to complete the treatment period simultaneously for all study subjects,
      the minimum treatment duration may be less than 52 weeks, with a maximum treatment duration
      of up to 3 years after the last subject is randomized, and a post-treatment follow-up period
      of 4 weeks. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either roxadustat (FG-4592) or
      placebo in a double-blind manner.
