      delivering TMZ to the brain, taking into account the anatomical structure of os ethmoidal.

      The most important factor in the effectiveness of the drug is the achievement of an adequate
      amount of the active agent in its unbound state with albumin on the blood of a patient and
      the exposure time to the tumour process. Failure to comply with this requirement
      (difficulties in overcoming the BBB) was identified as the main obstacle to the successful
      treatment of all types of brain tumours. Translation to improved clinical outcomes in a
      patient with GBM has not yet been realized. The investigators will use modified temozolomide
      (without changing the chemical formula) to exclude as much as possible Anosmia, Hyposmia and
      other violation of the identification of odours with participants.
