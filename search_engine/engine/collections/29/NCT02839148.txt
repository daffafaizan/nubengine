    
      The stunted children will receive an intervention package which includes food supplementation
      (FS) with one egg and 150 ml of whole milk supplementing the usual home diet, 6 days a week
      for 3 months; psychosocial stimulation (PS) for 6 months, and routine clinical care monthly
      for 6 months. The control children will receive routine clinical care but no FS and PS.
      Routine clinical care includes micronutrients powder, de-worming, health and nutrition
      education and immunization. All children will be assessed for appetite score (ECAST score)
      and anthropometry-at baseline then monthly for 6 months; food intake at baseline then monthly
      for 3 months, and cognitive development using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler
      Development, third version (Bayley-III) on enrolment and at 3 and 6 months of enrolment.
      Blood samples will be collected to examine gut hormones, complete blood count and haemoglobin
      percentage.

      Stool samples will be collected for routine examination and stool biomarkers. Urine sample
      will be collected for screening urinary tract infection. All the specimens will be collected
      at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of enrollment.

      Outcome measures/variables:

      The primary outcome:

      Assessment of appetite score of stunted children aged 12-18 months compared to non-stunted
      children.

      The secondary outcomes are:

      -Association of appetite score with growth and development with potential biomarkers of
      appetite with child food intake and intestinal inflammation of the children.
