      Stage A is open label and all patients will receive HBI-3000. In each of three dose cohorts,
      up to 10 patients will receive HBI-3000 by IV infusion (30 minutes). For each dosing cohort,
      sentinel dosing is planned. Each patient may enroll only once in the study, will be enrolled
      into only one dose cohort and receive only a single dose treatment. In Stage A, three
      different dose levels are planned to be administered serially, lowest to highest, with
      assessment of safety, tolerability, and efficacy prior to proceeding to the next dose level
      group. The actual dose levels may be modified, and additional dose levels may be considered
      based on the observed results at each cohort.

      Stage B is the randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled part of the study. Study drug
      for Stage B patients is either HBI-3000 or placebo. Two cohorts will be enrolled
      sequentially, lowest dose level first, with safety, efficacy, and available PK results
      evaluated by the Sponsor and iDMC prior to enrolling patients in the next/higher dose cohort.
      The dose level for the second cohort may be adjusted following interim review of results in
      the first cohort. Patients will be randomized to receive a single IV infusion of HBI 3000 or
      placebo over 30 minutes. In each of the dose cohorts, sequentially enrolled patients will be
      randomized at 2:1 ratio so that 40 patients will receive HBI 3000 infusion and 20 patients
      will receive placebo infusion. Each patient may enroll only once in the study, will be
      enrolled into only one dose cohort and receive only a single dose treatment.
