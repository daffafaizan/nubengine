    
      This is a multi-center, assessor-blinded study aiming to evaluate the long term functionality
      in adults and children who have participated in study MW2004-11-02 (previous phase 3 study).

      We had previously shown that by using the MVSS scale which includes objective assessment of
      the physical characteristics of size, shape, volume, color, texture, and pliability as well
      as structural, mechanical and physiologic characteristics, lower (favorable) scores in
      Debrase vs. SOC group were observed in sub-groups of highly functional body parts of the
      hands and feet. This study will include specific functionality evaluation using the "Lower
      Extremity Functional Scale" test for burns in the lower extremities and the "QuickDASH"
      outcome measure for burns in the upper extremities as well as range of motion measurements of
      the joints (knee, ankle, shoulder, elbow and wrist, as relevant).
