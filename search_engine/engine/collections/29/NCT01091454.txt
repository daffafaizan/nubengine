    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify any clinical efficacy of brostallicin and cisplatin in the treatment of breast
      cancer patients having a triple negative (estrogen receptor [ER]/progesterone receptor
      [PR]/HER2 negative) phenotype, as measured by progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the confirmed tumor response rate of patients with measurable disease
      receiving brostallicin and cisplatin.

      II. To describe the duration of response in patients with measurable disease receiving
      brostallicin and cisplatin.

      III. To describe the 6-month progression-free survival of patients receiving brostallicin and
      cisplatin.

      IV. To describe the overall survival (OS) of patients receiving brostallicin and cisplatin.

      V. To evaluate the adverse event profile of the study regimen (adverse events graded using
      the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program [CTEP] Active Version of the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1 and brostallicin IV over
      10 minutes on day 2. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
