    
      The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus
      (RAD001) and lenalidomide in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard
      treatment or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer. The
      investigators seek to establish the safety of taking these two medications together and to
      determine the appropriate doses of the two drugs when given together as well as identify
      potential side effects when the drugs are administered together.

      Another purpose of this study is to find out if the medication works for the patient's kind
      of cancer and side effects of the combination of RAD001 and lenalidomide by looking at the
      patient's response to the treatment. The investigators want to find out what effects, good or
      bad, the drugs have on the patient's cancer.

      This study will also look at specific substances called biomarkers in the patient's blood and
      in the tumor tissue which are involved in the growth of tumor cells and determine if the
      levels of these biomarkers are related to the patient's response to treatment or development
      of side effects.

      An expansion cohort is currently enrolling patients with adenoidcystic carcinoma,
      neuroendocrine and kidney cancer.
