      and their antagonists can influence granulosa cell vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      production via OPRM1, causing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

      This study aims to investigate if a single exposure to opioids is enough to produce
      activation of stress mechanism during ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval. It will be measured
      the level of cortisone before and 15min after iv administration of fentanyl on blood and on
      oocyte fluid.
