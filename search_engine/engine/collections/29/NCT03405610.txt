      Recovery versus usual medical care. The Toolkit is delivered via secure live video to
      patients at risk for chronic pain, at 1-2 months after injury. The primary aim of this study
      is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the program, randomization, procedures
      and outcome measures. Secondarily, we report means and standard deviation and explore change
      in quantitative outcomes in the Toolkit compared to usual care.
