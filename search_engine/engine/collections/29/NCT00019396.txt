      patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or HLA-A2.1 negative melanoma.

      II. Evaluate the immunologic and biologic activity of Flt3L alone or in combination with
      melanoma peptide immunization (MART-1, gp100:209-217, gp100:280-288, and tyrosinase) in
      patients with metastatic, HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups:

      Group 1 (renal cell cancer): Patients receive Flt3 ligand (Flt3L) subcutaneously (SQ) alone
      on days 1-14.

      Group 2 (HLA-A2.1 negative melanoma): Patients receive Flt3L SQ alone on days 1-14.

      Group 3 (HLA-A2.1 positive melanoma): Patients may receive either Flt3L SQ alone on days 1-14
      or in combination with melanoma peptide immunization. Patients may receive melanoma peptide
      immunization comprised of MART-1 immunodominant peptide, gp100:209-217, gp100:280-288, and
      tyrosinase peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SQ on day 12 of Flt3L administration.

      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. Patients with no response or minor response
      may receive 2 additional courses. Patients with disease progression after 1 course are
      removed from study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      Approximately 54-96 patients (18-32 per treatment group) will be accrued for this study
      within 16 months.
