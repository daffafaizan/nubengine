      contrary to all other anesthetic drugs - it does not decrease blood pressure. It is widely
      believed that Ketamine increases intracranial pressure (ICP), which prevents its use in many
      emergency situations, including trauma and specifically in patients with traumatic brain
      injury (TBI) and with increased ICP. Based on our previous clinical experience in patients
      with ICP monitoring, Ketamine did not increase ICP. We therefore hypothesize that Ketamine
      decreases - rather than increases - ICP.

      Methods: Prospective, controlled, clinical trial performed in a Pediatric ICU of a regional
      trauma center. Children with ICP monitoring receive a single Ketamine dose (1-1.5 mg/kg)
      either for increased ICP and/or before a potentially distressing activity. Hemodynamic
      variables, ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) will be recorded 1 minute before and
      every minute for 10 minutes following Ketamine administration (before/after study design).

      Parents/guardian of patients will be informed and asked to sign an informed consent.
