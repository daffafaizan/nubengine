    
      Football players wear a football helmet containing the InSite Impact Response System that
      measures when, how hard, and where the helmet is hit. Coaches (or athletic trainer) are
      notified of threshold impacts via a sideline handheld device.

      Each year pre and post-season, subjects will complete several tests of brain function during
      a clinic visit. These tests are listed in the "secondary outcomes" section.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To quantify the cumulative head impact burden during consecutive seasons of youth tackle
           football and high school football.

        2. To detect impairment in neurologic and cognitive function from playing youth tackle
           football and high school football.

        3. To use cumulative head impact burden to predict the development of neurologic and
           neurocognitive impairment.

        4. To compare the effect of head impacts on youth tackle football players verses high
           school football players.
