      Subjects evaluated their symptoms over the previous 24 hours, noting the severity and
      duration of swelling at each of 5 locations (abdominal, genitourinary, facial, respiratory
      [including laryngeal], and/or extremity).

      The study design also allowed for administration of open-label C1INH-nf (1,000 U of C1INH-nf
      administered IV [repeated after 60 minutes, if necessary] for treatment of laryngeal
      angioedema or if deemed necessary by the investigator; 1,000 U of C1INH-nf administered IV
      [single dose] prior to emergency surgical procedures).

      A total of 26 subjects were enrolled in the study. One subject received open-label C1INH-nf
      but withdrew prior to randomization. Another subject was randomized but withdrew prior to
      receiving study drug. Twenty-four (24) subjects were randomized and treated with blinded
      study drug. In total, 25 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug and were analyzed
      for safety; all 25 subjects were exposed to C1INH-nf and 23 subjects were exposed to placebo.
