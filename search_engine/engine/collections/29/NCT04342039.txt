      act as both the control and tester (crossover design method). Participants will be provided a
      randomized treatment order of either 1) Budesonide (Rhinocort) or 2) placebo (no medication)
      nasal spray for the treatment trial. Participants will go through a series of nasal sampling,
      symptoms questionnaires, nasal inhalation flow readings during the in-person visits at the
      hospital. Investigators will also attempt to mimic allergen and pollution exposures, and
      track how the treatment affects one's nasal responses during visits. On days where
      participants do not have in-person visits, participants will continue using the treatment
      product on a daily basis. After one cycle of treatment, participants will go through a
      wash-out period before starting the second cycle with the opposite treatment (Budesonide
      (Rhinocort)/placebo).

      Investigators are not expecting that participants' responses to the treatments or exposures
      will be noticeable to the participants. Any responses that may occur will probably only be
      detectable through careful examination of the collected nasal samples on a genetic basis.
      However, being able to understand the subtle changes will help investigators optimize and
      better understand the use of these treatments in the future.
