      I. To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the fluid biopsy in establishing a
      diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the accuracy of determination of the histologic subtype of bronchogenic lung
      cancer.

      II. To determine the relative contribution of cell based high definition circulating tumor
      cell assay (HD-CTC) and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and plasma based circulating tumor
      deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) assays in determination of diagnosis and histologic subtype.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples on day 1 for analysis via high definition
      (HD)-single cell analysis (SCA) fluid biopsy. Medical charts of patients are reviewed at 3
      months post-biopsy or computed tomography (CT) screening.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 1 year.
