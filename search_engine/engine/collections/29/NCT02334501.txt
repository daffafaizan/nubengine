      conditions. On Day 1 of Period 1 (Treatment A), a single oral dose of neratinib will be
      administered followed by PK sampling for 72 hours. In Period 2 (Treatment B), multiple oral
      doses of lansoprazole will be administered once daily for 7 consecutive days with a single
      oral dose of neratinib administered on Day 5. PK sampling for neratinib will be taken for 72
      hours following neratinib dosing on Day 5. The washout period will be at least 14 days
      between each neratinib dose.
