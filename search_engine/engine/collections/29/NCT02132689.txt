      therapy. In case of troponin positivity and/or echocardiographic findings as i.e. thrombi in
      RV thrombolytic therapy should be considered. The aim of this trial is to compare the two
      treatment modalities in their ability to reduce/predict 12 month end-point: pulmonary
      hypertension, right ventricular failure, exercise capacity.
