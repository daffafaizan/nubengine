      hospital care, and to determine the extent to which these alterations affect whether
      hospitalized patients become colonized with healthcare-associated organisms. The study
      enables collection of clinical specimens and associated medical data to evaluate the natural
      history, epidemiology, and genomics of patients who might become colonized or infected with a
      multi-drug resistant organism. Biological specimens including stool, sputum, and swabs will
      be taken from Clinical Center inpatients at least 2 years of age as frequently as daily
      through discharge, and at follow-up visits for up to 2 years from the date of enrollment. To
      understand possible pathogen colonization and infection of hospitalized patients, this
      protocol will assess the full complement of the microbial-host-environmental contributions
      including: (1) microbial genome and community; (2) patient s genotype, underlying medical
      condition, medical treatment; and (3) hospital practices and environment.
