      Despite the functional importance, fingertip forces are rarely explicitly addressed with
      feedback in therapy. This gap in treatment is due to a lack of tools to provide explicit
      feedback on patients' volitional finger force generation. To address this unmet need, the
      investigators developed a novel tool for practice of volitional three-dimensional (3D) force
      generation with explicit feedback. The objective of this project is to determine if 3D finger
      force training is an effective tool in restoring hand function post stroke.

      Stroke survivors with moderate to severe hand impairment with at least palpable volitional
      grip force will randomly be assigned to either the experimental or control group, stratified
      by impairment level. Both groups will undergo 3 1-hr training sessions per week for 6 weeks
      in which they practice volitional finger force generation against force sensors. The
      experimental group will practice for various target force directions to explore the 3D force
      workspace and receive feedback in 3D force, while the control group will practice 1D force
      generation without feedback on other directional forces on a computer screen.

      Training will progress by increasing influence of flexion synergy by varying posture
      requirements and increasing force level, introducing feedback delay, and incorporating
      unilateral/bilateral activity. Evaluation will occur at baseline (3 times over 3 weeks to
      establish baseline trends) and every 2 weeks during 6-week intervention to determine pattern
      of progress, and at 1-month follow-up to assess retention.
