    
      Methods: This multicenter longitudinal cohort study will include ischemic stroke patients
      treated within a telemedical stroke care network and patients transferred to tertiary stroke
      centers for treatment procedures from hospitals outside the telemedical network. Individual
      patient data are available from two tertiary stroke centers and 24 primary and secondary
      stroke facilities in Northern Bavaria, Germany. Patients with ischemic stroke transferred to
      the tertiary stroke centers for treatment procedures - i.e. endovascular therapy or
      thrombolysis in stroke with an unknown time of onset - and all stroke patients with either
      large vessel occlusion (LVO) and/or thrombolysis therapy admitted to the University Hospital
      Erlangen will be integrated from institutional prospective stroke registries. Consecutive
      patients admitted between January 2006 and December 2019 will be included, an estimated total
      number of more than 3000 ischemic stroke patients - approximately 1000 patients with LVO
      receiving endovascular therapy, 1000 patients with LVO not receiving endovascular therapy and
      1000 patients without LVO receiving thrombolysis therapy.

      Demographic and clinical data including medical history, medication and laboratory results
      will be obtained by review of medical charts, institutional databases or prospective
      registries, supplemented by structured interviews on follow-up information or by review of
      all available medical records. In detail the following parameters will be evaluated: prior
      medical history (e.g. comorbidities, premorbid functional status, medication), admission
      status (e.g. NIHSS, GCS, body temperature, arterial blood pressure), cerebral imaging
      parameters (e.g. Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score [ASPECTS], perfusion volumes, mismatch
      and collateral status on admission imaging, final infarct volume on follow-up imaging),
      treatment procedures (e.g. intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular therapy, decompressive
      surgery), time intervals (e.g. symptom onset or last seen normal until admission, imaging,
      thrombolysis, groin puncture, recanalization), complications (e.g. hemorrhagic
      transformation, arterial dissection, distant ischemic stroke), laboratory parameters,
      clinical and diagnostic follow-up (e.g. neurological status, blood pressure, vascular
      ultrasound), stroke etiology, secondary prevention (e.g. lipid lowering medication,
      antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation) and clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, modified Rankin
      Scale).

      Ethics Approval: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
      Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.
