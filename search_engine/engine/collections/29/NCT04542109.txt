      dyad's (person with dementia and their family care partner) health, safety, mortality, and
      likelihood of nursing home placement. The first phase of this study involves redevelopment of
      the intervention program into a 3-session values-based needs assessment intervention
      (delivered over 6 weeks) designed for early-stage persons with dementia and their primary
      family caregiver (i.e. spouse or partner). A secondary data analysis and focus groups will be
      conducted in order to complete the redevelopment phase. Objective digital data on behavioral
      patterns (from sensors and wearables) will be incorporated into a needs assessment that will
      allow for dynamic tailoring of the READyR program to new and unforeseen care needs.

      People who voluntarily decide to participate in this study will be asked to participate in
      three sessions: Session 1 for baseline assessments gathered from all participants (including
      remote in-home monitoring), Session 2 for discussing the participant's care values and their
      alignment with current patterns of activities (assessed by remote monitoring) in the home,
      and Session 3 for addressing current dementia related care needs and setting goals for the
      future.

      Participants who complete this study will be offered participation in a follow-up monitoring
      period to further study the possibilities for dynamic tailoring of their dementia-related
      needs assessment.
