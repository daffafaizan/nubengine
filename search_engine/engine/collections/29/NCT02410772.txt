      Rifapentine-containing treatment shortening regimens for pulmonary tuberculosis: a
      randomized, open-label, controlled, phase 3 clinical trial

      Hypotheses:

      A) Seventeen (17) week rifapentine-based regimen In previously untreated individuals with
      active drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis treated with eight weeks of rifapentine (P),
      isoniazid (H), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) followed by nine weeks of rifapentine plus
      isoniazid, all given daily throughout, the proportion of participants who experience absence
      of cure (unfavorable outcome) will not be inferior to that observed in participants who are
      treated with a standard regimen (eight weeks of rifampin (R), isoniazid, pyrazinamide and
      ethambutol followed by eighteen weeks of rifampin plus isoniazid), all given daily
      throughout.

      B) Seventeen (17) week rifapentine- plus moxifloxacin-containing regimen In previously
      untreated individuals with active drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis treated with eight
      weeks of rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin (M), followed by nine weeks of
      rifapentine, isoniazid, and moxifloxacin, all given daily throughout, the proportion of
      participants who experience absence of cure (unfavorable outcome) will not be inferior to
      that observed in participants who are treated with a standard regimen (eight weeks of
      rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol followed by eighteen weeks of rifampin plus
      isoniazid), all given daily throughout.

      Phase: 3

      Design: This will be an international, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label,
      3-arm, phase 3 non-inferiority trial.

      Population: Patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis.

      Number of Sites: Multiple international sites, primarily sites of the Tuberculosis Trials
      Consortium and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.

      Study Duration: Duration per participant is approximately 18 months.

      Description of Agent or Intervention: After written informed consent, participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive one of the following oral regimens:

      Regimen 1 (control regimen): 2RHZE/4RH

        -  Eight weeks of daily treatment with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol,
           followed by

        -  Eighteen weeks of daily treatment with rifampin and isoniazid

      Regimen 2 (investigational regimen): 2PHZE/2PH

        -  Eight weeks of daily treatment with rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and
           ethambutol, followed by

        -  Nine weeks of daily treatment with rifapentine and isoniazid

      Regimen 3 (investigational regimen): 2PHZM/2PHM

        -  Eight weeks of daily treatment with rifapentine, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and
           moxifloxacin, followed by

        -  Nine weeks of daily treatment with rifapentine, isoniazid, and moxifloxacin

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of a rifapentine-containing regimen to determine whether the
           single substitution of rifapentine for rifampin makes it possible to reduce to seventeen
           weeks the duration of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of a rifapentine-containing regimen that in addition
           substitutes moxifloxacin for ethambutol and continues moxifloxacin during the
           continuation phase to determine whether it is possible to reduce to seventeen weeks the
           duration of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate the safety of the investigational regimens

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of the investigational regimens

        -  To collect and store biospecimens from consenting participants for the purpose of future
           research on discovery and validation of TB biomarkers

        -  To determine the correlation of mycobacterial and clinical markers with time to culture
           conversion, culture status at completion of eight weeks of treatment, treatment failure,
           and relapse.

        -  To conduct a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study of the test drugs. The main
           objectives of the PK/PD study are to characterize study drug PK parameters and to
           determine relationships between treatment outcomes and PK parameters.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz-based antiretroviral treatment among
           patients with TB/HIV co-infection taking efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral
           therapy and TB treatment with rifapentine

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoints:

        -  Efficacy: TB disease-free survival at twelve months after study treatment assignment.

        -  Safety: Proportion of participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events during study
           drug treatment

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  TB disease-free survival at eighteen months after study treatment assignment

        -  Time to stable sputum culture conversion (solid and liquid media considered separately)

        -  Speed of decline of sputum viable bacilli by automated liquid MGIT culture days to
           detection

        -  Proportion of participants who are culture negative at completion of eight weeks of
           treatment (solid and liquid media considered separately)

        -  Sensitivity analyses assuming all participants classified as 'not assessable' have a
           favorable outcome

        -  Discontinuation of assigned treatment for a reason other than microbiological
           ineligibility

        -  Estimated steady state efavirenz PK parameters including mid-dosing interval
           concentration
