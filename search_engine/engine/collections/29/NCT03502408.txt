    
      Study design is a prospective, single-center study of acute ischemic stroke patients with
      large artery occlusion in 6-24 hours of stroke onset. According to patients or their family
      members' willing, patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to endovascular
      thrombectomy group with approved devices (only the devices listed in this protocol are
      approved for us) plus standard medical therapy or control group (standard medical therapy
      alone) after undergoing either CT Perfusion or MR Perfusion studies. Patients who have
      evidence of an ICA or MCA M1 or M2 or BA occlusion and a Target Mismatch Profile will be
      enrolled.

      The intent of this study is to support thrombectomy beyond the currently labeled 8 hour
      indicated time limit in wake up, unclear onset, and late presenting ischemic stroke subjects,
      who currently have no other option besides medical management of their symptoms, with careful
      selection.

      The study will enroll up to 55 patients. The primary endpoint, the modified Rankin Score,
      will be assessed at 3 months.
