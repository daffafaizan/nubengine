      single center, 3 arms, prospective randomized controlled open study

      Objective:

      to determine the impact of luteal phase support on pregnancy rates in ovarian stimulation and
      IUI cycles with recombinant FSH in patients with unexplained infertility and mild male
      factor.

      Methods:

      All patients in all study groups will undergo a single insemination procedure and then will
      be randomized into 3 groups:

        1. Luteal support with progesterone only (they will received vaginal P gel (Crinone 8%
           vaginal gel; Serono, Israel)

        2. Luteal support with estrogen + progesterone [(Crinone 8% vaginal gel; Serono, Israel)
           and Estrofem 4mg].

        3. No luteal support

      Luteal support will begin after insemination and will be continued through the 12th week of
      gestation if the patient conceived. A pregnancy test will be performed 2 weeks after
      insemination (Serum hCG) an intrauterine pregnancy will be confirmed using a transvaginal
      ultrasound 2 weeks after a positive pregnancy test. If no pregnancy will be achieved patients
      will undergo 3 treatment cycles preferably in the same treatment group.
