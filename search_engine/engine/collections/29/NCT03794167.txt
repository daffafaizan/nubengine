      allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic and
      non-hematologic malignancies.

      The investigators have previously studied that conditioning regimen of i.v.
      busulfan/melphalan/etoposide (BuME) was well tolerated and effective in patients with
      relapsed or high risk NHL. And busulfan/cyclophosphamide/etoposide (BuCE) conditioning
      regimen has been extensively utilized in ASCT for NHL.

      Therefore, based on the encouraging results, the investigators will conduct a randomized
      phase II multicenter trial of BuCE versus BuME as conditioning therapy for ASCT in patients
      with NHL.
