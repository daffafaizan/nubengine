      were carried out by three pediatric dentistry residents (E.K.C.G., R.A.V.V., and J.M.A.R.),
      previously trained in the clinical setting with a pilot sample of 10 similar child patients
      each. Study participants received local anesthesia and rubber dam isolation, which was
      disinfected, followed by the remove of the carious peripheral dentin with high speed
      tungsten-carbide bur # 3, and air-water spray. Then, the soft dentin layer was carefully
      removed with a sharply-edged sterilized hand excavator, based on tactile and visual
      standards, leaving only the hard dentin adjacent to the pulp ceiling. The cavity was
      thoroughly rinsed only with water and then dried with sterilized cotton pellets; no other
      special disinfection protocol was applied. The next step consisted in the placement of the
      correspondent liner over the remanent carious dentin layer, following the manufacturers'
      instructions, and according to the randomly assignment scheme previously described. In the
      case of the control group, the liner was cured undr 20 seconds of light exposure. All treated
      molar were restored with stainless steel preformed crowns (3M ESPE) cemented with glass
      ionomer (Ketac-Cem, 3M ESPE). One week later, the same procedure was repeated in the opposite
      tooth with the contrary IPT agent.
