      asked to record a complete dietary intake for 14 consecutive days, the magnesium food
      frequency questionnaire along with a calcium food frequency questionnaire, and a brief
      participant data form. Data from the 14 day consecutive food diary will be correlated with
      the food frequency questionnaire.
