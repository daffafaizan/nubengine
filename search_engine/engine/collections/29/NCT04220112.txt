      disturbances in AN. Hypothesis 1: Compared to the sham group, the amygdala neurofeedback
      group will show reduced amygdala activation to aversive images, which will increase with
      repeated training. This effect will generalize to non-neurofeedback test runs. Hypothesis 2:
      Compared to the sham group, the amygdala neurofeedback group will exhibit enhanced task and
      resting amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) connectivity, which will increase with repeated
      training. Enhanced amygdala-PFC connectivity will be associated with less amygdala reactivity
      to aversive images during the emotion regulation task.

      Aim 2: Identify the impact of rt-fMRI neurofeedback targeting limbic functioning on symptoms
      of AN. Hypothesis 1: Compared to the sham group, the amygdala neurofeedback group will
      exhibit improvements in self-reported emotion regulation and eating disorder symptoms over
      the study visits. Hypothesis 2: Compared to the sham group, the amygdala neurofeedback group
      will engage in less restrictive eating (i.e., will consume more calories) at a post-training
      test meal. Hypothesis 3: Across groups, decreased aversive amygdala reactivity and enhanced
      amygdala-PFC connectivity will predict reduced emotion dysregulation and eating disorder
      symptoms, and less restriction.
