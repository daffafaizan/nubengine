      with the use of ultrasound versus electrical stimulation.

      Hypothesis: Compared with the use of electrical stimulation, the use of ultrasound guidance
      when inserting a perineural catheter is associated with a decreased time of placement.

      Secondary Specific Aim: To determine if other possible benefits of perineural catheter
      placement associated with the use of ultrasound guidance versus electrical stimulation.

      Hypothesis: Compared with the use of electrical stimulation, the use of ultrasound guidance
      when inserting a perineural catheter is associated with an increased surgical block success
      rate and catheter-placement success rate, as well as decreased patient discomfort and
      incidence of venous puncture.
