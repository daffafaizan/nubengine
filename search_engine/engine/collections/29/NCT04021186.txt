      following stress response. This condition will for the majority of cases results in poor
      glycemic control - and there will be a risk of hyperglycaemia in the hospitalized patient.
      This condition affects all cells in the body and therefore has associated complications such
      as bigger risk at multiple infections, longer healingprocess, poorer fluid balance, etc.
      Hyperglycaemia is associated with a poorer outcome for the patient, which can cause an
      increase in hospitalization days and multiple re-admissions. It is also common for the
      postoperative patient to experience nausea and pain as a result of both surgery and
      anesthesia and immobilization. To counter this, the patient receives Dexamethasone (steroid
      treatment).

      This experiment is based on the fact that there is still insufficient attention at this
      postoperative insulin resistance. In a large randomized study from 2001(Van den Berghe),
      insulin therapy was initiated for intensive patients. This study points out that even
      moderate increases in blood glucose are associated with increased morbidity and that insulin
      therapy is both capable of reducing mortality and morbidity.
