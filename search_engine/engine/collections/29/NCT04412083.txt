    
      The primary goal of this pilot project is to develop an evidence-informed on-line
      psychoeducation program (Tele-Savvy) based on the well-established Savvy Caregiver program to
      address the unique challenges facing informal caregivers of those living with Primary
      Progressive Aphasia (PPA) and to help these caregivers achieve mastery. Key elements of the
      adaptation process are to identify and adapt mechanistic elements of the Tele-Savvy
      intervention (increasing self-efficacy, mastery of new skills, increased knowledge of
      disease-specific symptoms and trajectories, problem-solving skills). We will engage PPA
      caregivers in the process of adapting the existing Tele-Savvy program to fit their needs and
      then pilot test the adapted PPA Tele-Savvy program.
