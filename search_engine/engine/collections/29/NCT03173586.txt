      Health Study who were free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease to evaluate the association
      between intake of sugar sweetened beverages (SSB), juice and artificially sweetened beverages
      (ASB) and biomarkers of hepatic function, lipid metabolism, inflammation and glycemic
      control. Biomarkers were measured from blood samples that were collected in 2 cycles,
      approximately 10 years apart.

      Specifically, multivariate linear regression will be used to assess the associations of SSB,
      ASB, and fruit juice intake with concentrations of fetuin-A, alanine transaminase,
      gamma-glutamyl transferase, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP),
      intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1),
      adiponectin, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c as well as total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio.
