      antioxidant properties, neuroprotective effects, and ability to increase frataxin levels in
      vitro and in vivo. This clinical pilot study aims to determine the effect of two doses of
      resveratrol (1g/day and 5g/day) taken for 12 weeks, on frataxin levels in individuals with
      Friedreich ataxia. Additional outcome measures include the effect of resveratrol on markers
      of oxidative stress, clinical measures of ataxia , and cardiac parameters (including relative
      wall thickness and left ventricular mass index).
