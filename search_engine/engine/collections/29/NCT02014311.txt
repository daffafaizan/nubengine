      - Consecutive patients referred with chest pain in whom acute coronary syndrome has been
      excluded, yet with a maintained clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease will be
      included in the study. Only patients deemed clinically suited for subsequent invasive
      evaluation and treatment will be included.

      METHODS

      -If the patients accept participation in the trial a computerized 1:1 randomization for CTA
      alone (control group) or CTA and CTP combined (intervention group) within 2 weeks from
      discharge will be conducted. CT angiography and CT myocardial perfusion imaging will be
      performed using a 320-slice MSCT Toshiba VISION Edition Aquilion One scanner according to
      recommendations from the vendor and clinical routine developed at Rigshospitalet. Based on
      CTA and/or CTP findings patients will be referred for invasive evaluation including
      fractional flow reserve assessment (FFR) and treatment within 30 days. Invasive procedures
      will be performed according to international guidelines and the frequency of
      revascularization procedures recorded. Clinical outcome data according to specified secondary
      endpoints will be recorded from hospital charts and medical registries.
