      clamping both are good procedures to prevent anemia in neonates .

      Objective: To investigate the effects of delayed umbilical cord clamping for 120 seconds,
      compared with milking of the cord 5 times toward the neonate on hemoglobin level after 6
      weeks, Intubation,Respiratory distress,Clinical jaundice,Neonatal Intensive Care unit (NICU)
      admission,Apgar score (after 5 minutes of delivery).

      -Maternal,Need for blood transfusion,Additional need for therapeutic uterotonics,Post
      postpartum hemorrhage (blood loss > 500cc),Intensive Care unit admission.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Ain Shams university maternity hospital.
