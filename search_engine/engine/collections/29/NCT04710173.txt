      pneumonia, is still an important factor in the death of children, with a case fatality rate
      of 55%. The treatment includes lung protective ventilation and advanced ventilation support,
      but the effect is still not ideal for severe patients. ECMO can effectively support the
      respiratory system and provide good oxygen exchange. However, the survival rate of ECMO
      treatment in children with ARDS has a large bias.One of the key factors is the uneven timing
      of ECMO activation, which significantly affects the prognosis.This study intends to design a
      multi-center, prospective, non-randomized controlled trial , through retrospective research
      to find relevant factors affecting the prognosis of ECMO treatment, and to screen key
      indicators related to the timing of intervention; through a prospective cohort study to
      screen Good indicators and cut-off values suitable for starting ECMO , constructing and
      verifying comprehensive prediction models.
