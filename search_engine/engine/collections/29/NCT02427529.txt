      18 month period. Exclusion criteria included thyroid conditions or prior significant medical
      history. Patients were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of either hCG
      (200-300IU) or saline (placebo). All were placed on a VLCD resembling a protein-sparing
      modified fast. The caloric intake was between 500 and 600 calories, with 50% protein and 50%
      complex carbohydrates consisting mostly of fruits and vegetables. Measured parameters:
      weight, body composition via bio-impedance, blood pressure, and blood labs. A subset also
      underwent weekly electrocardiograms (EKG).
