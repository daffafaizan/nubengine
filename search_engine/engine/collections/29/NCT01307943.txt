      plus MBSR. Participants will be residents of a local inpatient treatment facility for
      adolescents with serious mental health issues. Outcomes the investigators will measure
      include mental health status as well as mindfulness. The investigators will also conduct
      qualitative interviews to assess the personal impact of the intervention on the patients and
      their families. In order to map and measure cognitive changes during MBSR the investigators
      will conduct brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
      Event-Related Potential (ERP) recordings. Through this study the investigators will determine
      if MBSR is helpful to our population.
