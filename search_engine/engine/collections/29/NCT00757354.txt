      incorporation into the surrounding tissue resulting from metal on metal articulating surfaces
      in cementless total hip arthroplasty.

      The amount of metallic ions released post operatively will be assessed by the concentration
      of Cobalt, Chromium and Molybdenum present in urine and analysed by I.C.P.M.S. (Inductive
      Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy). The amounts of metallic ions released will be related to
      the hip function and range of motion measured pre-operatively and post-operatively. Secondary
      performance of the metal-on-metal articulation will be determined by radiographic evaluation
      and incidence of complications / revision rates.
