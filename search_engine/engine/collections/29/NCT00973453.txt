      patients with allergic rhinitis / rhinoconjunctivitis induced by house dust mites will be
      evaluated and the optimal regimen to reach the maximum tolerated dose will be determined. The
      maximum intended dose is a 4-fold dosage compared to the currently used maintenance dose of
      PURETHAL Mites. The tolerability and safety of the injections will be examined by means of
      determining the early and late local and systemic reactions. In addition, short-term efficacy
      of this high dose PURETHAL mites will be determined by means of the Clinical index score
      (CIS) and two surrogate efficacy markers; the conjunctival provocation test (CPT) and serum
      levels of allergen specific immunoglobulins (IgG and IgE). These efficacy parameters are
      purely indicative and not decisive for the further clinical development of PURETHAL Mites.
