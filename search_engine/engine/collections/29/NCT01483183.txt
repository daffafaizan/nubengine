    
      This trial will test the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of ascending
      doses of OPC-108459 in separate populations of paroxysmal and persistent AF subjects.

      The trial will consist of two parts. Each part will evaluate two populations of subjects
      presenting for cardioversion in a hospital setting.

      Cohorts of paroxysmal and persistent subjects may have their dose increased independently.
