      T cells modified with lentiviral chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene have been studied in
      different clinical settings. Recent successes suggest that increased costimulatory signaling
      in the CAR design is critical for long term efficacy. Several clinical reports indicate that
      many patients still relapse and developed CD19-negative cancer cells after CD19 targeted
      therapy. Thus, to prevent the target escapes and improve the therapeutic effects, CAR
      gene-modified T cells targeting CD20, CD22, CD30, CD38, CD70 or CD123 are considered to apply
      together with CD19 CAR-T cells.

      Activation of T cell response to high tumor burden may induce a severe response. To increase
      safety, a novel design using an inducible caspase 9 fusion gene has been incorporated in the
      CAR gene. A 4th generation CAR lentiviral vector (4SCAR) carrying multiple costimulatory
      signals for CD28/CD137/CD27 plus an inducible apoptotic caspase 9 gene has been established.
      This study aims to evaluate the activities of a combination of CAR gene-modified T cells to
      target cancer cells based on specific CD19/CD20/CD22/CD30/CD38/CD70/CD123 single chain
      antibody gene designs (4SCAR19/20/22/30/38/70/123).

      Objective:

      To evaluate safety and efficacy of administrating 4SCAR19, 4SCAR20, 4SCAR22, 4SCAR30,
      4SCAR38, 4SCAR70 and 4SCAR123 T cells to patients with mixed CD19 positive and negative B
      cell malignancies following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine based conditioning regimen.

      Eligibility:

      Patients older than 6-month-old with CD19 positive or negative B cell malignancies that have
      recurred after or refractory to standard therapy and is deemed incurable using standard
      treatment.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened based on cancer cell phenotype analyzed using flow cytometry or
      immunohistochemical staining methods. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be
      obtained through apheresis. On Day -5 to -7, T cells from PBMC will be activated and
      enriched, which will be followed by 4SCAR19, 4SCAR20, 4SCAR22, 4SCAR30, 4SCAR38, 4SCAR70 and
      4SCAR123 lentiviral transduction. The total cell preparation time is approximately 5-7 days.
      Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising
      cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accommodate the modified CAR T
      cells. The preparative regimen will depend on the immune condition of patients, which is
      consistent with standard chemotherapy conditioning regimen. Participants will receive an
      infusion of the modified 4SCAR19 and 4SCAR20/22/30/38/70/123 T cells and closely followed up
      for treatment-related responses. Participants will be continuously monitored for CAR T cells
      and clinical responses in a preset timeline.
