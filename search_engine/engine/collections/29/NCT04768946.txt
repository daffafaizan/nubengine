      injury. In addition, the study will determine ways to adapt our current home safety virtual
      simulation training system, a game based training and assessment that trains home healthcare
      workers to identify and respond to hazards they encounter in client homes. The study will
      include interviews with three stakeholders groups: adolescents with ABI, parents of
      adolescents with ABI, and healthcare providers working with adolescents with ABI to identify
      home safety hazards encountered by adolescents with ABI. We will demonstrate proof of concept
      for adolescents with ABI through assessment of safety concerns from multiple perspectives and
      evaluation of design considerations from our intended user-group. Further, we are applying
      the HH-VSTS in a novel way to solve an understudied problem in adolescents with ABI. In
      addition, we will apply a user-centered, participatory approach to assess the design
      consideration of virtual gaming technologies to health and safety training adolescents with
      ABI.
