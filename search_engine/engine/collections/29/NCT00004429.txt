    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.

      Prior to randomization each patient's protein and calorie intake is assessed and optimized as
      possible. Patients are randomized to receive either placebo or recombinant human growth
      hormone subcutaneously every other day for 6 months. At the end of this 6 month period,
      patients undergo a 4 week washout period. After the washout period, patients are crossed-over
      to the alternate regimen for an additional 6 months followed by another 4 week washout
      period.
