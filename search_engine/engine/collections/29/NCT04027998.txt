      applied pressure measurement . Idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome patients and healthy
      controls will be evaluated by ultrasound. Median nerve strain, pressure applied to the skin,
      and ratio of pressure-strain will be measured at the proximal part of the carpal tunnel. In
      addition, distal latencies in the motor and sensory nerve conductions studies and
      cross-sectional area of median nerve will be measured. The parameters will be compared
      between patients and controls, and before and after the open carpal tunnel release in the
      patients.
