    
      Temporary attachment of IMUs to wrists and ankles of the patients and probands for a period
      of three days and recording of movement during a 10 meter-walking test, 180° turnaround and
      during normal movement at home.

      Group 1 (patients):

      Patients with a completed diagnostic concerning iNPH, who are planned to receive a VP-shunt
      by their responsible neurosurgeon (independently from the study), will be included.

      Before the shunt implantation, the patients will be examined at the USZ using wearable
      gyroscopes (like wristwatches) at both wrists and ankles as well as one around the body
      center.

      The short examination will comprise a patient history (MoCa test, Kiefer-score, Stein- and
      Langfitt-Score), a short examination (4 minute walking test, 180° turnaround) in hospital.
      Afterwards, the patient goes home, where the gyroscopes examine walking patterns for a period
      of three days. After this period, the patient brings the devices back to the hospital. The
      surgery will take place afterwards, independently from the study, as well as adjustments of
      the shunt's flow-resistance for achievement of optimal response to the therapy. After this
      optimal result is achieved, but latest after 6 months, the examination will be repeated.

      Groups 2 and 3 (controls):

      As well 20 subjects matched for sex and age with the patient's group as 20 healthy young
      subjects will be examined just like the patients preoperatively. Walking patterns shall be
      compared to identify changes between pre- and postoperatively as well as differences between
      patients and controls.
