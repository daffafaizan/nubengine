    
      Primary Endpoint Parameters

      The safety endpoint is incidence of complications related to BioProtect balloon implant and
      implantation procedure:

        1. Serious Adverse Events related to the BioProtect balloon and/or implantation procedure.
           Serious adverse event are defined as adverse requiring operation and/or associated with
           prolongation of hospital stay. Serious Adverse Events will be documented in Serious
           Adverse Event Form.

        2. Adverse Events related to the BioProtect balloon and/or implantation procedure. Adverse
           Events will be documented in Adverse Event Form.

        3. Subjective discomfort related to the balloon and implantation procedure will be assessed
           by pain analogue scale.

      Secondary Endpoint Parameters

      To assess the efficacy of BioProtect biodegradable balloon implant. Efficacy will be measured
      in terms of:

        1. Increased distance between anterior rectal wall and prostate post implantation as showed
           by CT until last radiation treatment.

        2. Noticeable reduction of isodose level to the rectum post implantation as compared to
           pre-implantation isodose to the rectum by XRT treatment planning software.

      Other Measured Observations

        1. Balloon non-displacement during treatment phase as shown by CT.

        2. Balloon remaining inflated during treatment phase as shown by CT.

        3. Operator satisfaction from BioProtect balloon implantation procedure.
