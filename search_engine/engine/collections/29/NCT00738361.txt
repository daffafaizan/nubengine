      Primary

        -  To evaluate the overall response rate of patients with unresectable, metastatic uveal
           melanoma treated with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the median progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 8 weeks for 1 year.
