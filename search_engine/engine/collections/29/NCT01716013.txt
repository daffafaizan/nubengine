    
      This is a two-phase, multi-center, prospective, randomized, parallel-group study, in which a
      total of 153 subjects (102 in the BondEase™ group and 51 in the CWCD group) with traumatic
      lacerations and incisions will be enrolled. Overall, eligible subjects will be randomized in
      a pre-defined 2:1 ratio to BondEase™ skin adhesive or CWCD.

      In Part 1 of the study 30 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (BondEase™ : CWCD). This
      part of the study is designed to assess the feasibility and validate use of the device.
      Pediatric subjects younger than age 18 will not be included in this part of the trial. The
      results from these 30 subjects will be compiled and submitted to FDA for review and approval
      prior to proceeding with Part 2. Part 2 of the study will only be initiated after FDA
      indicates it is acceptable to begin. In Part 2 of the study a total of 123 subjects will be
      randomized, of which 82 subjects will be randomized to the BondEase™ group and 41 subjects to
      the CWCD group. This will result in 102 subjects in the BondEase™ group and 51 subjects in
      the CWCD group across the both parts of the trial.
