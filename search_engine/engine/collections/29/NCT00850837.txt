      This study will measure the mucosal response to daily intravaginal applications of Acidform
      lubricant and HEC gel in two groups of healthy women at low risk for HIV infection.

      The duration of this study for each participant is 3 weeks. Study participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two study groups. Group 1 participants will apply Acidform
      lubricant twice daily for 14 consecutive days between menses. Group 2 participants will apply
      HEC gel for 14 consecutive days between menses.

      After screening and study entry, study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, and 21. Study entry
      will occur 2 to 6 days following the menses and within 45 days of screening. Medical and
      sexual history, a pelvic exam, cervicovaginal lavage sample collection, blood collection,
      vaginal pH testing, STI testing, and adverse effect reporting will occur at all visits.
      Cytobrush collection, vaginal swab, and cervical biopsy will occur at selected visits. All
      participants will be asked to complete a diary throughout the study; this diary will be
      reviewed at all study visits. A Pap smear will be obtained at screening if documentation of a
      negative Pap smear result within the last year is not available.
