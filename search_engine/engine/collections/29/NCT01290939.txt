        -  To determine the therapeutic role of bevacizumab as well as the most favorable approach
           to treatment optimization for sequencing the combination of bevacizumab and lomustine in
           patients with glioblastoma multiforme in first recurrence.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution, WHO
      performance status (0 vs > 0), steroid administration (yes vs no), and largest diameter of
      tumor (≤ 40 mm vs > 40 mm). Patients are randomized at 2:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm 1: Lomustine 90 mg/m² every 6 weeks (cap. 160 mg) + bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2
           weeks (at further progression treatment will be according to investigators discretion).
           In the absence of hematological toxicity > grade 1 during the first cycle the dose of
           lomustine can be escalated to 110 mg/m² (cap 200 mg) in their second cycle.

        -  Arm 2 (control arm): Lomustine single agent 110 mg/m² every 6 weeks (cap. 200 mg) (at
           further progression treatment will be according to investigators discretion).

      One cycle will be defined arbitrarily (due to the lomustine sequencing) as 6 weeks for all
      arms. Day 1 of a cycle will be the first day when medication is taken.

      Previously collected blood and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for MGMT methylation status,
      isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, and biomarkers of the VEGF pathway.

      Patients and their caregivers/relatives complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EORTC
      QLQ-C30 and EORTC-BN20) at baseline, at 12 weeks, and then every 12 weeks after completion of
      study therapy. Patients also undergo neurocognitive assessment at baseline, at 12 weeks, and
      then every 12 weeks after completion of study therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 12 weeks.
