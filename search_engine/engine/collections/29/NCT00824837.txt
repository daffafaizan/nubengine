      patients remains unsatisfactory. Standard haemodialysis membranes remove middle-sized
      molecule solutes poorly such as beta2-microglobulin, which has a pathogenic role in
      dialysis-related amyloidosis. Pre-dialysis beta2-microglobulin concentration has been shown
      to be independently predictive of mortality. A new polyamide haemodialysis membrane has been
      developed with increased pore size to increase the removal of middle-sized uraemic toxins
      such as beta2-microglobulin. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the new
      membrane in beta2-microglobulin removal compared with standard haemodialysis membrane in
      dialysis patients and the degree of increased loss of albumin as a potential limiting factor
      of its use.
