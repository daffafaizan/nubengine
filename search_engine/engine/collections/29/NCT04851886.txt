    
      The proposed study is a single-blinded randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of
      using the PostureCheck (a camera-based system equipped with machine learning algorithms to
      track the quality of the exercise performance) on motor gains in group and individual
      robot-assisted upper-limb. Study participants (stroke survivors) will be recruited at the
      Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital - Boston. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the
      two different groups: individual- or group-therapy using a covariate-adaptive allocation
      procedure to ensure important covariates, such as baseline Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper
      Extremity (FMA-UE) scores and proprioceptive deficits, are balanced between groups.
