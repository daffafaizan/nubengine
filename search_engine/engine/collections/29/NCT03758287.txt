      Part 1: This is the dose-escalation part. The primary purpose of the part 1 portion is to
      determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommend
      the appropriate doses of CT053PTSA in combination with gefitinib for further studies.

      Part 2: This is the expansion part. The part 2 portion of this study will continue to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of CT053PTSA and gefitinib , at the
      appropriate doses recommended in Part 1, in patients with EGFR mutation, T790M negative
      NSCLC.
