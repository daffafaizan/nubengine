      to two community-based acute care medical services. Patients will be asked to identify a
      CarePartner (CP) living outside their household, i.e., an adult child or other social network
      member willing to play an active role in their transition support and organizing their
      broader network of informal caregivers. Patients will be randomized to the intervention or
      usual care. Intervention patients will receive automated assessment and behavior change
      calls, and their CPs will receive structured feedback and advice following each assessment.
      Patients' clinical team will have access to patients' assessment results via the web, will
      receive automated reports about urgent health problems, and will be able to communicate
      asynchronously with patients and CPs using a secure web page and a specially designed
      voicemail service. Patients will complete surveys at baseline, 30- and 90- days post
      discharge; utilization data will be obtained from hospital records. CPs, other caregivers,
      and clinicians will be interviewed to evaluate intervention effects on processes of self-care
      support, caregiver stress and communication, and the intervention's potential for broader
      implementation. The primary outcomes will be 30 day readmission rates; 2ndary outcomes
      measured at 30 and 90 days include functional status, self-care behaviors, and mortality
      risk.
