      the other is self-initiated movement. The underlying neural mechanisms in each movement have
      been investigated, but they are not fully understood. The present study is aimed to
      understand the neural mechanisms, especially aimed to find out the commonly devoted brain
      area for the categorized movements. By obtaining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      signals during triggered movement tasks designed from 3 input triggers of different
      modalities (visual, auditory, and somatosensory) and 3 output movements of different body
      parts (right hand, left hand, and right foot), we will determine the brain regions specially
      devoted for each input or output, and commonly devoted for triggered movements. By obtaining
      fMRI signals during spontaneous voluntary movement tasks designed from 3 output movements of
      the same body parts, we will determine the brain regions specially devoted for specific
      execution and commonly devoted for the voluntarily chosen movements.
