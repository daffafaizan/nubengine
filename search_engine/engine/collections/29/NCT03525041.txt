      leads to the reduction of blood supply on myocardium. CABG is one of the procedure to improve
      symptoms caused by myocardial ischemia. And it is especially effective in treating severe
      coronary artery disease.

      FIMR is one of the most common complications of CAD. After acute myocardial infarction, FIMR
      will occur in 17%-55% patients, and 3%-19% of them will develop into moderate or severe MR
      eventually. FIMR is an important prognostic factor of CAD, the in-hospital mortality rate of
      patients with IMR is significantly higher in several studies. In patients with mild MR, CABG
      alone is enough to improve myocardial ischemia; however, in people with moderate mitral
      regurgitation, there is still a dispute on whether mitral valve annuloplasty is beneficial at
      the time of CABG. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal surgical procedure of
      CAD patients combined moderate FIMR.

      This study will compare the effectiveness of different surgical procedure on people with
      moderate FIMR by enrolling people with enrolling people with CAD who require CABG procedure
      and have moderate mitral regurgitation. At baseline study, a questionnaire will be assigned
      to undergo either CABG surgery of CABG plus mitral calve annuloplasty. Blood, urine and
      tissue samples will be collected after the surgery. All participants will be followed up at
      month 1,3,6,12, participants will take part in a medication history review, a physical
      examination, a blood collection to evaluate the brain natriuretic peptide and an
      echocardiogram.
