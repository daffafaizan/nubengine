      there is no published research expanding on the benefits of using platelet rich plasma in
      conjunction with microneedling for facial aesthetics. This pilot study will expand knowledge
      and application of 2 X concentration of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) in conjunction with
      microneedling using the SkinPen device. The pilot aims to objectively measure skin quality
      using the Visia systemTM and provide objective data to compare Microneedling with the use of
      (PRP) versus microneedling without the use of PRP. The pilot also aims to subjectively
      measure skin improvement using the Face QTM and the Global Aesthetic Improvement ScaleTM.
