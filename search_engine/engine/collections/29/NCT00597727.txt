      anaphylaxis remains the single most common cause of anaphylaxis seen in hospital emergency
      departments, accounting for about one third of anaphylaxis cases seen. It is estimated that
      about 30,000 food-induced anaphylactic events are seen in U.S. emergency departments each
      year and that about 200 fatal cases occur in the U.S. each year. Either peanuts or tree nuts
      cause more than 80% of these reactions. No treatments are available and avoidance is the only
      approved intervention.

      The goal of this study is to investigate peanut sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) as a
      treatment for children with peanut allergy. This study is primarily designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of peanut SLIT compared to placebo after 12 months. Secondarily, the
      study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of extended maintenance dosing of peanut SLIT in
      inducing lasting tolerance after discontinuation of the peanut SLIT. Mechanistic studies will
      be completed concurrently as exploratory endpoints to understand changes in the allergic
      immune response related to peanut SLIT.
