    
      In about 800 children with allergic diseases from our Outpatient Clinic (asthma, allergic
      rhinitis, atopic dermatitis) we will retrospectively and cross-sectionally analyse the
      influence/correlation of diagnosis, treatment methods, allergy status (skin prick test
      results), lung function tests results on/with the concentration of nitric oxide in exhaled
      breath.
