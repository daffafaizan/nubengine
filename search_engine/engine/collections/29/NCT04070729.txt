      application of i-PRF and hyaluronic acid gel as adjunctive to non-surgical periodontal
      therapy. 120 periodontal patients will receive traditional mechanical supra and subgingival
      scaling and root planing. Patients were randomly allocated in three groups. Group 1, 2 and 3
      will receive subginigval application of placebo, hyaluronic acid gel and i prf respectively.
      Clinical parameters will be evaluated: plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on
      probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR).
      Clinical measurements will be performed at baseline, 1 month and at 3 months.
