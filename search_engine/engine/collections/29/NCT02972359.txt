      participants and the informed consent form was signed. Medical history was obtained, a
      physical examination was conducted, and other safety assessments were performed. Signs and
      symptoms of CRPS were assessed to confirm the diagnosis of CRPS according to the Budapest
      clinical criteria. Participants were trained to report their pain. Calcium and vitamin D
      supplementation were initiated to ensure sufficient vitamin D levels prior to treatment.

      Participants meeting all eligibility criteria received infusions of investigational medicinal
      product (IMP) during visits on Day 1, Day 4, Day 7, and Day 10. Flexibility of Â±1 day was
      allowed for Day 4, Day 7, and Day 10 whilst ensuring a minimum period of 48 hours between
      infusions. During the treatment period and follow-up period, pain intensity ratings were
      captured at the site visits in a patient reported-outcome system.
