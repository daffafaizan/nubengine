      the spectral wavelengths of tissues. The surgery being performed will in no way be altered by
      the imaging device and post surgical follow-up of patients will be standard of care
      appropriate to the surgical procedure.

      Patients will have HSI performed only during their surgery. They will not receive additional
      medications and will have no additional follow up. Participating in this study will not add
      extra appointments, procedures, or time requirements for the patient. The patient's medical
      record may be referenced for information after the surgery for up to one year. There are no
      costs to the patient for participation in this study.
