    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, 3-arm trial to compare the pharmacokinetic
      profile and the safety profile between 3 dose groups. There are 2 periods in this study: a
      10-week treatment period and an 8-week follow-up period. Patients will receive 6 injections
      of long acting injectable risperidone at one of the dose levels (25, 37.5 and 50 mg) every 2
      weeks according to their randomly assigned treatment. Blood samples will be collected
      throughout the 10-week treatment and 8-week follow-up period to determine the changes in
      study drug concentration in the plasma. Safety will be assessed by monitoring of adverse
      events, subjective symptoms/objective findings, laboratory tests, physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms, injection site reactions, and the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms
      Scale (DIEPSS). Efficacy of the study drug will be assessed based on the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) and
      Clinical Global Impression - Change (CGI-C) scales. The patients will receive injections of
      long acting injectable risperidone (either 25, 37.5, or 50 mg) in their muscle every 2 weeks
      for 10 weeks for a total of 6 injections.
