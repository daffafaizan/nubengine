      investigating the efficacy and safety of low profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS)
      stents combined with coils for the treatment of ruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. As
      the protocol, clinical follow-up at 30 days (±7 days) after procedure, DSA or MRA follow-up
      at 6 months (±30 days) after procedure, and clinical follow-up at 1 year (±30 days) after
      procedure was conducted for each patient. The primary end-points include major adverse events
      (cerebral infarct and death) in 30 days post-procedure, complete occlusion rate at 6 months
      (180±30d) follow-up, and modified Rankin Score (mRS) at 1 year follow-up. The secondary
      end-points were immediate technical success (successful device placement) rate, immediate
      complete occlusion rate, recurrence rate at 6 months (180±30d) follow-up and in-stent
      stenosis or obliteration rate at 6 months (180±30d) follow-up. Duration of this study is 2
      years.
