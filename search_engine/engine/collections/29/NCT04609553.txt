      enhance literacy promotion for low-income Latino families. The investigators will recruit 630
      parent-child dyads from community health centers that serve low-income, Latino families.
      Parents will be randomly assigned to one of 3 arms (1) Reach Out and Read (ROR) an
      evidence-based literacy promotion intervention that is widely disseminated in primary care;
      (2) ROR plus tailored outreach text messages; (3) ROR plus tailored outreach text messages
      and enhanced access to poverty-reducing resources using a widely disseminated model that
      simplifies access and provides care coordination. In Aim 1, the investigators will test their
      hypotheses that (1) children in the ROR plus text message arm will have higher scores on
      validated assessments of language and social-emotional development compared to standard ROR
      alone and (2) children who receive both text messages and enhanced access to poverty-reducing
      resources will have higher scores compared to the other two arms. In Aim 2, the investigators
      will examine mechanisms that underlie the effects of the interventions. In Aim 3, the
      investigators will use mixed methods to conduct a process evaluation to understand how the
      interventions are implemented, identify barriers, facilitators, and modifications, and
      explore parents' experiences with the interventions.
