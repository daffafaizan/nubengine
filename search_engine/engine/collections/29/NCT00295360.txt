      bile acid homeostasis. As an efflux pump, it could protect the enterocytes from potential
      toxic bile acid concentrations. During cholestasis, where the enterohepatic circulation is
      disrupted, there occurs an adaptive regulation of transporters for bile acids, bilirubin and
      cholesterol. These changes take place in liver, kidney, as well as in the intestine.

      Using real-time RT-PCR analysis we determine BCRP mRNA expression levels in duodenal tissue
      of healthy subjects and cholestatic patients. BCRP protein levels will be determined by
      immunohistochemistry.

      Healthy subjects and cholestatic patients are enrolled in the study after giving informed
      consent. Control subjects with an indication for a gastrointestinal tract endoscopy within a
      cancer-screening program and patients with obstructive cholestasis with an interventional
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are included in this study. During
      endoscopy four biopsy specimens are obtained from the distal part of the duodenum. Biopsies
      are immediately stored at -70Â°C until further processing.
