      leading cause of mortality and morbidity in France. These diseases are multifactorial origin
      and even if it is not possible to act on risk markers such as age, sex, or heredity, risk
      factors like high cholesterol, smoking , hypertension, obesity, diabetes and physical
      inactivity, are the main target of prevention strategies.The dydlipid√©mies have a role in the
      formation of CVD in participating in the genesis of atherosclerosis. The cholesterol and
      LDL-cholesterol in particular is subject to oxidation process in plasma. The molecules of
      oxidized LDL-cholesterol, small and dense, easily penetrate the arterial endothelial wall and
      are greeted by macrophages. Following a succession of different processes including
      inflammation, atherosclerotic plaque is formed. The result is either an arteriopathy when the
      arterial lumen narrowing, or atherothrombosis in the event of plaque rupture. Given this
      pathophysiology, reduce blood lipids, including LDL-cholesterol and reducing oxidation and
      inflammation are interesting strategies in the context of cardiovascular prevention. Several
      scientific study showed that nutritional supplementation with some plant extracts such as
      artichokes, garlic, red yeast rice, or the sugar cane policosanol helps to reduce several
      cardiovascular risk factors including regulate concentrations of circulating lipids.

      The objective of this study is to validate the effectiveness of Limicol, formulated with
      proven scientific data on the reduction of LDL-cholesterol in volunteers with moderate
      hypercholesterolaemia (LDL-cholesterol).
