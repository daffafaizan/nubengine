    
      This study will be an open-label, non-randomized, metabolism and excretion study of
      [14C]-rigosertib administered as a single dose of approximately 450 mg containing 250 μCi
      [14C]-labeled rigosertib as a 24-hour continuous intravenous (CIV) infusion in healthy
      volunteers. Up to 8 subjects will be enrolled to ensure at least 6 subjects have evaluable
      data.

      Eligible subjects will be confined at the clinical site from the time of Check-in
      (approximately 24 hours prior to dosing) until Discharge (between Days 6 and 10). One single
      dose of [14C]-rigosertib will be administered as a 24-hour continuous intravenous infusion on
      Day 1. Subjects will be discharged as early as 120 hours after the start of the infusion,
      after ≥ 90% of the administered radioactive dose has been recovered in urine and feces or
      when the combined total radioactivity recovered in urine and feces is ≤ 1% of the
      administered radioactive dose for 2 consecutive 24-hr samples. The maximum stay will be until
      Day 10 (216 hours after the start of the infusion).
