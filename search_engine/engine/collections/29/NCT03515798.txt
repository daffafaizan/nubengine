      breast cancer representing approximately 5% of all breast cancers that requires immediate
      aggressive treatment. Significant progress has been made in recent years using a combination
      of treatments, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy.

      Accumulating data indicate a prognostic and/or predictive impact for immune-response
      variables in BC. Recent data, suggest that PD-L1 is overexpressed in a significant number of
      BC, notably in IBC and may have significant prognostic or predictive value. Furthermore it
      may be targeted to restore or boost functional antitumor immunity. Pembrolizumab, a
      PD-1-directed monoclonal antibody is already registered and has an out-standing activity in
      advanced melanoma and NSCLC patients, with promising results in several other tumor types,
      including triple-negative BC, and a favorable profile of tolerance.

      Thus, potential benefits of pembrolizumab in combination with a conventional cytotoxic
      backbone may be considered as high in HER2-negative IBC.

      The aim of the study is to assess the pathological complete response rate following
      neoadjuvant EC-paclitaxel chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab and to assess if neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with anthracycline-based induction in combination with pembrolizumab exposes IBC
      patients to significant toxicity. rates.
