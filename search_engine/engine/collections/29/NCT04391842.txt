      Medicine (SAM) device combined with diclofenac on symptoms of patients suffering from knee
      osteoarthritis. The class-II device, samÂ® has been FDA-cleared for home use. On the first day
      of the study, baseline data will be collected as patients report pain score before treatment.
      During the following 6 days, patients will self-apply the wearable SAM device with diclofenac
      patch to their affected knee for 4 hours daily. Each day of the study, pain scores will be
      recorded immediately before application of SAM device as well as 30 minutes, 2-hours and
      4-hours after applying the device. A quality of life and function assessment will be
      performed prior to the patient beginning the protocol and at the conclusion of the protocol.

      Up to 32 subjects will be recruited from neighboring communities to the study sites. The
      study is designed to reach a target patient population which includes rural citizens and
      socioeconomic disadvantaged individuals.
