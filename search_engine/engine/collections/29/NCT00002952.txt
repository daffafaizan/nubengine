    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose level of the vaccine
      consisting of MAGE-3 or Melan-A (human tumor antigen genes) peptide-pulsed autologous
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells plus interleukin-12. II. Determine if the procedure
      results in successful immunization. III. Assess the response of the tumor to the vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, nonrandomized, single institution study. Patients receive 3
      initial courses of treatment consisting of 21 days each. Treatment consists of an
      immunization with MAGE-3 or Melan-A peptide-loaded autologous PBMC and interleukin-12 (IL-12)
      on the first day, IL-12 on days 3 and 5, and 16 days of rest. The first cohort is not
      administered IL-12 and the next cohorts are given escalating doses of IL-12. The Phase II
      dose will be one dose level below the MTD. Patients who have a tumor remission response or
      stable disease may continue treatment for up to one year. Phase I completed as of 04/1999.
      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 34 patients will be accrued for this study.
