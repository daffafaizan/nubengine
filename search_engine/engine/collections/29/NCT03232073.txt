      (core study). The core study has been designed to investigate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of ponesimod in subjects with RMS. The subjects are treated with either
      ponesimod or the active comparator, teriflunomide in the core study. The purpose of this long
      term extension of the core study is to characterize the long-term safety and control of
      disease of ponesimod in subjects with RMS. In particular, the study will allow to observe
      potential adverse events which may only occur after long term treatment with ponesimod. The
      study will also investigate the effect of re-initiation of ponesimod after a brief
      interruption in a relatively large population (all subjects treated with ponesimod in the
      core study and eligible for the extension study) on disease activity in terms of relapses and
      MS-related MRI lesions. There is currently limited guidance on when a new MS treatment should
      be started after discontinuation of teriflunomide and the study will contribute with data on
      safety and efficacy of switching from teriflunomide to ponesimod after an interruption as
      mandated by the protocol. The study will also allow confirmation of sustained efficacy of
      ponesimod in terms of relapses, MRI lesions and reduction of disability accumulation during
      long-term treatment. In addition, combined data from the core study together with the results
      of the current extension study will allow comparison of MS activity in subjects who were
      switched from teriflunomide to ponesimod versus those who were treated with ponesimod in both
      studies.
