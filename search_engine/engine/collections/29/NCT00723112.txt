      expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and ineffective hematopoiesis. Although all 3 cell
      lineages in myeloid hematopoiesis can be involved, the erythroid dysplasia and ineffective
      erythropoiesis of MDS are usually the most severe, and often precede the development of other
      bone marrow lineage defects.

      In normal erythropoiesis, erythroid progenitors differentiate and proliferate in response to
      stimulation by erythropoietin (Epo). Epo binds to its receptor, EpoR, constitutively
      expressed at the surface of committed erythroid progenitors and induces homodimerization.
      This study is designed to evaluate the EpoR cDNA sequence and its level of expression in the
      clonal erythroid progenitors of MDS patients (in cells stratified for the same degree of
      erythroid maturation) to determine whether mutations in the EpoR may be responsible for an
      aberrant Epo signal transduction in MDS. As well as analyze intrinsic erythroid Epo
      expression to determine whether it differs between normal controls and patients with MDS and
      perform a microarray analysis of genes associated with Epo signal transduction to determine
      if MDS patients have abnormal expression of signal transduction proteins.
