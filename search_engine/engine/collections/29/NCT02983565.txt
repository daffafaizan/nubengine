      pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe persistent hypoxia. LTOT is prescribed at a fixed-flow
      rate with the aim of maintaining a partial pressure of oxygen greater than or equal to 8
      kilopascals (kPa). However, a number of studies have demonstrated that patients on home LTOT
      experience episodes of intermittent hypoxia during rest, activities and especially sleep.
      Simply increasing the oxygen flow rate at night can relieve this hypoxia but at the expense
      of hyperoxia with its detrimental effects of hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. Therefore,
      a more targeted approach is needed to oxygen delivery. The investigators have devised an
      auto-titrating oxygen system (intelligent oxygen therapy [iO2Ts]) which delivers variable
      flow oxygen to maintain a pre-set specific oxygen saturation ( SpO2) target. The system can
      avoid the dual hazards of hypoxia and hyperoxia and potentially optimise LTOT.

      This study will be investigating whether the iO2Ts can reduce intermittent hypoxia during
      sleep compared to usual fixed flow oxygen in patients on LTOT. Nineteen patients will be
      recruited to undergo two sleep studies each on two different nights; one on their usual LTOT
      flow rate and one of the iO2Ts. During both sleep studies, all participants will have full
      polysomnography, oxygen and transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring. The primary outcome
      will the percentage of time spent with SpO2 < 90% during sleep.
