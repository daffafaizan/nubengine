      the current standard HFNC protocol for children <2yo admitted to South Shore Hospital with
      bronchiolitis. We currently use a flat limit of 8 liters of HFNC to support work of breathing
      and hypoxia in these patients. We will compare that to a weight-based protocol, which will
      provide 2L/kg/min of flow (flows generally between 6 and 20L/minute) to this patient
      population. The goal of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of our study design. We
      will evaluate the functionality of a new weight-based flow protocol. We will also evaluate
      the functionality of a new bronchiolitis scoring tool, the Bronchiolitis Assessment Severity
      Score (BASS), and it's ability to guide care through the new protocol. We are also testing
      the feasibility of recruitment, randomization and retention. We are ultimately interested in
      whether a weight-based flow protocol reduces need for escalation to ICU-level care for
      children with moderate-severe bronchiolitis on HFNC.
