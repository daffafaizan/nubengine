      two consecutive phases. Phase I assessed safety as determined by assessment of delays in
      ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrhythmia detection time using new algorithms. Phase II
      assessed the influence of new algorithms on inappropriate and unnecessary shocks at 1 year of
      follow-up. Subjects enrolled in Phase I continued in Phase II of the study and data from all
      enrolled subjects contributed to the analysis of Phase II objectives. A sub-study of Phase II
      randomized secondary prevention subjects to either 18/24 NID or 30/40 NID in order to assess
      the safety of prolonged detection in these patients.
