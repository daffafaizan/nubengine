      countries over the past 20 years, much less progress has been made in reducing neonatal
      mortality and morbidity. Neonatal mortality rates are high in Nepal; a significant proportion
      of which are due to sepsis. In addition, the vast majority of women deliver babies at home
      without a skilled birth attendant and early neonatal care is routinely used in rural areas.
      Previous hospital-based research in Malawi suggested that newborn cleansing with a dilute
      chlorhexidine solution could reduce early infant mortality. This project evaluates the use of
      a simple intervention at the community level and the impact on neonatal mortality.

      Comparisons: Two nested community-based randomized trials are being conducted. The first
      compares the neonatal mortality rates between newborn infants randomized to receive a whole
      body skin cleansing soon after birth with baby wipes impregnated with 0.25% chlorhexidine
      compared with newborns cleaned with baby wipes with a placebo solution. The second trial
      compares the rates of umbilical cord infections among children assigned to three groups:

        -  education of the mother on clean cord care alone;

        -  education of the mother plus routine washing of the cord and stump with soap and water
           solution for the first 10 days of life; -OR-

        -  education of the mother plus routine washing of the cord and stump with a 4%
           chlorhexidine solution.

      Enrolled infants are visited on a regular basis during the first month of life to record
      vital status and grade the cord for signs of infection.
