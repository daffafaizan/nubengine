      improved metabolic profiles and reduced inflammation. However, levels of moderate to vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA) diminish dramatically as children move into the middle school years.
      To address this problem, this study tests a behavioral intervention, called "Zamzee,"
      designed to motivate middle school-aged children to increase their levels of MVPA. The Zamzee
      intervention consists of a 3-axis accelerometer that tracks individual physical activity
      rates over time and a website that displays individual physical activity rates and provides
      rewards for maintaining or improving physical activity rates. The primary aim of this
      randomized, controlled trial is to test whether middle school-aged children randomly assigned
      to the Zamzee intervention will show significantly greater levels of physical activity levels
      over six months, compared with control group participants who wear the accelerometer but have
      no access to the rewards website. A secondary aim is to test the intervention's impact on
      biological parameters that may contribute to the long-term health effects of inactivity
      (including C-reactive protein as a measure of inflammation, and hemoglobin-A1C as a measure
      of metabolic status) in a sub-set of study participants who agree to provide blood samples.
