      at a HD unit using two catheter dysfunction protocols during January 2013 to Septebmer 2013.
      In the Intensive Protocol, rt-PA intervention is administered to all catheters based on blood
      flow and/or line reversal. In the Standard Protocol, rt-PA intervention is administered to
      all catheters based only on blood flow.
