      .Patients who meet the inclusion criteria were asked to participate in the study and a verbal
      consent was obtained from each patient. Patients will be divided into three equal groups (A,
      B, C). A single dose of the drug (placebo or HBB 20mg or HBB 40 mg) will be injected
      intravenously slowly to groups A, B, C respectively. Labouring mothers will be monitored in
      bed. Vaginal examination will be conducted every two hours. The duration of the first stage
