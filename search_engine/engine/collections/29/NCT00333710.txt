      quality of life, given that PTSD is associated with poor self-care and medical
      non-compliance. To date, no systematic efforts to improve quality of life in this high-risk
      population have been documented. The main objective of this proposal is to develop and test
      the feasibility and efficacy of two cognitive-behavioral interventions (a telehealth
      intervention and a face-to-face intervention) designed to improve quality of life, self-care,
      motivation to engage in healthcare, and psychological distress in patients diagnosed with HCV
      and PTSD. A secondary objective is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the interventions. I
      plan to develop the interventions, pilot test them, and deliver the refined treatments to
      veterans with HCV and PTSD. Participants will be 70 patients from VA Boston who meet study
      criteria. Assessment will occur at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month
      follow-up. Assessments will measure quality of life, self-care, motivation to engage in
      healthcare, and psychological distress. Analyses will examine study feasibility, the effects
      of the treatment conditions, and the cost effectiveness of the interventions. It is
      hypothesized that the telephone and face-to-face intervention will improve outcomes, as
      compared to treatment as usual, but that the participants will be more satisfied with the
      telephone intervention. In addition, it is predicted that the telephone condition will be
      cost effective as compared to the face-to-face intervention
