      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance
      of cure. With combined-modality therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the
      prognosis of stage III NSCLC remains poor. Nimotuzumab, a human anti-EGFR monoclonal
      antibody, has shown its efficacy in the treatment of head/neck squamous cell carcinoma,
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma as well as lung cancer. This study is studying neoadjuvant
      nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in
      treating patients with unresectable stage III squamous cell lung carcinoma.
