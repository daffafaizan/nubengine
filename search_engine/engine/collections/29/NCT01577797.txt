      patients treated for MA dependence have a high rate of relapse. Additionally, there are no
      currently approved medications for MA dependence. Thus, a significant need exists for add-on
      therapy for treatment of MA addiction. CBT-based text messaging could serve as a real-time
      intervention when craving and risk of MA use are high and patients are not in the clinic. It
      could further serve to reinforce CBT group therapy. If found efficacious, fully-automated
      CBT-based text messaging would be a relatively inexpensive adjunctive therapy that could be
      readily scaled up for use in a large number of patients. Additionally, this type of text
      messaging intervention also could be tailored to individual users, which may enhance its
      efficacy. This Phase I randomized crossover study will evaluate the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of CBT-based text messages in conjunction with CBT group therapy
      delivered over a 22-day period in MA users in the San Francisco Bay Area.
