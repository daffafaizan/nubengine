      health benefits. It has been shown that starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) before HIV has
      progressed results in a better response to treatment and gives the person a better chance of
      long-term survival with HIV. Treating HIV can also reduce the risk that someone will transmit
      HIV to his or her sexual partners. The first step in achieving these individual and
      population level benefits is testing people for HIV. Unfortunately, in many parts of the
      world, including Kenya where we plan to conduct this study, many people are not tested
      regularly and do not know that they are infected. This study involves providing a public
      health service, notification of an exposure to a communicable disease and HIV testing, to
      sexual partners of those who test HIV-positive at voluntary counseling and testing (VCT)
      clinics in Kenya. Sexual partners are identified voluntarily by the person who tests at the
      VCT. A public health provider then goes to the home of the sexual partners to offer them HIV
      counseling and testing. This process is called provision of assisted partner services (aPS).

      We propose a cluster randomized clinical trial which will be conducted in collaboration with
      the Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) at 18 rural and urban voluntary counseling and testing
      (VCT) facilities across Kenya. Proposed activities will assess the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of providing aPS, improve capacity for program implementation in Kenya,
      and lay the foundation for evaluating the program's impact at the national level.
