      Primary

        -  To better understand the pathophysiology of gliomas and identify molecular markers that
           may predict prognosis and progression or that could identify new therapeutic approaches.

      Secondary

        -  To compare gene expression profiles, in terms of response to treatment, and attempt to
           isolate subgroups of patients with objective response to certain types of chemotherapy
           or radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Biological samples are collected from patients at time of surgery for diagnostic and/or
      treatment purposes.
