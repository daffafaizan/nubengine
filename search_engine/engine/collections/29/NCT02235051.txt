      I. To test the hypothesis that regular exercise increases DNA repair capacity.

      II. To test the hypothesis that regular exercise reduces inflammatory response.

      III. To test the hypothesis that regular exercise modulates telomerase activity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess adherence to the study protocol.

      II. To examine differences in body composition before and after the exercise intervention.

      III. To examine differences in fitness before and after the exercise intervention.

      IV. To test the hypothesis that regular exercise increases quality of life in breast cancer
      survivors.

      V. To examine the safety of the exercise intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients participate in a supervised Curves exercise program three days a week for 16
      weeks. The circuit-style workout consists of 14 exercises constructed with pneumatic or
      hydraulic resistance that target opposing muscle groups in a concentric-only fashion. Each
      session at a Curves facility will include two complete circuits which correspond to
      exercising for approximately 30 minutes followed by a standardized stretching routine.

      ARM II: Patients do not participate in a formal exercise program for 16 weeks. Patients are
      then offered the Curves exercise intervention.
