      (DRE) and testing of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in blood . However, over the years
      it became clear that PSA is not a specific biomarker of prostate cancer . Finding out new
      biomarkers is pivotal for early detection of prostate cancer, increasing the accuracy of
      diagnosis, and reducing the false positives in PSA testing These biomarkers include many
      biological compounds such as, microRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (sncRNA), proteins and
      metabolites .

      PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of sncRNA molecules, are associated with the PIWI
      proteins. Moreover, MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved small non-coding RNAs (19-22
      nucleotide-long) that mediate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, affecting
      mRNA stability and translation by binding complementary sites on target mRNAs[15]. Studies
      have shown that the miRNAs have critical roles in a variety of biological processes such as:
      cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. Regucalcin (RGN) is an
      inhibitory protein of calcium signaling with calcium-binding properties. It plays a
      multifunctional role in the regulation of cell functions. Free amino acids, in biological
      fluids can be a reduced invasive method associated to a high diagnostic potential. It was
      found that free amino acid profiles vary depending on type of cancer and its stage.
