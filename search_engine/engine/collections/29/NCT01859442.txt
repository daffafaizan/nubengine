      appointments at the University of Liverpool Magnetic Resonance and Image Analysis Research
      Centre (MARIARC). Three appointments will be prior to chemoradiotherapy treatment, and the
      other 4 will be after chemoradiotherapy. Two of these 5 appointments are part of routine
      care. The first 4 appointments will last about an hour. Patients will complete 3 quality of
      life questionnaires on recruitment, during chemotherapy, before and 4-6 weeks after surgery.
      These 3 questionnaires will take 20 minutes to fill in. The fourth and fifth appointments
      will consist of Computed Tomogram (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans in our
      radiology department to assess cancer staging. These appointments will last about 1 hour 30
      minutes.
