      predominantly negative symptoms and who derive no benefit from currently available
      treatments. Advances in neuroscience have allowed a greater understanding of negative
      symptoms and have identified key structures and circuits believed to generate and maintain
      them. Here, we propose the application of a targeted therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS),
      to alter the circuits driving negative symptoms. This is a phase I, non-blinded,
      non-randomized, pilot trial, exploring the safety and efficacy of DBS in patients with
      refractory negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Patients must be identified and approached by
      their treating psychiatrist regarding this study. Patients will be given several
      opportunities to review the study details with the investigators before the informed consent
      is presented. All eligible patients will also be reviewed by an independent non-study
      affiliated psychiatrist for confirmation of their diagnosis and assessment of study
      eligibility. The total study duration will be one year for each patient, who will undergo
      regular imaging and psychiatric analyses.
