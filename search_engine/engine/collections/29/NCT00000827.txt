      in adults. HIVIG is manufactured from HIV antibody-rich plasma taken from asymptomatic
      donors. It is hypothesized that HIVIG will decrease the viral burden of moderately advanced
      HIV-positive children.

      Children are randomized to receive HIVIG every 4 weeks for 6 months at one of three dose
      levels, then are followed for 3 months after the final infusion.
