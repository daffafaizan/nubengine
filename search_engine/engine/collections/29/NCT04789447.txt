      rapidly all over the world, and the World Health Organization declared "International Public
      Health Emergency" in January 2020. The first Covid-19 case in our country was seen on March
      11, 2020, and then spread rapidly. SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is a member of the coronavirus
      family, has similar genetic and clinical characteristics to the SARS-CoV virus, which caused
      severe acute respiratory tract infection in 2003 and caused epidemics. Covid-19 patients also
      have clinical diversity in terms of laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings. . In a
      study conducted, "real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction" (rRT-PCR)
      positivity was found to be 83.3% and CT positivity was 97.2% . It is not known whether there
      is a difference in prognosis in patients with only CT findings, only rRT-PCR positivity, and
      both positive.

      The purpose of this study, two tertier hospital in Turkey, laboratory and radiological
      characteristics, comorbidities, treatment received, hospitalization time, to examine the
      invasive mechanical ventilation needs and mortality rates, only with CT findings, only with
      positive RRT-PCR and to determine whether there is a difference between cases where both are
      positive.
