      which 24 male patients with schizophrenia are included. After inclusion in the study,
      patients will be assessed in a test-battery, in which psychophysiological parameters of their
      basic information capabilities are quantified. Following this, the patients will be treated
      with either risperidone or sertindole for a period of 10 weeks, after which they will
      cross-over to the other treatment (the order of treatments is randomized (and balanced)). The
      battery of tests is repeated after the first and second treatment period. In addition, a
      second test-battery will be performed at these follow-up intervals, to assess
      neuropsychological parameters of information processing. To evaluate the extend of the
      treatment effects, the patients will be matched (age, gender, parental socioeconomic status)
      to 24 healthy controls.
