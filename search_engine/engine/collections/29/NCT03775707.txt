      hepatocellular carcinoma, and PD-1 antibody was effective and tolerable in patients with
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of
      lenvatinib plus PD-1 antibody. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective study to
      find out it.
