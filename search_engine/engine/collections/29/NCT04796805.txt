      palpability that facilitate peripheral intravenous catheter insertion. However, there is only
      one study examining the effect of topical essential black pepper oil on veins. The
      investigators aimed to determine the effects of topical application of black pepper essential
      oil on peripheral intravenous catheter insertion success.

      Methods: This randomized controlled trial was carried out on 60 patients randomly assigned to
      either the experimental group (n=30) or the control group (n=30) reporting to the endoscopy
      unit of the clinic between May 2019 and October 2019. The study results were evaluated using
      an information form, a catheter insertion form, and a visual analog scale (VAS). In the
      experimental group, black pepper essential oil was used to increase vein degree before the
      procedure, while in the control group, no extra interventions were applied. The time taken in
      determining an appropriate vein, time taken for successful catheter insertion, and the
      patient's and nurse's satisfaction after the process were recorded via a chronometer.
