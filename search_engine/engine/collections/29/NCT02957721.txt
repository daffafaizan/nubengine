    
      Aim 1: To evaluate how primary care practices adopt and integrate DEAP into routine workflow
      including identification of barriers and facilitators to support acceptable, feasible, and
      sustainable use of the system.

        -  Sub-aim 1.1: Measure the proportion of clinicians and care team members who engage
           patients through the DEAP intervention as well as the types of patient support
           activities they address; assess the representativeness of participating clinicians and
           care team members in relation to all practice staff; and assess how they integrated DEAP
           into the care of type 2 diabetes patients.

        -  Sub-aim 1.2: Assess how practices redesign workflow, overcome barriers, and enhance
           facilitators in order to integrate DEAP.

        -  Sub-aim 1.3: Determine processes for sustaining DEAP beyond the project funding period .

      Aim 2: To compare, relative to usual care, the effectiveness of the DEAP intervention.

        -  Sub Aim 2.1: Measure the proportion and representativeness of eligible patients who
           choose to enroll; access the DEAP curriculum; complete the DEAP curriculum; and contact
           care team members. .

        -  Sub Aim 2.2: Compare the change in the average glycosylated hemoglobin (primary
           outcome), Body Mass Index, systolic blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes (T2D)
           medications and patient activation (secondary outcomes) from baseline to 3 months and
           from 3 to 6 months for patients randomized to DEAP versus usual care.

      Sub Aim 2.3: Assess the clarity, readability and acceptability of the DEAP curricula
      materials for T2D patients enrolled in the intervention.
