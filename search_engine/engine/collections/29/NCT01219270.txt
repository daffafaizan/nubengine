    
      Radiocontrast media after percutaneous coronary interventioncan lead to increased osmolaliry
      of plasma, which results in translocational hyponatremia.

      The investigator will exam the incidence of hyponatremia after percutaneous coronary
      intervention, and will evaluate the underlying mechanism related to hyponatremia including
      translocational hyponatremia, or osmotic natriuresis.
