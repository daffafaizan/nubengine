      phase for those subjects who show a response during the first eight weeks. All treatment will
      be open label and monitored by research clinicians with expertise in treating psychotic
      youth. The initial titration is relatively slow to minimize side effects. A flexible dose
      strategy in which each individual's ultimate dose is determined by his/her response and side
      effects will be used. The maximal dose will be 160mg split as a BID dose. We estimate that
      the average dose will be 120mg/d. Concurrent use of benztropine, propranolol, and
      benzodiazepines (lorazepam and clonazepam) will be permitted as needed to treat any emergent
      extrapyramidal side effects and agitation. Concurrent use of antidepressants and mood
      stabilizers will be permitted in those subjects who have been on stable doses of
      antidepressants or mood stabilizers for at least four weeks at time of entry, or those with
      emergence of significant affective symptoms during the maintenance phase of the study.
