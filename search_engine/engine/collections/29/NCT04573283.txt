      Firstly, it contains a cross-sectional study to collect the clinical data of the patients
      with fatty liver. The clinical features of this population will be analysed.

      Secondly, the study will collect the plasma, urine and stool samples of the patients in this
      cohort. And then a long-term follow-up of these patients will be carried out. Investigators
      wish to find out biomarkers that can detail patient stratification and predict the prognosis
      of the disease.
