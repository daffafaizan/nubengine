      exacerbations account for the majority of costs attributable to asthma in the United States.
      Vitamin D is an essential nutrient with significant immuno-modulatory effects. The
      observation that vitamin D insufficiency and asthma share risk factors such as urban
      residence, obesity, and African American ethnicity has generated significant interest in
      exploring a link between these two conditions.

      This is an 8-week randomized, double-masked, controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day and
      4,000 IU/day) to achieve vitamin D sufficiency (a serum 25(OH)D â‰¥30 ng/ml in 60 school-aged
      children (ages 6 to 14 years) who have vitamin D insufficiency (a serum 25(OH)D <30 ng/ml)
      and are at risk for severe asthma exacerbations, but whose asthma that is well-controlled on
      medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) at the end of a 4-week run-in period.
