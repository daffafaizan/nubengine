    
      This is a 2-way cross-over, randomized, placebo controlled, pilot feasibility study to
      determine the effect of brown rice on the risk factors of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Eligible
      subjects (n = 9) with the MetS (>50 yr, post-menopausal women and men) will be randomized to
      receive either brown rice cakes (100 g/d) as treatment or white rice cake as placebo during
      each 5-wk intervention phase with a 2-wk washout between phases. Subjects will visit Tufts
      Medical Center for all study visits, at the end of baseline (first 2 week run in phase) and
      weeks 7, 9 and 14, which will include a 12 hour fasting blood draw. Two sets of three 24 hour
      dietary recalls will be conducted during the intervention phases. Fasting blood samples will
      be analyzed for 1) oxidative stress markers (vitamin E concentrations, total antioxidant
      capacity, and lipid peroxidation product), 2) blood lipid profiles and 3) metabolic risk
      factors such as plasma glucose, insulin, inflammatory cytokines.
