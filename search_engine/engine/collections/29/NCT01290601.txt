      sequential cohorts. Cohort 1 was randomized 2:1 to receive tafenoquine, 400mg/day for 3 days,
      or the standard blood schizontocidal dosing regimen of chloroquine (1000mg for 2 days
      followed by 500mg for 1 day) followed by a standard hypnozoite eradication dosing regimen for
      primaquine (15mg base per day for 14 days). Cohort 2 was to be randomized 2:1 to receive a
      single 600mg dose of tafenoquine or the standard blood schizontocidal dosing regimen of
      chloroquine (1000mg for 2 days followed by 500mg for 1 day) followed by a standard hypnozoite
      eradication dosing regimen for primaquine (15mg base per day for 14 days).

      A planned interim analysis was performed after all subjects in Cohort 1 had completed the day
      28 assessment and an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) convened to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of the tafenoquine dosing regimen (400mg once per day for 3 days) used in
      Cohort 1. Only if the results from Cohort 1 met pre-defined efficacy and safety criteria was
      enrollment to begin for Cohort 2. The efficacy criterion for achieving the primary endpoint
      was that the lower limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval was no less than 85%, and
      for safety that a review of trends in all AEs, tolerability, medical observations,
      methemoglobin and other lab data for all subjects indicated the dose was well tolerated.

      During the IDMC review it was determined that Cohort 1 failed to meet the pre-specified
      endpoint for the day 28 cure rate and therefore Cohort 2 should not be initiated and
      follow-up in Cohort 1 should be completed according to protocol. Following last subject last
      visit for Cohort 1 the study was terminated.
