      characterized by progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, vascular damage, and
      autoantibody production. Although the disease is relatively rare, it is associated with
      considerable morbidity and mortality. There have been improvements in survival over the past
      few decades; however, this has been related to better management of vascular manifestations
      of disease including renal crisis, pulmonary hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
      and Raynaud's phenomenon. Clinical studies of disease modifying therapies for cutaneous
      disease to date have been relatively unsuccessful.

      Although the etiology of the disease remains unknown, several observations support the role
      of activated T cells in both the blood and skin of affected patients. Abatacept, a
      recombinant fusion protein that blocks T cell activation, has recently been approved by the
      FDA for rheumatoid arthritis. We hypothesize that inhibition of T cell activation with
      abatacept may be efficacious in the treatment of patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis.
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of abatacept versus
      placebo in patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis. Changes in validated measures of skin
      thickness and disease activity over 6-months of treatment will be compared between patients
      receiving abatacept and those receiving placebo. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive
      abatacept.

      The protocol was amended during the study and the outcome measures "Change in Serum
      Autoantibody Profile" and "Change in Serum Cytokine Profile" were changed to exploratory
      outcomes.
