      mortality, most of the population remains sedentary and evidence is inconclusive that
      counseling adults in the primary care setting to increase physical activity is effective.

      The OBJECTIVE of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of an
      innovative programme to promote physical activity (called PEPAF) implemented by family
      doctors into daily routine practice. Doctors randomly allocated to the PEPAF group identified
      sedentary people who visited them for any reason, diagnosed their stage of change and
      prescribed a written plan of physical activity with those patients ready to change. Those not
      prepared to change were briefly counseled and given printed materials to motivate them.
      Patients with cardiovascular disease or other problems meaning that exercise could cause
      adverse effects were excluded.

      Participating people will be followed for 24 months to measure the increase in the level of
      physical activity from baseline measurement to 6, 12 and 24 months, using 7-day physical
      activity recall. Health-related quality of life and cardiorespiratory fitness (submaximal
      cycle ergometer test) will also be measured.

      People assigned to the PEPAF group will be COMPARED to patients of family doctors randomly
      assigned to the control group in which any systematic intervention on physical activity
      promotion has been postponed until year 2006, except for those patients whose health problems
      were directly related to a sedentary lifestyle. The average changes observed in the two
      groups will be compared, on the basis of intention to treat through analysis of covariance.
      The investigators will use mixed-effect models to take into account intra-patient,
      intra-doctor and intra-center correlation.
