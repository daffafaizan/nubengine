      mediates platelet activation and vasoconstriction via binding to cellular
      thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) receptors. The cardioprotective effect of aspirin is due to
      suppression of platelet thromboxane generation and reactivity. Unfortunately 25-50% of
      patients with cardiovascular disease taking ASA continue to generate thromboxane from
      non-platelet sources, which significantly increases their risk of atherothrombosis and death.
      Evidence suggests that oxidative stress is a potent stimulus for thromboxane generation in
      endothelial cells that involves autocrine/paracrine signaling through the TP receptor. This
      clinical trial addresses the central hypothesis that vascular endothelial cells under
      oxidative stress are a major source of non-platelet thromboxane generation in patients with
      cardiovascular disease and that antagonism of the TP receptor will suppress its formation and
      improve endothelial function.
