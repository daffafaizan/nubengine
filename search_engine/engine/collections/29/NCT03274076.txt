    
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of treatment with tofacitinib (study drug) versus placebo (a substance with no
      active ingredients and therefore may have no treatment benefit) in people with diffuse
      cutaneous systemic scleroderma. Subjects will be randomized to tofacitinib vs. placebo in a
      2:1 ratio at 5 mg twice a day for 24 weeks. Subjects will then be offered to participate in
      an open label phase during which they will receive tofacitinib 5 mg twice a day for 24 weeks.
