      Kori-tofu literally means frozen tofu. The production process of Kori-tofu leads to the
      formation of a higher high molecular weight fraction (HMF) content of the soy proteins.
      Several clinical studies describe the effects of Kofi-tofu on health. In this study, the aim
      is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial blood glucose concentrations
      in participants with an impaired glucose tolerance.

      The primary objective is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial blood
      glucose concentrations, when administered as a part of an ordinary high carbohydrate meal.
      The secondary objective is to investigate whether Kori-tofu protein affects postprandial
      insulin concentrations.

      The study is a randomized, cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study
      participants will visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions.
      Subjects will receive two different carbohydrate-rich meals, either with added Kori-tofu or
      whey protein, with a washout period of one week. Blood will be collected via a catheter
      before and up-to 3 hours after consumption of the test-meal.
