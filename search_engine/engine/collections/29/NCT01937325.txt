      therefore have an opportunity to examine correlates between improvements in lung function,
      exercise capacity, inflammatory markers and indices of wellbeing in CF that may not be
      repeatable in a single cohort.

      Investigators propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 20 patients
      currently awaiting initiation of ivacaftor therapy. Patients enrolled in the study will be
      asked to undergo screening (day -28), and baseline assessments (day 0) and re-assessment
      studies (day 28) after treatment period 1, followed by baseline assessment at the beginning
      of treatment period 2 (day 56) and at the conclusion of treatment period 2 (day 84). A
      further assessment (day 224) will be performed 140 (+/-7) days following commencement on open
      label Ivacaftor.

      After satisfying eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomly assigned to initial active
      treatment or placebo following a 4 week run-in period. After completion of period 1 and a 4
      week washout period, subjects will cross-over to the alternative treatment. After 4 weeks of
      period 2, subjects will undergo final assessment as shown in the diagram below. However
      participants choosing not to continue taking ivacaftor in a Named Patient Program or another
      similar program run by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ('Vertex'), at the end of the study
      period will be required to undergo a Safety Follow-Up visit 28 days after the final dose of
      study drug. Safety Follow-Up assessments will not include the CPET.
