      cystatin C with bone mineral density(BMD). All the inpatient in the department of
      endocrinology and metabolism in the fifth affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University will
      be screened for 5 to 6 months. Those satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      included in the study after signing the informed consent.

      The patient's blood will be withdrawn in the morning after 8 hours of fasting and sent to the
      laboratory of the hospital for blood lipids, Hba1c, urinary Albumin creatinine ratio, uric
      acid, GGT, vitamin D, calcium, cystatin C, βserum collagen type 1 cross-linked
      C-telopeptide(βCTX),procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide( P1NP), phosphorus, alkaline
      phosphatase. Smoking habits, duration of diabetes, diabetes medications, and fracture history
      will be asked. The history of smoking is classified as

        1. Non-smokers: Subjects who have never smoked any products (cigarettes, pipes or cigars)
           during their lifetime;

        2. Smoking cessation: a person who smokes one or more products but stops smoking at least

        3. Current smokers: A subject or any other product that smokes at least one cigarette per
           day.

      The pelvic BMD, Vertebral body BMD will be measured in the physical examination department of
      the hospital and divided into normal, osteopenia, osteoporosis.

      All covariates will be extracted to SPSS v.23 for statistical analysis to evaluate the
      association of Cystatin C and BMD.
