        -  Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience full ideal femorotibial contact
           mechanics.

        -  Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience optimal cam/post mechanics.

        -  Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience continuous axial rotation in deep
           flexion.

        -  Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience optimal distribution of tibio-femoral
           and cam/post contact forces over a broad area on the post.

        -  Subjects having a Sigma RP PS TKA will experience a smooth transition of the cam on the
           post, not an abrupt slide as seen with fixed bearing PS TKA.

        -  The use of the sound sensors will detect cam/post contact mechanics under in vivo
           conditions.
