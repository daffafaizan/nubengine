      Primary

        -  Assess the maximum tolerated dose of sunitinib malate when administered concurrently
           with temozolomide in patients with stage IIIC or IV malignant melanoma. (Phase I)

        -  Assess the overall safety of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) Phase II
           was never conducted due to toxicity in phase I.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of sunitinib malate followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily and oral temozolomide once daily on days
      1-42. Treatment repeats every 56 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up very 6 months for up to 5 years.

      Phase II was never conducted due to toxicity in phase I.
