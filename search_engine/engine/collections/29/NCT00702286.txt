    
      The UroShield™ System is comprised of 2 main components:· The Disposable UroShield Z-Patch -
      a disposable small lightweight patch that is attached to the PCN catheter, while its opposite
      side is attached directly to the patient's skin at the site of catheter entry. The patch has
      twofold function:

        1. it receives energy and a signal from the UroShield Driver allowing it to generate the
           ultrasonic waves;

        2. it acts as a fixation device for the PCN catheter.· The UroShield Driver - an external
           driver unit that is attached to the UroShield patch and contains batteries to power the
           system and electronics that control the patch unit
