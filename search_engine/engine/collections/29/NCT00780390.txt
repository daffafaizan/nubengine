      stratification of either diagnosis or therapy is very weak. . There is a great need to
      develop and validate more objective methods to characterize and stratify CRPS that better
      diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are available. Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) has been
      used as the last resource to alleviate pain and re-establish function in CRPS patients.
      However, there is a disagreement over how it works. An underlying concept is that it works by
      modulating autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. Therefore, ANS parameters could be useful
      to stratify patients. Our preliminary studies indicated that SCS has also an effect on blood
      pressure regulation and improves the CRPS patients' response to Valsalva maneuver -a test of
      autonomic function. The Autonomic Nervous System function in adult CRPS patients has not yet
      been studied. The only existing study of CRPS and autonomic function showed that 15% of the
      patients suffer from syncope and increased heart rate during upright position similar to same
      aged patients with postural tachycardia syndrome - a syndrome of autonomic dysfunction. It is
      unclear if autonomic dysfunction is present in CRPS patients because ANS activity is altered
      by chronic pain or whether or not ANS activity contributes to CRPS. Therefore, we proposed to
      study the autonomic function in CRPS patients by standardized autonomic function and to
      evaluate the effect of the SCS on autonomic function in CRPS patients before and after spinal
      cord stimulator implant. This is a 24 months study.
