    
      Functional Disorders (FD) are conditions where patients complain of multiple medically
      unexplained physical symptoms. FD defy the clinical picture of any conventionally defined
      disease and cannot adequately be supported by clinical or para-clinical findings. The
      disorders are common in all medical settings, both in primary and secondary care. The
      conditions range from mild to severe and disabling, they are costly for society due to the
      patients' high health care use, and the patients' social and functional level is reduced.
      There is no well-established, effective pharmacological, or psychotherapeutical treatment
      offer today.

      In randomized controlled trials, cognitive behavioural treatment has shown to be effective
      for selected patient groups suffering from FD. However, only a few trials have been made,
      especially concerning treatment of the most severe disorders.

      Randomized controlled trials on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) have shown
      mitigation of stress, anxiety, and dysphoria in a general population sample and reduction in
      total mood disturbances and stress symptoms in a medical population sample. Furthermore, RCTs
      in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) have demonstrated a 50 % reduction of
      depression relapse for individuals, who have experienced three or more previous episodes.

      We wish to examine the efficacy of MBCT in patients with functional disorders defined as
      severe Bodily Distress Disorder.
