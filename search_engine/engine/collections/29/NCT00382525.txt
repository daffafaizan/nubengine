      behavior of device features, technical reliability and longevity, as well as to allow
      studying device performance in different subgroups of patients. Larger databases are often
      essential for formulating and testing study hypotheses for prospective (randomized) trials.
      While it may depend on specific objectives for individual devices, reliable assessment of
      device performance over longer periods and in broad patient populations typically requires a
      study population from a few hundred to a few thousand patients. PANORAMA collects acute and
      chronic patient and device data in a large population during routine usage of the device,
      without specific study interventions, and always within the approved intended use of the
      device.

      In the past, observational studies were designed and conducted specifically on a
      device-by-device case. PANORAMA avoids the redesign of the same set of data. It establishes a
      core database which can be expanded with substudies creating more detailed data sets for
      particular CRDM devices/features.

      PANORAMA will be open for inclusion to any patient (to be) implanted with a CRDM device. It
      shall be suitable for current and upcoming CRDM devices implanted in patients. It will serve
      as an epidemiological tool designed to stratify morbidity and mortality of all cardiac
      diseases treated by implantable CRDM devices.
