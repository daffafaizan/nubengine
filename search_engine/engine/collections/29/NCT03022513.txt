      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named Non-Celiac
      Gluten Sensitivity' (NCGS). In a previous paper the investigators suggested the term
      'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity' (NCWS), since it is not known what component of wheat causes
      the symptoms in NCGS patients, and the investigators also showed that these patients had a
      high frequency of coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity. CD is an immunological disorder
      whose best-known manifestations are gastrointestinal symptoms. However, early joint
      manifestations are common and frequently overlooked features of the disease. Similarly, the
      clinical picture of NCWS is characterized by combined gastrointestinal (bloating, abdominal
      pain, diarrhea and/or constipation, nausea, epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux,
      aphthous stomatitis) and extra-intestinal and/or systemic manifestations (headache,
      depression, anxiety, 'foggy mind,' tiredness, dermatitis or skin rash, fibromyalgia-like
      joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, and anemia). Nowadays no data are available on the
      characteristic of 'rheumatological' symptoms of NCWS patients. Therefore, the aims of the
      present study are: 1) to investigate the prevalence of fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain in
      NCWS patient, 2) to search for possible ultrasonographical alterations (i.e. synovitis) of
      hands and feet joints of NCWS patients, and 3) to evaluate modification of fibromyalgia-like
      joint/muscle pain in NCWS patients after a gluten free diet period of almost 6 months.
