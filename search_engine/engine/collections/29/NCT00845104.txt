      I. To estimate PFS at 2 years after FR plus Avastin (A) induction followed by Rituximab plus
      Avastin (RA) maintenance therapy for relapsed/refractory CLL patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response rates after FR-A induction and RA maintenance therapy. II. To
      eliminate residual disease (documented by flow cytometry and/or PCR) in patients who have
      achieved a CR after FR-A.

      III. To estimate the rate of conversion of PR to CR after FR-A. IV. To determine the safety
      and pharmacokinetics of FR-A and RA maintenance.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 20-30 minutes once daily on
      days 1-5 and rituximab IV once daily on days 4 or 5. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 8 of
      course 1, patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients achieving complete response, partial response, or nodular partial response proceed
      to maintenance therapy.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 2 months after completion of induction treatment, patients
      receive rituximab IV every 3 months and bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.
      Treatment continues for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.
