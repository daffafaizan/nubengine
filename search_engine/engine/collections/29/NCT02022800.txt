      regarding the treatment of patients during oncologic neurological MDM. It's a matter of
      measuring the frequency in attitude and situations changes in which these changes most often
      occur.

      Secondly, the study will have the objective, during patient follow-up, to evaluate the
      pertinence of these changes in decisions, as well as the usage of PET in relation to clinical
      situations:

        -  The differential diagnosis between radionecrosis or pseudo-progression and recurrence
           before newly appeared contrast zones in patients diagnosed a high glioma level or
           metastasis and treated by radiotherapy; either with or without chemotherapy.

        -  The evaluation at the end of treatment with introductory level temozolomide (TMZ) (6th
           cycle) after adjuvant radio-chemotherapy of a high-level primary cerebral tumor.

        -  The evaluation of the response under anti-angeogenic treatment

      The expected benefit of this study is an improvement in the patient's care. Indeed, the
      additional information provided by Position Emission Tomography (PET) could allow for
      healthcare professionals to more precociously test for recurrence and thus diminish the delay
      in therapeutic care. Conversely, the PET could allow for healthcare professionals to avoid
      over-treatment of patients for whom the MRI would wrongly indicate a recurrence. Furthermore,
      imagery by PET should bring a new level of additional information allowing for an increase in
      the confidence index when being diagnosed, thus comforting the collective therapeutic
      attitude proposed in the MM.
