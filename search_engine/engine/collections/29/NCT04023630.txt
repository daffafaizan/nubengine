      rivaroxaban plus ticagrelor with rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel in Patients With Non Valvular
      Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF) and Acute Coronary Syndrome. The study aims to show inferiority of
      rivaroxaban plus ticagrelor when compared to rivaroxaban plus clopidogrel in terms of safety.
      Safety will be determined by comparing the rates of death or ischemic event-including
      myocardial infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent
      revascularization.
