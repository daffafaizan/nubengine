      measures for all dependent variables. This trial will enroll subjects with a clinical
      diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
      computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound, including those diagnosed with nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH). Subjects will be consented, blood collected and a MRI conducted on
      the first visit. Patients will be advised on the proper use of the study drug and given the
      first three month's supply of the study drug to take home with them. For the remaining three
      months, study drug will be delivered by US mail along with return packaging for the prior
      three month's study medication in order to monitor compliance. Patients will be called
      routinely to encourage compliance, retention, and monitor side effects or adverse events.
      After six months of study drug administration, subjects will return for a follow-up visit.
      Blood will be drawn, an MRI will be obtained and a post-study questionnaire will be
      administered.
