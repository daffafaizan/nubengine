    
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to investigate the sequence in which
      physicians perform the pelvic exam, describe and compare the self-reported comfort during
      each section of the pelvic exam and how comfort during the exam relates to quality of life,
      self-esteem, and sexual function in English speaking females at least 18 years of age in an
      outpatient setting.
