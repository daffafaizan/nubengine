      The primary aim will be to see if Omega-3 Woundâ„¢ is clinically superior to tissue harvested
      from the palate (Autogenous Free Gingival Graft) when comparing before and after measurements
      of: keratinized tissue. Change in KT width from time of surgery to 6 months post-surgery
      (22).

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Measures of periodontal health (probing depth, recession levels, bleeding on probing,
           plaque score, clinical attachment level, resistance to muscle pull, vestibular depth,
           healing time) over 3 months (at study entry, 4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months)

        2. Time of surgery

        3. Subject Discomfort Survey during healing and at 1 week and 4 weeks

        4. Subject Preference Questionnaire at month 6

        5. Safety endpoints assessed by monitoring adverse events
