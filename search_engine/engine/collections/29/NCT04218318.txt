    
      Neonates in high-threshold group phototherapy will be ceased if TSB level is 50-100 µmol/L
      below the appropriate 2004 AAP phototherapy threshold, whereas neonates in the low-threshold
      group phototherapy will be stopped if TSB reached ˃100 µmol/L below the AAP threshold.

      Phototherapy will be commenced for neonates in both groups according to AAP
      guidelines.Neonates will be treated with intensified overhead blue LEDs phototherapy if they
      have a TSB level at or above phototherapy threshold. Neonates will be started on intensified
      360◦ LED phototherapy if they have TSB level within 50µmol/L below the exchange threshold.
      The administration of IVIG is indicated in infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease if TSB
      lies within 34 to 51 micromol/L of the threshold for exchange transfusion and not responding
      to initial intensified phototherapy.Infants with a TSB concentration above the thresholds for
      exchange should have immediate intensified 360◦ LED phototherapy, and preparation for
      exchange transfusion will be started.Infants showed clinical signs of acute bilirubin
      encephalopathy will have an immediate exchange transfusion.
