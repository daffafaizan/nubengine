      I. To compare investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) between atezolizumab plus
      radiotherapy and atezolizumab alone. (Phase II) II. To compare overall survival (OS) between
      atezolizumab plus radiotherapy and atezolizumab alone. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity between the atezolizumab plus radiotherapy arm and the atezolizumab
      arm.

      II. To assess the impact of adding radiotherapy on PFS and OS in patients with 1-3 visible
      tumors and > 3 visible tumors.

      III. To assess the impact of adding radiotherapy on PFS and OS in patients receiving
      consolidation radiotherapy to all visible disease ("complete consolidation") and patients who
      do not receive consolidation radiation to all visible disease ("incomplete consolidation").

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the association between pre-treatment tumor burden (determined by central
      radiographic assessment, using both tumor number and tumor volume), and PFS and OS benefit.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo
      radiation therapy once daily (QD) on days 1-5 during weeks 1-5 only.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
