      information between the brain and external devices, offering a natural and rich control
      signal for prosthetic hands or functional electrical stimulators (FES) to re-animate
      paralyzed hands. This study focuses on an ECoG-based BCI system. ECoG measures brain activity
      using electrodes implanted on the surface of the brain. Each participant will undergo testing
      of the ECoG direct brain interface for up to 29 days. Participants will learn to control
      computer cursors, virtual reality environments, and assistive devices such as hand orthoses
      and functional electrical stimulators using neural activity recorded with the ECoG sensor.
