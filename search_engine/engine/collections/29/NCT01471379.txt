      primarily by abdominal pain associated with bowel dysfunction. Like many other painful
      functional somatic syndromes (e.g. fibromyalgia) the pathophysiology of IBS includes abnormal
      responses to pain and dysregulation of brain-body pain pathways. IBS affects up to 10% of the
      population, is a leading reason for visits to gastroenterologists and primary care doctors,
      and, in the United States, annually accrues health care costs over $20 billion.

      In their practice the investigators use centrally acting agents to treat IBS. Historically,
      the investigators have used tricyclic antidepressants based on results of clinical trials,
      including our NIH funded trial on desipramine. Nonetheless, these agents can produce side
      effects that limit their full application. More recently the investigators have begun to use
      SNRIs because they have been shown to benefit for various pain syndromes like diabetic
      neuropathy, fibromyalgia. The initial impression is that Milnacipran helps improve IBS
      symptoms and global well being. There is now a need to systematically determine Milnacipran's
      value for IBS.
