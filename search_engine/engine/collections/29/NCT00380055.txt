      provision of cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. These disparities have been related
      to a variety of health-system, health-financing, geographic, and cultural barriers. We
      hypothesize that the use of lay community outreach workers will be an effective means of
      identifying and overcoming these barriers in order to improve the proportion of
      Medicare-eligible American Indians who receive recommended screening and diagnosis for
      prostate, breast, colon, and cervical cancer, and the proportion of individuals receiving
      appropriate treatment for prostate, breast, colon, cervical, and lung cancer. Community
      clusters randomized to this form of cancer navigation will be compared with community
      clusters randomized to receive educational outreach only.
