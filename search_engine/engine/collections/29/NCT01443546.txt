      with the desire to donate oocytes and who meet FDA and program requirements for donation.

      Participants will be randomized to one of the three treatment interventions for triggering
      ovulation: 1) a standard dose of hCG, 2) leuprolide acetate 2 mg alone, or 3) a combination
      of the two drugs in low dosage (leuprolide acetate 2 mg and hCG 1500 IU).

      Study participants who choose to repeat oocyte donation during the course of the study trial,
      and who consent to participate in the trial again, will be randomized in a cross-over manner
      for any subsequent trials.

      Following randomization, the clinical care of study subjects will be the same as for
      non-participant oocyte donors. Participants in all three study arms will undergo standard
      ovarian stimulation protocol with gonadotropins, standard individualized adjustment of
      medication dose, standard criteria for administration of the ovulation trigger dose, and
      standard egg retrieval procedure.

      The recipient population will be recruited from women, age 18 to 55, who present to our
      center wishing to become pregnant using donor oocytes. All prospective participants who meet
      the Center for Reproductive Medicine (CRM) criteria be recipients of donated eggs will be
      eligible to participate, should they wish to do so.

      If a prospective recipient consents to participate in the study, then she would be matched
      with either a donor who is not participating in the study (and is receiving one of our
      standard triggers for ovulation) or a donor who is participating in the study and whose
      medication to trigger ovulation has been randomized into one of three groups: standard dose
      hCG, Leuprolide acetate, or a combination of low dose hCG and Leuprolide acetate.

      A recipient who chooses to participate in the study will have no additional tests or
      procedures over the ones that she would normally do in order to receive donated eggs.
