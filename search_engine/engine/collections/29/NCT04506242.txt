      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before surgery [neoadjuvant phase], followed by camrelizumab
      alone after surgery [adjuvant phase] in participants with resectable stage II, IIIA, and
      resectable IIIB (T3N2) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary hypotheses of this
      study are that neoadjuvant camrelizumab in combination with apatinib, followed by surgery and
      adjuvant camrelizumab will improve: 1)MPR assessed by investigator using Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) ; 2) event free survival (EFS) and 3)
      overall survival (DFS).
