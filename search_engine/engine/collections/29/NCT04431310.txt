      second phase) serum samples will be drawn and shipped bi-weekly to laboratory collaborators
      in United Kingdom for antibody analyses during the course of the local epidemic, expected to
      last 10-12 weeks or more. After the cease of the epidemic serum will be drawn in 3-monthly
      intervals in a smaller group of seroconverted volunteers to follow the long-lasting immunity
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 5 years post-pandemic.

      Nurses, medical doctors, biomedical laboratory scientists, social health care assistants, and
      few healthcare administrators (as controls) will be invited for enrolment. In hospitals, all
      departments with staff that are in physical contact with patients during the pandemic will be
      invited to participate in the study.
