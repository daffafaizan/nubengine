      parameters, lipid profile and cardiovascular risk markers (using enzymatic and biochemical
      techniques, nephelometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, radioimmunoassay), and markers
      of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the insulin pathway and inflammatory and apoptotic
      parameters (by means of Western blot, Real Time- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Luminex®
      xMAP® Technology ) in patients with and without PCOS. The investigators' second objective is
      to evaluate (using the abovementioned methodology) the efficacy of different insulin
      sensitizers (myoinositol and metformin) administered to PCOS patients during a 3-month period
      after which the investigators will analyze different parameters of oxidative stress and
      mitochondrial function (using Clark electrode and fluorometric techniques).
