      with neuromotor developmental delay. Diagnosis of GERD in patients with neurological
      impairment (NI) might be more difficult due to the absence of characteristic features in many
      cases. One of the best methods for the diagnosis of GER is the 24-hour esophageal pH
      monitoring.Even though there are some statements in the literature advocating that
      gastroesophageal reflux may develop in the late period in patients undergoing only
      gastrostomy, there are also reports supporting that gastrostomy does not contribute to the
      development of reflux.Regardless of whether the patient received anti-reflux surgery or not,
      the long-term follow-up is necessary in patients feeding with gastrostomy.The aim of this
      study is to compare the results of pre- and postoperative 24-hour pH monitoring in patients
      who underwent gastrostomy only and who underwent fundoplication concurrently with gastrostomy
      and to evaluate influence of gastrostomy/ LNF+ gastrostomy on GER.
