    
      Radical lymph node dissection (LND) along the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is surgically
      demanding and can be associated with substantial postoperative morbidity. The question as to
      whether robot-assisted esophagectomy (RE) might be superior to video-assisted thoracoscopic
      esophagectomy (VATE) for performing LND along the RLN in patients with esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains open.

      The investigators will conduct a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (termed
      REVATE) enrolling patients with ESCC scheduled to undergo LND along the RLN. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to either RE or VATE. The primary outcome measure will be the rate of
      unsuccessful LND along the left RLN, which will be defined as 1) failure to remove lymph
      nodes along the left RLN or 2) occurrence of left RLN palsy following LND. Secondary outcomes
      will include the number of successfully removed RLN nodes, postoperative recovery, length of
      hospital stay, 30- and 90-day mortality, quality of life, and oncological outcomes.
