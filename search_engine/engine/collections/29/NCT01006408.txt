      trigger tissue to increase cellular production by giving off a low-level, or cold light
      energy. This low level energy passes through the skin, into the cell membrane producing a
      process called photobiostimulation. LLLT works by capturing and increasing the beneficial
      wavelengths of light. These lasers do not cut or burn, but instead penetrate into the skin.
      This process has multiple effects on cells and can enhance the body's natural regenerative
      functions. It can also stimulate the release of endorphins and collagen. Endorphins work as
      "natural pain relievers" and are produced by the body during strenuous workouts, excitement
      and pain. Collagen is a natural substance within body tissues.

      This is a single center trial conducted at Legacy Health System. Twenty patients from Legacy
      Health System with chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy will be enrolled in this study. Arm 1
      will receive LLLT twice a week for a total of eight weeks. Arm 2 will follow a crossover
      study design where patients will receive sham (fake) LLLT twice a week for the first four
      weeks, followed by true LLLT twice a week for four weeks, (total of 8 weeks). Each patient in
      Arm 2 will serve as his or her own comparison for the purpose of examining the effects of
      LLLT. Both arms will have a follow-up visit following the last treatment.
