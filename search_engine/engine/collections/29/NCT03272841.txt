      improved tissue-matching techniques and better immunosuppressive drugs. However, nowadays the
      major aim after transplantation is the long-term patient and graft survival which are still
      poor, where half of the RTR looses their graft after 10 years. With TransplantLines we are
      setting up an extensive biobank to improve the long-term survival after transplantation.
      Moreover, we are one of the few studies to collect across transplant specialities. Like
      mentioned in the brief summary, extensive questionnaires will be send to participants prior
      to the visit containing multiple questionnaires (e.g. SF-36, WHODAS, PQ-SGA etc.). During the
      visit, we will collect multiple blood samples who will be taken during the regularly visit to
      the clinician. Moreover, two tubes from 24-hour urine collection will be collected, faeces,
      hair and nails will be stored. Finally, physical tests and cognitive tests will be performed
      with the participants (e.g. 2-min walking test, 4m walking test, timed-up-and-go test etc.).
