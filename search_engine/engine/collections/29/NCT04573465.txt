      support coaching model for college students. The primary aim of the coaching model is to
      increase participants' adherence to ACT Guide, an online mental health program. To test the
      effects of peer-support coaching on ACT Guide adherence rates and outcomes, the investigators
      will conduct a randomized controlled trial with three conditions (peer-support phone
      coaching, peer-support text message coaching, and a no support control group) using a sample
      of 300 Utah State University undergraduate students. Individuals who indicate interest in
      participating will complete an automated online workflow through Qualtrics which will include
      informed consent, baseline assessment, ACT Guide registration, and randomization into one of
      the three conditions. Participants will then gain access to a research version of ACT Guide,
      either with no additional support, with concurrent peer-support coaching, or with concurrent
      peer-support text messaging based on their randomly assigned condition. Coaching will take
      place over 10 weeks, with the post assessment being administered 10 weeks after baseline
      assessment. The investigators hypothesize that participants will adhere to coaching (80%
      completing â‰¥ 6 coaching calls; 80% responding to texts > 6 weeks), be satisfied with coaching
      (M = 5 "agree" on a 6-point self-reported coaching satisfaction scale), and that coaching
      fidelity will be maintained (80% of audited coaching calls/texts meeting criteria for
      fidelity). The investigators also hypothesize that participants who receive peer-support
      phone coaching will complete more ACT Guide modules and will report greater improvements in
      mental health relative to both the text messaging and no support conditions, and that the
      text messaging condition will perform greater in this regard than the no support condition.
