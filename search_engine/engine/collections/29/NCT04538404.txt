      Italian hospital were retrospectively selected. MECC score [Mortality in Elderly patients
      with Colon Cancer] was calculated summing up the scores relating to: arterial saturation of
      O2, Systolic Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, WBCs, Albumin, Creatinine. Once CR-POSSUM was
      calculated, the two scores were compared.
