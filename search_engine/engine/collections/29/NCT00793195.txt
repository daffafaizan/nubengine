      morbidity and mortality in infants with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) and intestinal failure.
      Although, the etiology is likely multi-factorial, lipids within parenteral nutrition solution
      have been implicated in its development. The standard lipid used in PN is typically, a soy
      based lipid (eg: Intralipid® - Fresenius Kabi) that primarily contains omega-6 fatty acids
      (ω6FAs). Animal and human studies have suggested that addition of omega-3 fatty acids (ω3FAs)
      to parenteral nutrition may decrease the incidence of hepatic injury, as well as have
      beneficial immunologic effects. SMOFlipid® (Fresenius Kabi) is a composite lipid emulsion,
      which contains polyunsaturated ω3 and ω6FAs, monounsaturated FAs, as well as medium chain FAs
      as integral constituents. All components (Soy-bean oil, medium chain triglycerides, olive
      oil, fish oil) have been used in humans, and the drug is approved for use in children in
      Europe. Based on its composition, we believe that this lipid preparation has the potential to
      prevent progression of liver disease in infants with SBS who are demonstrating evidence of
      liver dysfunction.
