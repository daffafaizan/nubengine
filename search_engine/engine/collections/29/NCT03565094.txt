      possibility of 4 additional cohorts. In cohort 1, the subjects will receive a single dose of
      Lu AF28996 by mouth. Following evaluation of data from the first dose, the subjects in the
      following cohorts are planned to receive two single increasing doses by mouth of Lu AF28996
      on 2 separate days with a wash out (day or days without dosing) in between.

      Part B is an open-label three-period crossover study in healthy young men to compare the PK
      of an oral capsule formulation with that of an oral solution formulation and to evaluate food
      effect following oral capsule administration of Lu AF28996.The subjects will be randomised to
      one of the four treatment sequences
