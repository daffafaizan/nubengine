      opioids are effective analgesics, dose-limiting side effects in the form of sedation, nausea
      and vomiting, and fear of dependence often limit their use at higher - and possibly more
      effective - doses. Of particular interest, however, is the potential for greater than
      additive analgesic effect of cannabinoids and opioids in combination that would allow for
      opioid analgesic effect to be achieved at lower dosages than are necessary alone, which could
      overcome problems with both tolerance and side effects for both drug classes. Unfortunately,
      safety data on the combination in humans does not exist at this time and needs to be
      obtained. As increasing numbers of patients with chronic pain may turn to cannabis to augment
      the effects of their opioid analgesics, data on potential pharmacokinetic interactions and
      clinical safety of the combinations should be evaluated in a controlled clinical research
      setting.
