      individuals and their families, communities and healthcare systems.While neck pain can be
      severely disabling and costly, treatment options have shown moderate evidence of
      effectiveness. No previous study has used foam roller in patients with neck pain. In
      addition, it has been suggested that neurodynamic interventions provide a peripheral
      stimulus, reducing the pressure existing within the nerve, improving blood flow, axonal
      transport and nerve conduction. It was hypothesized that a self-administered intervention
      focused on myofascial release of main muscles related to neck pain and upper-limb active
      neurodynamics could reduce the presence of active trigger points and pain, improving
      functionality and active mobility.
