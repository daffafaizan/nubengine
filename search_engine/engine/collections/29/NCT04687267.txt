    
      Women aged 25-45 years, adherent to the organized population-based cervical screening
      program, with a histological diagnosis of CIN2 and fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be
      invited to participate to the study, previously providing specific information; in case of
      acceptance, informed consent is signed.

      STUDY PROTOCOL:

      The adherent women will attend periodical control visits:

        -  every 6 months up to 24 months, with performance of: pap test (PT) and colposcopy (with
           biopsy in case of visible alterations);

        -  at 6 and 12 months control visit: a liquid-based sample of cervical cells will be
           collected for the biomarkers' analyses.

      BIOMARKERS:

        1. - HPV search and partial HPV16/18 genotyping, by cobas 4800 high-risk HPV assay (Roche);
           PCR with MY09/MY11 consensus primers and full genotyping by restriction fragment length
           analysis, plus PCR with beta-globin primers (in-house);

        2. - methylation analysis of the cellular genes FAM194A and hsa-mir124-2, by
           methylation-specific quantitative PCR test (qMSP - QIAsure methylation test, Qiagen);

        3. - methylation analysis of the L1 and L2 viral genes of HPV types 16 and 18, by
           pyrosequencing;

        4. - immunocytochemical analysis for p16INK4A/Ki67 proteins (dual stain), by p16INK4A/Ki67
           immunocytochemical analysis by CINtec Plus kit (Roche).
