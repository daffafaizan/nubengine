      erodes the ability of each member of the couple to support each other. Moreover, couples may
      be unaccustomed to seeking or accepting emotional and practical support from family members
      or formal resources. Even though AD can have a major negative impact on each member of the
      couple and on their relationship, their needs have generally been addressed separately, often
      without sufficient appreciation for the importance of their ongoing relationship. Previous
      studies suggest that by improving support for both members of the couple, the intervention
      will have a positive effect on mental health outcomes such as depression and help keep the
      person with AD at home rather than in a long-term care facility.

      One hundred couples will be randomly assigned either to an immediate treatment group or a
      wait-list control group which will receive treatment four months after enrollment.
      Participants will receive a formal baseline assessment, consisting of a structured set of
      questionnaires to assess dyadic (couple) adjustment, social support, depression and anxiety
      as well as goals for counseling. There will be two follow-up assessments, 2 and 4 months
      after baseline using the same instruments. All participants will be able to call a counselor
      for the duration of the study to obtain resource and referral information or in the event of
      a crisis. The treatment will consist of 6 sessions of couples counseling within a 2-month
      period. The focus will be on helping each member of the couple to express feelings, needs and
      issues that have emerged between them as a result of the diagnosis.
