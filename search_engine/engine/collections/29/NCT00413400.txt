      type II DM (diabetes mellitus) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A subclinical
      inflammatory state is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome,
      insulin resistance, and coronary artery disease (CAD). Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -alpha is
      an inflammatory cytokine that is increased in a spectrum of inflammatory diseases as well as
      in insulin resistance. TNF-alpha antagonists are clinically effective in the inflammation of
      arthritides, and have recently been shown by our group to decrease inflammatory
      cardiovascular risk markers in metabolic syndrome. Data suggests that adiponectin, a recently
      discovered adipocytokine that may protect against the development of insulin resistance and
      atherosclerosis, may be downregulated by TNF-alpha. In addition, population based studies
      have shown that those with the highest levels of TNF-alpha have an increased relative risk of
      cardiovascular morbidity while rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with TNF-alpha blockade
      appear protected from cardiovascular disease. We will perform a 6-month study in which we
      will administer etanercept, a TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein, to subjects with metabolic
      syndrome to investigate its effect on surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease, including
      inflammatory markers, adiponectin and glucose tolerance and endothelial function. The results
      of the proposed study will have broad implications regarding the physiological role of
      TNF-alpha on the inflammatory cascade, cardiovascular indices and endothelial function.
