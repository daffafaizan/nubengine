      been demanded by communities at great risk of HIV, especially men who have sex with men
      (MSM). The DREAM Program is developing a tenofovir (TFV) douche for on demand PrEP use prior
      to receptive anal intercourse (RAI), given that the vast majority of MSM very commonly douche
      prior to RAI (behaviorally-congruent). This ATN protocol seeks to ensure the inclusion of
      adolescent and young adults' (age 15-24 years) perspectives as next generation biomedical
      prevention, specifically a rectal douche, is being developed for efficacy.

      ATN DREAM is an early phase 1, open label study to compare the safety, PK, PD, and
      acceptability of a TFV-medicated douche. Each participant will undergo a Screening Visit to
      evaluate eligibility. Baseline Visit will assess pre-dose safety, PK, PD, and behavioral
      points of reference. Safety, PK, PD, and behavioral readouts are assessed at specified times
      after the single dose. The TFV douche to be used consists of TFV 660 mg in 125 mL half-normal
      saline (TFV 5.28 mg/mL). Study objectives including safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and acceptability of a single TFV douche, are essential to inform the
      design of an extended safety study of a TFV douche in outpatient pre-RAI contexts. The
      necessity of extending the testing of new HIV prevention modalities to this proposed
      adolescent population is motivated by anticipated behavioral differences, not biological
      ones.

      Participant accrual will take approximately 9 months and each participant will be on study
      for approximately 3 months. Total study duration is about 1 year.
