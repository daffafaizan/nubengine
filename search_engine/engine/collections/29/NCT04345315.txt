      characteristics. In this context, it is essential to collect data relating to the
      epidemiology of the disease, to outline further useful tools for diagnosis and to define the
      correct use of rapid molecular and / or serological tests in the surveillance of high-risk
      subjects (cancer patients and healthcare operators), in order to identify any new disease
      control strategies, crucial to reduce the transmission and to outline specific guidelines for
      cancer patients healthcare management. It is also necessary to identify the factors that
      determine the evolution of the viral genome over time in the various geographical areas and
      also the potential susceptibility markers in the different types of affected subjects
      (symptomatic, mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic).
