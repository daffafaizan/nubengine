      number of patients with refractory cough, the concept of cough hypersensitivity syndrome
      (CHS) has emerged. In CHS, afferent sensory nerves may exhibit a modification of activation
      patterns with facilitation of encoding signals in response to irritating stimuli. Similar
      patterns with neuropathic pain have been described. Small fiber neuropathy has never been
      assessed in chronic cough. Interestingly, diabetic patients experienced cough more frequently
      than healthy subject. We hypothesized that small fiber neuropathy may explain chronic cough
      is more frequent in diabetic patients.

      Within 60 days after inclusion, diabetic patients with and without chronic cough will perform
      neurophysiological tests such as electromyography, thermotest, QSART (Quantitative Sudomotor
      Axon Reflex Test and Sudoscan), cardio-vascular tests to study the autonomic nervous system.
      No risks are expecting with these non-invasive tests. A skin biopsy to evaluate small fiber
      neuropathy will also be performed.After the neurophysiological tests, a consultation will be
      scheduled at 6 months. A cough VAS and LCQ will be used to assess cough.
