      so that neither you nor the investigator will know which group you are in.

      You will be put into either the treatment group or the control group.

        -  The treatment group will receive a drug called pentoxifylline

        -  The control group will receive a placebo (matching pill that has no medication in it)
           You will take the pills by mouth starting from the time of admission. You will receive a
           total of 9 doses over the first three days of your hospitalization (72 hours).

      When subject have standard patient care blood draws, additional blood will be taken to do the
      research tests. The additional blood tests will be done every day for up to 5 days, after the
      administration of study drug or till the time of discharge whichever occurs earlier. The
      additional tests will require about 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of blood per day; the maximum amount
      of extra blood taken would be less than 3 tablespoons (40.0 ml). Information from your
      medical record will be gathered while you are hospitalized and after your discharge. The
      study will continue to gather clinical follow up information up to four months.
