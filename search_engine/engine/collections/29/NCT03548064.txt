      safety and immunogenicity of double mutant heat-labile toxin LTR192G/L211A (dmLT) from
      Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) by oral, sublingual, or intradermal vaccination in
      approximately 135 healthy adult volunteers, age 18-45 years, who meet all the eligibility
      criteria and reside in Bangladesh. Study duration is approximately 2.5 years, with each
      participant duration for up to 9 months depending on the route of dmLT administered. The
      study population will be recruited from Mirpur, a community of Dhaka, Bangladesh, known as
      having a high rate of diarrheal, respiratory, and enteric disease. This clinical trial is
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a range of
      dosages of dmLT administered by three different routes: oral, sublingual, or intradermal. The
      oral and sublingual routes of administration will evaluate dosages of 5, 25, and 50
      micrograms of dmLT; the intradermal route of administration will evaluate dosages of 0.3,
      1.0, and 2.0 micrograms of dmLT. Participants will receive a total of three sequential doses
      of dmLT; the oral and sublingual routes will be at days 1, 15, and 29 and the intradermal
      route will be at days 1, 22, and 43. There is no specific hypothesis being tested in this
      study. The primary objective of this study is to assess the reactogenicity, safety, and
      tolerability of dmLT when administered in three sequential doses, over a range of dosages by
      oral, sublingual, or intradermal routes. The secondary objectives of this study are: 1) to
      assess the long-term safety, from first vaccination through 6 months following the last dose
      of vaccine, 2) to evaluate the serum anti-dmLT IgG and IgA response, 3) to evaluate the IgG
      and IgA anti-dmLT Antibody Secreting Cell (ASC) response, 4) to evaluate the IgG and IgA
      anti-dmLT Antibodies in Lymphocyte Supernatant (ALS) response, 5) to evaluate the total fecal
      IgA and fecal anti-dmLT IgA response, and 6) to evaluate the total salivary IgA and the
      saliva-derived anti-dmLT IgA response.
