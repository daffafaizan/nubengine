      chronic hepatic impairment and matched (age, sex, weight, BMI) healthy subjects. Subjects
      will be enrolled into 1 of 3 groups based on hepatic impairment grade: mild, moderate and
      normal hepatic function. An optional severe hepatic impairment group will enroll based on
      data from the mild and moderate hepatic impairment groups in comparison to matched healthy
      group. All subjects will receive a single oral dose of IPI-145 25 mg.
