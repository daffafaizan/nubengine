      during palliative shunt procedure. Patients will receive 0.3 million/kg of autologous cardiac
      progenitor cells via intracoronary delivery 1 month after cardiac surgery. Follow-up visits 3
      months to 1 year after cell injection will need to prospectively verify the clinical,
      laboratory, and safety-related data.
