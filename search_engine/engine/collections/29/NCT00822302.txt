      active arm of the study. Bloods will be taken for baseline measurements, and the infusion of
      either saline (placebo) or rHDL (active agent) will be carried out on the ward. Infusion will
      take 4 hours, and the active agent infused at 40mg/kg.

      Just prior to CAE, bloods will be collected (24 hours post-infusion) and the atherosclerotic
      tissue collected into RNA stabilising agent for subsequent analysis. Further bloods will then
      be collected 24 hours post-operatively (48 hours post-infusion).

      Patients vital signs will be monitored hourly following infusion and will be reviewed in
      out-patients at 6 weeks after the operation.
