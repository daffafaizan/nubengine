      refugees in primary care. The first step in both models is giving a medication (an SSRI/SSRN,
      e.g., paroxetine). For those who still have PTSD, the second step is either adding another
      medication (e.g., prazosin) or providing culturally sensitive cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT). We hypothesize that patients will improve in both models, but more so in the the CBT
      model. The primary outcome measure is PTSD severity as assessed by the PTSD Checklist (PCL).
      Eligibility requirements include having PTSD and having been old enough to remember the Khmer
      Rouge period.
