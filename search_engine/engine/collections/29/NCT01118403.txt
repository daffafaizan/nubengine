    
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most common nosocomial infections occur
      in intensive care units, with frequencies ranging between 15% and 45%, which determine an
      attributable mortality of 25% to 27%

      Patients with compromised state of consciousness brought to mechanical ventilation, have a
      much higher reported incidence that patients without neurological involvement, reaches
      between 44 and 70%.

      These data have led to plan the implementation of strategies to reduce the incidence of early
      pneumonia in this population group, to thereby favorably influence the high rates of
      mortality, morbidity and costs that arise.

      Then we design this study to assess whether these patients really benefit from the use of
      antibiotics as a prophylactic, considering also the high impact that this would have given
      the high incidence of early ventilator-associated pneumonia in this population group.
