      themselves in remote areas and need to be treated in relative resource poor settings. It is
      for this reason that standardised treatment with proven efficacy is much needed. A shorter
      course of treatment is not only advantageous for the patient but also reduces the overall
      case load in the clinics thus reducing the risk of disease outbreaks in already
      immuno-compromised kala-azar patients. Paromomycin, either alone or in combination with SSG
      would decrease the treatment duration substantially. An additional added value of combination
      therapy is that it is likely to reduce the chances of development of parasite resistance
      against the individual drugs.

      Leishmaniasis experts in the three countries are in agreement that there are potential
      benefits of the combination treatment of SSG and PM and that its efficacy should be evaluated
      with the view to introduce this protocol if proven efficacious and safe. There is ample
      circumstantial evidence of the use of this combination therapy and its efficacy and
      tolerability as a standardized protocol. This can only be confirmed through a randomised
      controlled study with 6 months follow up.
