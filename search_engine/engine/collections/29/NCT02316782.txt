    
      Global multi-center, prospective, two-arm, randomized study. Patients will be randomized to
      either blinded or non-blinded IVUS assessment before the treatment of coronary bifurcation
      lesions. Treatment will be based either on grayscale and VH IVUS versus angiography alone.

      After routine coronary angiogram, the physicians in the blinded arm of the study will only
      use the angiogram to guide the DES stenting procedure; the non-blinded arm will use the
      angiogram and IVUS grayscale and VH-IVUS to guide the procedure. In all patients, both pre-
      and post intervention, IVUS grayscale and VH-IVUS will be preformed on both branches of the
      bifurcation (blinded or non-blinded).
