    
      Design: Monocentric, cross-sectional analytical study

      Subjects: 32 HIV-free and Cushing disease-free adult patients for whom a prolonged treatment
      (³3months) with glucosteroids (³ 0.5 mg/kg/day) is initiated

      Methods: At treatment initiation and 3 months after: comparison of fat sample mRNA expression
      of adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, IL6, TNFa), 11bHSD1, SREBP1c and PPARg, fat morphology
      and seric concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, IL6, sTNFR1 between patients LD+ and
      patients LD-. The diagnosis of LD will be performed by 3 experts using patients photographs

      Aims of this study:

        -  To gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of glucosteroids-induced LD

        -  To compare this pathophysiology to the one of HIV-associated LD for which the hypothesis
           of a local, cellular, hypercorticism has been put forward and for which related
           treatment have been prescribed.
