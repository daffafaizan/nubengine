      treat dizziness in patients with chronic diseases. The investigators designed this randomized
      clinical trial to examine whether Diaoshi Jifa significantly decreases dizziness in patients
      with Meniere's disease. There are 2 arms in this trial: One arm is DiaoShi Jifa plus
      conventional Western medical treatment, another is conventional Western medical treatment
      only. The dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) will be used to evaluate the treatment effect.
