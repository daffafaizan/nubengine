      Although the number of conditions that can present with nausea are numerous, the mainstay of
      treatment has become intravenous ondansetron (Zofran), not only due to its rapid onset but
      also its availability. One of the major drawbacks to using this form is that it often needs
      to be redosed. This study aims to compare intravenous (IV) ondansetron alone versus IV
      ondansetron given with IV dexamethasone (Decadron) as another viable option when treating
      patients with nausea in the emergency department.
