      Aim 1: Validate externally the predictive risk score using Sea Mar CHC's robust data
      including 29,000 patients age-eligible for colorectal cancer screening; stratify patients
      according to risk of non-adherence to follow-up colonoscopy; and adapt patient navigation
      program for the local context.

      Aim 2: Assess the effectiveness, costs, and cost-effectiveness of a centralized, phone-based
      patient navigation program for follow-up colonoscopy receipt for patients at moderate risk or
      high risk for non-adherence.

      Aim 3: Assess differences in the intervention arms in secondary outcomes (e.g. time to
      colonoscopy receipt, no-show/canceled appointments, colonoscopy quality) and moderators of
      intervention effectiveness (e.g. probability level, intervention dose, and patient age,
      ethnicity, and sex)
