      most common disorder requiring interventional pain treatment in USA. Fluoroscopy-assisted
      transforaminal anterior epidural steroid injections (TAESI) are more commonly preferred for
      treatment of low back pain. Most of the time epidural steroid injections are supplemented
      with different analgesic combinations due to insufficient analgesia. Recent reports have
      revealed immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities for statins in vivo and in vitro.
      Statins have very recently been shown to alleviate neuropathic pain in the rat model.
      However, the impact of statin use on response to epidural steroid injections remains unknown
      and may well increase the effect considering the substantial anti-inflammatory properties. We
      thus tested the primary hypothesis that patients taking statins before and after the
      procedure will have lower VAS scores compared to patients not on statins. Secondarily we
      tested the hypothesis that statin users will have improved quality of life evaluated with
      Short Form 36 (SF 36).
