      benefit, among the general public, of starving cancer cells with several diet deprivations.

      Due to the lack of coherent scientific data, no evidence base recommendations can be made
      regarding the optimal diet during cancer and its effect on cancer growth.

      The objective of this trial is to analyze the feasibility for patients with early luminal
      breast cancer to be compliant with a diet modification - ketogenic or proteins restricted
      diet - during 9 +/- 1 days, before breast cancer surgery.

      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the compliance to the proposed diet.

      The study will be conducted in patients with luminal early breast cancer, candidate to
      primary surgery, in order to study an homogeneous population of patients, with good
      performance status and without nutritional deprivation.

      Metabolic changes on the main metabolic pathways and the potential antitumor effects related
      to these metabolic changes following the diet will be analyzed as secondary objectives of the
      study. We hope to find biological hypotheses to further test in a next larger prospective
      trial.

      The impact of the patient's beliefs, anxiety and/or depression on the compliance will be
      analyzed as well.
