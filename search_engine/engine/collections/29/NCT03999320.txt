      compared to the general population.

      Our recent randomized trial in a population of children and adolescents with asthma showed
      that sophrology improve lung function (NCT02114398). Sophrology, from the Greek "study of
      consciousness in harmony", is an adjuvant therapy, considered in healthcare as a relaxation
      technique, mainly based on breathing.

      Investigator assume that adolescents and young adults (13-25 y.o.) with CHD who participate
      in a program of sophrology with structured group sessions will improve their exercise
      capacity as measured by the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), in comparison with a control
      group.
