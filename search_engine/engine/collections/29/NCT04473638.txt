      fractures have always been surrounded by controversies. Even in the certainty of deltoid
      involvement and its consequent instability, the direct repair of this structure is not a
      consensus. In recent years, the arthroscopic technique to approach this ligament has been
      described with the objective of potentiating clinical results and minimizing possible
      complications.

      Objective: To demonstrate the functional results of patients with ankle fractures operated
      with arthroscopic deltoid repair.

      Methods: This is a retrospective study in patients diagnosed with ankle fractures associated
      with acute deltoid injuries and submitted to a malleolar fixation and deltoid arthroscopic
      repair between January 2018 and January 2020. All patients will fill an epidemiological
      questionnaire and will be evaluated for pain and function according to the Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) at 12 months
      (6-24 months) average of follow-up.

      Discussion: The inclusion of the deltoid complex and the low invasiveness of this technique
      can improve the clinical outcomes of these patients. Additional studies, with a prospective
      and comparative methodology are required to sustain this proposal.
