      environment increases muscle hypertrophy, thus promoting a more efficient form of
      rehabilitation. Blood flow restriction therapy is a blood pressure cuff placed around the
      desired limb with a handheld device that controls the pressure exerted by the cuff. The cuff
      is placed around the desired limb before a specific exercise, the physical therapist
      determines the appropriate pressure and time, and the patient completes the exercise as they
      normally would. The monitor determines the limb occlusion pressure and has an automatic timer
      that will deflate after the specified time has elapsed. There are also audio and visual
      alarms that alert the user of under or over pressurization. The specific pressure will vary
      based on patient's tolerance and will stay consistent through each exercise. Thus far blood
      flow restriction therapy has been tested in patients with several pathologies but there is
      limited literature on its effect on lower limb extensor injuries.
