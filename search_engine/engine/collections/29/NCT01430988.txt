      United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland. 150,000 of these patients will need hospital admission and
      one study estimates an incidence of 45-48% moderate or severe disability in those surviving
      admission. Although the incidence of head injury is high, the incidence of death from head
      injury is low. Therefore ED's are required to see a large number of patients with a
      minor/mild head injury, and identify the very small number of these that will go on to have
      serious complications. The challenge to the emergency medicine clinician is identifying which
      patients with a head injury have an important brain injury that requires further attention
      and which patients can be safely sent home. The standard for determining an important brain
      injury is the result on the Computerised Tomography (CT) scan of the head. CT scanning is
      nonportable and exposes individuals to high radiation levels.

      The study medical device is a portable, point of care, noninvasive and non radiation-emitting
      medical device designed to assist clinicians in early identification, staging, and
      optimisation of treatment for patients who are head injured.
