    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled single-center study using nebulized
      platelet lysate compared to placebo control of saline administered via handheld nebulizer 1x
      daily for eight weeks to determine effect on lung function in patients with post-COVID-19
      ARDS syndrome.

      20 patients randomized to Treatment group: Inhaled nebulized platelet lysate (PL) 1x daily
      for eight weeks 20 patients randomized to Control group: Inhaled nebulized saline, 1x daily
      for eight weeks.

      Outcomes will be measured at 4-weeks, 8-weeks, 3-months, 6- months

      Goals for this study are as follows:

        1. Investigate and compare the efficacy of autologous PL inhaled via handheld ultrasonic
           nebulizer, 2-ml once per day for 4-weeks compared to saline control (Phase 1), early
           treatment timepoint.

        2. Investigate and compare the efficacy of autologous PL inhaled via handheld ultrasonic
           nebulizer, 2-ml once per day for 8-weeks compared to saline control (Phase 1), final
           treatment timepoint.

        3. Investigate, compare, and monitor long term function and quality of life through
           6-months for treatment arm compared to control.
