    
      At the lower dose of 0.1 µg/kg/h, GHRP-3 presumably will improve endothelial dysfunction,
      enhance insulin action and lower blood pressure via the anti-inflammatory effects of GHRP-3
      while at the higher dose of 0.5 µg/kg/h GHRP-3 these anti-inflammatory effects will be
      further augmented by the hormonal action of increasing serum IGF-I and its primary serum
      binding protein insulin like growth hormone binding protein - 3 (IGFBP-3 as well as -1).
      Also, the more detailed inter-relationships between the actions of GHRP-3, GH and IGF-I on
      serum glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels over 24h periods will be determined at the
      end of the 14 day placebo and two GHRP-3 infusion periods. The GHRP-3 will be administered in
      escalating doses.

      The Specific Aims of this study are as follows:

        1. To determine the relative effects of 0.1µg/kg/h and 0.5µg/kg/h GHRP-3 as compared to
           placebo infusion in inducing physiological secretion of the GH-IGF-I system after
           continuous sc delivery for 14 days in healthy older men and women with insulin
           resistance.

        2. To determine the relative interrelated effects of 0.1 and 0.5µg/kg/h GHRP-3 infusion and
           placebo on various hormonal and non hormonal aspects of insulin resistance such as blood
           pressure (BP), plasma glucose and FFA as well as GH, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, -3, insulin and
           endothelin-1 levels.

        3. To determine the relative effects of placebo and the above 2 doses of GHRP-3 infusion on
           flow mediated dilation (FMD) and nitroglycerin-dependent dilation
