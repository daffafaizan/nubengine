      ocular hypertension and were between the ages of 48-74. Patients were excluded if they
      currently performed ANB or FR, were unable to perform the task, had previous eye surgery or
      laser, were receiving other CAM for ocular hypertension, or were unable to complete a washout
      period. After a 30-day drug washout, patients completed either ANB or FR. After instruction,
      the assigned task was performed for 5 minutes. FR was done on a commercially available foot
      reflexology board (JAPAN TSUBO HH-700) focused at the base of the second and third toes of
      both feet. Two weeks later, patients completed the alternate task. IOP was measured before
      the task, immediately after the task and then every 30 minutes for two hours. Sign rank tests
      were used to evaluate IOP changes within and between each group.
