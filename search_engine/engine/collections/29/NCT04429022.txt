    
      Material and Methods:

      This is a prospective cohort study with historical controls. Cases of those receiving a
      non-opioid multimodal pain regimen will be compared to historical controls of those receiving
      a traditional opioid pain regimen. All patients undergoing robotic total laparoscopic
      hysterectomy, with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with a uterine weight ≤325
      grams will be included in this study. Multimodal pain regimen will include the following:

      Protocol:

      Pre-Op: - Gabapentin 600mg PO PO x 1 prior to surgery (in pre-op area)

        -  Acetaminophen 1000mg PO x1 prior to surgery (in pre-op area)

      Intra-Op:

        -  Paracervical block with local anesthetic (0.5% ropivacaine); 10 mL bilaterally (2 point)
           for total of 20mL

        -  Local anesthetic (0.5% ropivacaine) at all laparoscopic port sites; another 10mL

        -  Will operate at <15mmHg intra-abdominal pressure with goal of <12mmHg

        -  At end of procedure during closure of fascia, give 30mg ketorolac IV x 1

      Post-Op:

        -  Gabapentin 300mg PO BID for 7 days

        -  Acetaminophen 1000mg PO q6h x 2 days then 1000mg q6h PRN

        -  Celecoxib 200mg PO q 12h x 7d

        -  Dilaudid 1mg IV PRN q3h while inpatient; oxycodone 12 tabs x 5mg upon discharge (90MME)

        -  if patient did not use any opioids postoperatively while inpatient, will not prescribe
           opioid medication upon discharge

        -  Also include standard post-op medications such as zofran, reglan, mylicon…

      Our primary outcomes are opioid pain medication needed after surgery and pain scores as rated
      subjectively by the patient. Our secondary outcomes include length of stay in hours and
      whether the patient returns to the clinic or emergency department due to post operative pain
      within a 2 week period.
