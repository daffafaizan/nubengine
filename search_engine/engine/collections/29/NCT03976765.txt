      immunosuppression allowed for the development with success of liver transplant. 1322 liver
      transplants occurred in 2016 in France to 806 in 2000. Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU)
      of Rennes became a reference with 122 liver transplants in 2016 being the second liver
      transplant center in France.

      Early rehabilitation concept is a multidisciplinary approach (surgical, anestheticâ€¦) that
      aims to reduce the length of hospital stay and peri operative morbidity/mortality. These
      programs have first been developed in colorectal surgery before extending to complicated
      surgery like cephalic duodeno-pancreatectomy or hepatectomy. There are poor data in the
      literature on early rehabilitation program in liver transplant.
