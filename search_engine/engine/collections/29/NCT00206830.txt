      blood sample collected at enrollment and tested using the TriageÂ® Profiler S.O.B. Panel
      (measuring creatine kinase MB [CK-MB], myoglobin, troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide
      [BNP], D-dimer). The test is used as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI),
      an aid in the diagnosis and assessment of severity of heart failure (HF), and an aid in the
      assessment and evaluation of disseminated intravascular coagulation including pulmonary
      embolism (PE). Phase I is an observational study and results of the Triage Profiler S.O.B.
      panel will be blinded to all attending physicians and health care workers. In Phase II,
      patients will be assigned to either the experimental arm or the control arm of the study. In
      the experimental arm, the Triage Profiler S.O.B. Panel results will be available to the
      treating physician and can be incorporated into the decision making process. In the control
      arm, treating physicians and staff will be blinded to the Triage Profiler S.O.B. Panel
      results. Time to appropriate treatment, length of ED stay, patient outcome and hospital costs
      will be assessed in all patients and used to determine the impact of Triage Profiler S.O.B
      Panel on these parameters. Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of the Triage Profiler S.O.B
      Panel will be calculated.
