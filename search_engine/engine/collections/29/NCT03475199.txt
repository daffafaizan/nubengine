      The FabLife personalised program aims to improve sperm quality including sperm DNA
      fragmentation in subfertile men through:

        -  A personalized dietary program based on patient's phenotype and genotype

        -  A daily dietary supplement, developed in the context of male infertility

      A total of 75 patients will be recruited:

        -  46 patients will benefit from the program,

        -  23 patients will form the control group.

        -  6 patients will not answer to all the criteria.
