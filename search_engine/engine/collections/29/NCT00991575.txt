      type 1 diabetes it is still not known in detail how hyperglycaemia leads to damage of the
      vessels.

      The aims of the present proposal are therefore two-fold:

        1. To study in detail the progression of atherosclerosis (and micro vascular complications)
           in a well characterized cohort of type 1 diabetes with a long duration of the disease.
           This project will be a continuation of the Oslo study, a cohort started in 1982, with
           the last follow-up study in 1999/2000.

        2. To define factors responsible for the progression of coronary heart disease (and micro
           vascular complications) in this cohort.
