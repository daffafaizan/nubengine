      are profoundly immunocompromised and are plagued early in life with recurrent and life
      threatening infections. The prognosis for CGD patients whose infection persists despite
      appropriate medical and surgical intervention is extremely poor. Allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation can cure CGD however the mortality of this procedure is high for patients who
      are actively infected. Ongoing clinical trials at the NIH and elsewhere suggest that the use
      of non-myeloablative conditioning for allogeneic stem cell transplantation is safer and less
      toxic for patients who are free of infection at the time of transplant. The goal of this
      phase II study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of this novel approach to allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation for CGD patients who are actively infected. Following a preparative
      regimen designed to provide intense immunosuppression without myeloablation, patients will
      receive a peripheral blood stem cell graft from an HLA identical parent or sibling. Donor
      T-cells will be infused post-transplant if donor stem engraftment is unsatisfactory.

      The end points of this study are engraftment, degree of donor-host chimerism, incidence of
      acute and chronic GvHD, infection status, immune reconstitution, and transplant related
      morbidity and mortality.
