      Management Training intervention to improve the caregiver's self-efficacy for helping the
      patient manage pain. Secondary aims include testing the effectiveness of the CG-PMT
      intervention to improve patient pain severity, patient self-efficacy for pain management and
      patient psychological distress, as well as short-term caregiver adjustment and caregiver
      adjustment following the patient's death.

      In this multi-site study, 236 dyads (patients with cancer pain and their family caregivers)
      will be randomized to either a Caregiver-Guided Pain Management Training protocol or to an
      Enhanced Treatment-as-Usual control condition. Dyads in the Caregiver-Guided Pain Management
      condition will receive three one-hour sessions conducted via videoconference. Dyads in the
      Enhanced Treatment-as-Usual condition will receive educational material about cancer pain and
      its management but will not receive any study-related treatment sessions. Assessments will be
      conducted with patients and caregivers before and after treatment, and with caregivers 3
      months and 6 months following the patient's death. The primary hypothesis to be tested is
      that caregivers who receive the intervention will report significantly higher levels of
      self-efficacy for helping the patient manage pain than caregivers in the control condition.
      Secondary aims will focus on (a) improvements in short-term caregiver adjustment as well as
      caregiver adjustment following the patient's death, and (b) patient pain severity,
      self-efficacy for pain management, and psychological distress.
