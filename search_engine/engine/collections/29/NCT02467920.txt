    
      This is a multicentre, open-label, randomized and parallel trial that will compare the
      efficacy and safety of basal insulin glargine combination with Exenatide bid vs. switching
      premix human insulin to aspart30 in type 2 diabetic patients with inadequate glycaemic
      control on premixed human insulin and metformin. Approximately 248 patients will be enrolled
      in the study from China and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 treatment arms:
      once-daily insulin glargine + twice-daily exenatide + metformin; or twice-daily aspart 30 +
      metformin.

      Study treatment will continue for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy measure is the change in
      HbA1c at 24 weeks. The study consists of 3 periods: a 1-week screening (period A), a 12-week
      run-in period (period B) and a 24-week treatment period (period C).
