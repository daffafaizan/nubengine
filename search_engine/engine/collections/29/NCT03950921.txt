      awareness of their patients' urinary catheters, vascular catheters, and pressure injuries. A
      "Patient Safety Display" will be implemented in half of the patient rooms in one hospital
      unit. The Patient Safety Display will display catheter and pressure injury data pulled
      real-time from the electronic medical record onto a tablet mounted at the patient bedside.

      This is an intervention-control design study that will be conducted with patients and
      clinicians at Michigan Medicine. The proposed intervention, the Patient Safety Display, will
      provide clinicians with key catheter and skin information at the bedside when pertinent
      clinical decisions are being made.
