      immunodeficiency.With the increasing number of solid organ transplantation, how to
      effectively treat severe PCP after solid organ transplantation has become an urgent problem
      to be solved.In general, Atovaquone, Dapsone, and Clindamycin-primaquine can be used as
      second-line alternatives when TMP-SMX fails to treat HIV-PCP. More and more studies suggest
      that clindamycin-based alternatives play an increasingly important role in treating of PCP.
      Therefore, the objective of this study is to preliminarily investigate the safety and
      efficacy of low-dose TMP-SMX combined with clindamycin (CT regimen) for the treatment of
      severe PCP after solid organ transplantation.
