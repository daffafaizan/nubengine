      antineoplastic effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The investigator's phase â… study
      has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the tolerable does is 20 mg/m2. The
      hypothesis of this clinical research study is to discover if the study drug Mitoxantrone
      Hydrochloride Liposome Injection can shrink or slow the growth of advanced recurrent or
      metastatic breast cancer. The safety of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection will
      also be studied. Patients physical state, symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and
      laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if
      Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection is safe and effective in advanced recurrent or
