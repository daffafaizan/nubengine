      and balance from normal healthy subjects for the purpose of establishing radiographic
      measurements which are reliable and reproducible and which could give insight into the
      potential clinical utility of these measurements as future predictors of who may/may not have
      spinal pelvic issues and in evaluation and treatment of patients with hip-spine syndrome.

      This specific objective of this study will be to measure sacral slope, pelvic femoral angle
      and cup ante-inclination via radiographs in both sitting and standing positions. The
      radiographs will be evaluated for the three measurements by four individuals with the intent
      of evaluating inter-observer reliability.
