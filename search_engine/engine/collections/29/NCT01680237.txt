      estimates ranging between 10-30% (Kessler et al 2007). They are an economic burden on society
      and the sixth largest cause of disability globally (Baxter et al 2014; Fineberg et al 2013).
      Suffering from an anxiety disorder is distressing, with affected individuals reporting
      adverse effects on quality of life comparable to sufferers of major depressive disorder, and
      in excess of the population norm (Mendlowicz and Stein 2000). Panic disorder with agoraphobia
      is especially prevalent and one of the most handicapping anxiety disorders.

      Although the efficacy of psychological treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia has been
      the subject of a great deal of research (Sanchez-Meca, Rosa-Alcazar, Marin-Martinez &
      Gomez-Conesa, 2010), studies comparing cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure in vivo have
      regularly been underpowered to detect small to moderate differences.

      Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study is to investigate if the combination of
      cognitive techniques with exposure in vivo is superior to the effects of exposure alone for
      patients with moderate to severe agoraphobia. Participants suffering from panic disorder,
      agoraphobia receive exposure-based treatment with elements of cognitive restructuring
      (CBT-group) or without such elements (Exposure-only group) delivered according to treatment
      manuals and in individual sessions with a maximum of 30 sessions รก 50 minutes. Both
      treatments cover psychoeducation on the nature of anxiety and panic, interoceptive and
      intensified situational exposure exercises. In the CBT group identification and correction of
      maladaptive thoughts about anxiety and its consequences is furthermore part of the treatment
      package.
