      common symptom is intermittent claudication pain during walking that is relieved by rest.
      Walking is the primary treatment prescribed for PAD rehabilitation. Polestriding uses muscles
      of the upper and lower body in a continuous movement. Walking with poles increases stride
      length, cadence and walking speed and decreases ground reaction forces on the joints.
      Subjects in this study will participate in a walking program with or without poles.

      Dr. Collins' research focuses on physical activity interventions to improve the functional
      status of persons with chronic illness. Several rehabilitation studies have tested the
      efficacy of walking exercise for patients with PAD. Studies on polestriding indicate that it
      may be superior to traditional walking, but these two methods have never been compared.
      Approximately 30% of patients with coronary artery disease have PAD as their only symptom. As
      the population ages and more people are affected by this debilitating condition,
      nurse-initiated rehabilitative therapies, such as polestriding, need to be explored. The
      consent form explains the purpose of the study in addition to the procedures, risks,
      benefits, options, confidentiality, costs, and compensation. Participants are also asked to
      sign a HIPPA authorization.
