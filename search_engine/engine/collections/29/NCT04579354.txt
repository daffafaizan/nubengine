      additional discomfort, increased pain sensation and increased stress symptoms. Virtual
      exposure has proven to be successful in exposure therapy for the treatment of the narrowest
      patients. Patients are not confronted with the real stimuli or situations that trigger the
      branches, but with virtual representations of them. Virtual reality (VR) makes it possible to
      create scenarios that would not be possible in reality because of the organisational, time or
      financial expenditure involved.The effectiveness of virtual stimulus exposure is well
      documented, especially in the case of object or situation-related fears in the context of
      specific phobias. It is therefore obvious that virtual stimulus exposure could also be
      suitable for minimising operation-associated fears.The research project described is designed
      to investigate the effect of virtual stimulus exposure on perioperative anxiety. For this
      purpose, a virtual tour of the operating setting has been created, which enables patients to
      explore the surroundings in detail by means of VR glasses.
