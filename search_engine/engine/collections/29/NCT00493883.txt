    
      This study will use angiographic administration of radioactive TheraSphere® Yttirum-90
      microspheres into the hepatic artery, to treat 50 patients with primary or secondary cancer
      involving the liver. The study population are those who have failed standard therapies, have
      a majority of their cancer in the liver, have a good performance status and reasonable
      hepatic function. Outcomes being studied are response to treatment, survival and toxicity.

        1. Range of patients who can be offered TheraSphere®

        2. Tumor response rates, in terms of size, volume, contrast enhancement and PET avidity

        3. Survival time

        4. Determine response in relation to histology and other parameters

        5. Ability to tolerate repeat treatments

        6. Toxicity, which may include radiation induced liver damage, pain, consequences of
           shunting, toxic deaths.
