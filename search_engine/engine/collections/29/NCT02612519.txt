      refractory, with regular requirements for large volume paracentesis (see subject inclusion
      criteria). With respect to TIPS-contraindications patients will be assigned to two
      substudies. If no TIPS-contraindications exists (sub-study 1) patients will be randomized to
      Alfapump or TIPS. The presence of at least one TIPS-contraindication (sub-study 2) is leading
      to a randomization to Alfapump or standard of care. All patients will receive medical care
      for cirrhosis and ascites according to the institution's standards medical care. Standard of
      care may include, but is not limited to, administration of diuretics, paracentesis and
      consideration for orthotopic liver transplantation.
