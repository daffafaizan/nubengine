        -  Evaluate the safety, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of sodium salicylate in patients
           with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome; newly diagnosed, relapsed, or refractory acute
           myelogenous leukemia; or relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Define biologic characteristics that influence the likelihood of a clinical response to
           this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sodium salicylate twice a day. Intrapatient dose escalation or
      de-escalation is permitted. Treatment continues for up to 6 weeks in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Responding patients may continue to receive
      sodium salicylate beyond the 6-week period.

      Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia are followed until the end of therapy. Patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome are followed until death or progression to leukemia.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
