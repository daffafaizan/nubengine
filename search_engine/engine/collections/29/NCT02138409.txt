      in each group will be randomly allocated in a 3:1 ratio to receive fentanyl sublingual spray
      (FSS) or a matching placebo sublingual spray (PSS) 10 minutes before the scheduled procedure.
      Based on FDA guidelines, opioid-experienced FSS participants will receive FSS 400 µg, and
      opioid-naïve FSS participants will be further randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 100
      µg or 200 µg. All participants randomized to placebo receive the same matching PSS,
      regardless of opioid experience. Pain and sedation will be recorded multiple times during the
      scheduled procedure. If rescue medication is needed during the procedure, local anesthetic
      standard of care for the procedure will be administered and recorded in the study record.
      Efficacy and safety/tolerability of fentanyl sublingual spray will be evaluated among and
      between the treatment groups.
