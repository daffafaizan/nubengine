      and in vivo animal models of depression and anxiety. These observations and the recent
      findings linking hippocampal function and neurogenesis to mood disorders support the
      evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BCI-540 in patients with major
      depressive disorder with concomitant anxiety.
