      high incidence of anal dysplasia and anal cancer. The study proposes to evaluate new
      therapeutic options in the treatment of anal dysplasia, thus trying to overcome the current
      limitations of electrocoagulation (moderate efficacy, high recurrence, significant patient
      discomfort, and significant health cost).

      Topical cidofovir has shown (in a non-comparative study) efficacy and tolerance rates similar
      to those observed for electrocoagulation, although with the benefits of self-application by
      the patient. This makes it an attractive topical treatment option that requires a direct
      comparison with the currently chosen treatment, which is electrocoagulation.

      On the other hand, the medical properties of the sinecatechins, together with the results
      obtained in the treatment studies of oral and cervical dysplasia, and the possibility of
      being self, make this drug an attractive option to be evaluated experimentally in the
      treatment of anal dysplasia. Finally, the identification of prognostic markers of the disease
      should continue to be explored, in terms of the response to treatment and the recurrence of
      the disease.
