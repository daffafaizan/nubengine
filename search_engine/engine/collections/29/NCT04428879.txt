      the retina. Treatment of eyes with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma remains a challenge.
      The historic standard of care for patients with unilateral disease is enucleation and for
      those with bilateral disease, a variety of modalities have been tried. These include
      radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy, periocular administration of chemotherapy,
      selective intra-arterial chemotherapy, and intravitreal chemotherapy. Unfortunately, all of
      these modalities are associated with significant morbidity and investigators are looking for
      new ways to treat these patients either with novel directed drug delivery methods or with new
      less toxic agents. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of topotecan delivered
      directly to the eye using a novel sustained-release topotecan episcleral plaque (also
      referred to as a Chemoplaque) in patients with active residual or recurrent intraocular
      retinoblastoma in at least one eye following completion of first-line therapy. The study
      intervention involves the insertion and removal of the Chemoplaque, examinations under
      anaesthesia (EUAs), visits to clinic to monitor for adverse events throughout, and post
      plaque removal toxicity evaluation. EUAs, clinic visits and laboratory tests are standard of
      care for retinoblastoma patients.
