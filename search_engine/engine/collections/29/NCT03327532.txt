    
      Congestion (clinical, biological and ultrasound evaluation) will be quantified at inclusion
      within 72 hours of admission and before hospital discharge.

      Follow-up at 3 months of hospital discharge will be performed through telephone interviews.
      Vital status and rehospitalization status will be collected.

      Throughout the study, patients will continue to be treated according to usual routine care,
      regardless of their level of congestion. There will be no modification of treatment according
      to the congestion data acquired within the setting of the study.
