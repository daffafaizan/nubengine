    
      Subjects with OA will be recruited and informed consent obtained. During a screening period
      lasting 1 to 28 days, subjects will undergo medical and arthritis history, physical
      examination, collection of concomitant medications, KOOS (which contains the WOMAC
      questionnaire), SF-36 and global 100 mm VAS assessments, have samples obtained for
      urinalysis, hematology, chemistry, immunology and serum and plasma for future biomarker
      testing, ECG, bilateral knee x-rays and MRI of the index knee at selected sites. Subjects who
      meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized into
      the first cohort of 8 subjects to receive either 1.0 mL lactose (placebo) (2 subjects) or 1.0
      mL OP-1 (6 subjects) intraarticularly using ultrasound or fluoroscopy guidance in an
      outpatient setting on day 1. Each cohort will consist of 8 treated patients, with treatment
      allocation in a 3:1 active-to-lactose (placebo) ratio. After an observation period of at
      least one hour, subjects will be released and contacted via telephone on Day 2 to query for
      AEs and concomitant medications. Additional follow-up visits will be done on days 7, 14, 28,
      56, 84 and 168 (weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24) and safety and efficacy parameters evaluated
      according to the Schedule of Events. When a minimum of 4 weeks have elapsed since the last
      patient of the current cohort has been treated, all safety data will be collected and
      reviewed by the Principal Investigators and the Sponsor. The safety review will be conducted
      to ensure the demonstrated safety profile of OP-1 is acceptable for the treated patients.
      Only after the current dose level has been judged to be safe will dose escalation to the next
      dosing cohort occur.
