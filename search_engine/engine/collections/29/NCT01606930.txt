      own disease process. Patients now increasingly find themselves dealing with multiple
      illnesses over the span of their lifetime.

      Patient-provider communication is key to optimal patient outcomes. Numerous studies have
      shown adverse effects of poor communication on a number of outcomes, including patient and
      provider satisfaction as well as medical compliance and health related outcomes.

      An important next step in this field is to study whether it is possible to improve chronic
      illness care in real world settings by improving the quality of patient-provider interaction
      through feasible interventions focused on efficient, motivational, and empathic
      communication, targeted at both patients and providers.

      There is little information on the best patterns of communication in dealing with patients
      with multiple comorbidities. The investigators believe that an optimal healing relationship
      between these patients and their healthcare providers includes shared decision-making,
      partnering between patients and clinicians to foster health and healthy behaviors in an
      environment of trust, and effective open communication.

      An important outcome for this pilot study is feasibility. The investigators intend to conduct
      a follow-up multi-centered trial; planning and budgeting for such a trial will require
      information gleaned from this study. What is the rate of accrual and how many patients can
      realistically be enrolled and followed within the current study personnel. What outcomes are
      sensitive to change and how much change can the investigators expect to see? Will this
      intervention effect change in patient behavior? This study will give us insight to allow us
      to build a right-sized project.
