      with microneedling DermarollerÂ®, 3 zones with ablative fractional CO2 Laser, and 3 zones with
      no pretreatment. After performing pretreatment, MAL cream was applied on the 6 assigned
      mini-zones for 3 hours incubation. Each condition was tested with and without occlusion. The
      three mini-zones with no product applied were used to perform biophysics measures.
