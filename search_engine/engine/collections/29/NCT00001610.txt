      visual function. The fast and slow oscillations of the EOG will be studied. For the analysis
      of fast EOG oscillations, peak-to-peak amplitude (micro V), peak-to-trough ratio, and phase
      (degrees) will be measured. The analysis of slow EOG oscillations will include measurements
      of the ratio of light peak to dark trough (Arden ratio), implicit time (latency) of the light
      peak (ms), and amplitude of the dark trough (micro V).
