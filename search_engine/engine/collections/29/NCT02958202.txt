      approximately 50 male subjects with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) who have previously
      been treated with BMN 044 will be enrolled. Subjects will receive either IV infusions or SC
      injections at pre-defined doses.

      Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy
      assessments will be conducted at regular intervals throughout the study.

      Subjects will be permitted to continue in this study until the subject meets any of the
      defined withdrawal criteria, BioMarin decides to halt the clinical development of BMN 044, or
      BMN 044 receives marketing authorization.
