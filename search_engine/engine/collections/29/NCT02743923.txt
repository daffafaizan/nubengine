      adenocarcinoma. For long time KRAS mutation has been related with poor prognosis and poor
      response to chemotherapy. Recent data however show that this is both not true. It seems that
      response, progression free survival and overall survival is similar in KRAS mutated. Until
      now no specific targeted therapy is available for KRAS mutated NSCLC patients. Optimization
      of treatment in advanced NSCLC patients with a KRAS mutation could also be achieved by
      selecting the best available chemotherapy treatment.

      Two standard chemotherapy schemes are frequently used and FDA and EMA approved as first line
      treatment for patients with adenocarcinoma: cisplatin-pemetrexed and
      carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab.

      The aim of this randomized phase III study is to compare two standard treatment regimens in
      patients with KRAS mutated, advanced stage NSCLC and the hypothesis is that bevacizumab with
      chemotherapy improves outcomes compared to chemotherapy alone as first line treatment.
      Furthermore the outcome for the different KRAS mutations will be studied.

      Treatment with one of the two following chemotherapy combinations according to the label:
      carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab or cisplatin-pemetrexed q3wks for up to six cycles.
      Continuation maintenance with bevacizumab and pemetrexed is allowed until progression. Blood
      and archival tissue will be optionally collected for translational research. This may help to
      identify subgroups of patients who are likely better treated with a specific treatment
      regimen.
