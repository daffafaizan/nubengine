      prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. Reports from China and Italy show that hypertension presents
      an increased risk of COVID-19-related death. Otherwise, observational studies suggest that
      25(OH)D induces protection against respiratory pathogens while large-scale studies indicate
      that serum 25(OH)D-level is inversely correlated to hypertension prevalence. Recent published
      data (2020) shows that 66% of Portuguese adults present Vitamin D deficiency. HeartGenetics'
      genetic database with more than 8.500 Portuguese genotypes shows that the prevalence of
      vitamin D polymorphisms in this population is 4-fold higher than the EU average, increasing
      the risk of hypovitaminosis D.
