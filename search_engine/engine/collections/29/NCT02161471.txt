      impaired cardiac function, atrial contraction is even more important. So far, the size and
      function of the atria have been assessed two-dimensionally by angiography and by
      echocardiography. However, these do not allow exact characterization of the volumetric
      changes of the atria during the cardiac cycle. Recently, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has
      been used to assess size and function of the left atrium in adults. Little data are available
      about function and volume of the atria in children and the role of the atria in congenital
      heart disease (CHD).

      The study will recruit patients with CHD (n=40) and normal controls (n=10). The patient group
      will be composed by patients suffering from the following conditions: coarctation of the
      aorta (n=10), tetralogy of Fallot (n=10), transposition of the great arteries after atrial
      switch (Senning procedure) (n=10), transposition of the great arteries after arterial switch
      operation (n=10).

      The study consists of measurements of sizes and function of the right and the left atrium,
      respectively, by examining three-dimensional volume changes across the heart cycle, and of
      phase contrast measurements of blood flow across the valves of the heart.
