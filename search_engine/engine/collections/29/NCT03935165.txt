      consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      The sample size was calculated according to the study design by Simon (Simon R. Optimal two
      stage design for phase II clinical trials), using an α-error of 0.01 (two-sided) and a
      β-error of 0.90. Considering a patient dropout of approximately 10%, the study was planned to
      enrol at least 47 women.

      The first abdominal and pelvi's inspection was made using direct laparoscope visualization
      under white light conditions. All areas suspected of peritoneal endometriosis was classified
      as white, black and red lesions and recorded together with their anatomic location in the
      surgical record for the purposes of subsequent extirpation. After the first visual inspection
      the patient was administered with 0.05 - 0.25 mg /(kg BW) Indocyanine Green intravenously.
      The Indocyanine Green imaging mode of the Olympus Indocyanine Green Imaging System was
      activated and suspected areas in Indocyanine Green imaging mode were recorded with them
      corresponding appearance in white light mode. If suspected areas were visible either in white
      light or Indocyanine Green imaging mode, specific sample has been taken from these areas. In
      addition, control biopsy specimens from inconspicuous peritoneum has been taken.
