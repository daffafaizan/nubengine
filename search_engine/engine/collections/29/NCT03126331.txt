    
      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the feasibility of intermittent nivolumab therapy in patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the clinical outcome (overall response rate (ORR), progressive free
           survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients
           treated with intermittent nivolumab therapy.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of intermittent nivolumab therapy in patients with metastatic
           renal cell carcinoma.

      Correlative Objective

      - Investigate correlations between baseline and post-treatment immunomodulatory cells
      [specifically, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) regulatory T cells (Treg), cluster of
      differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), T Cells, T-cell receptor
      (TCR) repertoire and time off therapy.
