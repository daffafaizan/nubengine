    
      The efficacy of Thrive has been studied among patient and community populations and has shown
      to effectively reduce depression and anxiety symptoms among adults with moderate to severe
      depression symptoms at baseline.

      This study will examine whether Thrive can also reduce suicidal thinking for persons
      exhibiting at least moderate depression symptoms. The first phase of the study will implement
      a randomized waitlist controlled trial. The second phase of the study will examine the
      effects in a open trial. Outcome assessments will occur at baseline, 4- and 8-weeks (12- and
      16-weeks for the waitlist group) with a 6-month follow-up assessment for all participants.
