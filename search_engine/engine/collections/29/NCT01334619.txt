      infraclavicular block. The initial concentration of 0.5% ropivacaine injected was 30 ml,
      which was subsequently varied at a ratio of 1: 1.2 for each consecutive patient according to
      the response of the previous patient. The medium effective volume (EV50) was determined using
      the Dixon and Massey up-and-down method. The effective volume in 95% of patients (EV95) was
      calculated using probit regression.
