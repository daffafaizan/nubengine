      resource utilization of Injectafer vs. intravenous (IV) iron standard of care (SOC) for the
      treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in an infusion center setting. The study will also
      assess the ability of baseline serum hepcidin levels to predict if subjects will have a
      clinically meaningful hemoglobin response to oral iron therapy for 28 days or to IV iron
      therapy.
