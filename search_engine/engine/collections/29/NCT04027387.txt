    
      This phase 1, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, sequential single dose
      escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters
      of TMB-365 administered via intravenous infusion (IV) to HIV-1 infected participants at one
      of three successively increasing dose levels: 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1600 mg. Each participant
      will be monitored for 10 weeks post-administration. All participants will be expected to
      participate in PK sampling during Weeks 1, 4, 5, and 6.

      Beginning with the lowest dosage group, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review
      available data after four participants have completed two weeks of post-dose follow-up to
      determine if dosing of the next dosage group may proceed.

      If no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) emerge, defined as a single Grade 4 or two of the same
      Grade 3 clinical or laboratory adverse events deemed possibly, probably or definitely related
      to the study drug, or a serious adverse event deemed possibly, probably or definitely related
      to the study drug as graded by the DAIDS Table for Grading Severity of Adult and Pediatric
      Adverse Events Version 2.1, then dosing of the next higher dose group will be permitted.

      Dosing in the highest dose group will begin after four of the eight participants in second
      group have successfully completed the scheduled study drug administration and two weeks of
      follow-up, and those data, along with all available data from the initial dose group have
      been reviewed by the DMC and no DLTs or SAEs as defined above are identified.

      All participants may initiate standard combination antiretroviral therapy six weeks after
      receiving the study drug.
