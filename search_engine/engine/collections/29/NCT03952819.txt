      it is produced by osteocytes and chondrocytes, it suppresses osteoblast activity by
      inhibiting canonicular Wnt / β-catenin signal, it is described as an anti-anabolic protein of
      22-kDa size.In diabetes mellitus patients osteoporosis and obesity always create problems,
      increased levels of sclerostin inhibit canonicular Wnt / β-catenin signal and is potentially
      held responsible from bone fragility. Bone problems are important both for chronic kidney
      disease patients and diabetes mellitus patients and in instances where these two diseases
      coexist, the importance of sclerostin as a new marker of bone turnover increases. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate how serum sclerostin levels are affected in diabetes
      mellitus patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. To this end, the investigators analyzed
      the levels of serum sclerostin before and after hemodialysis as it is a main element of
      treatment in such combined disease states.
