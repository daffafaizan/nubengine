      determine optimal treatment regimens for patients with type 2 diabetes. In the absence of
      regional guidelines, most international societies in Latin America recommend following
      international guidelines for the management of hospitalized patients with diabetes. However,
      hospital resources, admission cause and inpatient glycemic control differ among countries. In
      the US, the leading cause of admission to the hospital in patients with diabetes is
      cardiovascular disease, whereas infections and acute complications of diabetes are more
      common than cardiovascular disease in some countries. The safety and efficacy of insulin
      regimens in non-ICU setting in Latin countries have not been determined. Objective: to
      compare the efficacy and safety of a basal-bolus regimen using insulin analogs with glargine
      once daily plus glulisine before meals to human insulin with NPH twice daily and regular
      insulin before meals in medicine patients with type 2 diabetes Outcome measures. To determine
      differences in glycemic control between groups as measured by mean daily BG concentration
      during the hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included differences between treatment groups in
      any of the following measures: number of hypoglycemic events (BG <70 mg/dL and <40 mg/dL),
      total daily dose of insulin, length of hospital stay, hospital complications and mortality.
