      happens after treatment with methotrexate. Dextromethorphan, an ingredient in common cough
      medicines, may be able to prevent and/or treat this neurotoxicity. We have given
      dextromethorphan to a small group of patients who developed severe neurologic side effects
      after methotrexate. All had a complete recovery within one day.
