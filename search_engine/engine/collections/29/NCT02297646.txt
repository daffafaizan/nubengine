      perturbations of cellular homeostasis and consequently diminishes the stimulus for training
      adaptation. Therefore, a negative relationship with exercise efficacy seems plausible.
      However, experimental evidence is rare and far from conclusive. Therefore, the present study
      aims to test the influence of carbohydrate intake on the efficacy of a typical preventive
      training program.
