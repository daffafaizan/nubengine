      foetus is more likely to have congenital anomalies and imaging in these patients is
      technically more difficult.

      The investigators hypotheses that an earlier ultrasound with alternative technics will
      improve the quality and thereby improve the identification of anomalies. By using
      transvaginal ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound at the window just above the symphysis, were
      the subcutaneous fat is known to be thinner, the investigators hope to achieve a better
      overview. This will be done by evaluating fetal ultrasound at three different gestational
      ages (GA); GA 13, 15 and 21 weeks.
