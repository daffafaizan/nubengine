      placebo capsules. If the safety profile of the drug is acceptable, based upon review of
      blinded data, the cohort receiving the next higher dose will be treated. Up to 8 cohorts will
      be recruited. All subjects receive a single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo).

      Subjects in Cohort C will receive a second single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo)
      approximately 2 weeks after the first dose. The second dose will be administered as a liquid
      suspension rather than as a capsule formulation. The purpose of the second dose is to
      estimate the bioavailability of the capsule formulation relative to the suspension.

      Subjects in Cohort E will receive a second single dose of study drug (EDP-788 or placebo)
      approximately 2 weeks after the first does. The second dose will be administered with a
      standard test meal. The purpose of the second dose is to estimate the effect of food on
      absorption of EDP-788.
