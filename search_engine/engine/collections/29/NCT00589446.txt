      which have ceased developing and in which the embryo is dead), after at least two previous
      (recurrent) miscarriages. The procedure will have two main purposes:- To allow the diagnosis
      of structural anomalies (disorganized embryos), and to allow an accurate biopsy of embryonic
      tissue for karyotyping. Hence, this procedure will lead to a more accurate diagnosis of the
      cause of recurrent miscarriage.

      After confirmation of missed abortion by ultrasound, dilatation and curettage (D&C) is
      normally performed under general anesthetic to evacuate the uterus in missed abortions. In
      this project embryoscopy will be added to the standard D&C. An 8mm hysteroscope with
      irrigation channel and 300 view will be used with continuous saline flow. The embryo will be
      visualized, and the findings recorded. Biopsies will be taken for chromosomal analysis from
      the embryo and the placental villi. Embryoscopy will be performed with a hysteroscope which
      is in normal clinical use for investigating the uterine cavity, but for a slightly different
      indication.

      The first stage will be a pilot study on 20 patients to judge the value of embryoscopy.
