      that affects children and adolescents, is often associated with high rates of health care
      utilization and disability, including school absences. While psychosocial factors are not
      believed to cause IBD, research suggests that they may increase illness-related dysfunction.
      Prior studies suggest that response to chronic illness is, in part, acquired during childhood
      through social learning processes and may be modified with psychosocial interventions. This
      randomized controlled trial will compare a social learning and cognitive behavior therapy
      (SLCBT) treatment to an education and support condition (ES). 180 children with IBD will be
      recruited and followed for 12 months. It is hypothesized that SLCBT participants, compared to
      those in the ES condition, will, at one-year follow-up: 1) exhibit greater decreases in IBD
      symptoms, medical visits for IBD, and functional disability, and greater increases in quality
      of life; 2) demonstrate greater use of cognitive coping, relaxation and stress management
      skills, and their parents will demonstrate greater reductions in maladaptive responses to
      illness behavior; and 3) exhibit greater reductions in anxiety, depression, and somatization.
      Results will lead to innovative interventions for IBD and other chronic childhood medical
      conditions.
