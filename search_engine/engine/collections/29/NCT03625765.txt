      Indocyanine (ICG) fluorescence within fasciocutaneous flap. The investigators will
      characterize the sensitivity of the SmartGoggles device relative to a previously validated
      device (the SPY Elite system).

      The investigator's primary endpoint will compare the ICG transit time (the time needed for
      ICG to first appear in flap after intravenous injection) detected by the SmartGoggles and the
      SPY Elite system.

      As a secondary endpoint, the investigators will compare the ICG accumulation curve and
      fluorescence intensity generated from each device, measured on the same region of interests
      (ROI). Finally, the study team will compare perfusion margin characteristics (the area
      between regions of well-perfused and hypoperfused tissue) as assessed by the Goggles and the
      SPY Elite system.

      Study Design This is an unpowered pilot study to determine the sensitivity of the new
      SmartGoggles device for detection of ICG fluorescence in free flaps in a clinical setting.
      The investigators have chosen to examine ICG as the contrast agent because this agent is
      FDA-approved and is regularly used for evaluation of tissue perfusion. The team has chosen to
      use DIEP free flaps as the clinical target because these flaps are relatively large and will
      provide adequate surface area for measurement of fluorescent margins and comparison of
      fluorescence between the Goggles and SPY Elite systems.

      This study will enroll 25 patients. After signing consent form all patients will undergo
      standard of care preoperative and postoperative evaluations. Investigators will perform one
      ICG angiography per patient: intraoperatively after designing and harvesting the flap. All
      measurements will be taken by SmartGoggles and SPY Elite systems.
