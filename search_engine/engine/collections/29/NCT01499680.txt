      surgical treatment and will be screened prior to study enrollment. Subjects will undergo
      neuromonitoring during the XLIF operation, as per standard care. They will then be
      re-evaluated immediately after surgery and at the first standard postoperative follow-up
      visit (6 weeks) to assess for presence of new neural deficit. If a new neural deficit is
      identified, the patient will be followed per the Investigator's standard follow-up schedule
      until symptoms have resolved (or are deemed permanent).

      A total of 300 subjects will be enrolled in this study from multiple centers. The subjects
      will have degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine with planned treatment including XLIF
      surgery. The following eligibility criteria are designed to identify existing clinic patients
      for whom study under this protocol is considered appropriate. All subjects must meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria below in order to be considered for enrollment.
