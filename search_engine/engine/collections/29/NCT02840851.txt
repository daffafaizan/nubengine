      are reduced in healthy older adults. The investigators also have preliminary data suggesting
      that sex differences in cerebrovascular regulation exist. The overall goal of this
      application is to extend on the investigators previous studies by employing advanced
      neuroimaging techniques to enhance the investigators understanding of neurovascular coupling
      in healthy aging. This study will collect clinically significant data with implications for
      the future risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.

      The research aims are:

        1. To determine the effect of age and sex on baseline cerebral blood flow through the
           middle cerebral artery (MCA).

        2. To determine the effect of age and sex on cerebral vasodilator responses.

        3. To determine if the cerebrovascular responses measured by transcranial Doppler
           ultrasound (TCD) are associated with the cerebrovascular responses measured by Magnetic
           Resonance (MR) imaging.
