      suitable candidates for endoluminal repair and who are diagnosed with a Type IV complex
      thoracoabdominal aortic lesion. The total number of enrolled subjects is planned to be 15. It
      is a prospective evaluation of patients receiving the device to determine the proportion in
      whom successful implantation is achieved, as indicated by exclusion of the thoracic lesion
      and graft patency at implant, time of discharge, and 1, 6, and 12 months following
      implantation, and to determine the proportion of patients who die or experience adverse
      events during and after the implantation. Furthermore, the percentage of patients in whom
      technical and clinical success is achieved, will be determined. Patients will be followed for
      5 years after the surgery in which the stent graft is implanted.
