      all remission-induction and consolidation courses of chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy
      consists of a timed-sequential chemotherapy including a first sequence of chemotherapy
      combining daunorubicin, 80 mg/m2 per day, administered IV as a short infusion over 3 days
      (days 1-3), and cytarabine, 500 mg/m2 per day IV as a continuous infusion over the same
      period. The second sequence, administered after 4-day free interval, consists of
      mitoxantrone, 12 mg/m2 per day, administered IV as a short infusion over 2 days (days 8 and
      9), and cytarabine, 500 mg/m2/12h, administered as a 3-hour infusion for 3 days (days 8-10).
      Salvage therapy consists of cytarabine, 3 g/m2/12h on days 1,3,5,7, combined with amsacrine,
      100mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 3. GM-CSF (Leucomax, recombinant human GM-CSF from Escherichia
      Coli, Schering Plough, Kenilworth,N.J., USA) is given at a dose of 5Âµg/kg per day,
      intravenously beginning at day 1 of each chemotherapy course and continuing until the last
      day of chemotherapy of each course.

      Patients who achieve CR after induction chemotherapy or salvage therapy are randomly assigned
      to consolidation courses consisting of either a timed sequential chemotherapy similar to that
      of the ALFA-9000 trial (P2 arm) or the CALGB postremission chemotherapy (P1 arm), which
      includes 4 cycles of high-dose cytarabine, followed by 4 additional maintenance courses.
