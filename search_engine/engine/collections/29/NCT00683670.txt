      blood mononuclear cells for vaccine production. All patients will be given cyclophosphamide
      300mg/m2 IV three days prior to vaccine dose #1 in order to deplete regulatory T cells. All
      patients will receive mature DC for each dose of vaccine. For each dose all patients will
      receive autologous dendritic cells pulsed with 2 gp100 melanoma peptides (G209-2M and
      G280-9V) plus up to an additional 10 unique melanoma tumor-specific peptides. All patients
      will receive booster doses with mature DC. The DC vaccine will be given intravenously every
      three weeks for a total of six vaccine doses. Peripheral blood (16 ml) will be taken weekly
      to monitor the immune response to each peptide by tetramer assay. Apheresis is repeated after
      vaccine dose #3 and dose #6 in order to collect PBMC for immune monitoring. Restaging is
      performed after three and six vaccine doses. Patients with stable disease or better (partial
      response/complete response) after six doses will be eligible to receive additional
      vaccinations as maintenance therapy every 2 months until progression.
