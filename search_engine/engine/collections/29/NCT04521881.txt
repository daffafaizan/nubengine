      from randomised trials (CRASH-3 and NCT01990768) show that early treatment with TXA (given
      intravenously) reduces head injury deaths (pooled RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99). In the CRASH-3
      trial, the reduction in head injury deaths with TXA was largest in patients with mild and
      moderate head injuries, particularly if patients were treated soon after injury. However, the
      CRASH-3 trial included mild TBI patients only if they had intracranial bleeding on CT scan.
      It is uncertain whether the results apply to mild TBI patients more generally. CRASH-4 is a
      randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in symptomatic mild TBI in about 10,000
      older adults. The pilot phase will include about 500 patients. The trial aims to provide
      reliable evidence about the effects of early intramuscular TXA on intracranial haemorrhage,
      disability, death, and dementia in older adults with symptomatic mild head injury.
