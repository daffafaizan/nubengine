    
      The primary purpose of the investigation is to demonstrate the claimed clinical benefit and
      safety of Injeq IQ-Tip™ system.

      IQ-Tip™ is similar to common spinal needles with a custom-made stylet that enables the
      real-time bioimpedance measurement at the tip of the needle. The needle is connected to the
      analyzer device, which provides real-time CSF detection during lumbar puncture from the very
      tip of the needle and by these means assists conducting the medical procedure.

      The investigation aims to demonstrate the first puncture success rate, as proxy of clinical
      benefit and clinical performance, of bioimpedance spectroscopy based spinal needle guidance
      method among pediatric hemato-oncology patients requiring lumbar punctures.

      The investigation is conducted in the pediatric hematology and oncology units of three
      Finnish university hospitals
