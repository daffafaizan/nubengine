      organ prolapse but it currently suffers from a high rate of postoperative buttock and
      posterior thigh pain. Rates of buttock and thigh pain 6 weeks after sacrospinous ligament
      fixation with the widely used Capio™ Slim device (Boston Scientific) are about 15-16% with
      immediate postoperative pain occurring in 55-84% of patients. This study is a randomized
      controlled single-blind study with the primary goal of investigating if there is an
      improvement in the intensity and rate of buttock and posterior thigh pain 1 day, 7 days, 6
      weeks, and minimum 12 months after sacrospinous ligament fixation with a new device, the
      Anchorsure® Suture Anchoring System (Neomedic) compared to the widely utilized Capio™ Slim
      (Boston Scientific) device. 60 patients will be enrolled to undergo sacrospinous ligament
      fixation for treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. The patients will be randomized into two
      study groups; one will have sacrospinous ligament fixation using the Capio™ Slim device and
      the other with the Anchorsure® device. The patient's pain will be recorded via the numerical
      rating scale (NRS), a validated pain evaluation tool. The study is powered to detect a 2.5
      point difference in pain between the two groups, a value that has been shown in studies to be
      clinically significant to acute pain patients. Secondary outcomes of surgeon satisfaction and
      efficiency with the devices will be assessed via surgeon questionnaires.
