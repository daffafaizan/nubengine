      ALF. This information will be used to develop methods to predict whether a child will recover
      from the illness without the need for a liver transplant or other life-saving procedure. We
      believe the methods to predict survival will vary with different patient age groups, but that
      diagnosis, multi-system organ failure, degree of encephalopathy and level of coagulopathy
      will be important regardless of patient age. Biological samples, such as blood and liver
      tissue, will provide opportunities to identify subgroups of patients who have unique
      treatment requirements and outcomes. In addition, we hope to identify unrecognized mechanisms
      of liver injury resulting in ALF in children. Eligible study participants will be invited to
      participate in neurocognitive testing. Since patients that develop acute liver failure
      experience varying levels of hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral edema, we suspect that there
      may be residual sub-clinical neurological injury that compromises long-term neurocognitive
      function. Detailed neurocognitive testing has never been performed in a cohort of children
      that survive acute liver failure and this study seeks to close that information gap by
      defining the spectrum of neurocognitive outcomes in this population.
