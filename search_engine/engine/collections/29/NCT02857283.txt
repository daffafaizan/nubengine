      particular, high level ozone exposure has been shown to affect pulmonary function and cause
      pulmonary inflammation. Troubling community-based work has implicated high ozone levels as
      being correlated with increased pediatric asthma emergency room visits. Because of adverse
      health effects, EPA standards for safe ozone levels have been set, currently at 0.07 ppm.
      Still, it is estimated that 100 million Americans live in areas where ozone levels
      periodically remain above the EPA standard. And while this EPA standard had been set based on
      available data, it remained unclear at the time whether naturalistic low-level ozone
      exposure, such as fluctuations between 0.06-0.08 ppm throughout the day, might affect health
      as well.

      This group previously examined lung function and inflammatory response in adults exposed to
      low-level ozone, 0.06 ppm exposure for 6.6 hours, while undergoing intermittent moderate
      exercise. The investigators found that in response to low-level ozone exposure (0.06 ppm)
      with exercise, lung function declines and neutrophilic airway inflammation is observed. What
      remains unclear, is whether low-level ozone alone - without exercise - will cause similar
      health effects.

      To mimic exposure to ozone on a typical summer day in a polluted city, the investigators will
      expose subjects to a varying level of ozone, form 0.06 ppm to 0.08 ppm, rather than a
      constant 0.07ppm. The variation from 0.06ppm to 0.08ppm, then back to 0.06ppm will occur each
      hour.
