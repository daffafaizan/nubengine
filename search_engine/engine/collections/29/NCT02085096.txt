      diagnosed with cancer. Efforts have been made to apply this same strategy to
      spouses/significant others of men diagnosed with prostate cancer. The purpose of this study
      is to test the efficacy of problem-solving therapy on the spouses of prostate cancer
      patients.

      Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group which received problem-solving
      therapy, or to a control group which relied on their standard methods of coping (e.g. their
      normal therapist, family and friends).

      Participants completed baseline surveys regarding their distress and coping prior to
      randomization. They then completed these surveys again at post-intervention (approximately
      2-3 months post-baseline) and 6 months post-baseline to determine lasting effects of the
      intervention.
