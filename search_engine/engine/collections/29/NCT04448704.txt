      documented how migrant workers have an increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes,
      little is known about their mental health burden during a large-scale health crisis.

      In the current COVID-19 outbreak, migrant workers represent 9 in 10 of the COVID-19 cases in
      Singapore, with 25 dormitories gazetted to contain the spread of the virus. Correspondingly,
      these measures have placed a spotlight on the mental well-being of migrant workers.

      In this research protocol, the investigators propose to administer a survey to understand the
      prevalence and predictors of mental health symptoms amongst migrant workers in Singapore. In
      particular, prior meta-analyses have identified COVID-19 health concerns, quarantine status,
      financial instability, exposure to news and misinformation and demographics (i.e., gender,
      age, education) as risk factors for poor mental health amongst the general population. By
      assessing these factors amongst the migrant worker population and documenting their impact on
      migrant workers' mental health, we hope to identify workers in greatest need of support
      during the ongoing pandemic and provide empirical evidence to guide public health policies.
