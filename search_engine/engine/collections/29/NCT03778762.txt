      study was the first trial success rate. Using fibre exact test and assuming alpha (type I
      error) = 0.05 and beta (type II error) = 0.2 (power =80%), 58 patients per group would be
      sufficient to detect a difference 10 % in success rate among the groups. A drop out 10% of
      cases was expected; therefore 63 patients were required in each group to detect the
      difference.
