      Subjects will be evaluated sequentially with [123I]ß-CIT SPECT and standardized clinical
      rating scales during a sixty month period. The subjects involved in this study will have had
      [123I]ß-CIT and SPECT scans at baseline and return for scanning at week 40 following the
      start of their participation in the ELLDOPA study.

      Before each SPECT procedure subjects will be tested to ensure eligibility for the study. They
      will also have a neurological evaluation including tests of motor function, thinking, memory
      and handwriting. Some of these tests will be given with the aid of a computer.

      On the first day participants are injected with [123I]ß-CIT, an investigational radioactive
      material that localizes in the brain. Study participants will also have a thorough neurologic
      examination and standard neuropsychological testing, including testing of memory,
      concentration, abstraction and visual spatial functions.

      Twenty-four hours later study participants return to the Institute for Neurodegenerative
      Disorders where an investigational scanning procedure will be used to obtain SPECT (single
      photon emission computed tomography) images of the brain.
