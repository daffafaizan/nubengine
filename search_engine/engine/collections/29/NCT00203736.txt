      control. In the South East African Combination Anti-malarial Therapy (SEACAT) evaluation,
      there is an evaluation of the phased introduction of combination anti-malarial therapy (CAT)
      in Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa. In order to facilitate formulation of effective
      regional drug policy and provide a database for decision-making on the implementation of CAT,
      it is essential that the in vivo response to CAT be investigated. This will be achieved
      through the SEACAT 01 protocol which is a component of the SEACAT evaluation described in
      another file on this website. However, in selected Mozambique sites where the intensity of
      malaria transmission is high, a direct parallel group comparison of monotherapy (SP) with CAT
      (artesunate, AS, plus SP) will be conducted according to a specific amendment (Amendment 4)
      to the SEACAT 01 protocol. Amendment 4 is presented in this separate file on the website for
      clarity.
