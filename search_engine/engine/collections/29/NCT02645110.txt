      general and specifically, the spread of hospital-acquired diseases. Mother's Choice Company
      develops natural products and technologies which include hand-wash soap. The purpose of this
      project is developing a whole-natural hand wash soap including no harmful ingredients which
      will succeed to remove at least 99.9% (3 log reduction) of the hand transient microbiota. In
      addition, the soap will be mild enough to allow the use of dozens times a day. The procedure
      for evaluating soap effectiveness in bacterial removal will include in general: bacterial
      application on hands, hand washing with the tested soap, sampling of hands before and after
      hand washing. The procedure for soap mildness estimation will include exposure of specific
      area of the arm or the back skin to the soap and following up and grading the reaction of the
      skin.
