      drinks may play a role in the development of diabetes.

      Recent studies in animals and humans have shown, that artificial sweeteners (AS) influence
      metabolic responses after glucose ingestion, possibly alter the intestinal microbiome and
      even modulate incretin release.

      However, it is unclear, if these findings are valid for all kinds of AS, as they are
      chemically different. Up to now, no single study has ever compared metabolic responses to
      different AS in the same subjects. Furthermore, data on human subjects are sparse and
      controversial. This is partially explained by different methodical approaches such as
      intragastral/intraduodenal application of AS, rather than conventional oral consumption.

      The investigators will therefore conduct 7 consecutive single oral stimulations with glucose
      or AS alone or a combination. Three different AS will be tested: saccharin, aspartame and
      sucralose.
