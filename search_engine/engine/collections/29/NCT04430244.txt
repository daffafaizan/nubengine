      resulting in significant visual impairment. With improved instrumentation and corneal imaging
      technology, deep anterior keratoplasty has been recognized as the preferred primary operative
      technique for cases of keratoconus requiring corneal transplantation.

      Since corneas preserved through organ culture remain viable only for up to 4 weeks,
      techniques that can extend storage of corneas have been explored.

      The objective of this study is to assess the outcomes between deep anterior lamellar
      keratoplasty using dehydrated versus standard organ culture stored donor corneas.
