      feasibility of successful transplantation of NMP-treated livers to patients. First, up to 71
      marginal livers declined for transplantation will be treated with NMP using the OrganOxÂ®
      metra device and tested for viability using previously defined criteria. NMP-treated viable
      livers will be subsequently transplanted to patients (n=5 in the 1st stage; additional 10
      transplantation in the 2nd stage; additional 10 transplantation in the 3rd stage: total
      N=25). Patients will be closely followed for clinical outcomes of the transplantation during
      6 months post-transplantation. The follow-up will also be extended up to 1 year
      post-transplantation. The trial will compare the results to those of three comparison groups
      - 1) matched patients who received liver transplantation at Washington University/Barnes
      Jewish Hospital; 2) matched patients who received DBD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS
      database; and 3) matched patients who received DCD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS
      database. Given that patient safety is the priority, the trial uses a multi-stage design in
      which the study stops earlier when NMP-treated liver transplantation is observed to be
      ineffective (see trial schema in Section 3.1).
