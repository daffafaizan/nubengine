      to passively and actively acquire quantifiable signs and symptoms related to mental health
      status. These features include both physiological and cognitive performance measures.
      Collectively they serve as a set of metrics whereby an estimation of a person's mental state
      can be gauged. Additionally, use of these platforms allows those who are identified as high
      risk for mental illness to have targeted therapy delivered via their smartphone and if
      necessary connected with a suitable healthcare provider. Applications of such technology
      platforms serve to potentially reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality in a population
      at increased risk for mental illness and burnout.
