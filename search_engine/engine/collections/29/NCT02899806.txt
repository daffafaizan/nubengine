      impact of multimedia preoperative information in terms of satisfaction, comprehension and
      anxiety, with conflicting results. None have evaluated the contribution of a video explaining
      epidural analgesia in obstetrics. This study compared two types of information given in
      anesthesia consultation: an oral and written information (group P) versus oral, written and
      video information (group V). The main objective was maternal satisfaction, the secondary
      objectives were understanding and anxiety.

      This is a common care, prospective and randomized study, conducted between September 2015 and
      February 2016 in the Creteil Intercommunal Hospital Center (CHIC) and accepted by the ethics
      committee Paris V. After information, not opposition of women who accepted to participated
      was collected. Oral information on epidural analgesia was provided in consultation by the
      anesthesiologist, with delivery of a written information sheet. The video made at CHIC in
      2015, was transmitted, in addition, by email to patients randomized in the group V for she
      could look it at their convenience. Satisfaction and anxiety were evaluated by numerical
      scale from 0 to 10 and comprehension by multiple choice questions with a final score of 10.
      These three criteria were also evaluated in an emergency context in which women received oral
      and written information (group U). Evaluation questionnaires were given during the anesthesia
      consultation and recovered during the hospitalization after childbirth.
