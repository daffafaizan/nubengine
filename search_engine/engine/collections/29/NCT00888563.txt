    
      This protocol is designed to characterize the symptoms of fatigue in healthy individuals
      using standardized questionnaires and determine if physical activity, pain, depression,
      fatigue

      catastrophizing, stress, and daytime sleepiness play a role in the experience. This study
      will also examine the potential role of plasma cytokines and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      axis (HPA) functioning in symptoms of fatigue in healthy individuals.

      Eligible participants will complete questionnaires that measure fatigue, pain, depression,
      fatigue catastrophizing, perceived stress, daytime sleepiness, neurological health, and
      physical activity. Participants will also perform strength testing (e.g. hand grips), walk
      testing (6-minute walk test), exercise testing on a treadmill, and physical activity
      monitoring using a portable activity device. Blood samples will be obtained to determine
      cytokine profiles, gene expression, and levels of stress hormones (cortisol,
      dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], catecholamines). Urine samples will also be obtained to
      measure the levels of stress hormones excreted. Information collected in this protocol will
      be used to make comparison in subjects who experience extreme symptoms of fatigue due to many
      different disorders, in order to better understand the mechanisms of fatigue.
