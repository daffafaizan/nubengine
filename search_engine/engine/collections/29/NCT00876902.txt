      under an almost identical study protocol with extended inclusion criteria. Like YSPSL-0002,
      YSPSL-0003 is a single-center (UCLA), randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.
      Patients are randomly assigned to either active study drug (Active group) or placebo (Control
      group) prior to transplantation. The active study drug dose includes both a 1 mg/kg IV
      infusion for the recipient and a 20 mg [approximately 0.27 mg/kg] as an ex vivo flush. The
      doses are administered via 2 separate infusions of study agent: one 20 mg dose into the
      portal vein of the liver prior to implantation as an ex vivo flush with ViaspanÂ®; and the
      second infusion of 1 mg/kg intravenously into the recipient, when technically feasible, prior
      to the hepatic artery anastomosis. Placebo of a volume equivalent to active study drug is
      prepared for administration to the control group to help maintain the blind. Those patients
      that experience an intraoperative blood loss of >10 units, receive an additional 1 mg/kg IV
      infusion of study agent (or placebo equivalent) at the end of the transplant surgery. The
      Investigator/Sponsor is blinded to the treatment assignment for each patient. Randomization
      assignment is maintained by UCLA's clinical pharmacist.
