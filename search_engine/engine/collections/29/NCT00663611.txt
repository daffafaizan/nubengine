    
      Objectives and Specific Aims:

      We plan to investigate whether growth hormone, administered in a physiological or pulsatile
      fashion, can elicit relevant changes in the human immune system while at the same time
      associated with no change or even an improvement in the metabolic profiles such as insulin
      sensitivity.

      Experimental Design and Methods:

      Thirty-eight healthy men, age 25-50, will be recruited for this study. There are three parts
      to this study: Study I, Study IB and Study II. Study I and IB each involve six subjects and
      are designed to test the hypothesis that pulsatile subcutaneous infusion of GH via a
      subcutaneous infusion pump will yield a reasonable pulsatile GH pattern. The dose of GH used
      in Study IB will be three-fold higher that that in Study I. Study I and IB will be done first
      before proceeding to Study II.

      Study II is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week study involving 26
      subjects divided into 2 groups: Group A and Group B. Group A will involve 13 subjects
      receiving pulsatile GH or placebo infusion for 4 weeks with 8-week washout after
      intervention. Group B will involve 13 subjects receiving conventional once a day subcutaneous
      infusion of GH or placebo for 4 weeks with 8-week washout after intervention.

      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome:

      This study will ascertain the significance of the effect of pulsatile growth hormone
      administration on the human immune system and metabolic profile.
