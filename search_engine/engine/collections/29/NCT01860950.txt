      intervention includes either anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS for 20 minutes during a pain
      cognitive intervention [either brief cognitive intervention (BCI) or general pain education].
      The tDCS brand was the Phoresor-II Auto (Model PM850, Iomed, Salt Lake City Utah, USA) and
      the current was set to 2.0mA. Electrodes were 4x4 cm sponge electrodes soaked in sterile
      saline. For anodal and cathodal tDCS, One electrode was placed over the left DLPFC (F3 from
      the EEG 10-20 system) located via the Beam F3 measurement system and the other electrode was
      attached to the right shoulder. For sham tDCS, the device was turned on for 30 seconds to
      temporarily mimic tingling and skin sensations of real tDCS and then ramped-down to 0mA for
      the duration of the 20-minute session.
