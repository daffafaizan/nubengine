      syncopal recurrences in patients affected by neurally-mediated syncope. Observational studies
      report a recurrence rate with this drug ranging between 12% and 22%. Theophylline was much
      more effective in selected patients with syncope without prodromes and normal heart who had
      ECG documentation of long pauses at the time of syncopal attack and low values of baseline
      plasmatic adenosine. Since theophylline is a non-selective antagonist of purinergic
      receptors, it has been hypothesized that purinergic receptors are involved in the mechanism
      of syncope in such patients. Conversely, theophylline was suspected to be ineffective (or
      less effective) in patients affected by other forms of neurally-mediated syncope.

      The present study aims at assessing that theophylline is effective in patients with no
      prodromes, normal heart and with low values of plasmatic adenosine compared with a
      propensity-score matched untreated control population.

      This will be a multicenter, non interventional study, verified by ICM, with 2 predefined
      subgroups:

      Subgroup #1

        -  Low adenosine group: Patients with Low Adenosine values (<0.40 μmol/L)

        -  Normal/high adenosine (≥0.40 μmol/L) group: any other patient Subgroup #2

        -  Patients with no prodromes or very short prodromes (≤5 sec), normal heart and normal ECG
           (No prodrome group)

        -  Any other form of atypical neurally-mediated syncope with prodromes >5 sec. Remote or
           in-hospital periodic follow-up will be done according to centre's clinical practice for
           ICM monitoring.

      Patients will be followed up until the first primary endpoint event with a maximum follow-up
      of 24 months since start of theophylline treatment.
