      preterm infants, which is related with the development of cerebral palsy. The current therapy
      is only supportive to maintain the live sign stable. There is no effective therapeutic
      strategy for preterm brain injury. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to be protective
      against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries in animal models of brain injury, and
      clinical trials of neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury. Furthermore, recombinant human Epo
      (rhEpo) has been widely used in preterm infants to prevent or treat the anemia of prematurity
      during the past decade. It has been considered to be safe and well tolerated in preterm
      infants. However, there is no conclusion yet if the EPO has the effect to prevent preterm
      brain injury. The purpose of the study was whether the rhEpo (500 U/kg) given to very preterm
      infants (gestation age < 32 weeks) within 24h after birth and subsequently each other day
      for2 week possesses neuroprotective properties. Very preterm infants with gestational age of
      < 32 weeks and admit to our NICU are eligible for enrollment. After informed consent is
      obtained, infants will be randomly assigned to either EPO group or vehicle group. The primary
      short-term outcome measures are brain injury (intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and
      periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)) and ROP. The long term outcomes are whether rhEpo in very
      preterm infants finally improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months corrected age.
