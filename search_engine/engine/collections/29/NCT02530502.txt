    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiation therapy (RT) + temozolomide
      (TMZ) + MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) followed by MK-3475 + TMZ x 6 cycles (1 cycle is 9 weeks),
      MK-3475 can continue for an additional 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Safety of MK-3475 in GBM.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there is a correlation of programmed cell death 1 (PD1) or programmed cell
      death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) expression and T-cell infiltrate in pathology from first and, if
      applicable, second surgical specimens with outcome.

      II. Assess changes in peripheral T-cell activation and tryptophan metabolites. III. Correlate
      o-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) status with outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab, followed by a phase II
      study.

      RT PORTION: Patients undergo focal RT over 42 days, and receive concurrent temozolomide
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42 and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22,
      and 43.

      POST-RT: After completion of RT, patients receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5 and 29-34 of
      course 1 and days 1-5 and 29-33 of subsequent courses, and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 22, and 43. Treatment repeats every 9 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 courses, patients deriving benefit may
      continue to receive pembrolizumab for an additional 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-4 months.
