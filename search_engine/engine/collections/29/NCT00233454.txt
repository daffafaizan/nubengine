      in patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) or mast cell leukemia (MCL) with or
      without associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (AHNMD).

      Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL) are characterized by
      excessive bone marrow production of mast cells which can can infiltrate tissues and release
      harmful substances, resulting in organ damage. These diseases have very limited treatment
      options and poor prognosis. Existing treatments for in advanced mast cell disease, eg,
      interferon-alpha; corticosteroids; and/or cladribine, exhibit low response rates that are
      usually partial in nature.
