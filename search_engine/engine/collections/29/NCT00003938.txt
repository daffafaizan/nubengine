        -  Compare the efficacy and side effects of amphotericin B-liposomal formulation initiated
           72-84 hours vs 144-156 hours after onset of a febrile episode in cancer patients with
           granulocytopenia and persistent unexplained fever refractory to antibacterials.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      antifungal prophylaxis (yes vs no) and type of underlying condition. Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive amphotericin B-liposomal formulation IV over 1 hour on day 3 of
           febrile neutropenia.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive amphotericin B-liposomal formulation IV over 1 hour on day 6 of
           febrile neutropenia.

      Treatment continues until signs and symptoms of the fungal infection appear or febrile
      neutropenia has resolved. Persistently neutropenic patients receive treatment for at least 10
      days or until another cause of infection is determined.

      Patients are followed weekly for 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients will be accrued for this study.
