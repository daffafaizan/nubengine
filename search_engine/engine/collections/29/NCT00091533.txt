      There is growing evidence that a mirror system for action observation exists. Neurons in the
      monkey premotor cortex discharge with performance of goal directed actions and also with
      observation of another individual performing a similar action. This mirror neuron system for
      action observation seems to be important for the recognition and understanding of actions.
      Recently, bimodal neurons, sensitive both for tactile stimulation and for visual stimuli,
      were found in the parietal cortex. This suggests the idea that there might be a similar
      mirror neuron system for observing and receiving (or experiencing) tactile stimulation. The
      neuronal correlates of observing tactile stimulation are mainly unknown. The purpose of this
      protocol is to determine the pattern of brain activation related to the observation of a
      tactile stimulated hand.

      Study Population:

      We will test our hypothesis by means of a functional MRI (fMRI) experiment in a group of
      healthy subjects.

      Design:

      We hypothesize that observation of touch will rely on the activation of a cortical network
      that is different form the observation of non-touch and is in part overlapping with cortical
      structures active during real tactile stimulation (i.e., somatosensory cortex). Further, we
      hypothesize that the observation of touch enhances activation in the somatosensory cortex
      during real tactile stimulation.

      Outcome Measures:

      Our outcome measure will be an increase in the number of activated voxels in the
      somatosensory cortex during the touch observation (for both hypothesis). This would give an
      important hint for a mirror system for observed and received touch. A mirror neuron system
      for observed touch may become an important tool in rehabilitative treatment for patients with
      somatosensory impairments.
