      magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). rTMS of the left prefrontal cortex was shown to be effective in
      the treatment of Depression. Recent studies showed that iTBS probably is as effective as
      rTMS.

      One possibility to increase to efficacy of rTMS/iTBS is to use neuronavigation. With
      neuronavigation the coil Position can be targeted with an accuracy in the range of
      millimeters. Furthermore the Stimulation Position can be ensured during one single session
      and over the course of the daily Treatments.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the benefit of neuronavigation in the
      Treatment of Depression with iTBS by using two arms one with targeting the Stimulation site
      with neuronavigation and one by using the EEG Position F3 as target by using head caps for
      marking the position.
