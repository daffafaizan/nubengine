      transplant (HCT). Post-HCT targeted therapy to reduce relapse is limited by toxicity to the
      engrafted cells. VOR33, an allogeneic CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited hematopoietic stem and
      progenitor cell (HSPC) therapy product, lacking the CD33 protein, is being investigated for
      participants with CD33+ AML at high risk for relapse after HCT to allow post-HCT targeting of
      residual CD33+ acute AML cells using Mylotarg™ without toxicity to engrafted VOR33 cells.
      Participants will undergo a myeloablative HCT with matched related or unrelated donor
      CD34+-selected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) engineered to remove CD33
      expression (VOR33 product). Mylotarg™ will be given after engraftment for up to 4 cycles. The
      primary endpoint assessing safety of VOR33 will be the incidence of successful engraftment at
      28 days. Part 1 of this study will evaluate the safety of escalating Mylotarg™ dose levels to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 2 will
      expand the number of participants to evaluate the Mylotarg™ RP2D.
