        -  Determine non-hematologic toxic effects of high-dose cytarabine and high-dose
           mitoxantrone in patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia or lymphoma.

        -  Determine the in vitro T/NK lymphocyte proliferative responses to patient's
           leukemia/lymphoma cells before and after treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and high-dose
      mitoxantrone IV over 15-30 minutes on day 5. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF)
      subcutaneously beginning on day 14 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients who achieve at least stable disease or a response may receive a second course
      beginning at least 14 days after the first course is completed.

      Patients are followed for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within
      approximately 2-3 years.
