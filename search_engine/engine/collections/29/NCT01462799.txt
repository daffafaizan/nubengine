      smoking alters the course of events after an event of coronary heart disease (CHD), risk
      factors remain. Outcomes can improve if core components of secondary prevention programmes
      are structurally pedagogically applied using adult learning principles e.g. problem based
      learning (PBL). Until now, most education programs for patients with CHD are not based on
      such principles and primary health care lacks structure in the follow-up of self-care goals
      of the patients. All patients will receive conventional care from their general practitioner
      and other care providers. They will randomly be allocated to an intervention that consists of
      a problem based patient education program (1 year) in PHC by trained district nurses
      (tutors). Patients in the control group will not attend a PBL group but receive mailed
      patient information during the 1 year.
