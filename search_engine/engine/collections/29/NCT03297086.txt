      lens implantation.

      During cataract surgery Medicontur Bi-Flex 677MY IOL and Alcon Acrysof Restor SN6AD1 IOL are
      implanted. Optical biometry is carried out for IOL calculation and to measure axial length
      and angle kappa. Three months after surgery biometry is repeated, IOL position and angle
      kappa are measured using Scheimpflug-camera.
