      metabolic diseases with supplementing the diet with sea buckthorn berries (HippophaÃ«
      rhamnoides), their bioactive fractions, and bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus). The study
      design was a randomized cross-over clinical trial. The participants were slightly and
      moderately overweight female subjects. In total, 110 female volunteers were recruited, and
      they followed four different berry diets (bilberry, sea buckthorn, sea buckthorn phenolic
      extract and sea buckthorn oil) in a randomized order for 33-35 days. Each intervention was
      followed by a wash-out period of 30-39 days. Blood samples were drawn and physical
      measurements were performed after each period. Eighty volunteers completed the study.
      Different markers of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and inflammation were measured form
      the blood samples.
