      one of two groups with stratification according to their level of training: the active group
      and the observer group. Each participant of the active group will be paired with one of the
      participants from the observer group. The active participant will manage individually a
      simulated crisis scenario (pretest) while the paired observer participant will observe the
      scenario from outside the simulation room using a video transmission system. Immediately
      after, both participants will be debriefed by a trained instructor focused on CRM principles.
      The same active and observer participants will then individually manage another simulated
      crisis scenario (post-test). Two independent raters, blinded to the study design and to the
      randomization groups, will review the videos of all scenarios in a random order and rate each
      participant on their CRM performance using a global rating scale (GRS).
