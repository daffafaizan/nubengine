      (6 to 9 months) to two time points (6 and 12 months), and to focus on prodromal AD
      (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] 23-30 inclusive, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test
      [FCSRT] less than or equal to [≤] 24 for free recall or ≤ 44 for total recall). Participants
      enrolled under the original protocol were allowed to continue in the extension study if they
      so desired, and if they met the new inclusion criteria. Due to the number of participants
      that completed the extended trial, no sub-group analysis was performed based on which
      amendment the participants entered under.
