      of a self-help intervention among a sample of orthopedic patients. In addition to monitoring
      the effectiveness of the Deprexis program on depressive symptoms, the proposed project will
      assess whether a reduction in depressive symptoms will be associated with improvement on
      patient reported orthopedic impairment. The investigators will enroll 50 adults and the
      participants will be given the opportunity to participate in 8 weeks of the web-based online
      Deprexis program.
