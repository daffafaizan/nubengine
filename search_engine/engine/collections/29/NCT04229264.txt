      blinded-endpoint adjudication, proof-of-concept, and exploratory trial. Two hundred patients
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, 72 hours after successful infrapopliteal angioplasty for
      critical limb ischemia. In the study group, patients will receive oral apixaban 2.5mg twice
      daily plus aspirin 100 mg once-daily for 12 months. In the control group, aspirin 100 mg
      once-daily will be taken for 1 year on a background of clopidogrel (75mg daily) for the first
      three months. The primary endpoint is the composite of target lesion revascularization (TLR),
      major amputation or restenosis/occlusion (RAS) plus MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, and
      cardiovascular death) at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint is the composite of major
      bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding at 12 months.
