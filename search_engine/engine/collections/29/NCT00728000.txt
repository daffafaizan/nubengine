      patients (~80%)are unresectable at presentation. The use of a multimodality approach may be a
      crucial method to improve the dismal survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer. A
      logical tactic is to use neoadjuvant cytotoxic agents and targeted drugs to facilitate
      resectability.
