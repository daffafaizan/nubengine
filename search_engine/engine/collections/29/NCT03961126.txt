    
      Randomized, prospective and unicentric study, in which the investigators evaluate patients
      with vulvar lichen sclerosus who undergo surgical treatment consisting of two separate
      infiltrations by intra and subdermal injection in each half vulvar of autologous fatty tissue
      associated with autologous platelet-rich plasma, in order to:

      Main objective:

      To estimate the population parameters of the study variables, as well as their variability,
      to be able to determine the sample size and statistical power for a future clinical trial
      whose main objective will be to demonstrate the efficacy of this treatment regarding the
      increase in the vulvar elasticity in patients with vulvar lichen sclerosus.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate if there is a structural improvement in the vulva areas treated at month, 3
           months, 6 months and 12 months after the first infiltration and at 3 and 9 months after
           the second infiltration.

        2. To analysis the improvement of fibrosis and inflammation 6 months after the first
           infiltration and 3 months after the second infiltration.

        3. To study if there is an improvement in symptoms at month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months
           after the first infiltration and at 3 months and 9 months after the second infiltration.

        4. To examine whether there is an improvement in the quality of patients life.

        5. Subsequent use of clinical and pain assessment scale in this study and in another lichen
           sclerosus vulvar studies with a greater number of patients.

        6. To evaluate the adverse events derived from the treatment during the first year after
           the first infiltration through its registration in the CRD.
