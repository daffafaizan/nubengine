    
      Double-blind, randomized, controlled dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial in hookworm
      exposed adults.

      Study site: Centre de Recherches Médicales de Lambaréné Number of participants: 32 in 2
      cohorts of 16

      Doses of Na-GST-1 to be tested: 30 and 100 μg Doses of Na-APR-1 to be tested: 30 and 100 μg
      Dose of GLA-AF: 5 μg per antigen

      Cohort 1: 30 μg of each of the two antigens (Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® and Na-APR-1
      (M74)/Alhydrogel®) or hepatitis B vaccine; Cohort 2: 100 μg of each of the two antigens
      (Na-GST- 1/Alhydrogel® and Na-APR-1 (M74) /Alhydrogel®) or hepatitis B vaccine.

      Randomization: Cohort 1: 30 μg Na-GST-1 + 30 μg Na-APR-1 (M74) (n = 12) versus Hepatitis B
      Vaccine/placebo (n = 4) Cohort 2: 100 μg Na-GST-1 + 100 μg Na-APR-1 (M74) (n = 12) versus
      Hepatitis B Vaccine + placebo (n = 4)

      The cohorts will be enrolled in a staggered fashion with safety data assessed prior to the
      Na-GST-1 and Na-APR-1 dose escalation from 30 to 100 µg.

      Pre-treatment: Albendazole (400 mg) at least 2 weeks prior to first vaccination

      Immunization schedule: Study days 0, 28 and 180 Route: Intramuscular in the deltoid muscle

      Study duration: approximately 20 months; each participant will be followed for a total of 12
      months.
