      Monitoring (BGM) and insulin bolusing, and have an understanding of their relationship. BGM
      must occur and then it must be followed by a decision about what to do (or not do) regarding
      insulin bolusing. If insulin bolusing occurs in the absence of BGM, hypoglycemia and less
      than ideal glycemic control can occur. Of the few insulin pump adherence studies, only very
      basic adherence behaviors such as BGM and insulin bolusing frequency or number of
      hypoglycemic events have been reported.

      The overall objective of this study is to address the critical need of improving insulin pump
      adherence in adolescents with T1D by providing personalized intervention using evidence-based
      techniques during routine diabetes clinic visits at point of care.
