      treatment of venous leg ulcers (VLUs), but they do so by different mechanisms.

      Compression therapy applied by a wound care professional has been demonstrated to improve
      healing rates in patients with existing VLUs and to reduce ulcer recurrence, and is used
      consistently by treating physicians. Compression therapy consists of hosiery, tubular
      bandages and bandage systems comprising two or more components, which provide graduated
      compression to the lower limb in order to improve venous return and to reduce edema.

      Polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM) is an injectable foam medication that is used to treat
      symptoms of venous disease, including venous leg ulcers (VLUs). The medication
      ("polidocanol") is in the foam ("endovenous microfoam"). PEM is injected through a catheter
      or by direct injection into the malfunctioning vein. The foam fills and treats the desired
      section of the vein, thereby collapsing the diseased vein. When the malfunctioning vein
      collapses, the microfoam is deactivated and blood flow shifts to healthier veins nearby.
