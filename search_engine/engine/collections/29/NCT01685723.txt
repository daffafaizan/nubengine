      have increased risk of cancer, and most lung cancers are attributable to smoking. Cancer
      (malignant neoplasm) is the number one killer in Hong Kong, which leads to nearly one-third
      of all deaths each year. Cancer patients who continue smoking would result in extra risks of
      all cause mortality, cancer recurrence and second primary cancer as well as reducing survival
      time (Chen et al., 2010). Smoking could also reduce the efficacy of clinical and medical
      treatment of cancer including radio- and chemo-therapies (Benninger et al., 1994; Browman et
      al., 1993) and increase the risk of treatment related side-effects (Rugg et al., 1990).

      Cancer patients may present an excellent "teachable moment" for smoking cessation
      interventions, as their current illness could largely be due to smoking. However, few smoking
      cessation programs target on this vulnerable group and only one-third of oncology nurses
      would assist cancer patients quit smoking. Healthcare professionals have the responsibility
      to assist this vulnerable group to quit smoking. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCT)
      suggested behavioral intervention may help cancer patients quit smoking, but they are limited
      by small sample size. No RCT study has ever been done in Hong Kong.

      This study can make an important contribution to evidence-based practice by testing the
      effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention using a risk communication approach and
      targeting cancer patients. The results primarily serve the purpose to support the development
      of clinical practice guidelines and interventions to promote smoking cessation in cancer
      patients to improve their cancer prognosis and, in the long-run, increase their survival time
      and quality of life.
