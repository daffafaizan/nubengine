      Many methods of reconstructing the coracoclavicular ligaments, which provide vertical
      stability of the acromioclavicular joint, have been described. The use of tendon graft to
      augment the reconstruction provides improved biomechanical stability, less radiographic
      changes postoperatively including loss of reduction, and improved function. However, the use
      of a tendon graft necessitates larger drill holes in the clavicle when compared to
      suture-only repair constructs. The size and placement of these tunnels in the clavicle have
      been associated with a higher rate of complications.

      It has been shown that repairs in the setting of acute injury demonstrate less complications
      including loss of reduction when compared with chronic dislocations. However, other reports
      describing repair of acute AC joint dislocations without graft augmentation have described
      significant changes in coracoclavicular distance with routine follow up radiographs, and up
      to 90% implant migration rates. While use of tendon graft would be expected to provide
      further stability, they may in turn cause an increased complication rate.

        1. To determine complication rates in the reconstruction of AC joint dislocations with and
           without the use of tendon graft.

        2. Determine patient satisfaction, the ASES, Constant, SF-12, SANE, SST scores of shoulders
           that undergo reconstruction of acute AC joint dislocations with and without the use of
           graft.

        3. The investigation aims to determine whether or not graft should be used in the
           reconstruction of acute AC joint dislocations.
