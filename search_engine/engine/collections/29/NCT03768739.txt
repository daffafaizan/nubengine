      surgical procedures. The true incidence of both dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population
      is unclear due to a lack of rigorous study using instrumental assessment techniques and
      validated outcomes in all patents undergoing cardiac surgery. We therefore aimed to determine
      the incidence of dysphagia and VFMI in this patient population and to characterize impairment
      profiles related to swallowing safety and efficiency. We also aimed to assess the relative
      impact of VFMI and dysphagia on health-related outcomes such as length of hospital stay,
      pneumonia, sepsis, reintubation, and discharge status.
