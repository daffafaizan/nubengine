    
      This research is a Phase II clinical trial, which means it will test the safety and
      effectiveness of nivolumab alone (Cohort 1) or in combination with ipilimumab (Cohort 2).
      Both nivolumab and ipilimumab are antibodies (types of human protein) that work to stop tumor
      cells from growing and multiplying by immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is trying to have the
      body's own immune system work against tumor cells.

      Nivolumab and ipilimumab have both been used in other research studies and information from
      those other research studies suggests that these interventions may help to stop Meningioma
      cells from growing.

      Nivolumab is FDA approved to treat other types of cancers, but the FDA (the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration) has not yet approved this intervention for this type of cancer. The FDA
      has not approved the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for your specific disease, but
      it has been approved for other uses.
