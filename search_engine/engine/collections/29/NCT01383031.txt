      abdominal scar and avoid infection produced by puncturing stomach, vagina or rectum in
      NOTES,but also can be played by the conventional laparoscopic instruments. TU-LESS
      (transumbilical laparoendoscopic single site surgery), is considered to be the most feasible
      NOTES(natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery)technology at present. Researches about
      TU-LESS mostly are case reports and small samples or the control experiments up to now,there
      are not persuasive randomized controlled trail between TU-LESS and conventional laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. So the investigators design this prospective randomized controlled trail to
      scientifically evaluate the safety, efficacy and cosmetic results of transumbilical
      laparoendoscopic single site cholecystectomy .
