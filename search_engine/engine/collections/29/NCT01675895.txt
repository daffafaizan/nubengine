      time. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is a surgery of medium duration. The
      addition of lidocaine to hyperbaric bupivacaine shortens the duration of bupivacaine spinal
      block and therefore provides more rapid recovery. This property of lidocaine is not verified
      with other local anesthetics. Levobupivacaine is a S-enantiomer of racemic bupivacaine and is
      a long acting local anesthetic.The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study was to
      investigate this effect of lidocaine, with a local anesthetic other than bupivacaine. It was
      hypothesized that the duration of the intrathecal block could change when performed with
      hyperbaric levobupivacaine mixed with low dose lidocaine and this technique could be
      consistent for the duration of TUR-P surgery. Participants will be followed on the day of
      surgery for primary and secondary outcome measures and 3 days postoperatively for
      complications (TNS).
