    
      Parkinson's disease is a frequent neurodegenerative disease leading to motor handicap,
      cognitive and pain disorders. These pain disorders could be correlated to dopaminergic loss.

      The clinical trial will be conducted in a single center (Neurology Department, Purpan
      Hospital, Toulouse, France). The study is classified as a physiopathology one. Twenty
      patients with Parkinson's disease, presenting pain disorders or not, will be selected. This
      clinical trial will last one year. All the exams, including image acquisition will be done
      the same day. These will take about 6 hours for each patient.

      Expected results: Binding of 123I FP-CIT to dopamine transporters should negatively correlate
      with pain intensity and also with thermal pain thresholds in patients suffering from
      Parkinson's disease.
