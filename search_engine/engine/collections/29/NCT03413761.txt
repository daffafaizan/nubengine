      breast cancer receiving AC+T onto this ancillary study to address the following specific
      aims:

        1. To characterize use of antioxidant supplements with a survey instrument prior to and at
           completion of treatment, and to evaluate reported use pre and post treatment in relation
           to toxicity and disease-free survival. The potential effects of diet, physical activity,
           and other lifestyle factors on relationships between supplement use and treatment
           outcomes will also be considered.

        2. To evaluate if variants (polymorphisms) in genes that produce reactive oxygen species
           (ROS) (MPO) and in genes that protect cells from the effects of ROS are associated with
           treatment-related toxicities and with disease-free survival.
