    
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 open-label, dose-finding and cohort expansion study of the
      anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab in combination therapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab
      in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Phase 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose
      in absence of exceeding the MTD, of the combination regimen of mogamulizumab and nivolumab
      subjects. Phase 1 will enroll up to 12 subjects. Phase 2 will explore the safety, efficacy
      and anti-tumor activity of the highest tolerated dose of the combination regimen. Phase 2
      will enroll up to 184 subjects.
