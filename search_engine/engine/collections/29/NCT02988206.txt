      in DOC.Clinical practice has shown that self-referential stimuli, such as the patient's own
      name and face, are more effective to elicit the patient's response than that of
      non-self-referential stimuli.

      The item "Functional Object Use" was assessed by using personalized objects (e.g., cigarette,
      paper) and non-personalized objects, which presented in a random order.The rest assessments
      were performed following the standard protocol of CRS-R. The differences between functional
      use of the two types of objects was analyzed by Chi-square test.

      Researchers expected to see some of the patients in MCS are re-diagnosed as EMCS with the
      using of personalized objects.
