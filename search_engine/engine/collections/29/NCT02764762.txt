      treat people who have CD. This study will look at the endoscopic remission and mucosal
      healing of gastrointestinal tract of people who take vedolizumab as triple combination
      therapy with adalimumab and methotrexate.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants. Participants will receive triple
      combination therapy which includes:

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg (intravenous)

        -  Adalimumab 160/80/40 mg (subcutaneous)

        -  Methotrexate 15 mg (Oral)

      All participants will receive vedolizumab intravenous infusion on Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22
      along with adalimumab 160 mg, subcutaneous injection at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, then 40 mg
      once at Week 4 and every 2 weeks thereafter until Week 26 along with methotrexate tablets
      orally, once weekly from Weeks 0 up to Week 34. In monotherapy phase, all participants will
      receive vedolizumab intravenous infusion once at Weeks 30, 38, 46, 54, 62, 70, 78, 86, 94 and
      102.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is 128 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic, plus a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study drug for a safety follow-up
      assessment. Participants will also participate in a long-term safety questionnaire, by phone,
      at 26 weeks (6 months) from the last dose of study drug.
