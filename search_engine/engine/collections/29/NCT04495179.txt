    
      This is a Phase II, international, open-label, two-arm, non-randomised study of AZD4635 in
      participants with mCRPC. Participants in each arm will be stratified by the presence of
      measurable soft tissue metastasis (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST
      v1.1]) or bone-only metastasis (per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3 criteria]). There
      will be no formal comparisons between treatment arms.

      AZD4635 plus durvalumab (Arm A) will consist of 80 participants with mCRPC previously treated
      with one or more approved new hormonal agent(s) (NHAs) and one or more taxanes or
      participants who are taxane ineligible.

      AZD4635 plus durvalumab plus cabazitaxel (Arm B) will consist of 80 participants mCRPC
      previously treated with docetaxel and one prior NHA.

      As of November 2020, the Sponsor stopped enrolment in Arm A following decisions at the
      program level, not related to any safety issues. Ongoing participants in Arm A may continue
      treatment as planned.
