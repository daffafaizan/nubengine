      restore peripheral blood flow affected by critical limb ischemia.

      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), also known as Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), occurs
      when peripheral arteries are damaged by arterial hypertension and/or by the formation of
      atherosclerotic plaques. PAD is a chronic disease that progressively constricts arterial
      circulation of limbs. The term critical limb ischemia (CLI) is used for all patients with
      chronic ischemia rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene in limbs attributable to objectively proven
      PAD. These sequelae represent the end stage of PAD. PAD is associated with several other
      clinical conditions, i.e. hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,
      tobacco use, obesity and stroke.

      The double-blind study is expected to enroll 150 patients, randomized into two patient
      groups. The treatment group will receive intramuscular injections of the TRC product into the
      affected limb; the control group will receive intramuscular injections with an electrolyte
      solution (without cells). Both groups will receive the standard of care appropriate for their
      medical condition.
