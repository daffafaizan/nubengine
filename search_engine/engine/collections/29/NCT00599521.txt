      treatment of subjects with Acne Vulgaris. This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel, vehicle controlled study involving subjects with acne vulgaris meeting
      pre-specified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Male and female subjects, 12 years of age or
      older, with 20-50 papules and pustules and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions and have an
      Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 (Moderate) or 4 (Severe) are eligible for
      enrollment. One nodule may be present at inclusion. Acne lesions are evaluated on the face
      only. Subjects presenting with facial and truncal acne vulgaris can participate in this
      study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Adapalene, 0.1% or Vehicle.
