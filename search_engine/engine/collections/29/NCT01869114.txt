      I. To characterize the rate of response to azacitidine and sirolimus in adults with high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      those unable or unwilling to tolerate high dose chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic effect of sirolimus on inhibition of mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in adults with high-risk MDS, or relapsed or refractory AML or
      those unable or unwilling to tolerate high dose chemotherapy.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of sirolimus and azacitidine in adults with
      high-risk MDS, or relapsed or refractory AML or those unable or unwilling to tolerate high
      dose chemotherapy.

      III. To determine the progression free survival and overall survival in adults with high-risk
      MDS, or relapsed or refractory AML or those unable or unwilling to tolerate high dose
      chemotherapy.

      IV. To determine if the quality of life of patients is improved with the combination of
      azacitidine and sirolimus when compared to historical controls of azacitidine alone.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-10 or 1-12 and azacitidine intravenously
      (IV) on days 4-8, 11, and 12 or days 4-10. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
