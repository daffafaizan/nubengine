    
      Objective: To assess the effect of natriuresis guided therapy in acute heart failure to
      improve diuretic response, decongestion, and clinical outcomes

      Study design: Randomised, controlled, open label study

      Study population: 310 patients admitted with the primary diagnosis of acute heart failure
      requiring intravenous loop diuretics.

      Intervention: natriuresis guided treatment versus standard of care

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Co-primary outcome: total natriuresis after 24 hours, and first occurrence of all-cause
      mortality or heart failure rehospitalisation at 6 months Secondary outcomes: 48- and 72-hours
      natriuresis, length of hospital stay, percentage change in NT-proBNP at 48 and 72 hours.

      Safety endpoint: doubling of serum creatinine at 24 or 48 hours, worsening heart failure.
