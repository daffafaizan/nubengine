      analysed at 6-hourly intervals pre- and if applicable, postoperatively after surgical
      fixation or fasciotomy. Also, blood samples will be collected in 6 hourly intervals if acute
      compartment syndrome is suspected. An expert panel of senior orthopaedic surgeons will
      retrospectively assess study data and classify patients who had undergone fasciotomy into
      those with and without acute compartment syndrome.

      Blood samples will also be collected in patients with acute compartment syndrome without
      tibial fractures, to serve as a positive control group.
