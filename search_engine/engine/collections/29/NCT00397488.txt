    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with progressive metastatic transitional cell
           carcinoma of the urothelium treated with sunitinib malate.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

             -  To determine time to tumor progression (TTP) for sunitinib malate on a continuous
                dosing schedule for treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

             -  To estimate sunitinib and SU012662 trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) data for
                the continuous daily schedule and to determine potential association with efficacy
                and safety.
