    
      Three Magnet hospitals in Los Angeles County (Huntington Hospital, Torrance Memorial Medical
      Center and Ronald Reagan UCLA Health System) are collaborating on this demonstration and
      evaluation project (Multiple Case-Study Design). The project will engage interprofessional
      hospital leadership; provide training and coaching in implementation processes of the SAFE
      Care model; and track outcome of the SAFE Care model as implemented in the three
      collaborating site hospitals (three case studies). The investigators hope to contribute to
      the existing state of the science in dissemination and implementation of evidenced-based
      innovations. The collective data from the three sites (collected through interviews with
      hospital leadership and staff and with de-identified patient data on program implementation
      outcomes) will provide information about the effectiveness of the implementation process and
      support further dissemination.
