      lack of objective measures for recovery. The conventional treatment after a TBI is physical
      rehabilitation that helps with motor functional recovery. However, there are usually some
      disabling persistent post-TBI symptoms (mostly neurological) that do not respond to the
      current clinical and physical rehabilitation. rTMS, on the other hand, is a promising,
      well-tolerated, non-invasive brain neuromodulation technique that has emerged as a
      therapeutic tool for a variety of neurological conditions. Thus, the researchers' aim to
      investigate the effect of rTMS treatment on post-TBI symptoms in patients identified by the
      medical collaborators (Drs. Mansouri and Salter). Equally important is to have an objective
      measure of treatment efficacy and patient's symptoms recovery. EVestGTM is a noninvasive
      technique to record neural activity from the vestibular apparatus and vestibular nuclei in
      the external ear. After a head injury, people commonly experience balance (vestibular)
      problems and dizziness, as well as confused thinking. Considering the well-known
      bidirectional anatomical links of the vestibular system, following an impact TBI, EVestG
      signals are expected to change, and our pilot studies show a great potential of EVestG to
      monitor the impact of TBI. Thus, the researchers aim to use EVestG as an objective measure to
      monitor the recovery path during and after the rTMS treatment in parallel to clinical and
      neuro-psychological assessments.
