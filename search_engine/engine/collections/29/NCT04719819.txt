      are reliability and fast onset. However, techniques of spinal anaesthesia are varied. Dose of
      hyperbaric bupivacaine used may shifted, varying intensity of sensor block but also
      hemodynamic side effect. Likewise, use of adjuvant is frequent and differs between centres.
      Management of the maternal hemodynamic is also discussed. While it is recognized that
      intraoperatively vascular filling alone is not effective, use of vasopressors is not
      unequivocal. For example, recent studies support the use of norepinephrine.

      Finally, maternal experience is a hot topic. Although insufficient anaesthesia is rare, it is
      often overlooked. There are few recommendations on the intraoperative treatment of
      insufficient anaesthesia and to the management of post-traumatic stress that it lead to.

      The objective of this study is to describe practices of spinal anaesthesia for scheduled or
      non-emergency caesarean section (also named "green code") in France by detailing several
      points:

      Technique of spinal anaesthesia:

        -  The anaesthesia solution used (doses and adjuvants)

        -  Management of hemodynamic

        -  Management of insufficient anaesthesia

        -  Maternal experience It aims to make an inventory of practices, to orient future studies,
           guide practice and the realization of protocols.

      It is an observational study unfolds from 2021 to 2022. It concerns 11 French centres and 600
      women. Data are collected with an online questionnaire.
