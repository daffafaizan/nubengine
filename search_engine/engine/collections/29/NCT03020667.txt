    
      This is a prospective, observational, open cohort study of adults, legally authorized to
      purchase tobacco products in Japan. The study will describe the patterns of use of tobacco
      and nicotine containing products and self-reported health outcomes in CC smokers and IQOS
      users.

      For IQOS users, the date of initiation of IQOS use is the trigger for all study assessments
      in the study. However the process will be different for CC smokers for whom assessment timing
      will be based on the date of enrollment. IQOS users will be enrolled into the study at least
      two months after initiating use of IQOS (to ensure adoption of IQOS), but less than 12 months
      after initiating use of IQOS. The study assessments will start at the next appropriate study
      time point after enrollment.

      As this study is observational by design and is conducted in a post-market setting, adverse
      event (AE) reporting will follow the Sponsor's established post-market Safety Surveillance
      Procedures for spontaneously reported events. IQOS users will be reminded of the product
      quality complaints (including AEs) hotline that is available for all IQOS consumers in Japan.
