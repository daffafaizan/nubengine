      InfoMedics, Inc., a company with a system for developing such patient-physician feedback
      programs. Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program
      after Deplin速 has been prescribed and provide them with a brochure containing an introduction
      to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients self-enroll, take a brief survey
      before starting their Deplin速 prescription, and then a follow-up survey after 90 days of
      treatment with Deplin速. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will
      receive individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and
      progress. Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to
      continue taking Deplin速 as directed. Patients will also receive educational materials about
      managing their depression.
