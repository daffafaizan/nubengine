      into two major categories (Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
      Anthracyclines were basic drugs in lymphoma treatment. However, their dose accumulation
      related cardiac toxicity limits their clinical application, especially adriamycin. Adriamycin
      has been gradually replaced by epirubicin in malignant tumor treatment because of its similar
      effects and less toxic side effects. Polyethylene glycol liposome doxorubicin (PLD) is the
      liposome formulation of doxorubicin. Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol (MPEG) contained in liposome
      surface can decrease the peak plasma levels of free drugs, extend drugs circulation time in
      blood and reduce the chance of non-specific distribution to normal tissues. PLD goes into
      tumor tissues through tumor angiogenesis and produces targeted killing effect to tumor
      tissues. PLD has potential advantages in the treatment of malignant tumors. In lymphoma
      patients' therapy, the clinical application of PLD is expected to be a new method. Therefore,
      the investigators designed the randomized controlled clinical study and aimed to compare the
      efficacy and safety between PLD and epirubicin in primary B-NHL, peripheral T-cell lymphoma
      (PTCL) and HL patients.
