      behavior change at 12 and 24 weeks (reported phosphorus binder adherence, reported nutrient
      intakes, normalized protein catabolic rate), and clinical outcomes (serum phosphorus
      concentrations, symptoms). In addition, the impact of the different behavioral approaches on
      self-efficacy at 12 and 24 weeks, and the mediating effects of self-efficacy in facilitating
      behavioral changes and clinical outcomes will be examined.
