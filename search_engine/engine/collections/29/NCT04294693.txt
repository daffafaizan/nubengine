      non-solid tumor related reasons, are most often those children who developed osteonecrosis or
      avascular necrosis(AVN) as a side effect of their therapy for leukemia. Other patients
      undergo TKA or THA after degeneration of their joints secondary to trauma, infection,
      rheumatologic conditions, or congenital deformity. While not all cases of injury to the knee
      or hip result in the need for a joint replacement, the quality of life is believed to be
      improved in these children, as having a functioning joint without pain is believed to be
      better for the patients' quality of life than ambulating with a painful and/or partially
      necrotic joint.
