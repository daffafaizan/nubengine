      smokers compared to nonsmokers. This will be accomplished by supplementing individuals with
      deuterium labeled alpha- and gamma-tocopherols. Quantification of plasma tocopherols as well
      as urinary metabolites, alpha- and gamma-carboxy ethyl hydroxychromanol, will be determined
      using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, the role of vitamin C as
      it pertains to its influence on the fraction disappearance rate of vitamin E will also be
      evaluated.
