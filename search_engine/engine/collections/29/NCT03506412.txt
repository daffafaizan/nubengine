      to Entresto™ 49/51 mg (sacubitril/valsartan) twice-daily for a total duration of up to 5
      weeks of treatment. Blood will be drawn prior to and at completion of treatment. The primary
      endpoint measured is change in biomarkers with Entresto™ administration that reflect NEP
      activity and myocardial stress (NT pro-ANP, -BNP, -CNP) and drug action (cGMP). This endpoint
      has been well validated as a measure of Entresto™ drug response.
