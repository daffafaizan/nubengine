      effect through stimulation of V2 receptors in the kidney and is being developed for the
      treatment of nocturia. Nocturia, defined as the complaint that the individual has to wake at
      night one or more times to void, is a common condition and shows an age-dependent increase in
      both prevalence and severity (number of nocturnal voids). It has a significant detrimental
      impact on the quality of life in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of fedovapagon in the
      treatment of nocturia with BPH.
