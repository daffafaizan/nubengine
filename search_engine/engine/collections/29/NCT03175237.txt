      different levels of post-stroke motor impairment with two different therapy protocols.
      Methods: This is a randomized uncontrolled blinded study, with 27 individuals in the chronic
      phase of stroke. Participants were randomized into two intervention groups: MT group with
      motor patterns of movement (MP, n=13) and MT group with specific functional activities (SA,
      n=14). Motor impairment assessments (Fugl-Meyer Assessment - FMA), motivation
      (IntrinsicMotivationInventory) and functionality (Functional Independence Measure - FIM) were
      performed before and after treatment, and 3 months after the end of sessions (follow-up). In
      each intervention group,there were patients classified with mild, moderate or severe motor
      impairment, according to FMA. All participants performed 15 MT sessions, 3 times a week for
      50 minutes each session.
