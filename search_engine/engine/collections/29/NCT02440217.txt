      unipolar pacing catheter is positioned into the right atrium. Arterial sampling is done from
      the femoral artery introducer catheter.

      The study protocol consisted of 3 steps (Rest, Pacing and Recovery), during which timed blood
      samples are collected to measure plasma NEFA and glucose. After the instrumentation is
      completed, Rest arterio-venous sampling is performed at time -15 min and 0 min. After the 0
      min, heart rate is increased by atrial pacing to 110 bpm for 3 minutes and to 130 bpm for 3
      additional minutes and arterio-venous sampling is repeated at the end of each step (at time 3
      and 6 min). Pacing is then stopped and at time 1, 5, 15 and 30 min into the Recovery period
      other pairs of arterial and venous samples are withdrawn.
