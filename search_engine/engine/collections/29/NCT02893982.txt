      image-guided pre-planned workflow to deliver at least 25 Gy to the periphery of the target
      lesion while maintaining established dose constraints to normal tissues, and then to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of navigated percutaneous interstitial HDR
      brachytherapy for liver lesions. Secondary endpoints include assessment of toxicity and
      oncologic outcome (primarily local control at the treated site) and exploratory endpoints
      will be supported by advanced imaging studies at the time of the treatment procedure.

      The 25 Gy starting dose was chosen as it has been shown to be effective at controlling tumor,
      albeit with limited followup. The promising outcomes noted at that dose are predicated on
      actually delivering that dose, hence the feasibility endpoint for meeting the goal dose
      delivery. While the other primary endpoint will be toxicity so as to avoid exceeding the MTD,
      this trial will treat more patients at each level to better characterize both toxicity and
      efficacy within a dose level (the therapeutic window). The investigators will attempt to
      escalate to levels that modeling would predict to have durable local control approaching
      100%.55 Dose escalation levels of 5 Gy were chosen to mirror other studies performed at this
      institution with SBRT
