      in Sweden. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare emphasizes the importance of
      Supported Employment. Especially since there are no study in Sweden that has an RCT-design,
      and that fully take on the responsibility of implementing a SE- intervention in concordance
      with the evidence based version of SE in mental health care, the Individual Placement and
      Support model, IPS. Internationally, SE according to IPS is an evidence-based approach to
      help people with SMI find and keep employment. RCT and quasi-experimental studies showed that
      IPS (Place-Then-Train), is more effective than the traditional stepwise vocational
      rehabilitation model(Train-Then-Place. However, there is no research evidence if the SE/IPS
      will function in relation to a Swedish benefit and health system and work-rehabilitation
      context. This intervention project will therefore not only study the effects of vocational
      and health-related outcomes and experiences, but also study the implementation of SE/IPS, its
      feasibility and level of fidelity in a Swedish context.
