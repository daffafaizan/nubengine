      invasive coronary angiography. Inclusion criteria include:

        1. Age â‰¥ 18 years.

        2. The distal radial artery must be palpable and non-occlusive flow must be confirmed by
           Doppler ultrasound.

        3. Patient should be able to comply with the protocol.

        4. Provide written informed consent before study participation.

      The primary endpoint is the overall prevalence of hand dysfunction defined as any significant
      reduction from baseline score in any of the following five domains:

      DASH score Levine Katz score VAS score Sensory function Pinch grip strength.

      Specifically hand function will be assessed at 4 time points using simple tests of hand
      strength, sensation and ultrasound to assess the arterial latency.
