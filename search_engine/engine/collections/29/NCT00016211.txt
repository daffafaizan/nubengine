        -  Compare the incidence of, and time to, symptomatic brain metastases in patients with
           previously treated extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated with prophylactic
           cranial irradiation vs no further therapy.

        -  Compare the quality of life and survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the health economics associated with this study.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and performance status. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Within 5 weeks after completion of prior chemotherapy, patients undergo
           prophylactic cranial irradiation once daily for 5-12 days.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no further therapy after completion of prior chemotherapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months thereafter.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 287 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
