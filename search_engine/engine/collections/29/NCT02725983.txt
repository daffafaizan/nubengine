      IOC and control.

      Bleeding on Marginal Probing (BOMP), self-reported dental hygiene behaviors, and
      psychological determinants of behavior change (outcome expectancies, self-efficacy and
      planning) and IOC opinion were evaluated one week before or during the consultation and four
      months later.
