      in the study. Prior to recruitment the whole project will be explained to soldiers in a form
      of briefing during which they have the opportunity to ask and have answers to any questions
      concerning the nature of subsequent research. Following that explanation each participant
      will sign a consent form to voluntarily participate. No compensation will be given or
      promised for participation in a study that was approved by the Ethical board of the Faculty
      of Sport in Ljubljana (No. 454/2017). At the time of testing all soldiers must be free of
      acute injuries and should not reported any pain in musculo-skeletal system. Prior to the
      implementation of the preventive program all participants will underwent the set of
      functional testing that includes counterMovement jump (CMJ) testing, stork balANce test,
      pUll-ups, single leg hAmstrings bridge test, and loaded prone pLank test - MANUAL. Following
      initial testing a 15-week preventive training program will be implemented in experimental
      group, while control group will be training as usual. Following the intervention final
      testing will be performed to check for effectiveness of the intervention. After that a
      follow-up period will start during which injuries will be registered in both groups and later
      compared between groups (control and experimental) and within (2016-2017 injuries) groups to
      see if incidence rate of ankle and knee injuries has fallen.
