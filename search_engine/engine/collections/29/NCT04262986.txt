      and neurocognitive sequelae. Overweight is a common, reversible risk factor of OSA, and the
      rapid rise in obesity worldwide may lead to increases in OSA and related adverse health
      outcomes. Weight-loss interventions, especially comprehensive lifestyle interventions, are
      associated with improvements in OSA severity, cardiometabolic comorbidities, and quality of
      life. However, non-adherence is commonly seen in such lifestyle modification programmes. Such
      programmes are often intensive and pose a barrier to adherence. Researchers have suggested
      that programmes with fewer sessions may improve the completion rates. As yet, there have been
      no randomised trial assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief theory-based
      lifestyle modification programme.

      Furthermore, although there is strong evidence to support the value of mobile text messaging
      to promote physical activity and healthy eating in clinical and community settings, messaging
      has rarely been applied in interventions for overweight OSA subjects. In Hong Kong, where
      smartphone penetration is extensive (89% in 2017), utilising messaging as an intervention
      tool may be especially valuable.

      The proposed study will examine the perceived burden and informational needs and preferences
      of overweight subjects with OSA, especially in relation to physical activity. The study will
      also examine the feasibility of a brief lifestyle modification programme that makes use of
      smartphone technology (WhatsApp or WeChat) to provide personalised support and empower
      subjects to start doing simple and easy-to-do exercises that can be easily integrated into
      daily life for gradual lifestyle change and weight reduction.
