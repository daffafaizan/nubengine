    
      Phase I/Phase II, multi-center, open label, randomized, parallel group study to determine the
      safety/tolerability/efficacy of Thymosin alpha 1 in patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation
      positive NSCLC taking SoC versus SoC alone. The study will be conducted in subjects with
      sensitizing EGFR mutation positive Non Small Cell Lung Cancer. Subjects with sensitizing EGFR
      mutation positive NSCLC will be screened for eligibility by the clinical center involved. The
      study will be conducted in two parts. In Phase I patients will be randomized to one of two
      different dosing regimens of Thymosin alpha 1 for a treatment duration of 4 months. At the
      completion of Phase I, data will be reviewed and a single dosing regimen will be carried
      forward into Phase II. In Phase II patients will be randomized to SoC or Thymosin alpha 1
      plus SoC for treatment duration of 12 months. All patients will be followed for approximately
      18 months.
