      solid tumors and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. II. Determine the effects of liver
      dysfunction in these patients on the plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this
      therapy. III. Determine the utility of indocyanine green clearance and lidocaine metabolism
      as indicators of hepatic elimination of docetaxel in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      liver function (normal vs mild vs moderate vs severe). Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1
      hour. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR.
      Within each abnormal liver function stratum, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses
      of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Within each
      abnormal liver function stratum, more than 6 patients are treated at the MTD, if possible.
      Patients in the normal liver function stratum are included as control patients and are
      followed for toxicity, but do not undergo dose escalation. Patients are followed for
      survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
