      and once in postpartum. Women are interviewed in four time points:

        1. First trimester: 8th and 13th (baseline),

        2. Second trimester: 22nd-24th gestational weeks,

        3. Third trimester: 34th-36th gestational weeks,

        4. Postpartum: 30-45 days

      The following information will be gathered:

        1. Common mental disorders (CMD): MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, symptoms
           of depression (Edinburgh scale - EPDS), anxiety (Trait Anxiety Inventory - TAI)

        2. Dietary intake (food frequency questionnaire)

        3. Anthropometric measure (stature and body weight) and physical activity

        4. Biochemicals: fasting glucose, lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c), serum
           fatty acid composition, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6),
           hormones (adiponectin, insulin, leptin).

      All women are followed throughout pregnancy constituting the observational cohort. In the
      second trimester, those women identified as being in risk for PPD [past history of depression
      (DSM-IV) or presenting a score of depression (Edinburgh scale) >= 9 at the baseline
      interview] are invited to participate in the clinical trial. These women will be randomly
      allocated in two groups:

      Intervention 1: Fish oil: [1,8 g/dia n-3 (1,08 g EPA e 0,72 g DHA)+ vit E (0,2 mg/g)
      Intervention 2: Placebo comparator: soybean oil + 1% fish oil + vit E (0,2 mg/g)

      The supplementation occurs from the 22nd-24th week of pregnancy for 16 weeks.
