      (Reducing Alcohol use and related Comorbidities in HIV care) telehealth counseling protocol
      in a pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized trial. The study will
      recruit 600 heavy-drinking PLWH from four federally-qualified health centers in
      geographically distinct regions across the U.S, which provide services to over 14,000 PLWH.
      Upon completing enrollment, participants will be randomized to receive either single-session
      brief intervention (BI) by phone with referral to local treatment when appropriate or BI plus
      referral to ReACH telehealth counseling (TC). Participants will complete follow-ups through
      24 months after baseline to assess longer-term changes in drinking and health outcomes. The
      study will test the hypothesis that TC compared to BI will result in (a) reduced number of
      drinks consumed per week and frequency of heavy drinking and (b) increased odds of having an
      undetectable viral load at 12- and 24-month follow-ups. Secondary outcomes include
      self-reported ART adherence, engagement in condomless sex with non-exclusive partners,
      frequency of other substance use, phosphatidylethanol levels (a biomarker of recent alcohol
      use), and Veterans Aging Cohort Study index scores. The study also will examine potential
      moderators of TC effectiveness. As a secondary aim, implementation measures corresponding to
      aspects of the Dynamic Sustainability Framework will be assessed including implementation
      outcomes of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility guided by Proctor's
      Implementation Outcomes Framework. Thus, this pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 trial will help
      establish the real-world effectiveness of the ReACH TC intervention while also providing key
      implementation-related measures and outcomes that will inform future ReACH TC scale up and
      sustainability.
