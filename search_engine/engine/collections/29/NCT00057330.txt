    
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled Phase III trial to assess the
      prophylactic efficacy and safety of gD-Alum/MPL vaccine in the prevention of genital herpes
      disease in young women who are herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 seronegative. The primary
      efficacy objective is to evaluate vaccine efficacy in the prevention of genital herpes
      disease caused by HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 between months 2 and 20 in healthy adult women who were
      initially HSV-1 and HSV-2 seronegative. The secondary efficacy objectives are to: evaluate
      vaccine efficacy in the prevention of genital herpes disease caused by HSV-1 and/or HSV-2
      occurring between the months 7 and 20; evaluate vaccine efficacy in the prevention of HSV-2
      infection between months 2 and 20; and to evaluate vaccine efficacy in the prevention of
      HSV-2 infection occurring between months 7 and 20. The study will enroll approximately 7,550
      women, ages 18-30 years. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 possible study groups:
      candidate vaccine; or control vaccine (hepatitis A vaccine). The study duration for each
      subject will be approximately 20 months. Study procedures will include 9 scheduled study
      visits (including the screening visit) and additional unscheduled visits for evaluation of
      suspected herpes disease episodes. Three doses of vaccine or control will be administered
      intramuscularly in the non-dominant deltoid on a 0, 1, and 6 month schedule. Subjects will
      attend clinic visits at screening, months 2, 7, 12, 16, and 20. In subjects who present with
      suspected herpes disease between months 17 and 20, an additional visit to collect a serum
      sample will be scheduled 3 months after the evaluation for suspected genital herpes.
