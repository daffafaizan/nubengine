      perioperative period in elderly patients undergoing highly complex elective surgeries, it
      will be performed a randomized clinical trial, where two groups of patients older than 75
      years undergoing highly complex elective surgeries will be compared:

        1. The first group will receive a protocol of non-pharmacological interventions implemented
           by occupational therapy teams to prevent delirium plus standard non-pharmacological
           prevention interventions.

        2. The second group will only receive standard non-pharmacological prevention
           interventions.

      This study will be carried out in the surgical units of the Hospital Clinico de la
      Universidad de Chile (HCUCH) and in the Hospital San Jose (HSJ).

      The expected result is to demonstrate that the interventions carried out by occupational
      therapists decrease the incidence of DPO in a significant way in comparison with standard
      prevention intervention.
