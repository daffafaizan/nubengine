      Experimental tasks based on psycholinguistics and functional MRI are not standardized tests.
      To be able to interpret the results of patients, they must therefore be compared with healthy
      controls of the same age (+/-3 years) and level of education.

      This study will require the inclusion of cases and controls matched to these cases on the
      above characteristics.

      Patients who are seen in consultation or day hospitalization and who meet the inclusion and
      non-inclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study.
      Accompanying persons accompanying patients "matching" with included patients who meet the
      inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will also be offered the opportunity to participate in
      the study.

      Inclusion visit (D0) :

        -  Completion of the HAD self-questionnaire

        -  Validation of inclusion and exclusion criteria

        -  Signature of consent

        -  Collection of socio-demographic data to adjust standardized test results (age, gender,
           socio-economic and education level)

        -  Completion of the computerized ECVB self-questionnaire with the help of a clinical
           research technician: only for cases

        -  Scheduling of the HDJ assessment day (maximum 6 months after the inclusion visit)

      Visit 1 (assessment in HDJ) (D0 + 6 months maximum) :

        -  Neurological examination of the patient and performance of an EDSS if necessary

        -  Battery of standardised and normalised tests evaluating different cognitive functions
           (Annexes 1 and 2 to 9): only for cases

        -  Experimental language tasks (see description in section 6): for cases and controls

        -  Non-injected structural and functional encephalic MRI: only for cases with language
           impairment detected in the examination battery (and their matched controls)
