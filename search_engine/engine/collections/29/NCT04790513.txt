      LIB003 300 mg, evolocumab (Repatha) 420 mg and alirocumab (Praluent) 300 mg. Approximately
      220 males and females aged ≥18 years who fulfill all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria

      baseline LDL-C and randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to LIB003 (88 patients), Repatha (88 patients)
      or Praluent (44 patients) administered SC Q4W (≤31 days). The study will consist of a
      Screening Period and a Treatment Period. The total study duration will be up to 21 weeks
      which includes up to 9-week Screening Period (depending on period required for washout of
