      requiring two doses of influenza vaccine, as per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
      (ACIP) guidance, a second dose of the assigned vaccine will be administered at Visit 2. All
      participants will be followed up for safety (up to 6 months post final vaccination) and for
      immunogenicity up to Day 28 post-vaccination (Visit 2 or Visit 3, as appropriate).
