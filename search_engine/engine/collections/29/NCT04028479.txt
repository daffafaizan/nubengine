      cancer is eligible as long as they are a candidate for treatment. Each patient will receive
      testing and treatment as determined by patient in consultation with physician. ROOT will
      proceed in two directions: (1) Validation Cohorts. These patients will demonstrate the
      ability of the MOT to prospectively collect data using the same protocol and related
      documents, standardized data elements and processes, and accepted scientific endpoints; and
      (2) Analysis Cohorts. The modular nature of the study allows collection of RWD ranging from
      diagnosis only to the full treatment course of the of the patient. Patients are grouped to
      allow focused data collection or a specific analysis. Analysis cohorts can be created from
      patients already enrolled in ROOT or be defined prospectively. Because of the ongoing
      advancements of molecular based oncology, this trial allows a detailed focus on molecular
      testing as part of any cohort.

      Data is reported by the group that is most qualified to provide this information and is
      proved, at point of care, using standardized data elements and processes. Physicians will
      report diagnosis, molecular characteristics, staging, disease burden, significant
      comorbidities, treatment response, and medical decision making. Molecular testing (reports
      and details) will be requested from testing laboratories. Any diagnostic films will be
      received digitally from the location the study was performed. Research staff assist in data
      entry and providing physicians needed data as part of the regular workflow to allow
      point-of-care reporting.

      The Validation Cohorts and Analysis Cohorts may run sequentially or in parallel with each
      other.
