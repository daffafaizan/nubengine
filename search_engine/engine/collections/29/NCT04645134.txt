      adults (65-85 y, BMI 20-35 kg/m2), and stratify by current self-reported physical activity
      level (12 inactive vs. 12 highly active).

      Aim 1: Investigate whether physical activity level is associated with GPLD1.

      Aim 2: Investigate whether cognitive function and brain structure/function are associated
      with GPLD1.
