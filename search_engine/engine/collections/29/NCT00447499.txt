      partner injection. Previous microparticle somatostatin analogue formulations required careful
      reconstitution and as a result the cost of the analogues and the inconvenience of
      reconstitution meant self or partner injection was not a viable option.

      Somatuline Autogel does not require reconstitution as it comes ready-mixed in a pre-filled
      syringe, thus making it more user-friendly than its predecessor and introducing the
      possibility of self or partner injection.

      Patients with acromegaly often travel considerable distances every 28 days in order to
      receive their somatostatin analogue injections in the clinic. If Somatuline Autogel can be
      safely administered unsupervised, while maintaining disease control, this could offer
      patients considerable benefits in terms of reduced frequency of visits to the clinic.

      This study is designed to allow suitably motivated patients with acromegaly or their partners
      to learn how to successfully inject Somatuline Autogel while maintaining their mean GH level
      control. Disease control in these patients will be assessed by comparing their GH and IGF-1
      levels to accepted medical standards for control of acromegaly and by comparing the levels of
      GH and IGF-1 control achieved with baseline values.
