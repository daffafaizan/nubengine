      They will be randomized to treatment with DHA 250 mg/kg/d (n=20), DHA 500 mg/kg/d (n=20), or
      an identical placebo (n=20) given orally for a period of 24 months. All patients will be
      included in a lifestyle intervention program consisting of a diet tailored on the individual
      requirements and physical exercise.

      Patients will undergo a medical evaluation every three months during the 24-month study
      period. Liver biopsy will be performed only at baseline and at the end of treatment.
      Anthropometric analysis, laboratory tests, including liver enzymes and lipids will be
      repeated at 3-month intervals during the 24-month study duration. Ultrasonography and
      Fibroscan of the liver will be repeated at the end of the study period.
