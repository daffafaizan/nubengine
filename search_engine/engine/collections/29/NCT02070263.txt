    
      To evaluate the absence of tree nuts (TN) allergy, referred patients from one of the Arkansas
      Children's Hospital (ACH) Allergy Clinic physicians with current serum immunoglobulin E (IgE)
      to TNs that meet eligibility criteria will be invited to undergo a series of open mixed TN
      food challenges.

      A questionnaire pertaining to their TN allergy will be administered

      A brief physical exam will be performed.

      Skin prick tests using selected nut allergen extracts along with a positive (histamine) and a
      negative (salt-water) control will be performed at the first oral food challenge visit.

      Each food challenges will be performed to 1 to 3 TNs.

      Two telephone follow-up phone calls will evaluate inclusion/exclusion of tree nuts in the
      diet post food challenge.
