      grade 1 NF-PNETS with a size less than or equal to 2cm.

      Patients meeting the selection criteria will be included in the study after signing the
      consent. They will benefit from a RFA treatment consisting of 1 to 3 sessions depending on
      their response to the treatment. Patients will then be followed for 5 years in order to
      evaluate their response to treatment, their clinical evolution, their quality of life and any
      complications.
