      will receive chemotherapy with gemcitabine and immunotherapy with daily tadalafil during the
      first 21 days of treatment. On study day 22, patients will receive the first of three planned
      doses of radiation therapy and continue daily tadalafil. Patients are then evaluated to
      determine if they are candidates for pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients who are not candidates
      will continue daily tadalafil and receive gemcitabine chemotherapy. Patients who have surgery
      will resume daily tadalafil and gemcitabine chemotherapy following recovery from surgery.
      Patients will receive up to four cycles of gemcitabine.
