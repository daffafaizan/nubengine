      Specific Hypothesis: The preliminary findings suggest a physiological mechanism between
      dietary intake and GERD that may be related to type of dietary carbohydrate intake (complex
      vs simple carbohydrate). The investigators hypothesize that modifying the type of dietary
      carbohydrate consumed - by reducing the proportion of simple carbohydrate (sugars) consumed -
      will reduce or resolve GERD symptoms and medication use in obese Veterans with chronic GERD.
      The investigators further hypothesize that the mechanistic effects of reducing simple
      carbohydrate intake is related to either: a) improved dietary fiber intake and/or glycemic
      load, and thus, reduced amount and duration of esophageal acid exposure; and/or b) improved
      insulin sensitivity which would positively influence the function of key gastrointestinal
      hormones (ie, gastrin, glucagon, GLP-1, ghrelin11) that regulate gastric motility and/or
      lower esophageal sphincter function.

      Aim 1: To determine effects of dietary carbohydrate consumed (amount and type) on percent
      time with esophageal pH < 4.0, as well as number of reflux episodes, GERD symptoms and GERD
      medication use, in 200 obese Veterans who have chronic high frequency of GERD symptoms. To
      meet this aim the investigators will use a randomized controlled trial in which the
      investigators manipulate amount of total and simple dietary carbohydrate intake for duration
      of 9 weeks.

      Aim 2: To assess associations between GERD resolution variables and factors related to
      potential mechanisms by which modifying dietary carbohydrate intake could resolve/reduce GERD
      in obese Veterans.

      2a: The investigators will investigate associations related to whether the effect is
      nutritionally mediated by measuring change in dietary fiber load and dietary glycemic load,
      and thus, whether these changes are related to improved gastric acid secretion (% time pH <
      4), gastric motility, and/or the other parameters that comprise the Johnson-DeMeester score.

      2b: The investigators will also investigate whether effects are associated with changes in
      the hormonal milieu by measuring hormonal response of gastrin, glucagon, glucagon-like
      peptide-1 (GLP-1), ghrelin and insulin, which could potentially influence gastric acid
      secretion, gastric motility and/or lower esophageal sphincter function.
