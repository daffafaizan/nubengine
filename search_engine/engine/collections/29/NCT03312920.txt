      and a name or a word in English and the same word in another language. It is not only
      important for learning, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is
      impacted by aging and by Alzheimer×³s disease. For decades, neuroscientists have investigated
      associative learning and memory and ways to accelerate and enhance associative learning and
      memory.

      Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and painless electrical
      stimulation technique that has demonstrated to accelerate learning and improve memory in some
      studies. To investigate whether learning can be accelerated and associative memory improved
      by using tDCS, this study will compare the performance in a Face Name Associate memory task
      from 3 groups. The first group will get active aodal tDCS during the study phase of the Face
      Name Memory task, whereas the second group will get sham tDCS during the study phase of the
      task and the third group will get active cathodal tDCS.
