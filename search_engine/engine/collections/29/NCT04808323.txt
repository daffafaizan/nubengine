      for locally advanced (Stage I-III) rectal adenocarcinoma with the goal of accomplishing organ
      preservation. We are testing higher doses of radiation therapy, using a novel method of
      real-time adaptive MRI-based radiation therapy treatment.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that adaptive magnetic resonance (MR) -guided radiation therapy
      will result in acceptable toxicity and that a maximum-tolerated dose can be determined in a
      phase I setting.

      Intervention Description: The intervention in this circumstance is higher doses of radiation
      therapy focused within the tumor given using adaptive MR guidance. Radiation Doses being
      applied in this study:

      Cohort A- 64 Gy over 32 fractions, prophylactic nodes treated to 50 Gy over 25 fractions,
      boost to tumor and radiologically positive nodes to total dose of 64 Gy over 32 total
      fractions.

      Cohort B- 68 Gy over approximately 34 fractions, prophylactic nodes treated to 50 Gy over 25
      fractions, boost to tumor and radiologically positive nodes to 68 Gy over 34 total fractions.

      Cohort C- 72 Gy over 36 total fractions, prophylactic nodes treated to 50 Gy over 25
      fractions, boost to tumor and radiologically positive nodes to 72 Gy over 36 total fractions.

      Dose-Limiting Toxicity from Radiation Therapy: A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as per NCI
      CTCAE version 5. Specifically, this encompasses the need for additional treatments including
      the following: transfusion, invasive intervention, or hospitalization indicated. The presence
      of such a DLT would result in the halting of radiation therapy and impact on the dose levels
      of radiation therapy applied in the trial.
