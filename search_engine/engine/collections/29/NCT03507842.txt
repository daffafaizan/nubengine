    
      -  Induction chemotherapy

             -  Arm I [HDAC]: cytarabine 3.0 g/m2 q12hr 3-hour iv infusion on days 1, 3, 5 plus
                daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/day continuous iv infusion for 3 days (D1-3).

             -  Arm II [AD]: cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day continuous iv infusion for 7 days (D1-7) plus
                daunorubicin 90 mg/m2/day continuous iv infusion for 3 days (D1-3).

        -  Interim bone marrow examination Interim bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be done
           between 14 and 21 days after start of induction chemotherapy. If bone marrow has blasts
           < 10%, no additional chemotherapy will be given until the recovery of blood counts
           (absolute neutrophil counts rise over 1,000/μL and platelet counts over 100,000/μL) or
           post-induction day 35, when bone marrow examination will be repeated to evaluate CR.
           After the marrow examination, re-induction course will be given. If interim bone marrow
           examination shows persistent leukemia (blasts ≥ 10%), re-induction course could be
           given. Patients who did not attain CR after the re-induction chemotherapy will be
           eliminated from the study.

        -  Re-induction chemotherapy

             -  Cytarabine 200 mg/m2/day iv infusion for 5 days (D1-5) plus daunorubicin 45
                mg/m2/day iv infusion for 2 days (D1-2) Post-remission consolidation chemotherapy

             -  Adverse risk group: up to 3 courses of intermediate-dose cytarabine (1.0 g/m2/day
                iv for 5 days [D1-5]) plus etoposide (150 mg/m2/day iv for 3 days [D1-3])

             -  Favorable/intermediate risk group: up to 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine (3.0
                g/m2/day q12 hr iv for 3 days [D1, 3, 5])

             -  Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can be performed
                based on the risk of relapse.

             -  The bone marrow examination will be done after the completion of consolidation
                chemotherapy or before HCT.
