    
      -  Evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a circulating melanoma gene signature in
           pathologically verified Stage III melanoma at diagnosis (biopsy-proven lymph node
           positive) and compare this to LDH as a biomarker.

        -  Evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a circulating melanoma gene signature in
           pathologically verified Stage IV melanoma (including pre-surgery patients as well as
           those on either targeted or immunotherapy) and compare this to LDH as a biomarker.

        -  Define the assay metrics for sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis in Stage III and
           IV tumors.

        -  Monitor molecular signature levels in blood to assess efficacy of this tool as compared
           to imaging or other biomarkers to define disease progression or treatment responses in
           Stage III and IV treated patients.
