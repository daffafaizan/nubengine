      supplement acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) on chronic pancreatitis. ALC is an acetylated form of
      naturally occurring amino acid L-carnitine ((R)-3-Acetyloxy-4-trimethylammonio-butanoate)
      found in red meat and is readily commercially available. Supplementation with ALC may
      decrease pain and improve overall health based on our preclinical treatment studies in rats
      with high fat and alcohol induced pancreatitis. In rats, ALC reduces pain measures, improves
      glucose tolerance, decreases lipid peroxidation, and Ki67 cellular injury biomarker, and
      improves pancreatic histopathology. The measurable outcomes of this clinical study are
      patients' questionnaire scores for:

      pain, quality of life, well-being, and serum pro-inflammatory mediator and oxidative stress
      levels in volunteers with chronic pancreatitis. The questionnaires are given at intake and at
      experiment end (3 months). Participants will receive ALC for 3 months. These findings will
      indirectly determine the effect of ALC on the function and inflammatory state of the
      pancreas. Currently, there is no specific therapy for chronic pancreatitis, and its
      pathophysiology is still poorly understood. It is known that chronic pancreatitis is caused
      by ongoing inflammation in the pancreas, yet, no pharmacological intervention exists that
      optimally addresses this. The broad actions of ALC as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      agent as well as its ability to reduce side-effects of alcohol cessation make it a perfect
      compound to pursue for the treatment of pancreatitis.
