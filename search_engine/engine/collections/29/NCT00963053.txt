      these women are non-responsive to the currently prescribed therapies. As such it represents
      an area of unmet medical need. VA111913 inhibits vasopressin-induced contractions of human
      myometrial strips and human myometrial blood vessels in vitro. By this mechanism, it is
      anticipated that the pain of dysmenorrhoea, a condition in which myometrial tone and
      contractions are increased and blood flow to the uterus is decreased compared to normal, may
      be reduced.

      Subjects will be dosed with VA111913 TS and placebo in a cross over design during two
      consecutive menstrual cycles. They will be dosed for up to a maximum of 6 days, beginning 2
      days before the onset of menstruation. Subjects will then assess the menstrual pain, bleeding
      and amount of analgesia required to treat symptoms during each cycle
