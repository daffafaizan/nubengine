      and melanoma and use this information to determine the different between malignant and benign
      melanized lesions. The imaging devices are, Modified Two Layer Diffuse Optical
      Spectroscopy,multi-spectral imaging, and Spatially Modulated Quantitative Spectroscopy can
      use to measure atypical moles and melanoma and correlate the results of the biopsy tissue
      histology.

      The imaging devices can quantify melanin, oxy and deoxy hemoglobin concentration, water,
      lipid and reduced scattering coefficients and can compare results to histopathologic.
      Atypical moles and melanoma have a different optical profile based on physiological
      parameters compared to benign nevus.
