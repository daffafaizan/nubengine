    
      Retrospective observational registry of patients diagnosed of atrial fibrillation between
      2013 and 2020. Clinical, analytical and echocardiographic data will be recorded, as well as
      therapeutic prescription information. Data on mortality and cardioembolic and hemorrhagic
      events will be collected during follow-up. The aim is to study the prevalence and incidence
      of atrial fibrillation, the anticoagulant treatment according to cardioembolic risk, the
      thromboembolic events and hemorrhagic events, the risk of mortality (Cardiovascular,
      Non-Cardiovascular), the contemporary management (Rhythm control versus frequency control
      strategy), and other complications, such as heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or cancer.
