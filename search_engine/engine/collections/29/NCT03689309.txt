      patients:

        1. Classic SBT (C-SBT)

        2. High Flow Oxygen SBT (HFO-SBT)

      This prospective randomized study had 2 conjoint primary outcome:

        1. The HFO-SBT shows a better actuarial rate for extubation at day 7 from the begin of the
           weaning phase

        2. Compare the reintubation rate at D7 from the extubation
