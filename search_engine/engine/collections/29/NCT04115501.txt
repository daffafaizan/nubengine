      is no prospective study on different FiO2 and postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs)
      during cardiac surgery. We hypothesized that hyperoxia during cardiac surgery could lead to
      higher incidence of lung injury and PPCs than normoxia. The objective of this trial is to
      compare postoperative PPCs and other outcomes between hyperoxia and normoxia strategy by
      PaO2/FiO2 in CABG patients.
