      Persons with SCI are at a greater risk because of the increased use of their shoulders.
      Lifestyle changes following SCI place a large demand on an individual's shoulders. Pushing a
      wheelchair, transferring, and performing pressure relief raises are three common activities
      that put added strain on the shoulders. In addition to these activities, reaching from a
      wheelchair can put strain on the shoulder because many environments are not ideally set up
      for wheelchair users. These new stressors are believed by the medical community to lead to
      shoulder pain. The prevalence of shoulder pain for persons with spinal cord injury is 30-70%.
      Untreated, shoulder pain may lead to additional losses in function and community mobility.

      Previous research shows that shoulder exercises along with education on how to improve one's
      technique for wheelchair propulsion, transfers, and weight relief raises can significantly
      reduce chronic shoulder pain and improve quality of life. The investigators aim to not only
      reduce existing shoulder pain, but also to prevent the onset of new pain.

      The current study will teach the same 4 simple shoulder strengthening exercises performed in
      the prior study to patients with healthy shoulders. Half of the patients will receive 2
      sessions of one-to-one training with a physical therapist, and the other half will receive 4
      sessions of training combined with an interactive education program on techniques to protect
      their shoulder in a class format led by a physical therapist and a peer mentor with a spinal
      cord injury. Patients will be followed for 3 years to learn if they develop shoulder pain.
