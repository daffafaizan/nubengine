    
      Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a non-contact, passive, imaging technique that detects the
      magnetic fields generated by the electrical activity of the heart. The MCG technology has
      been evaluated in several clinical studies, demonstrating its potential usefulness in the
      detection of patients with stable angina and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including non-ST
      segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

      Previous studies have been completed using earlier versions of the Vitalscan device. Results
      showed that the device could differentiate between patients with confirmed ischaemic heart
      disease (IHD) and NSTEMI, those with non-IHD experiencing chest pain and healthy
      (non-ischaemic) control subjects.

      The aim of this pilot study is to assess the difference between abnormal MCG images from
      patients with a confirmed and recent myocardial infarction (MI)and normal images from
      previously obtained healthy volunteer controls scanned with the current device, so that
      comparisons can be made to the data acquired from the previous studies.
