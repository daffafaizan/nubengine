        1. Intervention group participants will have improved levels of protective behaviors
           (improved daily dietary composition and increased level of physical activity) that
           reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes compared to control group.

        2. Intervention group participants will have improved their status on clinical measures of
           risk for type 2 diabetes (anthropometric and metabolic status) compared to the control
           group.

        3. To assess whether theory-based variables, including changes in attitudes, behavioral and
           control beliefs, perceived social support and behavioral intention change from baseline,
           and whether these changes influence behavioral outcomes.

        4. To identify aspects of project planning and implementation that contributed to
           achievement of behavioral and clinical outcomes. Measures include recruitment, retention
           and intervention participation rates, barriers and facilitators of participation; and
           community involvement in, and satisfaction with, intervention components and project
           activities; and fidelity of intervention components.
