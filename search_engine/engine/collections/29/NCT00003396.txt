      graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis to maximize the probability of graft-versus-tumor
      effect in patients with hematologic malignancies refractory to standard chemotherapy and
      unlikely to be cured with high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Prior to peripheral blood stem cell transplant, patients undergo preparative
      cytoreduction. Patients receive total body irradiation (TBI) beginning on day -5.
      Radiotherapy is administered in 9 doses over 3 days (3 doses per day for 3 days). Male
      patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia receive an additional dose of radiation to the
      testicles. Patients who are ineligible for TBI due to prior radiotherapy receive 2 doses of
      melphalan IV on day -3. All patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -2 and
      -1. Anti-thymocyte globulin is also administered IV over 6 hours on days -2 and -1.
      Approximately 24-36 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide, peripheral blood stem
      cells obtained from the HLA matched related donor are infused into the patient. Patients do
      not receive graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis after transplant; however, all other forms
      of supportive care are provided. Patients are followed for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
