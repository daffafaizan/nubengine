      three quarters are women and the incidence of low-energy fractures increases exponentially
      with age. The standard diagnostic method for classifying osteoporosis is the measurement of
      Bone Mineral Density at specific body sites - hip, vertebra or distal radius. Despite the
      fact that osteoporotic fractures are very frequent at the shoulder, no study investigated the
      correlation between local bone quality and fracture treatment at the proximal humerus.

      There is a concern among the clinicians that osteoporotic bone in proximal humerus fractures
      increases the risk of treatment complications. However, to our knowledge this has not yet
      been evaluated in clinical studies. One major reason for this lack of studies is the fact
      that no standardized method exists for the determination of bone density at the proximal
      humerus.
