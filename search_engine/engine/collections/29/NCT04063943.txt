      of the Sidus Shoulder.

      Safety: Will be assessed by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events (AE),
      serious adverse events (SAE), and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE).

      Performance: Will be determined by analyzing the implant survival, overall pain and
      functional performances (based on the ASES Patient Questionnaire and range of motion) and
      radiographic parameters of subjects who received the Sidus Shoulder. Implant survival will be
      based on removal or intended removal and determined using the observed component years (OCY)
      model as it is not anticipated that there will be adequate data at the 10 years follow-up to
      support Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis. In the instance that there is sufficient data to
      perform Kaplan-Meier analysis, the analysis will be performed.
