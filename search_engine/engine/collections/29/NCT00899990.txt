      I. Collect biological specimens, including associated demographic and clinical data, from
      patients with Ewing sarcoma.

      II. Provide a repository for long-term storage of Ewing sarcoma-related biological materials.

      III. Make collected specimens available to qualified researchers to understand the biology of
      Ewing sarcoma and correlate these results with demographic and clinical data.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo collection of tumor specimens, bone marrow, and peripheral blood at
      diagnosis. Associated demographic and clinical data are collected and archived. Patients who
      are not enrolled on a therapeutic clinical trial are followed annually.
