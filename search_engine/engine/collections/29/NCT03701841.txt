    
      Patients with cancer planning for chemotherapy assessed with high risk of febrile neutropenia
      (FN) according to NCCN and ASCO guidelines are recruited, receiving primary or secondary
      prophylaxis of PEG-rhG-CSF according to real-world clinical pathway in local cancer center
      for at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary outcome is the incidence of FN rate and
      proportion of patients completing chemotherapy on schedule, the second outcomes are the
      incidence of 3-4 grade of neutropenia, FN-related hospitalization and antibiotic use,
      incidence of reduction and delay of chemotherapy dose, safety and pharmacoeconomics of
      PEG-rhG-CSF.
