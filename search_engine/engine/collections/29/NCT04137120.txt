    
      The primary objective is to assess the safety of intravitreal aflibercept injections in
      patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), myopic choroidal
      neovascularization (mCNV), diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema secondary to central
      retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion
      (BRVO).

      Secondary objectives comprise the comparison of the aflibercept safety profile between
      defined subgroups and the assessment of the real-world application of intravitreal
      aflibercept injections with special focus on CRVO, BRVO and mCNV indications.
