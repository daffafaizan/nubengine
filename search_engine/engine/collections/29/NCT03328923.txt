      the impact of a brown seaweed extract (InSea2) on cognitive function post-prandially in 60
      healthy non-elderly adults who self-report post-meal drowsiness. Computerised measures of
      episodic memory, attention and subjective state will be completed at baseline and for 3 hours
      following lunch with either seaweed or placebo consumed 30 minutes prior to a
      carbohydrate-rich meal.
