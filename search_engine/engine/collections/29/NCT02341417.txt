    
      This extension study was designed to characterize the long-term safety and tolerability of
      cinacalcet in pediatric patients from Amgen Studies 20130356 (NCT02138838) and 20110100
      (NCT01439867) who either had completed the parent study or were ongoing at the time an
      administrative decision was made to end the parent study. After enrolling into this study
      participants were administered cinacalcet for 28 weeks or until the time of renal transplant
      or parathyroidectomy, whichever occurred first. The treatment period was followed by a 4-week
      safety follow-up period.
