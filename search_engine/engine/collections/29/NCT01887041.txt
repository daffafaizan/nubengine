    
      The aim of this multi-centre, prospective-randomised study was to compare the effectiveness
      of palliative applications on patients suffering from a local, advanced and/or hepatic,
      metastasising, non-resectable pancreas head carcinoma and jaundice.

      Before randomisation, all patients are fitted with an endoscopically inserted biliary tract
      drainage endoscopically inserted. When postoperatively ascertained that the pancreas head
      carcinoma is non-resectable, the patient shall be electronically registered and randomly
      assigned to one of the palliative strategies. Group 1 will be fitted with a biliodigestive
      anastomosis. Group 2 will continue with the endoscopically inserted drainage. Regardless of
      which group they belong to, all patients will receive a palliative chemotherapy.

      The primary parameter is the average quality of life over a period of 6 months post-OP, to be
      analysed monthly using identical questionnaires. The comparison of the randomisation groups
      will be carried out using a co-variance analysis (ANCOVA) with the initial value, taken
      directly before the OP, to be used as co-variant.
