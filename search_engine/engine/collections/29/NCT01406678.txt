      incision consists of 3 cycles of 5 minutes left upper arm ischemia by inflation of a blood
      pressure cuff to 200 mmHg and 5 minutes of reperfusion. For myocardial molecular analyses,
      left ventricular biopsies are taken before induction of cardioplegic cardiac arrest and at 10
      minutes after aortic unclamping during reperfusion of the myocardium.
