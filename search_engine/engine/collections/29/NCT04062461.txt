    
      Study Design -A randomized, multicenter, national, phase II clinical trial aimed at
      evaluating the effectiveness of self-care promotion using a multifaceted strategy based on
      sending text messages(SMS) to patients with heart failure.

      Methodological quality

      -Central randomization with allocation concealment; Decision committee for blind outcome
      assessment; Intention-to-treat analysis

      Primary Objective -To develop and evaluate the feasibility of a monitoring, education and
      self-care strategy to optimize the management of patients with heart failure (HF) after
      hospital discharge.

      Secondary Objectives

      -To evaluate, in patients with heart failure, the effect of a self-care promotion program
      using a multifaceted strategy in comparison to the usual care about acceptability to the
      application of SMS, patient and / or family satisfaction with care, quality of life scales
      health scales, self-care scales and knowledge on HF, visual analog scale of dyspnea, and
      clinical outcomes at 30 and 180 days.

      Experimental group:

      -Self-care promotion using a multifaceted strategy based on the use of a tele-monitoring
      device, based on short message system (SMS) messages and self-care teaching tools.

      Patients will receive daily messages to optimize self-care in heart failure with the
      following functions:

        -  customized reminders about medication schedules

        -  weight and symptoms of decompensation monitoring assessing a decision tree with
           diuretics adjustment if needed and alerts that define the need to contact a health
           professional for early intervention before deterioration of the clinical state,
           identifying situations that require clinical intervention.

        -  educational content on heart failure for the patient (symptoms of the disease, healthy
           habits for HF, warning signs for severity)

        -  diary for registration of visits to health services and clinical setting.

      Control group:

      -Usual outpatient care

      Follow-up

        -  Follow up will be at least 180 days from the inclusion in the study.

        -  Sample size estimation 350 patients per group (700 patients)
