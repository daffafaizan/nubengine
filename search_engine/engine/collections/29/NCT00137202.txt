      delineated.

      While the exact mechanisms/pathways for itching are currently unclear, histamine antagonism
      appears to be the most popular treatment. Whether histamine antagonism works predominantly
      via peripheral inhibition or central sedation is uncertain. By treating another intermediary
      in the pruritus cascade, it may be possible that an alternate treatment could be used while
      eliminating some of the unwanted side effects of antihistamine at the same time.
