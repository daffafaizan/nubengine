    
      rTMS is a treatment that involves stimulating a certain area of the brain with magnetic field
      pulses. Over time, the magnetic field pulses can gradually change the activity level of the
      stimulated brain region and help symptoms of bipolar depression. The device used in this
      study has been approved by Health Canada for therapeutic use since 2002. Participants will
      complete a screen visit to determine eligibility based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      If the participants are not eligible, no further study procedures will be conducted. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized to receive either active iTBS-rTMS or sham rTMS treatment (scalp
      stimulation with no magnetic pulse) daily for four weeks (20 sessions) to the left
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All participants will complete a MRI (to target the
      left DLPFC region of the brain and functional activity), EEG & fNIRS, lab work, and
      neurocognitive testing prior to the commencement and post rTMS treatment. Efficacy, safety
      and tolerability will be evaluated at screen visit, during daily rTMS treatments, clinic
      visits and post rTMS treatment. All participants will have a phone interview two weeks post
      rTMS treatment.
