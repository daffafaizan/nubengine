      psychotherapy and of ketamine, combining the two treatments may yield a promising new rapid
      7-day treatment for PTSD. As PTSD symptoms' structure is comprised of several unique clusters
      which include re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing/depression and hypervigilance the
      investigators hypothesize that by combining Ketamine with prolonged exposure (PE) the
      investigators can address these symptoms clusters more effectively. This treatment has the
      potential to produce a significant therapeutic effect that otherwise would take months to
      occur by tapping on the enhanced neuroplasticity and the antidepressant effect of ketamine
      (which lasts between 24hrs to 7 days), to promote rapid changes in learning and memory using
      prolonged exposure therapy within this unique "window of opportunity".

      During the first visit participants will undergo a clinical interview to establish a PTSD
      diagnosis and other eligibility criteria. If found eligible participants will be invited to
      take part in this 7-day rapid treatment trial for PTSD.

      On the first therapy visits, participants will be educated about the psychological treatment
      that will be provided and the potential benefit of ketamine to enhance the psychotherapy
      outcomes.

      On the second day of the study, participants will receive an infusion of ketamine and will
      undergo an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and will receive the second psychotherapy
      session.

      On days 3-6 participants will attend a 60-90 minutes psychotherapy session to address their
      PTSD symptoms.

      Day 7 will include another MRI scan and the last psychotherapy session.

      Participants will be asked to come back for a follow up evaluation of their PTSD symptoms 30
      and 90 days post discharge.
