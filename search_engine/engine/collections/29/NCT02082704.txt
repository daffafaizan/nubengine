      participate in an online team-based game on diabetes self-management education (DSME) and
      will receive a paper documents on American history, and (2) the 'attention control' cohort
      will participate in an online team-based game on American history and will receive a paper
      documents on DSME. Each game would consist of 2 questions per week x 25 weeks = 50 questions
      total per arm. The questions are delivered via email by the Qstream platform to the
      participants. Upon clicking on a hyperlink in the email, participants select an answer that
      is downloaded to a server. They are then provided with the answer to and explanation of the
      question, along with additional educational materials. Using an adaptive methodology, the
      spacing and content of the game material will be individualized for each clinician based on
      their performance. Home-based testing of HbA1c and M/C ratio will be conducted by patients at
      enrollment, 6 months and 12 months. If successful, this SE game will improve diabetes
      management among VA patients and improve patient outcomes. Given the growing use of email and
      the Internet by patients, SE games could be easily expanded to a broad audience of VA
      patients with varying health problems across the country. With content tailored to meet
      specific needs, SE games can be utilized as tools to improve patients' clinical outcomes by
      bolstering their health management behaviors.
