      an unblinded prevention study, a controlled dose-ranging study, and a controlled drug
      combination dose-ranging study.

      In the treatment study, participants with acute attacks of porphyria receive intravenous heme
      arginate daily for 4 days. Treatment may be extended to 7 days in patients with severe
      attacks and slow recovery; these data are analyzed separately.

      In the prevention study, participants receive weekly infusions of heme arginate for 6 months.
      Treatment may be extended in selected cases; these data are analyzed separately. If an acute
      attack occurs, patients are treated with a standard course of heme arginate. Participants are
      followed weekly for 6 months after preventive treatment.

      In the dose-ranging study, 4 groups of 3 patients are randomly assigned to standard and
      low-dose heme arginate infusions, administered daily for 4 days. After a washout of 4-12
      weeks, patients are crossed to a second dose. In 2 of the 4 groups, patients cross between
      heme arginate and a normal saline control.

      In the combination dose-ranging study, 4 groups of 3 patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2
      doses of tin mesoporphyrin. After a 4-12 week washout, these patients are crossed to a
      standard or low-dose heme arginate infusion. After a second 4-12 week washout, patients are
      given a combination infusion of tin mesoporphyrin followed by heme arginate.

      All participants are given a special diet to prevent fluctuations in porphyrin precursors.
