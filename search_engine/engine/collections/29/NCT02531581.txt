    
      Main objective:

      Compared with the time of normalization of cTnI (biomarker of right ventricular dysfunction)
      in hospitalized patients in the initial phase of a serious EP normotensive between the 2
      groups diuretic and vascular filling

      PRINCIPAL INCLUSION CRITERIA

        -  older than 18 Patient

        -  Hospitalized in the first 24 hours of a serious EP normotensive formally diagnosed (by a
           chest CT)

      The serious nature without hypotension is defined by the presence of:

        -  From biological criteria: troponin and / or BNP positive AND

        -  In sonographic criteria: dilated right ventricle defined by echocardiography right over
           left ventricle ratio (VG)> 0.9 in apical 4- chamber or 0.7 in large parasternal axis and
           right ventricular systolic dysfunction (TAPSE <16 mm and S 'pulsed TDI tricuspid <10 cm
           / sec) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) Pulmonary Arterial Pressure with
           systolic (PAPs)> 35 mmHg or paradoxical septum

             -  Informed consent signed

             -  Affiliation to social security

      PRINCIPAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        -  Thrombolysis before inclusion

        -  State of cardiogenic shock defined as systolic BP <90 mmHg or a drop of> 40 mmHg in
           systolic BP for> 15 minutes

        -  severe chronic renal impairment defined by clearance <30 ml / min.

        -  pregnant or nursing woman (a pregnancy test will be performed for XML File Identifier:
           cthC5Fc14NkHBXHkFCiTvGcJ8a8= Page 15/26 women of childbearing age and the results will
           be communicated to the patient by a doctor of his choice)

        -  Most People under guardianship

        -  hospitalized without their consent and not protected by law No

        -  Private person of liberty

        -  Residence time of more than 24 hours in another department after the positive diagnosis
           of pulmonary embolism
