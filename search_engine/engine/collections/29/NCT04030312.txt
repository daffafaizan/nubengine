      (of their designated treatment arm for either 20 calorie-per-ounce commercially-sterilized
      donor human milk OR 20-calorie-per-ounce standard infant formula) as treatment if they meet
      hypoglycemia criteria. Infant participants will complete the study if 1) they have received
      two bottle feeding supplementations for treatment of hypoglycemia, 2) they only received one
      bottle supplementation and hypoglycemia resolved, 3) if the medical teams deems the infants
      requires a higher level of care for their hypoglycemia (example: admission to the newborn
      intensive care unit for intravenous fluids with dextrose).
