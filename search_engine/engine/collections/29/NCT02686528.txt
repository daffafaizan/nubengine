      total hip arthroplasty via the posterior approach. Precautions are instructions that limit
      the functional use of the hip and are given for the first six weeks after surgery, with the
      goal of preventing an instability event resulting in dislocation. The hip precautions that
      will be investigated in this study are: no hip flexion past 90ยบ, no crossing the legs, and no
      twisting at the waist.
