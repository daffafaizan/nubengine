      supplemented; 37 control) were recruited from government and private settings. Subjects were
      randomised to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received
      hydrolysed whey protein supplement and diet counselling for 6 months while the control group
      received only diet counselling for 6 months.

      Patients who consented were first subjected to a screening for identification of eligible
      subjects. The screening involved basic anthropometry measures (height, weight, BMI), routine
      biochemistry result obtained from medical record, assessment of nutritional status and
      dietary evaluation. About 4ml of pre-dialysis blood was also collected by respective nurses
      for additional laboratory parameters (hsCRP).

      During the 6 months of treatment period, patients in both control and intervention groups
      were assessed at baseline and end of the study (at 6 months) for anthropometry assessment,
      laboratory results, medical condition, hospitalisations, nutritional status, dietary intake
      and compliance towards supplementation (intervention group only).
