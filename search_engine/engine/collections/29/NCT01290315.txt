      oxidative stress potential of FCM vs. IV iron sucrose or IV iron dextran in female subjects
      with IDA. Subjects with a diagnosis of IDA who required iron supplementation met all
      inclusion and no exclusion criteria, and had given informed consent were randomized. The
      duration of the study for each subject was a maximum of 6 weeks.

      Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to FCM (Group A) or IV iron sucrose or IV
      iron dextran (Group B).

      Group A subjects received a single undiluted dose of iron as FCM by a slow IV injection on
      Day 0. Cohort I received 500 mg and Cohort II received 750 mg. Group B subjects received a
      single dose of iron as IV iron sucrose or as IC iron dextran on Day 0. Cohort I receive 500
      mg iron sucrose and Cohort II received 750 mg iron dextran. Iron dextran administration was
      preceded by a 25 mg test dose 1 hour prior to infusion.

      All subjects had laboratory assessments at Baseline, 2 hours post-infusion, 24 hours
      post-infusion, Day 7 (drawn at the same time of day [within 4 hours] as the 24-hour visit),
      and Day 30 (drawn at the same time of day [within 4 hours] as the the 24-hour visit). On Days
      7 and 30, the safety evalutation for all subjects included treatment-emergent adverse event
      reporting, concomitant medication review, physical examination including vital signs, and
      laboratory assessments. Any subject who withdrew from the study received a follow-up phone
      call 30 days after they received study drug.
