        -  Assess the ability of prostatic tissue to accumulate doses of lycopene in patients with
           prostate cancer or benign prostate hyperplasia.

        -  Determine whether the steady state level of DNA oxidation in blood and prostate tissue
           is responsive to lycopene dosing.

        -  Investigate the effect of lycopene dosing on the lipid peroxidation marker
           malondialdehyde in serum.

        -  Assess the importance of measuring multiple DNA oxidation products as biomarkers of
           oxidative stress and its chemoprevention.

        -  Determine the significance of DNA oxidation products in blood as an indicator of
           oxidative stress in the prostate.

        -  Measure prostate and blood uptake of the chemoprevention agent lycopene.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral lycopene once daily for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 3 weeks. In both arms, patients
           undergo biopsy to confirm diagnosis of prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia
           after 3 weeks of study therapy.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and before surgery for biomarker/laboratory studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
