      of ovarian mass will have a sonographic examination that include: Trans-vaginal +-
      trans-abdominal ultrasound with Doppler and three dimensional sonographic exam. anamnestic
      data will be collected and serum test for CA 125, HE4 and CEA. The management of the specific
      patient will be according to the department protocol, regardless the study data. The
      investigators will collect data about operation outcome and histological results of women
      that will be operated. Women that won't be operated on will be followed up every 6 months by
      the study team.

      At the end of the study a statistical analysis will be made to create a sensitive and
      specific test for the prediction of malignancy in sonographic diagnosed ovarian mass.
