      month mortality is recommended by international guidelines. NSTEMI appropriate for coronary
      angiography (and percutaneous intervention) have better outcomes compare with NSTEMI who are
      medically managed. Whilst the national and international guidelines recommend that the timing
      of (in-hospital) coronary angiography (<24, 24-72, 72-96 and <96 hours) is based upon
      estimated clinical risk (using the GRACE risk score) there is scientific and clinical
      uncertainty as to the incremental benefit that more urgent invasive treatments strategies
      have over and above that of delayed strategies. Moreover, the investigators recent research
      has shown that in the UK, may NSTEMI (eligible) for coronary angiography fail to achieve care
      according to the recommended time thresholds, and this is associated with potentially
      avoidable premature death.

      This study aims to investigate the extent to which the time to angiography impacts on
      survival in patients hospitalised with NSTEMI. It will characterise patients according to
      their estimated risk of death, their time to angiography, and associated outcomes. The
      investigators anticipate that this observational study will provide Level B evidence for the
      benefits of the timing of an invasive strategy according to the GRACE risk score. The
      investigators are aware that the NICE guidelines for the management of acute chest pain are
      to be updated in 2016.
