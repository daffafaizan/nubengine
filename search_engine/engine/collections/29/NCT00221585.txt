      minimum of two years and a registration of data at baseline and 1, 2 and 5 years after
      inclusion. Three sub-cohorts with different treatment modalities were designed:

      Treatment1: 119 patients were, in addition to TaU, offered SPP, i.e. a scheduled manualised
      supportive individual psychotherapy (1 session of 45 min. per week, for a period of 1-3
      years) and/or group psychotherapy (1 session of 60 min. per week for a period of 1-3 years).
      Anti-psychotic medication was given in doses based on individual needs; Treatment 2: 139
      patients were offered IT, i.e. a scheduled, two-year long programme consisting of assertive
      community treatment, psycho-educational multi-family treatment (a.m. McFarlane, consisting of
      4-6 families including the patients, meeting 1½ hour every second week for 1½ year), social
      skills training (concerning medication, self-management, coping with symptoms, conversational
      skills, problem and conflict solving skills), and antipsychotic medication (low dose
      strategy). This project, OPUS, has been described in detail elsewhere
