      (15mg, 20mg, 25mg, 30mg) for optimal dosage, which will be determined by efficacy and safety
      profiles of the patients; afterward, the optimal dosage of chidamide will be combined with
      VRD regimen, patients will be randomly assigned to chidamide+VRD group or VRD group, and
      their efficacy and safety will be compared.
