      sedative/hypnotic and amnesic effects of propofol by imaging electrophysiologic and regional
      cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes to identify these. Our main hypothesis is that there are
      differing neuroanatomical regions mediating drug-induced sedation and amnesia, and that these
      can be identified by specific changes in electrophysiology and rCBF. Electrophysiologic
      changes will be mapped using a validated electroencephalographic (EEG) mapping technique, Low
      Resolution brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). (1) Changes in brain activity will be
      identified with high spatial resolution using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      statistical parametric mapping (SPM). (2) To identify key regions out of possibly many
      exhibiting changes in brain activity during propofol administration, we plan to manipulate
      drug-induced sedation by using thiopental, a sedative drug with few memory effects active at
      the same receptors as propofol.
