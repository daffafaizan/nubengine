      those of healthy people in order to achieve the desirable growth. Not only the carbohydrates'
      intake is underlined according to special guidelines by Canadian diabetes association,
      American diabetes association and International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent
      Diabetes but also proteins and fats are suggested to be taken into consideration in the
      management of T1D. In order to reach the desirable euglycemic control, children and
      adolescents can use multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin
      infusion (CSII). By using the CSII the insulin can be administrated in three different
      patterns; as a normal bolus, as a dual wave bolus and as a square wave bolus. Dual wave
      insulin bolus (D/WB) is suggested as the most suitable option based on the effects that is
      having after meals with different content of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the impact of different types of D/WB on PPG after 3 given meals,
      in adolescents with T1D on CSII. In order to achieve that, 3 different meals were designed
      and combined with alternative types of boluses, D/WB and square wave insulin bolus (S/WB).
