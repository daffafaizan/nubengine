      and anxiety in autologous stem cell transplant patients. The current study seeks to confirm
      and extend these findings in a 2-arm, open-label randomized, controlled study of 70 cancer
      patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. All patients will receive a
      standardized premedication. Arm 1: Intervention (inhalation aromatherapy with orange
      essential oil during stem cell infusion); Arm 2: Control (routine care). The researchers
      hypothesize that inhalation aromatherapy with orange essential oil will be effective in
      reducing DMSO related nausea and vomiting and demonstrate lower anxiety levels just after
      autologous stem cell transplantation.
