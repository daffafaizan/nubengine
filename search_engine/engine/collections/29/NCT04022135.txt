      distributions of serum and red blood cell folate. Thus, to account for drop outs or loss to
      follow up, a total of 60 women (30 in each group) will be recruited.

      Aim 1: To establish the mean Â± standard deviation change in serum folate, red blood cell
      folate, and unmetabolized folic acid levels in each group following supplementation with
      (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid or folic acid for 16-weeks of pregnancy. Exploratory
      analyses will be to measure differences in folate forms and folate binding protein in
      breastmilk.

      Aim 2: To determine participation recruitment and retention rate, the most effective
      recruitment strategies for this population, and adherence to study protocol (to inform a
      definitive trial).

      Women may undergo informed consent process anytime <21 weeks gestation. Once participants
      indicate that they are interested in participating in the trial, the participant will be
      given a study ID, and a baseline visit will be scheduled.

      The baseline visit will occur between 8-21 weeks gestation, and will involve discontinuation
      of current folate/prenatal vitamin supplementation, review and signing the informed consent
      form (a scanned copy will be shared with the participant), randomization to a folate group,
      provision of study supplements, completion of a baseline questionnaire, completion of a food
      frequency questionnaire, measurement of weight and height, and a small blood draw (12ml).

      Intervention: total time: 16 weeks. Participants will supplement daily with the folate and
      prenatal vitamin supplements. The research coordinator will call the participants half way
      through the intervention period to serve as a reminder and answer any questions, which will
      enhance protocol adherence.

      The endline visit will occur between 24-37 weeks gestation, and will involve collecting any
      remaining supplements (for capsule counts), a weight measurement, and a small blood draw
      (12ml), and completion of a short endline questionnaire.

      Optional continuation of study: After the endline visit, women who are planning to breastfeed
      will have the option to continue supplementing with the study supplements until approximately
      1 week postpartum, at which time they will provide a small (3 mL) breastmilk sample. The aims
      of this collection will be to measure difference in folate forms (including total proportion
      of unmetabolized folic acid) and breastmilk folate-binding protein.
