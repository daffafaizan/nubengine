      31-180 days vs 181-365 days) and by type of surgery. Infants are randomly assigned to one of
      two treatment arms.

      In part I, following major thoracic, abdominal, or cardiac surgery, infants are randomized to
      receive either continuous IV morphine infusions (arm I) or to receive morphine by single IV
      bolus doses every 2-3 hours (arm II).

      In part II, cyanotic and acyanotic infants following thoracotomy receive morphine by 2
      loading doses over 15 minutes and then by continuous IV infusion.

      Patients are followed for at least 2 days.
