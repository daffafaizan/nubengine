      signed an informed consent in which they allowed contact to participate in new studies,
      participants who met the inclusion criteria in the original database were recruited and
      signed an electronic informed consent of the new study. A comprehensive geriatric assessment
      was generated to assess whether they were candidates even due to changes in health status
      that could change over time since their last assessment, they were recruited until the
      expected sample size was obtained, and they were randomized, blinding the participants to
      belong to the intervention group (individualized care: geriatrics, psychology, physical
      activity and nutrition) or the control group (orientation in standardized health issues
      through audiovisual educational material)
