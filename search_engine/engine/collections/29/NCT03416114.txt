    
      We planned to collect data from May 1, 2014 and afterwards, by means of both retrospective
      and prospective approaches.

      All patients who have received or will receive a diagnosis of rare primary headache will be
      asked to participate and, to this aim, to give their informed consent. Each participating
      Centre should have received the approval of the competent Ethics Committee before commencing
      any study procedures.

      The registry will contain anagraphic information and data about diagnosis, treatment,
      comorbidity, and clinical features of the headache. Patients' data will be coded through the
      Italian Health System unique identifier, in order to avoid duplications of patients referring
      to more than one Centre and also to monitor multiple referrals.

      A web-based open source platform (SurveyMonkey.org) will be used to collect data.
