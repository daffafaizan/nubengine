      impairment, especially the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that increased the risk of
      progression to dementia. It was regarded that neurodegeneration contributes to the diabetic
      MCI, however, recent research suggested that CNS microvascular alterations are the mechanism
      for early diabetic MCI. But there still lacks an early warning system for the CNS
      micro-structure alterations during early diabetes. Latest neuroimaging techniques enable the
      measurement of brain blood flow, local neural activityï¼Œand the nuclei deposition of iron to
      reflect CNS micro-structure alterations. But these techniques are complicated and can not
      fully reflect the alterations with one single technique.We previous observed that 44.4% of
      diabetic patients demonstrate MCI and established the comprehensive protocols of measuring
      brain blood flow, local neural activity and the nuclei deposition of iron simultaneously
      based on the multimodal MRI technique so as to reflect the microstructure alterations
      reliably and validly. Therefore, we intend to integrate psychological measurement and
      clinical biochemical examination, and to establish the early warning system for the central
      nervous system micro-structure alterations during early diabetes based on the multi-modal MRI
      technique. The reliability and validity of this system will be tested in the diabetic rat
      model. The early warning system will likely assist in screening patients with diabetic
      microstructure alterations, to perform early intervention so as to prevent or delay the
      progression from diabetic MCI to dementia.
