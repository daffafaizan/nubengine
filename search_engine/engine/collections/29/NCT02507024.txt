      range of organs and Investigators understand that patients may suffer ongoing disease
      activity, as well as side effects from the treatments. Assessing patients quality of life can
      be an important tool for conducting clinical trials for new treatments and medications.

      Quality of life can be measured by questionnaires called "patient reported outcome measures"
      (PROM). What is a patient-reported outcome? Patient-reported outcomes, or PROs, are patients'
      feedback on what they are feeling or what they are able to do as participants are dealing
      with a chronic disease . Patient-reported outcomes are important because they provide doctors
      and researchers information about patients' quality of life. Questionnaires can be designed
      to measure specific PROs that are of specific importance to a disease and can provide much
      needed information on evaluating the effectiveness of health care. The aim of this survey is
      to develop a disease specific patient reported outcome measure, or PROM, for patients with
      AAV.

      A small group of Investigators and Patient-Partners developed this survey for people with
      ANCA-associated vasculitis (the AAV-PRO). Investigators will invite patients with AAV to
      complete the questionnaire they have designed, called the AAV-PRO. By analysing how people
      fill in the questionnaire, Investigators will be able to find out how well the questions
      work, and whether they need to ask all of them.
