    
      This randomized parallel group trial is designed to evaluate the impact of implementing
      geriatrician-prescribed interventions, on the ability to deliver adequate chemotherapy
      treatment, as measured by RDI of at least 85%, in a cohort of vulnerable [≥1 deficit
      identified at CGA and/or ≥1 comorbidity Grade 3-4 as defined by Cumulative Illness Rating
      Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G)] elderly cancer patients with early stage or advanced solid
      organ malignancies.

      Patients will be randomized using a 2:1 allocation to Arm A: routine oncological care plus
      geriatric intervention or Arm B: routine oncological care
