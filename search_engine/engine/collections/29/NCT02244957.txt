      pathophysiology and clinical consequences of these patients. Overlap syndrome has recently
      been reported to have excess cardiovascular mortality compared with COPD alone. However, no
      study has evaluated the mechanisms of excess cardiovascular mortality in untreated overlap
      syndrome. In addition, no prospective, randomized, controlled data are currently available on
      treatment of overlap syndrome.

      This study is divided into two parts. The first part (Part 1) is a cross-sectional cohort
      study comparing subjects with overlap syndrome to those with COPD alone and those with OSA
      alone. Patients with COPD and OSA overlap syndrome will be evaluated by an overnight sleep
      study, cardiac MRI, serum inflammatory biomarker, urine catecholamine level, pulmonary
      function test, and questionnaires of sleep and health related quality of life. These
      measurement will be compared between overlap syndrome and control groups with either COPD or
      OSA alone.

      The second part (Part 2) of the study is a prospective, parallel-group, randomized,
      controlled pilot study examining the effect of BPAP (and nocturnal oxygen if needed) vs.
      nocturnal oxygen therapy alone in patients with overlap syndrome (20 subjects in each
      treatment arm). The same measurement done during Part 1 will be repeated to evaluate the
      treatment effects.
