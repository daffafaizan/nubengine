      I. To assess the potential for efficacy and safety of combining percutaneous computed
      tomography (CT)-guided cryoablation and radiotherapy for the palliation of osseous
      metastases.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cryosurgery. Beginning 2 weeks later, patients undergo 1, 10, or 15
      fractions of radiation therapy 5 days per week for 1-3 weeks. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours and weeks 1-2, 4,
      12, 18, and 24.
