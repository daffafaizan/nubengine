    
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase II/III study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG
      performance status (0 or 1 vs 2) and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens. Patients will
      receive full supportive care while on this study.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        1. Phase II component: To assure that neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by selective use of
           5FUCMT group (Group 1) maintains the current high rate of pelvic R0 resection and is
           consistent with non-inferiority for time to local recurrence (TLR).

        2. Phase III component: To compare neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by selective use of 5FUCMT
           (Group 1) to standard 5FUCMT (Group 2) with respect to the co-primary endpoints of the
           Time to Local Recurrence (TLR) and Disease-Free Survival (DFS).

      Secondary

        1. To determine if the neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by selective use of 5FUCMT (Group 1) is
           non-inferior to the standard group 5FUCMT (Group 2) with respect to the proportion of
           patients who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) at the time of surgical
           resection.

        2. To determine if the neoadjuvant FOLFOX followed by selective use of 5FUCMT (Group 1) is
           non-inferior to the standard 5FUCMT (Group 2) with respect to overall survival.

        3. To evaluate and compare the adverse event profile and surgery complications between two
           groups.

        4. To estimate the proportion of patients in the selective group (Group 1) who receive: 1)
           pre-operative 5FUCMT; 2) post-operative 5FUCMT; 3) either pre- or post-operative 5FUCMT.

      Event monitoring of patients will continue up to 8 years post randomization.
