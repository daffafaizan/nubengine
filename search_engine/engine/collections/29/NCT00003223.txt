      neoplasia. II. Assess the toxicity of fenretinide in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral fenretinide on days 1-25 every 28 days for a maximum of 6
      courses. After 6 courses, patients receive a post-treatment biopsy. Patients exhibiting
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicities are removed from the study. Patients are
      followed at 3 and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 51 patients will be accrued.
