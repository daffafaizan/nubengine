      chronic low back pain during and after wear. Consequently, an improvement in the quality of
      daily life is expected with a less significant impact of low back pain.

      The main objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of the ATLAS medical device with a
      standard lumbar support belt in terms of immediate reduction of low back pain experienced in
      patients with subacute or chronic low back pain.
