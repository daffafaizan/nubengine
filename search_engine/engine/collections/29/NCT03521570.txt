    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with recurrent or second
      primary head and neck squamous cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) re-irradiation with concurrent and adjuvant nivolumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the 1-year (yr) overall survival (OS) of patients treated with re-irradiation and
      nivolumab.

      II. Evaluate patient quality of life (QOL).

      III. Evaluate patterns of failure including local, regional and distant failure rates at 1
      yr.

      IV. Identify and estimate the incidence rate of acute and late toxicities associated with
      combined re-irradiation and concurrent and adjuvant nivolumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify potential biomarkers related to clinical benefit to concurrent and adjuvant
      nivolumab and re-irradiation in patients with recurrent or second primary (RSP) head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on weeks -2, 0, 2, 4, and 6 and
      undergo IMRT once daily beginning on week 0 for up to 6-6.5 weeks. Beginning week 10,
      patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 10 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years from the beginning
      of radiation therapy.
