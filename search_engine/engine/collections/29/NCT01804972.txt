      variety of media including; written information, web-site based information and more recently
      through the use of smart phone based applications. Such educational campaigns have financial
      implications for hospitals and institutions.

      The level of knowledge among patients with vascular disease of their pathology and its
      associated risk factors has been shown to be poor (Lovell et al 2009, Hirsch et al 2007). The
      optimum tool with which to provide information to patients with vascular disease has not been
      determined to date.
