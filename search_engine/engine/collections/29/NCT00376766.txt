      to baseline between events. The most common definition of cluster seizure is three seizures
      per 24 hours.

      The usual treatment of cluster seizure is benzodiazepin. This is recognized efficient therapy
      but has many side effects. Thus it is important to develop as an new therapeutic to improve
      patient care. Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic drug used in addition to other antiepileptic
      drugs with less side effects than benzodiazepin.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of levetiracetam in
      epilepsy cluster seizure.

      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, add-on clinical trial with two phases :

      Phase 1 : Double blind phase during 24 hours (H0 to H24). After consent signature and
      randomization, the patient takes two tablets of levetiracetam or placebo. If the patient has
      a seizure between H3 and H24, he is considered as a non-respondent patient. If there is a
      risk of rapid evolution to an statue epilepticus, the investigator can break the blind and
      adapt the patient treatment accordingly.

      Phase 2 : This is an open phase after H24. this phase consists of breaking the blind with
      free adaption of the therapy by the investigator, and patients follow-up during 1 month.

      The randomization is stratify by center. The size of randomization blocks is random because
      of the systematic breaking blind after 24 hours.
