      prematurely terminated due to poor enrollment on 12 September 2003. There were no statistical
      analyses of efficacy conducted because the numbers of patients enrolled were insufficient for
      inferential analysis due to the poor enrollment. There were no serious adverse events or
      deaths reported during the study.
