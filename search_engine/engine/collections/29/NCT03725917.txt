      ankle and foot function, characteristics related to the development of ulcers.

      In previous studies, it has been observed that physiotherapy protocols have produced
      improvements in joint mobility, magnitude of plantar pressures, distribution of plantar
      pressures, and improved function in the ankle and foot.

      A 12-week progressive physiotherapy protocol composed of manual therapy and exercise could
      produce changes in foot and ankle characteristics in diabetic neuropathic patients related to
      tissue damage, resulting in a reduction in ulcerations.
