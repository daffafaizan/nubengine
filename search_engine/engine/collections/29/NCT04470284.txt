      efficacy of SMBP with mobile health application (SMBP-App) compared with SMBP alone.

      Patients with hypertension will be randomly assigned to SMBP-App (intervention) and SMBP
      along (control) groups. In SMBP group the patients perform home blood pressure measurement
      and usual care. In SMBP-App group the patients perform home blood pressure and receive extra
      alarm and instructions from the mobile application in response to the obtained blood pressure
      value.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether SMBP-App is superior to SMBP alone in terms of
      blood pressure reduction and improved drug compliance in patients with hypertension.
