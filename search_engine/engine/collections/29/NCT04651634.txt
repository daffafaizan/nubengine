      complication in patients receiving CCRT used for treating HNSCC. Mucositis lesions can be
      painful, affect nutrition and quality of life (QoL), and have a significant economic impact.
      However, a definitive intervention regime has not been established. Therefore, it is
      essential to develop appropriate treatment.

      MitoImmune Therapeutics Inc. (hereafter referred to as Sponsor) has developed MIT-001 which
      can scavenge abnormal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enabling the cells to retain
      mitochondrial membrane permeability and mitochondrial function. This eventually inhibits
      additional ROS production, indicating that MIT-001 can prevent excessive inflammation caused
      by ROS. In addition, MIT-001 may possibly 1) block inflammatory cytokine production via
      inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF kB) or inflammasome dependent pathways, 2) inhibit
      necrosis/necroptosis via blocking high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) mediated cytokine
      production, and 3) balance regulation between T helper type 1/17 (Th1/17) and regulatory T
      cells.

      Based on the pathophysiological progression of CCRT-associated OM, initiated by direct injury
      to basal epithelial cells which experience deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and increased
      ROS levels, Sponsor expects the prevention of OM in patients receiving CCRT of locally
      advanced HNSCC with MIT 001 by effectively scavenging increased ROS induced by CCRT.
