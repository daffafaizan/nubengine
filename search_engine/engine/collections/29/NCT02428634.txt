      health-related components (diet, physical activity, human body and emotions management).
      Since the Program SI! for preschoolers has shown good results in improving healthy lifestyle
      habits in children aged 3 to 5 years, the investigators have developed the Program SI! for
      Elementary addressed to children from 6 to 11 years. The objective of the study is to
      evaluate the effects of Program SI! for Elementary in different times of exposure for
      childrens and their immediate environment (teachers, parents and school). In the Community of
      Madrid-South Area (Spain), 48 public schools from were randomly assigned to Program SI! for
      Elementary during 3 or 6 academic years (intervention group) or keep their normal curriculum
      (control group). The main outcome is 3-year, and 6-year changes from baseline of
      questionnaire scoring of children, and the secondary outcome is 3-year, and 6-year changes
      from baseline of questionnaire scoring of their parents and teachers in regards to a healthy
      lifestyle, as well as changes in the school environment. For children were included 3-year,
      and 6-year changes of cardiovascular markers derived from blood pressure and anthropometry
      (weight, height, waist circumference and skinfold thickness). The Program SI! for Elementary
      is designed for different exposures in a sample of schools never intervened to asses when the
      intervention has the most effectiveness. Besides, as some schools involved in the preschool
      study continues the Program SI! for Elementary, the investigators can be able to evaluate the
      impact of the Program SI! in different school stages, concluding how children keep the
      adoption of healthy behaviors from early in life.
