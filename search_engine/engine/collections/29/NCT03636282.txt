      improving health behaviours and health indicators. To achieve this goal, following a
      successful pilot study providing strong evidence to proceed with a definitive trial, the
      investigators are conducting a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the
      Hockey FIT program.

      The primary specific aim is to conduct an outcome evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness of
      Hockey FIT in middle-aged Canadian men who are overweight or obese. Specifically, the
      investigators will: examine whether Hockey FIT (vs. wait-list control) leads to: greater
      weight loss at 12 months (primary outcome), as well as improved health behaviours (physical
      activity; sedentary time; eating habits) and health indicators (physiological measures;
      health & psychosocial measures) at 3 and 12 months.

      Following the pilot study, the investigators will use the affiliation of being a fan of
      hockey as a powerful draw to engage men. Sites will be selected based on availability of both
      a major junior (or professional) hockey team and an implementation partner (e.g., YMCA
      branch, fitness facility, University) located in the city. A minimum of 32 Canadian sites
      will be randomized to the intervention (Hockey FIT program: immediately delivery) or
      comparator (wait-list control: delayed delivery); at each site, at least 10 men will be
      recruited (with the goal of recruiting approximately 40 men/site). Intervention sites will
      begin Hockey FIT immediately while comparator sites will offer Hockey FIT after a 12-month
      delay. The measurement sessions involving both groups will take place at 0 (baseline), 3 and
      12 months.
