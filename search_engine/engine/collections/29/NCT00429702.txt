      Primary

        -  Compare the degree of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in pediatric
           patients with newly diagnosed cancer treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride,
           lorazepam, and dexamethasone vs standard antiemetic therapy during the first course of
           emetogenic chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the degree of CINV during the first 3 days after completion of the first course
           of emetogenic chemotherapy in patients treated with these antiemetic regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, prospective, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to the emetogenic potential of their chemotherapy regimen (high vs
      moderate). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive ondansetron hydrochloride IV twice daily and saline IV twice
           daily beginning 30-60 minutes prior to the start of chemotherapy. Patients also receive
           diphenhydramine hydrochloride, lorazepam, and dexamethasone by continuous infusion pump.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive ondansetron hydrochloride IV twice daily and dexamethasone IV
           twice daily beginning 30-60 minutes prior to the start of chemotherapy. Patients also
           receive saline by continuous infusion pump.

      In both arms, treatment continues during the first course of chemotherapy. Patients may also
      receive rescue antiemetic medication to control breakthrough nausea or emesis.

      Patients and their parents complete the Adapted Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting, and
      Retching- Measured by Child/Parent questionnaire once before beginning chemotherapy, twice
      daily during chemotherapy, and for 3 days after completion of chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients will be accrued for this study.
