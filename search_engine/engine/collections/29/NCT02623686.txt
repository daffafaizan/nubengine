      sleep. The causes for this are multifactorial and include nursing and medical procedures,
      pain, discomfort, anxiety, stress, mechanical ventilation, the ICU environment including
      noise and light, pharmacological agents and severity of underlying disease (Tembo & Parker,
      2009; Bihari et al, 2012; Kamdar et al, 2012). Sleep disruption, along with inability to
      communicate and limitations on visiting, were rated as stressors by ICU patients (Nelson et
      al, 2001). The effects of poor sleep are deleterious, impacting on patients' recovery both
      within the ICU (Tembo & Parker, 2009; Bihari et al, 2012) and subsequently after discharge
      (Kamdar et al 2012). Measurements on mechanically ventilated patients receiving continuous
      intravenous sedation showed disturbed Circadian timing, lack of REM sleep and absent EEG
      features of the alternation of wake and sleep states, suggesting that these patients may be
      continuously sleep deprived which could exacerbate their condition and compromise their
      recovery (Gehlbach et al, 2012). There is a preponderance of evidence suggesting that
      sedation practices may impact a range of adverse outcomes; novel strategies to combat patient
      symptomatology through non-pharmacologic means are to be encouraged (Millelsen & Schweickert,
      2013).Furthermore, the positive effect on anxiety of therapeutic touch using massage on ICU
      patients has been demonstrated previously in two RCTs (Henricson et al, 2008; Lindgren et al,
      2013).The use of non-pharmacological strategies to encourage sleep is suggested by a number
      of authors (Gosselink et al, 008; Matthews, 2011; Kamdar et al, 2012). Richards (1998) found
      back massage useful for promoting sleep in critically ill older men; Nerbass et al (2010)
      found massage improved sleep post coronary artery bypass graft surgery;Soden et al (2004)
      found sleep scores of palliative care patients with cancer significantly improved with
      aromatherapy massage and massage alone, despite the fact that the massage interventions were
      given in the morning. Sleepdisruption can be exacerbated by factors such as pain, anxiety and
      stress (Kamdar et al, 2012). Massage may influence sleep partly because of its effects on
      these symptoms; a review by Ernst (2009) concluded that massage may help with symptom control
      including the reduction of anxiety and pain in cancer palliation and supportive care.Stringer
      et al (2008) found a single session of massage for isolated hematology patients undergoing
      intensive chemotherapy brought a significant reduction in cortisol with an accompanying
      improvement in psychological well-being.
