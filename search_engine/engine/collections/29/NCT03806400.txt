      The investigators defined PONV as a presence of either nausea or vomiting. In study hospital,
      it was routine for nurses to assess and record nausea and vomiting every 8 hours for all
      postoperative patients during postoperative 3 days. Accordingly, the investigators
      retrospectively collected the presence of PONV from electrical medical records. If patients
      had discharged hospital within postoperative 3 days, the incidence of PONV was assessed
      solely during hospital stay. The data, collected included information regarding age at
      surgery, gender, and type of strabismus. During strabismus surgery, the number and sequence
      of the operated muscles, HR before traction of the EOM (baseline HR), maximum decreased HR
      after traction of the EOM, HR at maximum recovery from decreased HR and maintained during
      traction of the EOM (adrenergic HR), and HR at the cutting of the muscle, were collected.
      Oculocardiac reflex was defined as a decrease in HR greater than or equal to 20% rather than
      maximum at first traction of the muscle.
