      ultrasonography and are candidates for either emergency or elective repeated cesarean section
      or hysterectomy (if the diagnosis of placenta accreta is confirmed).

      Those patients are attending to Kasr-Al Ainy Obstetrics outpatient clinic or casualty
      department during their 3rd trimester.

      Ultrasound and doppler will be done to all patients to diagnose placenta accreta . The
      diagnosis will be confirmed by intraoperative assessments and histopathological examination
      of the uterus after cesarean hysterectomy
