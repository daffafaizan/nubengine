      bioavailability of two formulations of 100 mg sertraline hydrochloride tablets under fasting
      conditions. The study was conducted with 36 (30 completing) healthy adults in accordance with
      protocol No.

      10540323(Revision 0). In each study period, a single 100 mg dose was administered to the
      subjects following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The test formulation was Ranbaxy
      Research Laboratories's Sertraline Hydrochloride 100 mg Tablets and the reference formulation
      was ZOLOFTÂ® (sertraline hydrochloride) 100 mg Tablets Manufactured by Roerig (Division of
      Pfizer). The subjects received the test product in one study period and the reference product
      in the other period; the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization
      schedule. There was a 14-day interval between treatments.

      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 144 hours after each dose. The
      plasma samples for all subjects completing both periods of the study were sent to Helen
      Fassoulas, B.Sc., Director of Operations, Warnex Bioanalytical Services Inc., 3885 boul
