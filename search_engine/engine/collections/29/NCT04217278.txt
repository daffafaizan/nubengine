    
      This is a randomised, international, phase II/III, multicentre, clinical trial in patients
      with AML and MDS undergoing allo-SCT. Patients with AML or MDS who fulfil the eligibility
      criteria will be invited to participate in the trial across centers performing allo-SCT.

      Patients will be randomised to treatment based on a minimisation algorithm prepared at the
      Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit (CRCTU).

      Randomisation 1 (R1) will compare the novel consolidation therapy vyxeos with the standard
      consolidation therapy intermediate dose cytarabine.

      Randomisation 2 (R2) will compare the novel conditioning regimen
      thiotepa/busulphan/fludarabine (TBF) with the standard conditioning therapy
      fludarabine/busulphan (FB4) in patients aged under 55 years of age.

      Randomisation 3 (R3) will compare the novel conditioning regimen mini
      thiotepa/busulphan/fludarabine (mini TBF) with the standard regimen fludarabine/busulphan
      (FB2) in patients aged 55 years of age and over.
