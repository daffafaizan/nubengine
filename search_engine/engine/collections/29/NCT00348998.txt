        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of giving bevacizumab together with hormonal therapy
           and radiotherapy in patients with high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Beginning in week 1, patients receive goserelin subcutaneously once every 3 months for 2
      years. Patients also receive oral bicalutamide once daily and bevacizumab IV over 30- to
      90-minutes once every 2 weeks in weeks 1-16 and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week in weeks
      9-16. After completion of radiotherapy, patients receive a higher dose of bevacizumab once
      every 3 weeks in weeks 17-28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
