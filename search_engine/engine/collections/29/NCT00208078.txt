      patients with neuromuscular diseases is well established.

      Long term non-invasive ventilation is commonly used in the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis
      patients with respiratory failure. However, the benefits of this treatment have never been
      studied in randomized control trials and are unknown.

      The goal of this multicenter study is to evaluate the effects of the addition of non-invasive
      ventilation to the standard therapy in stable Cystic Fibrosis patients with chronic
      hypercapnia.

      Two groups of patients will be followed: The first group will receive standard treatment for
      advanced Cystic Fibrosis according to international guidelines, the second group will receive
      the same treatment plus non-invasive ventilation (4H/day). The follow up time will be one
      year for each patient.
