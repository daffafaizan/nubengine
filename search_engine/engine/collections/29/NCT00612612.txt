      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of obatoclax mesylate in combination with
      fludarabine phosphate-rituximab (FR) in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity of obatoclax mesylate in combination with FR in this patient
      population.

      II. To determine objective response rate and progression-free survival of obatoclax mesylate
      in combination with FR.

      III. To correlate levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members with drug response.

      IV. To determine whether apoptosis is induced via the mitochondrial pathway in response to
      obatoclax mesylate and further enhanced by FR.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of obatoclax mesylate.

      Patients receive obatoclax mesylate IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 3, fludarabine IV over
      20-30 minutes on days 1-5, and rituximab IV over 4 hours on day 1 (days 1 and 3 of course 1
      only). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood collection for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed
      for expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members by western blot; apoptosis
      induction by measurement of lymphocyte count, Annexin V staining, and Caspase and PARP
      cleavage; activated Bax by immunoprecipitation; and Bax promoter polymorphism by PCR
      amplification and direct sequencing.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months.
