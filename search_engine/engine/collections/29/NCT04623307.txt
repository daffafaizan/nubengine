      cerebellum, and brain stem, while brain edema is increased intracellular or extracellular
      fluid in brain tissue. Early diagnosis is helpful to improve the cure rate and reduce
      sequelae. This study aims to evaluate brain injuries and brain edema with non-contact
      DCS-Speckle multi-parameter imager, so as to provide reference diagnostic criteria by image
      artificial intelligence analysis.
