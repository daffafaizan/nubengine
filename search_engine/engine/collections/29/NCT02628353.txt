    
      The study's main objective is to investigate the effects of acute consumption of a
      preparation containing 100 mg of a specific phenolic compound (patent pending, P201531587) on
      systolic blood pressure (BP) after ingestion of a high fat meal.

      The secondaries objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the effects on diastolic BP.

        -  To study the phenolic compound bioavailability and to analyze its metabolites for
           determine the phenolic compound consumption biomarkers.

        -  To evaluate the effects on endothelial function by ischemic reactive hyperemia (IRH).

      The sample size was calculated using a previous studies using systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      as the primary outcome measure. A total of 14 subjects are needed, assuming variance
      components of approximately 20.0, to detect differences between treatments (placebo and
      phenolic product) of 10 mmHg, with a bilateral significance level of Î±=0.05, a power of 80%
      and a standard deviation of 11.82 mmHg at the baseline.

      To compare the main variable efficiency of the products of study as well as secondary
      variables of efficiency, will carry out analysis of the covariance (ANCOVA) with basal value
      as covariable, followed by the Tukey test for determining multiple differences. All tests
      will be carried out with significance to bilateral level of 5%. It is considered significant
      value p<0,05. The data will be analyzed using the "SPSS" program version 22.

      The statistical analysis will follow the principles specified in the guidelines of the
      International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E9 and CPMP/EWP/908/99 ICH E9 Points to
      Consider on Multiplicity Issues in Clinical Trials.
