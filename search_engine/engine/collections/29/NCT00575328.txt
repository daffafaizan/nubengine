      medication regimen over 24 months. Subjects were outpatient females between 18 and 80 years
      old with no significant symptoms of mania (Young Mania Rating Scale score<10), and who have
      been on a steady regimen of medications to treat bipolar disorder for at least 8 weeks, with
      a stable dose for at least 4 weeks. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a double blind
      manner to receive 3000 mg/day of maca root or identical placebo for 12 weeks to determine
      whether maca root is more effective than placebo for the treatment of sexual dysfunction
      associated with treatment regimens for bipolar disorder.
