      The objective of this prospective observational study of intracranial tumors in patients with
      neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is to gain insight into the use of 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose
      (FDG) and 3 -deoxy-3 -18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) as a predictive measure of future tumor growth patterns.

      STUDY POPULATION: <TAB>

      Twelve patients, ages 18-50, with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of NF2 and harboring at
      least 3 unoperated intracranial tumors (meningiomas and/or vestibular schwannomas) will
      participate in this study.

      DESIGN:

      Study participants will be evaluated with a thorough physical and neurologic examination upon
      enrollment. This initial outpatient evaluation will include contrast-enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, FDG-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT scans.

      Subjects will be followed as outpatients for two years, during which time MRI evaluation will
      be performed every six months.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Based on data derived from this study, we hope to correlate FDG-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT scans
      with metabolic activity and cellular proliferation within tumors. These findings will help us
      better forecast tumor growth and senescence. These findings should permit the safer treatment
      of the subset of tumors that will grow and cause symptoms and avoid the unnecessary treatment
      of lesions that will remain stable (not requiring treatment) in these patients.
