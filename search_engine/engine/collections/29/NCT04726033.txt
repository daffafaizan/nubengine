    
      The optimisation dose and imaging conditions will be conducted in prostate cancer patients
      with with oligometastatic disease ( (defined as 5 sites or less outside of the prostate bed).
      On determining the optimal dose and imaging conditions, an additional cohort of patients with
      a higher tumour burden such as multiple metastatic sites across ≥10 regions will be assessed.

      Study conduct:

      Nine, prostate cancer patients with oligometastatic disease as detected using 68Ga-PSMA-11 or
      18F-DCFPyl PSMA PET/CT scanning (defined as 5 sites or less outside of the prostate bed) will
      be randomised to one of three treatment groups to receive a single injection of:

        -  Group 1: 2mg of TLX592, labelled with 300 MBq (± 10%) 64Cu.

        -  Group 2: 2mg of TLX592, labelled with 300 MBq (± 10%) 64Cu combined with 8mg of
           unlabelled TLX592 (mass dose of 10mg).

        -  Group 3: 2mg of TLX592, labelled with 300 MBq (± 10%) 64Cu combined with 18mg of
           unlabelled TLX592 (mass dose of 20mg). If one of the three patients in a specific group
           experiences a dose-limiting toxicity, three more patients will be treated at the same
           dose level.

      Patients with a higher tumour burden such as multiple metastatic sites across ≥10 regions
      [regions: prostate bed, pelvic lumph nodes, skeleton, distant sites (including viscera)] as
      detected on 68Ga-PSMA or 18F-DCFPyl PMSA imaging agent will be allocated to a fourth group.

      • Group 4: based on the result of Groups 1-3, the optimal dose and imaging timepoints will be
      selected to treat 3 patients with higher tumour burden (≥10 metastatic sites and/or visceral
      disease as detected on a 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 18F-DCFPyl PSMA PET/CTscan).

      For dosimetry analysis, biodistribution whole body PET/CT imaging will be performed at 1, 4 ±
      0.5h, 20 ± 4h, with the option for a an additional two scans to be performed between the
      36-120 hours post administration of the investigational product. The additional scans after
      the 20h timepoint will be at the discretion of the investigator. Patients will be imaged on a
      Siemens Biographe scanner, offering the possibility of TOF (time-of-flight) and non-TOF
      reconstruction.

      Comparative tumour PET/CT imaging:

      On Days 0, 1 and potentially at 36-120h the biodistribution and tumour imaging will be
      performed using gated or list mode acquisition, for generation of sub-partitioned data.Such
      data will allow the mathematical generation of statistically independent images for various
      dose levels, based on the actual dose administered in the trial.

      An end of study visit will be conducted on Day 28 ± 2 days. 64Cu-TLX592 images will be
      centrally analysed for absorbed organ and whole body doses in a standardised fashion. In
      addition, tumour absorbed doses will be determined for scientific purposes (estimation of
      achievable tumour doses of therapeutic nuclides labelled to TLX592). All image data analyses
      will be performed / confirmed centrally.

      Pharmacokinetic analysis:

      Blood samples will be taken at the following times and counted in a gamma counter:

        -  Pre-dose

        -  1, 4 ± 0.5h, 20 ± 4h and 48 ± 4h after the administration of 64Cu-TLX592.
