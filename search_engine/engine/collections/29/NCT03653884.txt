      incidence is low, evaluated between 0.4 and 1.1 / 1000.

      Intra-abdominal umbilical vein aneurysm is identified as an oval or rounded, anechoic mass
      located between the abdominal wall and the lower edge of the liver.

      It is defined by two criteria: either a diameter greater than 9 mm or a diameter of the
      subhepatic segment of the umbilical vein greater than 50% of the diameter of its intrahepatic
      segment.

      The complications that can occur during pregnancy are mainly represented by the MFIU, the
      occurrence of thrombosis and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Their overall frequency
      is evaluated at 10%.

      A complete fetal morphological assessment is necessary to eliminate the presence of other
      lesions. However, ultrasound monitoring is recommended during the third trimester in search
      of an increase in dilation and especially the appearance of a thrombus. A particular clinical
      form, related to abnormal umbilical vein involvement in the infra-hepatic portal system, must
      be individualized because of a high risk of thrombosis. It justifies the realization of an
      abdominal ultrasound in the first days of life
