      (AC) followed by GV. After completion of neo-adjuvant therapy, all patients will undergo
      lumpectomy (with radiation therapy) or mastectomy, and tissue will be assessed for residual
      disease to determine rates of pCR. Tumor tissue will be obtained by core needle biopsy and at
      the time of surgery for use in the correlative studies.
