      (apalutamide, abiraterone acetate and docetaxel plus prednisone) according to a
      dose-escalation schedule. The first dose of docetaxel infusion begins on Day 1 Cycle 1. Daily
      oral apalutamide, abiraterone acetate plus twice-daily oral prednisone begins on Day 1 Cycle
      1. Docetaxel 1-hour infusions are administered intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W), preceded by
      oral dexamethasone. While a subject is receiving chemotherapy, a treatment cycle is defined
      as 21 days. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) determination is based on toxicities observed within
      the initial 2 cycles defined as 6 weeks. DLT will be assessed before the start of the third
      docetaxel infusion. Once a combination dose is determined to be safe (i.e. no more than 2 of
      6 subjects experience DLT), the next cohort will enroll. Subjects remain at their allocated
      combination dose until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

      The primary objective is to determine a safe dose combination of apalutamide plus abiraterone
      acetate, docetaxel, prednisone in subjects with mCRPC.
