      that are scheduled for an L1-S1 discectomy and who meet the pre-operative eligibility
      criteria will be considered for study participation. Patients will be divided into two arms
      (small- and large-defect) based on the size of their annular defect as measured
      intra-operatively; each arm will be capped at 50 patients. All patients included in the trial
      will be followed for at least 12 months.
