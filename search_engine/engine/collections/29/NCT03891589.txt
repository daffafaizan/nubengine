      Complementary Feeding Recommendation (CFR) or optimized Complementary Feeding (CF) with or
      without MNP home fortification (Taburia) by using a Linear Programming approach. The
      objective of this stage was to address the nutrient gaps. Also, nutrient analysis of Taburia
      by employing an LP approach will provide adequate dosing of Taburia to added to local CF.
      Several studies have documented that MNP supplementation associated with a reduced bacterial
      population in digestive systems (Lactobacillus dan Bifidobacterium spp) and induced
      inflammation on the intestines. These conditions reduce the absorption capacity of digestive
      systems leading to nutrient deficiency among under-five children. Findings from the first
      phase were an optimized model of CF with or without MNP (Taburia) as an intervention media in
      the second phase of our study, which evaluates the effectiveness of a combination of CFRs and
      MNP fortification using an LP approach. This intervention group compared to (1) optimal
      Complementary Feeding (CF) with MNP one sachet per week, (2) optimized CF group alone, (3)
      Provision MNP alone three sachets per week, and (4) control group. Several indicators to be
      evaluated were (1) nutrient intake and density; (2) z-score of anthropometric index; (3)
      micronutrient status; (4) digestive health status (relative population of DNA Bifidobacterium
      and Lactobacillus spp).
