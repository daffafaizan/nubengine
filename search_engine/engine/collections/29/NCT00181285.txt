      together account for nearly 1 million hospitalizations each year in the United States alone.
      Beta agonists, anticholinergics, and corticosteroids delivered in aerosolized forms (via
      respiratory inhalers or nebulization) are recommended in the treatment of acute asthma and
      COPD. These medications rely on deposition into distal airspaces to suppress airway
      inflammation or promote bronchodilation. Unfortunately, excessive mucous production and
      impaired airway mucociliary clearance can lead to airway plugging, and thereby reduce the
      deposition of and response to aerosolized medications. These considerations highlight the
      need for therapies that clear airways of mucus in the acute management of asthma and COPD.
      High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) creates high velocity, low amplitude
      oscillatory airflows when applied through a pneumatic vest worn over the thorax, and is used
      for airway mucus clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and
      neuromuscular disorders.

      This was a randomized, multi-center, double-masked phase II clinical trial of active or sham
      treatment initiated within 24 hours of hospital admission for acute asthma or COPD at four
      academic medical centers. Patients received active or sham treatment for 15 minutes three
      times a day for four treatments. Medical management was standardized across groups. The
      primary outcomes were patient adherence to therapy after four treatments (minutes used/60
      minutes prescribed) and satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included change in Borg dyspnea
      score (â‰¥ 1 unit indicates a clinically significant change), spontaneously expectorated sputum
      volume, and forced expired volume in 1 second.
