      is more common in menstruating women with CD and UC than in the general population.
      Furthermore, we hypothesize that CD and UC activity as measured by non-invasive disease
      activity scores will be higher, and quality of life lower in women with both CD and UC and
      dysmenorrhea. As deciphering this complex relationship may avoid unnecessary testing or
      changes in therapy, we propose to characterize and compare the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in
      menstruating women with and without CD and UC. Furthermore, we will compare CD and UC
      activity and IBD-related quality of life in women with and without dysmenorrhea in a
      population of menstruating women with IBD. Lastly, we will compare general quality of life in
      women with and without either form of IBD and dysmenorrhea.
