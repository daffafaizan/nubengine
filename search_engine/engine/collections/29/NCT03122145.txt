      are few therapeutic options and minimal management strategies offered to treat these
      individuals and improve sequelae of dysphagia. Dysphagia contributes to malnutrition,
      aspiration, pneumonia, reduced quality of life and increased mortality in neurodegenerative
      disease such as ALS. One reason for this is the lack of normative data across various
      measures of swallowing and respiratory function. As a result, detecting early impairments in
      swallowing physiology is difficult, given the variability of swallowing and unknown normative
      value range of swallowing physiology. Therefore, the goal of this study is to complete
      clinical tests of swallowing and cough function in healthy volunteers to establish normative
      data. This will contribute to future study in disordered populations, to determine degree and
      severity of impairment and efficacious treatment and management strategies based on
      impairment.

      The purpose of this study is to establish normative values for clinical testing measures of
      swallow, respiratory and cough functions. This will aide in establishing degree of impairment
      in disordered populations, and in identifying efficacious treatment paradigms for dysphagia.
