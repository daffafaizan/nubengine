      will pursue the following specific aim: To determine the effects of 2 weeks (4 applications @
      2 per week) of HVLA-SM and LVVA-SM to the lumbo-pelvic region, compared to a control group
      receiving light effleurage and a sham mechanically assisted adjustment, on sensorimotor
      function as measured by: lumbo-pelvic repositioning ability, standing postural sway and
      response to sudden trunk loading;
