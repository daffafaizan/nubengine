    
      We plan to administer 200ml of distilled water as a single peroperative instillation and
      block the catheter for 2 hours to our eligible recurrent superficial bladder cancer patients
      who were in our follow-up schedule since 2002.

      We plan to look over the histories of the same patients in terms of the pathologies,
      recurrence patterns, the presence of peroperative intracavitary therapy after their previous
      TURs for recurrences.

      So we shall compare the effectiveness of MMC and distilled water on reducing the recurrences
      over the same patient pool.

      The patients will be scheduled for a follow-up program after TUR as;

        -  cystoscopy

        -  urine cytology

        -  bladder wash cytology for the probability of recurrence for 2 years to see if there is
           any difference in the recurrence patterns after instillation with distilled water vs
           MMC.
