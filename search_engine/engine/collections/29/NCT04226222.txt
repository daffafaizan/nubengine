    
      120 consecutive patients with "Triple Negative" breast cancers operatable from the outset
      will be included in the study

        -  To assess the prognostic value of the texture parameters of PET-TDM FDG on event-free
           survival at 2 years.

        -  To assess the prognostic value of standard parameters (clinical, standard histology,
           conventional imaging), semi-quantitative PET-TDM FDG and innovative
           Immuno-histochemistry parameters for 2-year event-free survival .

        -  To assess correlations between continuous PET-TDM FDG texture parameters and
           Immuno-histochemistry.

        -  To assess the multivariate prognostic value of standard parameters, PET-TDM FDG imaging
           parameters and Immuno-histochemistry defined as relevant to 2-year event-free survival .

        -  Construction of an optimal prognostic nomogram combining independent parameters to
           isolate different prognostic subgroups.
