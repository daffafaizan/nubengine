    
      This study will be an open-label, single-center, single-dose, randomized, two-way
      (two-period) crossover study in 16 adult subjects previously diagnosed with mild to moderate
      heart failure (NYHA class II/III) being treated concomitantly with oral furosemide therapy at
      a dose of ≥ 40 mg/day. Each subject will complete Screening, Baseline, Treatment, and
      Follow-Up Phases. The Screening Phase will be conducted on an outpatient basis between 14 and
      3 days prior to Baseline. Subjects will be instructed to maintain a < 2 gm sodium diet within
      3 days prior to Baseline. Baseline (Day 0) consists of clinical research unit (CRU) admission
      and final qualification assessments. The Treatment Phase will comprise two crossover periods
      separated by a 7-day outpatient fluid re-equilibration washout. Following CRU admission,
      subjects will discontinue oral furosemide at least 24 hours prior to administration of study
      drug for each Crossover Period. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2
      treatment sequences to receive both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) furosemide in
      Crossover Periods (i.e., IV followed by SC or vice versa). Subjects will remain domiciled in
      the CRU for each Crossover Period during the Treatment Phase through 24 hours after
      administration of study drug, after which time they will be discharged if safety parameters
      are acceptable to the Investigator. Oral furosemide therapy will be re-initiated at discharge
      after Crossover Period 1 (i.e., during the 7-day fluid re-equilibration washout) and after
      Crossover Period 2. The Follow-Up Phase will occur 7 days (± 1) after discharge from the CRU
      following Crossover Period 2, completing subjects' study participation.
