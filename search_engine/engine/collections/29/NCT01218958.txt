      [Volpicelli, JR [2001]; Guilford Press: New York]) at each visit.

      Subjects who completed this study (ie, received 6 injections of study drug and completed all
      study visits) and continued to meet eligibility criteria were given the option to enroll in
      extension study ALK21-003EXT (NCT01218971). A second extension, Study ALK21-010
      (NCT00156923), was conducted subsequent to ALK21-003EXT.
