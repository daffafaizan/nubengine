    
      In our study, about 480 type 2 diabetes patients will be enrolled from multiple centers in
      China. All participants will be randomly assigned into either the intervention group or the
      control group. All patients will be given basic diet, lifestyle instruction according to
      guidelines from home and abroad. The intervention group will be instructed to adjust the diet
      according to the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) and the recorde log monitored by the
      continuous glucose monitoring system, thereby implementing "therapeutic monitoring". All
      patients will maintain the drug treatment unchanged and make the glucose level as far as
      possible within the target range (>3.9 and â‰¤10mmol/L), and record the amount of various food,
      then maintain the dietary pattern and the amount unchanged until the end of the study.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of "therapeutic monitoring" on blood glucose
      control in type 2 diabetes, as measured by change in HbA1c level from baseline to 12-week
      follow-up in both intervention group and control group.

      THe secondary endpoint are 1) 1)Difference in TIR (time in range, time in target glucose
      range, 3.9-10.0mmol/L) at 12 weeks in both groups. 2)Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipids and
      other metabolic related components and parameters such as BMI will be measured. 3)Using
      questionnaires to evaluate the patients' satisfaction with Flash Glucose Monitoring System.
