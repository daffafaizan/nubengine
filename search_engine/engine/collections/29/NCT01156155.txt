      arthritis (RA) risk by enrolling 300 patients with RA and 300 comparator patients with
      osteoarthritis and comparing results from comprehensive dental examinations and antibody
      responses to P. gingivalis. We will examine whether these associations are modified by the
      presence of certain genetic risk factors previously implicated in RA and whether evidence of
      infection with P. gingivalis precedes RA onset by examining banked sera from the Department
      of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR) and the Studies of the Etiology of RA (SERA). We also
      plan to explore whether there are novel proteins expressed by P. gingivalis that drive
      autoimmunity in RA and whether immune responses to these bacterial proteins predict the
      future development of RA.
