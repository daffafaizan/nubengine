    
      The following will be assessed at Baseline and at the end of the treatment period;

        1. MRI scanning in order to assess cardiac function and morphology. The MRI scanning will
           be made after fasting for at least 6 hours in the same time of day at all visits. The
           cardiac MRI examination will be performed in accordance with a pre-defined MRI protocol,
           with the total scan time at each visit estimated to 45 minutes. Images from all sites
           will be analyzed centrally at the core-lab using a dedicated software package and
           certified analysts.

        2. CT-PET scanning will be made to assess myocardial function and metabolism, as well as
           fatty acid metabolism in brain, liver and kidney cortex. The CT-PET scanning will be
           made after a fast as well as abstinence from nicotine, alcohol and caffeine for at least
           6 hours at the same time of day at all visits.

             -  A cardiac 11C-Acetate PET/CT examination is performed (IV 400 MBq 11C-Acetate).

             -  A cardiac 18F-FTHA PET/CT examination is performed (IV 150 MBq 18F-FTHA). The
                subject is further examined by PET/CT over the liver, kidney cortex and brain (in
                this order) for uptake of 18F-FTHA. Arterialized venous samples are acquired
                throughout to assess P-NEFA and 18F-FTHA metabolism by metabolite analysis
