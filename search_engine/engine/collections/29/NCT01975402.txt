      technology and related end-to-end remote monitoring system to be used outside usual medical
      care environments to reduce hospital readmissions and facilitate independent living for heart
      failure patients. An important component of our overall strategy for continued development
      and refinement of the remote monitoring system is the incorporation of iterative behavioral
      evaluations to facilitate assessment and refinement in order to optimize adherence,
      utilization, and usability for patients as well as efficiency and functionality for
      providers.
