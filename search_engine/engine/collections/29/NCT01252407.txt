      to tissues. In recent years there has been an increased prevalence of heart failure (HF), in
      Brazil there are about two million people diagnosed with HF and 240,000 new cases per year.
      Thus, the IC constitutes the most serious problem now and in the fields of cardiology and
      public health. Sympathetic activity is increased and correlates with a worse prognosis and
      survival in these patients. Currently, the pharmacological blockade of the sympathetic system
      by chronic use of beta-blockers are commonly used to treat hyperactivity, but these
      interventions have side effects. The transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has
      been used successfully to control pain in different clinical conditions and may be a
      noninvasive strategy to reduce drug and not the severity of increased sympathetic.
