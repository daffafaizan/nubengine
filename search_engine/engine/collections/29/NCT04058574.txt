    
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common injury in athletes. It has multiple
      consequences on the knee: instability, pain, loss of muscle strength, proprioceptive
      impairments, modification of the knee kinematics and premature knee osteoarthritis. In
      athletes, the majority of these injuries are treated with ACL reconstruction surgery. The
      main objective of this treatment is the reduction of knee instability to allow return to
      sport, and this at the same level prior to the injury. Thus, the athlete's follow-up after
      the surgery is essential to guide the return to sport and to ensure that the knee
      sensorimotor control allows the return to sport. Currently this assessment is based primarily
      on functional testings and measurement of muscle strength.

      The investigators propose to prospectively study the evolution of instrumentally measured
      knee proprioception using isokinetic dynamometer before and after ACL reconstruction as well
      as a study of the factors associated with its favorable evolution and its impact in the
      return to sport and its level.
