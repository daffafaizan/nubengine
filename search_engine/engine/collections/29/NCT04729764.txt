      protein) inhibitor. Its metabolite GP1707D07 can selectively inhibit the cap-dependent
      endonuclease of influenza virus and prevent influenza virus replication. Mechanism of action
      against influenza virus. The results of previous non-clinical studies show that GP681 can
      effectively inhibit influenza virus replication, has good safety, and has antiviral activity
      1,000 times that of oseltamivir phosphate. It also has good antiviral activity against
      oseltamivir resistant strains. And it is expected to have a longer half-life than oseltamivir
      phosphate. Therefore, it is expected that a new type of PA inhibitor can be developed to
      provide patients with influenza with a new mechanism of action, better efficacy, and higher
      compliance.
