      vegan diet as compared to the standard American diet in a randomized, controlled and
      multi-centered workplace setting.

      The 10 months study involves 5 vegan sites and 5 control sites generated through a random
      process after recruitment. The vegan sites will receive low fat vegan diet instructions and
      weekly group sessions starting from the January, 2011. The control sites will also receive
      identical instructions starting from the 5th month and lasting for 18 weeks.

      For each participant at baseline and week 18 a blood test will be conducted, along with blood
      pressure, weight, hip and waist measurements. A questionnaire will also be administered
      during these time points to assess dietary intake, work productivity, quality of life, and
      healthcare utilization. At the end of one year, information about health insurance
      utilization will be obtained from Health Maintenance Organization(HMO) or Preferred Provider
      Organization(PPO) for each participant.
