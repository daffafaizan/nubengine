    
      participants were randomly divided into three groups : group 30 , group 40 and group 50 . for
      all the three groups an ultrasound guided supra-inguinal fascia iliaca block had been
      performed.

      A linear ultrasound probe was placed in the sagittal plane to obtain an image of the superior
      iliac spine.the fascia iliaca and sartorious,iliopsoas,and oblique internal muscles were
      identified by sliding the probe medially. After identifiying the "bow-tie sign"formed by the
      muscle fascias , an 50 mm needle was introduced 1-2 cm inferior to the inguinal
      ligament.using an in-plane approch, the fascia iliaca was penetrated and hydrodissected ,
      separating the fascia iliaca from the iliac muscle. in this created space a total volume of
      30 ml, 40ml or 50ml of 0.2% ropivacaine was injected , respectively to group 30 ,group 40 and
      group 50 .

      pain score at rest and with a straight leg raise of the affected limb to 15 degrees were
      assessed before and 30 minutes after block performance.
