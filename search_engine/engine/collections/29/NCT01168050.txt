    
      NILOMEL is a phase II multicentric uncontrolled open national trial assessing the efficacy of
      Nilotinib in first or second line treatment of primary melanomas , stage III unresectable
      melanomas, or Stage IV melanomas with c-KIT mutation or amplification (in case of c-KIT
      amplification, no B-RAF nor N-Ras mutation should be detected). The primary objective is
      overall response rate (partial and complete response) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria,
      assessed using CT-SCAN (stage IV melanoma) or MRI (unresectable melanoma) after 6 months
      therapy with Nilotinib 800 mg/d. Secondary objectives include:

        -  Disease control rate (complete, partial response and stable disease) according to RECIST

        -  Metabolic response rate (TEP-SCAN)

        -  Tolerance NCI CTCAE Version 3.0

        -  Biomarkers associated to response and disease control (evaluated at M0, M1 and M6).
           Protein analysis of c-KIT, PI3K, MAPK and STAT signalling pathways as well as PDGFR and
           Ephrin signalling pathways.

      Patients with progressive disease after 3 months therapy will be withdrawn. Patient with
      stable disease after 3 months will continue Nilotinib until evaluation at 6 months. Patients
      with stable disease or progressive disease at 6 months will continue Nilotinib until
      progression.

      The trial has been planned using a one-stage design (Fleming TR) . We considered that a
      response rate under 7.5% would define the null hypothesis of no efficacy . To detect a
      response rate of 30% or more with power 90% using a one-sided test at the 0.05 level, 25
      patients have to be recruited.

      Accrual for 2.5 years total study duration: 3 years
