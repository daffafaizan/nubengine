      IV fluid therapy for patients presenting to the ED with migraine headache. Patients will be
      randomly allocated to receive a bolus of 1000 ml normal saline or no fluid bolus. Patients
      and outcome assessors will be blinded to the assigned study group. Research assistants will
      assess pain scores, nausea, and functional disability at time 0 (just prior to starting the
      intervention), 60 minutes, and 120 minutes. Participants will be contacted 48 hours after
      leaving the ED to assess symptom burden following discharge.
