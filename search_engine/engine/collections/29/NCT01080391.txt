    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study comparing two treatment regimens
      for adults with relapsed multiple myeloma. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either the control Rd or CRd. Randomization will be stratified by β2
      microglobulin levels (< vs ≥ 2.5 mg/L), prior bortezomib (no vs yes), and prior lenalidomide
      (no vs yes). Participants will receive the treatment determined by randomization in 28-day
      cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first).
