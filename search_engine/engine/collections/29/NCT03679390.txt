      EEG data recorded from bi-spectral index (BIS) monitor. Under the same anesthesia depth, the
      experimental group use ketamine 0.5mg/kg; while the control group using alfentanil 0.01mg/kg
      injection. Both perioperative data were recorded included heart rate, blood pressure and
      surgical time. We decompose the raw EEG data from BIS monitor with EMD, and we observe
      difference between IMFs, and quantifying energy change. Second year: We will extend the EEG
      monitor to temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe. Besides the whole brain mapping
      method for detecting energy change after ketamine injection; we also tried to find the
      interactions between oscillations. Finally, we want to apply the analysis method to pediatric
      patients, try to find the difference of ketamine reaction between generations. Anticipated
      Results: We anticipate that we can quantify the energy of EEG by Emperical mode
      decomposition(EMD), and ketamine injection can cause different energy change with other
      sedatives. We will find the energy traveling in EEG with EMD decomposition. We will find that
      HHT is more suitable for EEG analysis in clinical practicing. With the whole brain mapping
      method, we can understand the electrical activity during general anesthesia.
