      In the standard of care group, women will monitor their blood glucose levels four times a
      day, perform fetal movement counting three times a day and also record insulin doses. The
      women will record this information in a logbook, which will be reviewed by the medical team
      at prenatal visits. In the Telemonitoring group, women will receive the standard of care anmd
      will also transmit their blood glucose and fetal movement information to their health care
      providers.
