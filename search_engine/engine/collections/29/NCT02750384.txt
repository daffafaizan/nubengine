    
      This is a randomized, open label, single dose, parallel group study consisting of 3 groups of
      14 subjects each. Subjects will be confined for 3 days followed by outpatient assessments
      until Day 21. Blood samples for assessment of DSM265 plasma concentrations will be collected
      for 480 hours after dosing.

      This study will compare the relative bioavailability of the oral DSM265 50% spray dried
      dispersion (SDD) granules with that of a reference 25% SDD powder for suspension formulation,
      and evaluate the effect of food on the DSM265 50% SDD granules
