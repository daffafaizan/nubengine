      obtained from the University's Institutional Review Board (#2015-51). Participants were
      recruited by flyers posted on the University campus. Informed consent was completed by all
      participants prior to the study procedures. The subjects were obese college students. A total
      of 13 subjects, four males and nine females (mean age of 24.38 ± 3.01 years, mean percent
      body fat of 39.10 ± 6.91 % [male: 41.93 ± 7.47 %, female: 38.16 ± 6.91 %]), were enrolled
      this study. All subjects underwent three different trials which include no taping (NT),
      placebo taping (PT), and Kinesio taping (KT). All individuals were assessed for peak and mean
      power, muscular strength, endurance, and muscle fatigue after each condition.
