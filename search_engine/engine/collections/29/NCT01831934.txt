    
      This pilot clinical study evaluated the safety and metabolic responses to a licensed
      inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV). This study will consist of two cohorts: MELAS
      syndrome volunteers (a specific identified disorder of mitochondrial dysfunction:
      mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) between 13-60 years
      OR adult control volunteers between 18-65 years of age. Both cohorts will receive the same
      treatment: a single vaccination with an FDA-licensed intramuscular seasonal trivalent
      inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV).

      All participants will receive a single administration of a licensed influenza vaccine. Prior
      to vaccination, participants will provide information regarding health history and responses
      to health questionnaires. A blood sample and urine specimen were collected prior to
      vaccination, and at 6 hours, 5-7 days and 26-30 days post-immunization.
