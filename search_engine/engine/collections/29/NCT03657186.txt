      food grade strain, Hafnia alvei 4597. The microbiome is known to play a crucial role in body
      weight management and metabolic disease. ProbioSatys™ mechanism of action relies on bacterial
      metabolites that send local and central signals via the gut-brain axis by molecularly
      mimicking satiety hormones involved in appetite regulation.

      Numerous ProbioSatys™pre-clinical studies indicate that consumption of the strain leads to
      body weight loss based on food intake reduction, but also improvement of body composition
      (increase of lean mass/fat mass ratio), and improvement of glucose metabolism (oral glucose
      tolerance test, and fasted glycemia).

      The present study aims to evaluate the effects of ProbioSatys™ on body weight and related
      parameters in overweight subjects during a 12-week consumption period. In addition,
      tolerability and safety of ProbioSatys™ will be assessed.
