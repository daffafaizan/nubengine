      regarding the present periodontal disease type and severity. Advances in diagnostic research
      are moving towards methods where periodontal risk can be identified and quantified by
      objective measures such as Biomarkers.

      Trefoil factors (TFFs) are one such secreted molecules derived from mucin producing
      epithelial cells of the gastro intestinal tracts and other tissues such as Salivary glands,
      Parotid ducts and oral mucosa. Among three Trefoil factors reported, Trefoil Factor 3 (TFF3)
      is the modifying factor for signalling pathway involved in cell survival, cell proliferation
      and cell migration of oral keratinocytes. Hence assessing the marker levels would achieve
      beneficial effects on diagnosing the disease severity.
