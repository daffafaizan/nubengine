    
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, parallel-arm, double-masked, placebo-controlled
      study. One (1) to 2 days prior to their scheduled cataract surgery, each study subject will
      be randomized (2:1) in to one of two treatment groups:

      Group A: A total of 50 study subjects (50 eyes) will have an N-PPDS inserted in the lower
      punctum of their scheduled surgical eye.

      Group B: A total of 25 study subjects (25 eyes) will have a p-PPDS inserted in the lower
      punctum of their scheduled surgical eye.

      All plugs will remain in the study subject's lower punctum for a period of 2 weeks following
      cataract surgery.
