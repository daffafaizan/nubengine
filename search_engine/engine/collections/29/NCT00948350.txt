      associated with the risk of neurological harm. Therefore the method of choice for anesthesia
      induction is the fiberoptic awake intubation. This method allows to place the ventilation
      tube without movement of the cervical spinal cord. This procedure is very uncomfortable for
      the patient and needs the application of topic and/or systemic anesthetics.

      With this clinical study we will compare two established techniques for local laryngeal
      anesthesia with regard to the quality of technical modalities and postoperative outcome.
