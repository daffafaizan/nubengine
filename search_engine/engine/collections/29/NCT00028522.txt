      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase II dose, and dose-limiting
      toxicity of R(+)XK469 in two different dosing schedules in patients with advanced
      neuroblastoma.

      II. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the tolerance to this
      drug in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug
      and its metabolites in these patients.

      V. Determine, preliminarily, any antineoplastic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      SCHEDULE A: Patients receive R(+)XK469 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and
      5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of R(+)XK469 until the recommended
      phase II dose or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, additional patients are accrued and treated at the recommended phase II dose (for
      a maximum of 20 patients treated at that dose).

      SCHEDULE B: Once the recommended phase II dose is determined on schedule A, additional
      patients are accrued and receive escalating doses of R(+)XK469 IV over 30-60 minutes on day
      1, beginning at a reduced dose. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose escalation continues as in Schedule A.
