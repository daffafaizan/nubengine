      assigned into Group A which were treated with Diode laser cyclophotocoagulation alone,
      whereas group B received intravitreal Avastin (One milligram = 0.04mL of 25 mg/mL) in
      conjunction with the Diode Laser. The preoperative data included etiology, mean age; follow
      up period, and a full ophthalmological examination with emphasis on mean IOP, iris
      neovascularization, pain and corneal edema.
