        -  Buccal smear (cheek cells) or small blood sample (4 mL or 1 teaspoon) from child being
           seen in the Dermatology clinic having infantile hemangioma or vascular anomaly

        -  Buccal smear (cheek cells) or small blood sample (4 mL or 1 teaspoon) from parents of
           child

      If you and your child agree to be in this study, the following will happen:

        1. Informed consent and permission to use or disclose your/your child's health information
           for research purposes will be obtained by Dr. Drolet, the principal investigator, or her
           research team. You will receive a copy of this consent form.

        2. A buccal swab or blood sample will be obtained from you and your child; buccal sampling
           involves rubbing the inside of your cheek and removing cells to perform a genetic test
           called "Genomewide Association (GWA).

      We expect you and your child to be involved in this study until you and your child have the
      genetic testing performed.
