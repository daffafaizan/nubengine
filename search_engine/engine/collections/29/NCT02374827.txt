      undergo tubal ligation at the time of their scheduled cesarean delivery (primary or repeat)
      will be approached about the study. Patients will be randomized to receive either the
      standard tubal ligation practice at our institution (modified Pomeroy procedure or Parkland)
      or a complete salpingectomy. The objective of this trial is to evaluate if a complete
      salpingectomy can be performed safely and comparable to a standard postpartum tubal ligation.
