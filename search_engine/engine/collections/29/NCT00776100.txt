      Primary

        -  To assess whether the addition of radiotherapy to radiographically apparent residual
           disease after an initial course of standard chemotherapy results in an improvement in
           overall survival of patients with oligometastatic stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with radiotherapy vs
           observation after standard chemotherapy.

        -  To compare the time to disease progression and time to treatment failure in these
           patients.

        -  To compare the confirmed response rate in these patients.

        -  To compare the duration of response in these patients.

        -  To compare the adverse events in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior treatment
      with bevacizumab during first-line chemotherapy (yes vs no), number of standard chemotherapy
      courses (2-3 vs 4-6), Linear Analog Self Assessment value (â‰¤ 7 vs > 7), and histology
      (predominantly squamous cell vs not predominantly squamous cell). Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo observation for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks to all sites of gross
           disease.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.
