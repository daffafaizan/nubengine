      group of 30 patients, who had been transfused autologous blood and a control group of 30
      patients who had been transfused only allogeneic blood. Parenteral iron preparation was given
      to all patients of the study group after each donation. Intraoperatively all patients of the
      study group received 2 g of intravenous TXA.

      This study was conducted through laboratory analysis of hemoglobin and hematocrit values
      during blood donation and for both groups in the preoperative and the postoperative period
      and the assessment of the amount of transfused blood units in both groups.
