      department of cardiology with suspected pulmonary embolism and controls with same age (within
      a range of 10 years) and gender from the outpatient clinic awaiting elective cardiovascular
      surgery. The main-outcome (i.e. means of the relative amounts of specific proteins in the EBC
      samples) will be compared by unpaired t-tests after assessment of normality and standard
      deviations within the three groups (PE confirmed, PE suspected but not confirmed and
      controls). Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity will be calculated for relevant proteins.
      The results from analysis of EBC samples from the patients and controls will be compared with
      results from the porcine model in order to confirm and reduce the number of putative
      biomarkers for PE. Blood samples (i.e. excess plasma from routine blood samples drawn as a
      part of routine diagnostic work-up) from the study participants will be stored for
      standardization of the putative markers and verification and supplementing analysis of the
      EBC markers. In order to qualify the most suitable markers and substrates for
      standardization, the analysis of the EBC samples must be completed before the blood samples
      can be analyzed. Only biochemical, no genetic analysis will be conducted.
