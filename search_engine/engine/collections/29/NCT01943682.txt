    
      Cytarabine in combination with an anthracycline is a frequently used chemotherapy platform
      for both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other
      hematologic malignancies. Synergistic antitumor activity has been demonstrated between
      cytarabine and daunorubicin that is dependent upon the ratio of the drugs with the best
      therapeutic effect observed with a cytarabine to daunorubicin ratio of 5:1 in in vitro and in
      vivo models. CPX-351 is a liposomal preparation of cytarabine and daunorubicin that maintains
      this therapeutic drug ratio 24 hours post infusion. The altered biodistribution from
      encapsulation may result in a greater therapeutic effect in patients with relapsed
      hematologic malignancies and demonstrate greater tolerability than non-liposomal cytarabine
      and daunorubicin.

      This is a single institution phase-I pilot study that aims to assess the pharmacokinetics,
      toxicity and tolerability of CPX-351 in pediatric and young adults with relapsed/refractory
      hematologic malignancies. Subjects will receive a single course of CPX-351 administered on
      Days 1, 3, and 5. The study will first open to children in a dose exploration phase, and then
      be available to an expanded cohort, which will be open to children and young adults once a
      tolerable dose has been determined.
