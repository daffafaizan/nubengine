      are limited by reperfusion injury. In animal models, nicorandil, a hybrid of an ATP-sensitive
      K+ (KATP) channel opener and nitrates, reduces infarct size, so the Japan-Working groups of
      acute myocardial Infarction for the reduction of Necrotic Damage by a K-ATP channel opener
      (J-WIND-KATP) designed a prospective, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate whether
      nicorandil reduces myocardial infarct size and improves regional wall motion when used as an
      adjunctive therapy for AMI.

      Twenty-six hospitals in Japan are participating in the J-WIND-KATP study. Patients with AMI
      who are candidates for PCI are randomly allocated to receive either intravenous nicorandil or
      placebo. The primary end-points are (1) estimated infarct size and (2) left ventricular
      function. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be associated with the function of
      KATP-channel and the susceptibility of AMI to the drug will be examined. Furthermore, a data
      mining method will be used to design the optimal combined therapy for post-myocardial
      infarction (MI) patients.

      It is intended that J-WIND-KATP will provide important data on the effects of nicorandil as
      an adjunct to PCI for AMI and that the SNPs information that will open the field of
      tailor-made therapy. The optimal therapeutic drug combination will also be determined for
      post-MI patients.
