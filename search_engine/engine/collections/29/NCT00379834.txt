      glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). IOP is a dynamic variable (like blood
      pressure)-it changes over time. The more it changes, the more likely patients are to get
      worse. Glaucoma is treated by lowering IOP. Cosopt is a medication that lowers IOP. Little is
      known about how well Cosopt reduces IOP fluctuations. In this study, we plan to measure the
      IOP in both eyes of 10 glaucoma patients treated with Cosopt, every 2 hours from 8am to 8pm,
      on five separate days over a one-year period. Untreated baseline IOP will be measured on a
      similar long day before beginning treatment with Cosopt. This methodology will allow us to
      compare IOP fluctuations with and without Cosopt, and also to learn about long-term control
      of IOP fluctuations in eyes treated with Cosopt.
