      order to compute the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) which has been shown to measure the
      relative parasympathetic tone, and hence to reflect the analgesia/nociception balance during
      general anesthesia. The primary endpoint of this randomized multicenter study is to measure
      whether there is a benefit to use the ANI in order to adapt remifentanil administration
      during propofol anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery. Primary endpoint is: lesser proportion
      of patients presenting with at least one episode of hemodynamic reactivity, hypotension or
      bradycardia in the ANI guided group vs control group ?
