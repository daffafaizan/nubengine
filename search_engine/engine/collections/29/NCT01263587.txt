        -  Primary Aim:

           o To describe participants with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a prospective
           cohort in the United States (US) and Canada and identify predictors of disease
           activation and progression

        -  Secondary Aims:

             -  To describe clinical, virological, and immunological characteristics of
                participants with HBV in the US and Canada

             -  To evaluate changes in HBV infection status and quantitative hepatitis B surface
                antigen (HBsAg) levels and factors associated with those changes

             -  To verify whether a baseline HBsAg below 1,000 IU/mL and HBV DNA below 1,000 IU/mL
                is an accurate predictor of people who are, or who will become, inactive carriers,
                defined as people who are HBsAg positive, hepatitis B "e" antigen (HBeAg) negative,
                have normal Alanine transaminase (ALT) and HBV DNA under 1,000 IU/mL on at least
                two occasions over a period of at least 6 months

             -  To develop a bank of biospecimens (e.g., serum, plasma, DNA, lymphocytes, liver
                tissue) obtained from participants with HBV infection

             -  To identify participants with HBV infection who are potential candidates in one of
                the treatment studies to be conducted by the Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN)

             -  To describe the natural history of hepatitis B infection in pregnancy including the
                frequency of, and clinical and virological characteristics associated with, hepatic
                flares during pregnancy and post-partum.
