      out, involving patients with traumatic brachial plexus injury, submitted to sessions of ETCC
      and mirror therapy. Participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: the first will
      receive active ETCC associated with TE and the second will receive simulated ETCC in
      conjunction with TE. The study will consist of 12 sessions, conducted over a period of 1
      month, with 3 sessions weekly on consecutive days, where each patient will receive ETCC for
      30 minutes concomitantly with ET. Assessments will be performed before the beginning of the
      protocol (baseline) and immediately after the end of the 12 sessions. The TCT-Research
      device, developed by Trans Cranial Technologies Ltda for ETCC and a rectangular platform with
      the dimensions of 40x70 cm, with a mirror sagittally coupled to the TE will be used. To
      assess the outcomes, EVA, McGill's Questionnaire, BPI, BDI, IDATE, SF-36 and CIF will be
      applied. For all analyzes, the statistical software SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago IL, USA) for
      Windows, version 20.0, will be used and considered significant, an alpha value of 5% (p
      <0.05).
