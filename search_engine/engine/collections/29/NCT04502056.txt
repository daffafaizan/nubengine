      Americans and Latinx people in the United States. Moreover, since our last experiment, the
      killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police has raised awareness of structural racism in the
      United States.

      The aim of the study is to build off results from our first experiment (NCT04371419) , and
      test whether messages that acknowledge racial injustice on behalf of institutions affect the
      retention of knowledge and movement of beliefs and behavior with respect to Covid-19. The
      investigators will also test the effect of concordance of providers and whether highlighting
      the unequal burden of the disease has additional effects on knowledge, beliefs and behavior
      regarding covid-19.The sample will include African American and white adult Americans and
      oversample those with less than a college degree.
