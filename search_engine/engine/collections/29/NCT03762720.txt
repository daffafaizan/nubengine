      , will receive five sessions of physium therapy at 80 millibars during one month.

      The measurements of the variables visual analog scale, joint mobility through the double
      inclinometer device, elasticity and tissue vascularization through the ultrasound, quality of
      life through SF-12 questionnaire and pressure algometry will be made before, after, month and
