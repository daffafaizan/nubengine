      balanced salt solution (BSS) filled in 11 patients during three-months observation,or
      silicone oil filled in 4 patients during a six-month observation respectively, can be
      transplanted into the vitreous body easily, and performances good safety and efficacy in the
      treatment of severe retinal detachment.

      Current multi-center clinical trial was to determine the feasibility, primary safety and
      efficacy of FCVB with silicone oil filled in the treatment of retinal detachment in 120
      patients.
