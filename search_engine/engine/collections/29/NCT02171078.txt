    
      Our project involves three primary goals:

        1. Use existing data from clinical trials sponsored by one of the leading cancer
           cooperative groups to evaluate how risk of recurrence and side effects of treatment vary
           based on patient and cancer characteristics.

        2. Use existing data to evaluate the effectiveness of the latest imaging technology for
           improving survival in patients previously treated for breast cancer.

        3. Engage cancer survivors, providers, and health outcomes researchers in the development
           of an improved patient-centered approach to guide post-treatment care, as well as
           identification of the highest priority strategies for prospective randomized trials.

      Methods Our methods have been developed based on input from patients and other stakeholders
      who identified the need for a large-scale observational study. The goal is to produce timely
      results, and guide the development of an improved approach to surveillance that recognizes
      individual patient risk factors and allows for design of future prospective studies. This
      study analyzes recurrence data and treatment side effects on over 22,000 patients involved in
      past clinical trials on breast cancer care. The project also involves the analysis of
      existing data (n=15,000 patients) from a national cancer registry (National Cancer Database)
      to evaluate whether new imaging technology, beyond mammography, are able to detect recurrence
      earlier and improve survival. Finally, we will engage cancer survivors, health care
      providers, and researchers to develop new guidance for the care and monitoring of breast
      cancer survivors, and to guide and prioritize future prospective trials.
