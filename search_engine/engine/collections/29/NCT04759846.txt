    
      This is an open label, multicentre, phase I study to evaluate the impact of moderate and
      severe hepatic impairment (HI) on the pharmacokinetics and safety of encorafenib in
      combination with binimetinib, in adult patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF
      V600-mutant melanoma.

      For each participant, the treatment period will be split in 2 phases:

        -  a HI assessment phase assessing the impact of hepatic impairment after a single dose
           (Day 1) and after repeated doses (Day 15).

        -  a post-HI assessment phase: after completing the HI assessment phase, participants may
           continue treatment in the post-HI assessment phase until disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Participants with hepatic impairment will be enrolled sequentially according to their
      severity. The study will start first in participants with normal hepatic function and
      moderate hepatic impairment respectively.

      Participants will be assigned to one of the following 3 study groups:

        -  Group with normal hepatic function: 4 participants

        -  Group with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B): 4 participants

        -  Group with severe impairment (Child-Pugh Class C): 4 participants

      An Internal Review Committee (IRC) will review the safety and PK data of encorafenib in
      combination with binimetinib for group with normal hepatic function and group with moderate
      hepatic impairment and make a recommendation prior to start group with severe impairment
      enrolment. The Sponsor will determine whether it is safe and feasible to proceed with group
      with severe impairment.

      Participants will receive treatment doses according to their assigned group.
