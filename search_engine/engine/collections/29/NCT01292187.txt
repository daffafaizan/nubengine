      the US. The subjects were all post-menopausal women whose 10-year risk of major osteoporotic
      fracture was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) Fracture Risk Assessment Tool
      (FRAXÂ®) algorithm within the first 3 visits. Eligible, consenting subjects were then enrolled
      and began a 2- week single-blind placebo run-in phase to determine tolerability. After the
      run-in phase, continuing subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral calcitonin
      or placebo. All subjects took 600 mg calcium citrate and 1000 IU vitamin D once daily with
      breakfast beginning with the run-in phase. The duration of treatment including the run-in
      phase was 54 weeks. Bone mineral density (BMD) and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen
      (CTx-1) were determined at Baseline and Weeks 28 and 54 after randomization. The % change
      from baseline in lumbar spine BMD was calculated and compared: active to placebo. The change
      from baseline in plasma CTx-1 was also calculated and compared likewise.

      To confirm that there is no effect of meal timing on this product, subjects in both arms were
      further randomized to take the active or placebo on an empty stomach at bedtime or with the
      meal at dinnertime.
