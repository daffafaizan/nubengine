      who meet entry criteria will be randomized to treatment with olanzapine plus zonisamide or
      olanzapine plus placebo. All subjects will receive Personal Wellness Solution Counseling

      Subjects will be inpatients or outpatients at the time of randomization to
      olanzapine-zonisamide or olanzapine-placebo. Throughout the study, psychiatric scales will be
      used to assess psychiatric symptoms, and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse events
      will be monitored and recorded.
