      group underwent a 6-hour face-to-face breastfeeding course which was divided in four 1.5-hour
      sessions during a time span of two weeks. The second intervention consisted of downloading a
      digital smartphone application designed by the research team to teach proper breastfeeding
      concepts which participants freely navigated during the same time span of two weeks. Before
      and after each intervention, students answered a general breastfeeding knowledge test
      consisting of twenty multiple choice answers with a score range of 0 to 20. Statistical
      comparisons between pre- and post-test scores were performed in each group and mean change in
      scores was compared between them to establish which method was the most efficient. Moreover,
      amount of time spent on the application was descriptively measured.
