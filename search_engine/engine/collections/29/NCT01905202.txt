      patients frequently receive more than one dose of PPI per day in an attempt to improve
      esophageal pH control. Nocturnal pH control is notably difficult to achieve in many patients
      suffering from Barrett's esophagus. Recently, adverse effects have been associated with
      prolonged PPI use (defined as 1 year or longer). These include hypomagnesemia, bone
      fractures, Clostridium difficile induced diarrhea. High dose PPI as well as very high dose
      PPI usage (such as that used in hypersecretory conditions) has generally not been found to
      produce a different side effect or tolerability profile in humans. This study will evaluate
      the effects of Secretrol on tolerability, adverse effects and pH control of the distal
      esophagus and just below the squamocolumnar junction.
