      asbestos exposure. A history of asbestos exposure can be elicited in more than 80% of
      mesothelioma victims. However, asbestos exposure alone is not sufficient to cause the
      development of mesothelioma. Nearly 27 million individuals in the US, were exposed to
      asbestos in the work place between 1940 and 1979 but just 3,000 new cases of mesothelioma are
      diagnosed each year. Therefore, the investigators hypothesis is that genetic variation in
      addition to asbestos exposure, and host factors contribute to the development of
      mesothelioma. It is estimated, based on the investigators preliminary studies, that a
      population in excess of 1,000 subjects with mesothelioma is required to perform a valid GWAS.

      Therefore a multicenter approach is necessary to collect data and DNA on sufficient numbers
      with mesothelioma to adequately evaluate genetic risk. It is the aim of this proposal to
      develop a consortium of mesothelioma investigators to share phenotypic data and DNA samples
      and to perform genome wide association scanning (GWAS).
