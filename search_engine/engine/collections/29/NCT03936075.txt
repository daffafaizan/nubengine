      complementary, supportive psychosocial therapy in cancer care. However, its effects have
      never been explored during the period of active chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment in
      various cancer populations, and especially gynecologic and breast cancer. This pilot study is
      an effort to explore the feasibility of the method to increase quality of life in this
      population by possibly reducing side-effects of treatment such as fatigue, improving mood,
      and building resilience as expressed through levels of hope.
