      research laboratory of our university. The patients will participate in the study after
      signing an informed consent form prior to data collection.

      Inclusion Criteria Subjects who demonstrate "tight" hamstring muscles, defined as inability
      to extend the knee to less than 20 degrees of knee flexion with the femur held at 90 degrees
      of hip flexion while the person was positioned supine. Subjects will also be screened to rule
      out knee joint flexion contractures by checking knee extension ROM, while they were lying in
      a prone position Exclusion Criteria Using of medical aids, and suffering from any
      neurological or cognitive impairment, limiting cardio-respiratory conditions, or had
      undergone recent surgery (within the past 12 months). Having any hip or knee replacements or
      any history of pathology in the low back, hips, or knees for the 3 months prior to the study

      Participants will be divided into four groups according to the stretching duration time (15,
      30, and 60s, and the fourth group, which served as a control, did not stretch). The patients
      will randomly assigned to one of the four groups as follows. The randomization process will
      be based on permuted blocks of variable sizes. Each random permuted block, created randomly
      by a number generator, will be transferred to a sequence of consecutively numbered, opaque,
      sealed envelopes that will be kept in a locked drawer until needed. Once a subject was
      formally included in the trial, the next envelope in the sequence was opened by the
      researcher in the presence of the subject who would be assigned to a group according to the
      number found in the envelope.
