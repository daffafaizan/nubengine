    
      This is a phase III, randomized, open label, multicenter, controlled trial of niraparib
      versus physician's choice in previously-treated, HER2 negative, germline BRCA
      mutation-positive breast cancer patients. Niraparib is an orally active PARP inhibitor.
      Niraparib (in a 2:1 ratio) will be administered once daily continuously during a 21-day
      cycle. Physician's choice will be administered on a 21-day cycle. Health-related quality of
      life will be measured. The safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of
      adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory
      values.
