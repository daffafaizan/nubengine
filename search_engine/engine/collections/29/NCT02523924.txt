      with metastatic prostate cancer found that PSMA PET/CT identified more sites of disease than
      conventional imaging with CT, MRI and bone scan. In this study we aim to investigate
      18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with an elevated PSA following radical prostatectomy. During
      the course of this study, patients will undergo two 18F-DCPyL PET/CT scans. The first scan
      will take place within 45 days of staging imaging and the second will take place following
      six months of standard of care therapy.
