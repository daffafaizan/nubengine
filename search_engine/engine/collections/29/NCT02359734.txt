      smart pumps. The proposed study will be conducted over three phases for a total of 36 months
      phases. In Year 1, an observational study will be conducted by investigators at ten multiple
      hospital sites. The investigators will prospectively compare the medication, dose, and
      infusion rate on the IV pump with the prescribed medication, doses, and rate in the medical
      record. Preventability with smart pump technology will be retrospectively determined based on
      a rigorous definition of currently available technology. The investigators will also make
      comparisons across sites by overall rate and degree of variability among sites.

      Then, in Year 2, these results will be evaluated, and a consensus process including a
      face-to-face meeting will take place to evaluate the types of events and to develop an
      intervention which will be implemented at multiple sites. After a run-in period, the
      intervention will be tested in Year 3 at the sites, and the data will be analyzed, and the
      investigators will produce a report and a set of recommendations.
