      purple wheat products, i.e. bran-enriched wholegrain purple wheat crackers and bran-enriched
      wholegrain purple wheat granola bars. Crackers are an example of a baked/ processed product.
      The purple wheat granola bars are an example of a food product that requires much less
      intensive preparation and cooking, compared to the crackers. A comparison of bioavailability
      between these two products should provide insights about how different processes and food
      matrix influence anthocyanin bioavailability and metabolism. The study is a crossover
      investigation with 8 men and 8 women who will adhere to a low anthocyanin and low phenolic
      diet for the duration and complete 2 postprandial study visits where, in random order, they
      will consume either the crackers or granola bars. Blood and urine will be collected at
      baseline and postprandially for the analysis of anthocyanins and their metabolites and
      phenolic acids and determination of antioxidant capacity.
