      ever described. Regado is developing REG1 for use in patients suffering from acute coronary
      syndrome who undergo coronary revascularization procedures. These procedures, which include
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), put
      patients at high risk for therapy-related bleeding complications. REG1 is being developed
      initially to increase therapeutic flexibility and improve patient outcomes in coronary
      revascularization procedures.

      REG1 is a two-component system, consisting of an aptamer-based anticoagulant and its matched
      antidote. The REG1 anticoagulant component (RB006) is a single-stranded, nucleic acid
      aptamer. RB006 selectively and potently binds to and inhibits Factor IXa, a protein critical
      to blood coagulation. The antidote component, RB007, is a complementary nucleic acid that
      binds to and neutralizes RB006. The binding of RB007 to RB006 causes the predictable and
      rapid reversal of the RB006 effect and allows the patient's blood to return to normal.
