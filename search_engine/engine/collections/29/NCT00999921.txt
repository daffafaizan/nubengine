      of who are premenopausal women. Established methods of treatment do not yield significant
      results. This is not only a social burden but also entails high economic cost. As such the
      quality of life of these patients is a matter of concern for both the patients and their
      families and to attending physicians. Reported effects of tamoxifen on benign breast disease
      in premenopausal non high risk patients are scarce. Moreover published data has not yet
      revealed association of estrogen receptors in different benign breast lesions.The variability
      of response and its relation with estrogen receptor status is still a field of active
      investigation.
