      alleviate depression, but the placebo control care did not do so.

      Strengths use is indeed associated with elevated levels of life satisfaction and quality of
      life. It is positively related to self-esteem and leads to greater self-esteem over time.
      Moreover, strengths use could help decrease depression in the patients, and has beneficial
      effect on quality of life. There is a model that examined the mechanism of how strengths use
      related to enhanced self-esteem, happiness and life satisfaction. Individuals who use their
      strengths and experience greater levels of life satisfaction is mediated by self-esteem and
      depression.

      Preliminary evidence suggested that character strengths-based intervention has positive
      impact on psychological well-being include improving self-esteem among women with breast
      cancer in Spain. However, there is a worldwide paucity of rigorous trials that have evaluated
      the effectiveness of character strengths-based interventions for breast cancer patients.
