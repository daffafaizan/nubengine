      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy
      in the pre-operative setting.

      II. To assess the rate of pathologic complete response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the correlation between rate of pathologic complete response, overall response
      rate at time of surgery (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 and
      modified RECIST 1.0), duration of response as defined by time to recurrence/recurrence-free
      survival, in addition to overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the predictive value of dynamic changes in fibrosis stage (defined by a
      minimum 1-point improvement in fibrosis stage 0-4 per magnetic resonance elastography [MRE])
      and in IGF-1 blood score.

      II. To measure baseline and longitudinal changes of immune infiltration including
      CD8/regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio and CD68+ density, and fibrosis stage by MRE for up to one
      year.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery during week 12.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
