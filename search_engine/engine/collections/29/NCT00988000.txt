      better selection and arrangement of investigations prior to or synchronous with the first
      face to face consultation, with the potential to reduce the number of visits the patient has
      to make to the hospital.

      Patients will be offered an initial telephone consultation by post and may opt-in or out of
      the study. Those having a telephone consultation would have this booked for a specific time
      and date and the patient would be sent an appropriate information leaflet regarding this.
      After the telephone consultation patients receive a summary of the consultation and details
      of any investigations and appointments booked by the research nurse. Patients who did not
      respond to the initial invitation letter within seven days or who declined to participate
      would be sent a routine appointment. All patients would asked to complete the MISS-21
      questionnaire.
