      and will be adaptively randomized (initially 1:1) to acute, double-blind treatment with
      escitalopram or duloxetine for 11 weeks. Remission status will be determined at week 10.
      Remitting patients (CGI-S ≤2) will resume treatment as usual, which may consist of outpatient
      referral. Non-remitting patients (CGI-S ≥3), will continue into Phase 2 and will be
      randomized to adjunctive clonazepam or pregabalin for 8 weeks. Twenty adults treated with
      escitalopram (or its racemic equivalent, citalopram) or duloxetine for ≥6 weeks (at
      screening) will be enrolled into Phase 2 and will be randomized to receive adjunctive
      clonazepam or pregabalin for 8 weeks.
