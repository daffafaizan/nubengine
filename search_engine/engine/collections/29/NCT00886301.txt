    
      Non invasive assessment of liver fibrosis and liver inflammation and steatosis is clinically
      relevant in patients exposed to non alcoholic fatty liver diseases.

      The aim of the study is to find new clinico-biological and medical imaging parameters
      associated with non alcoholic steatohepatitis in overweight and obese patients.

      Fatty liver and ectopic fat accumulation will be particularly assessed.
