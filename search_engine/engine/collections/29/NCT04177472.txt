      30 years, but has begun to level off in recent years. Children from minority groups may be
      disproportionately affected, such that Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black children have greater
      weight for recumbent length compared to White children. Similarly, socioeconomic status (SES)
      may affect child weight status. Epidemiological evidence indicates that obesity may
      transmitted across multiple generations. Genetics are a factor in determining weight status,
      but parents are largely responsible for regulating children's dietary environments.
      Grandparents increasingly provide care for their grandchildren, yet few studies have examined
      grandparent involvement or the role that grandparents or other significant caregivers play in
      feeding the child.

      The objective of the current study is two-fold: 1) to evaluate the extent to which
      grandmothers and/or other caregivers affect mothers' parenting surrounding feeding their
      infant, beginning when the infant is first introduced to solid foods; and 2) to examine
      whether an intervention aimed at providing both mothers and grandmothers or other important
      caregivers with hands-on training regarding healthy foods and responsive feeding behaviors
      improves mothers' and grandmothers' feeding behaviors and infants' weight trajectories over
      time. The researchers will collect both self-report data on diet, child temperament, mothers
      and other caregivers' mental health, stress and support. Observational assessments will be
      obtained to code co-caregiver behavior and caregiver responsiveness during feeding.
