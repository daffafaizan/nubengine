      disorder with no form of treatment that benefits everyone. One theory about tinnitus is that
      it is caused by altered patterns of synchronous nerve firing in the brains hearing centres.
      It is believed that conditions such as hearing loss lead to changes in how areas of the brain
      responsible for hearing are 'wired up' causing large areas of the brain to fire at the same
      time; this is believed to be a mechanism responsible for the sensation of tinnitus. Research
      suggests that this type of synchronous activity may be interrupted by presenting very
      specific sequences of sounds to the ears over several months. If sound stimulation can be
      used to break up patterns of synchronous activity in the hearing brain, then it is argued
      that it should also be effective in treating tinnitus. The German company ANM have patented a
      very specific algorithm of sound simulation that is delivered via headphones from a
      pocket-sized device. This treatment is currently being marketed by the private healthcare
      sector in Germany and very recently in the UK. The purpose of this study is to independently
      test the effects of this new therapy on tinnitus severity and related brain activity. We will
      gather information using questionnaires and listening tests, and make recording of electrical
      brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG).
