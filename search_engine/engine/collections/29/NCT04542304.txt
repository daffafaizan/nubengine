    
      Participants with chronic kidney disease will undergo two 1-week study periods (diuretic
      versus placebo) separated by 1-2 weeks of washout in a cross-over design. Blood and urine
      samples will be collected at the end of each study period to determine the effect on urine
      output and to assess the kidney clearance and levels of uremic solute. Participants will
      weigh themselves daily and complete quality of life questionnaires.
