      areas with high iodine in drinking water, this study will conduct an epidemiological study on
      600 children living in areas with high water iodine content but the actual iodine content in
      participants' drinking water is not so high, while no supply of iodized salt.

      Meanwhile, in order to get iodine dietary recommended nutrient intake (RNI) values of
      children. The investigators will conduct a iodine balance experiment on children with
      sufficient iodine nutrition. We will randomly select thirty healthy students for a three-day
      iodine balance experiment from the cross-sectional study. The investigators will use the
      regression model to obtain an iodine intake value when children at"zero iodine"balance.
      Combine the study at population and individual level, the investigators will obtain data on
      dietary recommended nutrient intake (RNI) of iodine for Chinese children, to properly guide
      children iodine supplementation to avoid iodine deficiency, which also will provide data for
      the update of Chinese dietary reference intakes of iodine.
