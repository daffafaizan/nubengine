      and Clinic involving two medications for treatment of emotional and behavioral disturbances
      that may accompany dementia. In this study, 112 patients will be enrolled for up to 17 days
      in order to investigate the safety and effectiveness of both medications. Forty-two of these
      patients will be given a recently FDA-approved antidepressant medication called citalopram
      and 42 will receive one of our current, usual antipsychotic medications called perphenazine.
      An additional 28 patients will be given non-active placebo capsules. Which treatment a
      patient is given during the study will be determined by chance. Findings from this
      investigation may directly lead to the improvement of symptoms such as: agitation, hostility,
      suspiciousness, hallucinations, and unusual thoughts. Improved treatment of problematic
      behaviors and a decrease in medication-associated side effects would enable dementia patients
      to be cared for in their home environments for longer periods of time.
