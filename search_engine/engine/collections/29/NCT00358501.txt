    
      This is a historically-controlled, multicenter, open label Phase 3 study to determine the
      safety and efficacy of 25 mg/kg/day of Defibrotide (DF) for the treatment of severe VOD in
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients.

      In this study, the term "severe VOD" is defined as those patients who meet the Baltimore
      diagnostic criteria for VOD (total bilirubin >/= 2.0 mg/dL plus two of the following:
      ascites, >/=5% weight gain and hepatomegaly), who also have multi-organ failure (i.e.,
      pulmonary and/or renal dysfunction). This represents a group of patients in whom mortality at
      Day+100 has been estimated to be >80%.

      Comparisons: The primary parameter is Complete Response at 100 days following stem cell
      transplant, utilizing historical controls as a comparator. The historical control database
      will be generated through a retrospective medical chart review performed at participating
      centers; the survival outcome of patients who would otherwise have met eligibility criteria
      for this trial will be compared to the survival observed in patients prospectively treated
      with Defibrotide. Secondary parameters include survival rate at 100 days and 6 months post
      stem cell transplantation (SCT), and special studies of endothelial and serum markers for
      VOD. This study will assess safety of the dose and schedule in this setting.
