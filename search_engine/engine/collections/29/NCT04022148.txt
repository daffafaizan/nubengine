      than 26) across the globe. In contrast, limited evidence are available for the efficacy of
      the quadrivalent HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine in adult women (Aged 27+). Most importantly, evidence
      for Japanese adult women is not available to date. Nevertheless, , we hypothesize that the
      quadrivalent HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine demonstrate the efficacy also in Japanese adult women. The
      outcome from this trial will be the first local evidence, which brings a considerable impact
      in OB/GY academia where local evidence is weighed heavily compared with global evidence -
      serves as a strong basis to support catch up program of HPV vaccines for young adults. As a
      consequence, we believe this study will develop a local supportive evidence for prevention of
      HPV infection by an HPV vaccine in young adults, which results in substantial public health
      improvement through prevention of HPV infection in Japan where active recommendation is
      halted long time.
