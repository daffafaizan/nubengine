    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the
      United States, and is exacerbated by exposure to air pollution. Knowledge about whether air
      purification affects the health of those with eosinophilic COPD (approximately 40% of all
      COPD patients seeking care), who generally have more active airway inflammation. If found to
      be beneficial, home air purification may offer a non-pharmacologic intervention for a large
      proportion of people with this common and serious disease.

      This study will evaluate whether home air purification affects lung function, respiratory
      symptoms, nasal biomarkers (inflammatory proteins and metals) among people with eosinophilic
      COPD. Participants will be randomized to receive real or sham air purifier in the bedroom and
      living room for 12 months. The intervention group will receive two high efficiency
      particulate air (HEPA) air purifiers, while the control group will receive two sham air
      purifiers that look and sound the same as real HEPA air purifiers.
