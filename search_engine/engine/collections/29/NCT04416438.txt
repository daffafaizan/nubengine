    
      It is a descriptive, prospective epidemiological study using retrospective patient data,
      multicenter, non-interventional, carried out in FIM (French Intergroup of Myeloproliferative
      syndromes) / FILO (French Innovative Leukemia Organization) centers.

      This is an exploratory descriptive study in order to put in place as soon as possible a
      possible strategy for the protection of patients most at risk.

      The study will include all consecutive patients with MNP according to the WHO (World Health
      Organization) classification seen in consultation or teleconsultation over the duration of
      the study, whether or not they have had a COVID-19 infection.

      The collection of clinical data, treatment regimens and survival and death data will be
      carried out by the investigator or a member of his medical team, after delivering an
      information note to the patient informing him of the computerized processing of his data,
      subject to the patient's non-objection.

      The diagnosis of asymptomatic COVID 19 will be made on the presence of a positive serology
      and on the absence of clinical signs on questioning.

      The presence of a symptomatic COVID 19 infection will be posed on the presence of clinical
      signs +/- CT as identified by the practitioner who treated the patient and confirmed or not
      by a positive PCR and / or a positive serology.
