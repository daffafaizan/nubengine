      retroperitoneal surgeries, while there is minimal evidence regarding this method in
      laparoscopic gynecological procedures.The advantage of improving surgical conditions with a
      deep neuromuscular blockade in laparoscopic surgery may however lead to a delayed
      neuromuscular recovery and hence a delay in turnover of patients.

      Rocuronium will be used for muscle relaxation in order to achieve the necessary depth of
      neuromuscular blockade. Sugammadex is a modified cyclodextrin that forms complexes with
      rocuronium, reducing free plasma concentrations of rocuronium and reversing its neuromuscular
      blocking action from any depth.

      The use of rocuronium will therefore aid in achieving a deep neuromuscular blockade which the
      investigators postulate will improve surgical conditions and the reversal with sugammadex
      will ensure a rapid recovery thereafter.
