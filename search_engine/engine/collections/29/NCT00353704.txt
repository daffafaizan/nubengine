      sensitization are playing an important role and this can lead to postoperative
      hypersensitization. Several studies have shown, that gabapentin can be effective to reduce
      sensitization and postoperative pain. Pregabalin (S-aminomethyl-5-methylhexaninacid) is a
      further development of gabapentin. Pregabalin has a fewer side-effects compared with
      gabapentin.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the analgetic and anxiolytic effect of pregabalin and
      placebo used as premedication.

      The hypothesis is that a single-dose pregabalin (150 mg postoperatively (p.o.)) gives
      significant better anxiolysis and analgesia than placebo.

      The study is including patients undergoing surgery of the vertebral columna.
