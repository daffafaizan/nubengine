      relatively common occurrence, estimated at a rate of 13 episodes per 100,000 people per year,
      mostly men, and usually attributed to swallowed meat. The current standard of care for
      patients presenting to an Emergency Department with this problem includes a trial of
      medication, usually glucagon but sometimes a carbonated beverage, an injection of
      nitroglycerin, or benzodiazepines. The medical interventions mentioned above have not been
      shown to be significantly effective and have unwanted side effects; glucagon is known to
      cause nausea and vomiting and benzodiazepines can cause sedation and depressed breathing. If
      the medication fails to relieve the problem, the patient may require a procedure called
      endoscopy, where a video scope and retrieval tool are inserted into the esophagus to remove
      the piece of food. There is significant risk associated with endoscopy, including the risks
      of anesthesia as well as with the physical procedure itself. Endoscopy also results in a
      prolonged hospital stay due to the time required for the procedure, as well as from
      anesthesia recovery. The ideal treatment would be a safe, inexpensive, quickly effective
      medication without significant side effects that could be administered without sedation or
      extensive monitoring. Oral nitroglycerin solution might just be that intervention.
