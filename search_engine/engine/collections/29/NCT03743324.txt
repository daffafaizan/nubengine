      breast cancer management. However, in the context of breast reconstruction, radiation can
      have adverse effect as it increases the rate of fat necrosis and leads to fibrosis/ capsular
      contracture in the reconstructed breast mounds. It is therefore necessary to investigate the
      best timing for breast reconstruction, especially in those patients which post-operative
      radiation is required, which does not interfere with overall breast cancer treatment while
      produces the best surgical, aesthetic and psychological outcome. Most studies in this field
      are retrospective, and studies on Chinese cohort are also rare. This multi-center
      prospectively designed clinical trial will include several medical centers across China. The
      investigators will allocate the patients into three arms based on the status and sequence of
      radiation and breast reconstruction, and will further stratify the groups based on the
      different approaches of reconstruction (autologous/ prosthetic based). Both objective and
      subjective (patient oriented) methods will be employed to make evaluations involving
      surgical, aesthetic, and psychological outcomes.
