      approximately 400 of these undergo surgery. Many patients report that life after lung cancer
      surgery is difficult. After surgery, the patients are frequently transferred to a local
      hospital or to another level of care at the hospital where they were operated. The transfer
      is critical for patients' safety because communication failure is one of the most common
      causes of medical error.

      Studies that have analyzed the quality of life of lung cancer patients after surgery reach
      different conclusions about the patients' Quality of life (QOL), some studies state that lung
      cancer patients are back to normal quality of life after 9 months, while others indicate that
      the patients still have reduced QOL two years after surgery. It is difficult to assess the
      reason for the differences in results as most of the studies used the same QOL questionnaire.
      Studies that have evaluated the social support that lung cancer patients receive indicate
      that lung cancer patients receive less support than other cancer patients.

      Lung cancer patients have a wide range of physical problems (fatigue, dyspnea, coughing and
      pain) and psychological (depression) problems following surgery.

      Based on findings from this literature review a need exist for improved postoperative
      follow-up of patients after surgery for lung cancer The proposed study will evaluate the
      social support, the levels of lung cancer stigma, symptoms and changes in this over time as
      well as evaluate patient experience with transfer in the immediate postoperative period.
