      were anaesthetised with intravenous induction agent, non-depolarising muscle relaxant and
      then SGAs were inserted. Two groups were compared. In group I : I-gel was inserted, its
      position was confirmed and then ventilating bougie was inserted through it. It's position was
      confirmed, then I-gel was removed , Endotracheal tube was railroaded over ventilating bougie
      and it's position was confirmed. In group C : C-LMA was inserted, its position was confirmed
      and then ventilating bougie was inserted through it. It's position was confirmed, then C-LMA
      was removed , Endotracheal tube was railroaded over ventilating bougie and it's position was
      confirmed.
