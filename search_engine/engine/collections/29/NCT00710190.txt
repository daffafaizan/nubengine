      Therapy(TM) in patients with refractory hypertension despite full pharmacologic therapy.
      Enrolled patients will be carefully assessed prior to receiving a permanently implanted Rheos
      System. Once the system is implanted, these patients will be followed closely for 1 month to
      establish baseline information. The Rheos System will be programmed "ON" at the 1 month
      follow-up and incrementally increased at 2 and 3-month follow-up evaluations. An assessment
      of safety and efficacy will be made at the 4-month follow-up. Enrolled patients will be
      followed annually thereafter.
