      during which patients had the option of listening to music in cases of agitation. This was
      compared to the number of medications needed for agitation during another 3 month period
      during which music was not available. The medications used were quantified using pharmacy
      records. Patients and nurses were surveyed to determine how effective and feasible they
      thought the music intervention was. The study was conducted at the SUNY Upstate University
      Hospital inpatient psychiatric unit, which is a 24-bed unit. 172 patients were included in
      the project.

      Before starting to offer music, a basic training meeting was held with nursing staff to
      understand the purpose of the project. Patients participating had the option of selecting a
      preferred musical genre and they listened to music using wireless headphones. The playlists
      used were genre playlists automatically generated by Spotify music application. If patients
      did not like the song that was generated, they had an option to skip the song using their
      bluetooth headphone controls. Headphones were collected after 30 minutes of listening unless
      they were return prior to completion of the listening session.
