      treatment (EBRT) or to a cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT). Randomization will be
      stratified by the presence of substance dependence disorder. Both treatment conditions will
      consist of 12 one-hour weekly outpatient individual sessions. Participants will be assessed
      at baseline, end of treatment, and 3-months, 6-months and 12-months follow-up.
