      ultrasound stimulation (TUS) for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a secondary
      aim, the investigators will explore whether the TUS is associated with improvement in
      cognitive functioning six and forty-six weeks following the intervention.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups which with or without
      the TUS administration.

      The investigators will study up to 20 subjects with mild AD. Initially, subjects will undergo
      a screening assessment with a study physician to determine medical and psychiatric history,
      establish AD diagnosis, and undergo a bold draw. Subjects that meet criteria and agree to
      participate in the study will undergo a follow-up visit. In the baseline measurement visit,
      participants will first undergo neuropsychological testing. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups. Participants will then be administrated TUS treatment for six
      weeks. Subsequently, participants will undergo a series of neuropsychological test. A final
      follow-up assessment will be administered at forty-six weeks.
