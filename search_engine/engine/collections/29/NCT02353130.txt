    
      Youth with ASD ages 8-12 years will undergo cortical metrics testing (testing of ability to
      discriminate the vibration of small brushes on the tops of the hand under various conditions)
      prior to treatment with memantine XR. They will then be treated with memantine XR target dose
      of 14milligrams daily for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, cortical metrics testing will be
      repeated. Within-subject changes in the cortical metrics testing between baseline and
      endpoint will be examined and described. Potential relationships between changes in clinical
      rating scales and cortical metrics will be examined. Data will be utilized to inform a
      decision about continuing to explore the utility of cortical metrics to detect changes in
      brain function in youth with ASD in response to therapeutic interventions.
