    
      Patients with mCRPC will receive enzalutamide and AZD5363 (or enzalutamide and placebo in the
      randomised phase II) until confirmed disease progression.

      The trial aims to identify the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide and AZD5363 and
      identify recommended phase II dose of AZD5363 (phase I safety run-in). The randomised phase
      II will estimate and compare the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 and enzalutamide, and
      placebo and enzalutamide as measured by response. The single stage phase II expansion cohort
      will estimate the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 and enzalutamide in patients who have
      previously progressed on enzalutamide alone.
