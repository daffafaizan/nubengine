      population. The highest incidence is seen in sports involving running and jumping.

      As the primary treatment eccentric exercises is recommended and 60-90% will benefit by that.
      Other studies have shown equal effect of stretching exercises. In a new study heavy slow
      resistance exercises has proven effective in achilles tendinopathy and the best treatment in
      lig.patellae tendinopathy.

      Injection with glucocorticosteroid is often used in the daily clinic, though inflammation is
      rarely found. Fredberg 2004 found a good short term effect of glucocorticosteroid injection
      in an RCT, but no effect in the long term, which the investigators explained by an aggressive
      rehabilitation with running after a few days. Even though 60-90% will benefit from exercises
      in efficacy studies, a recent pragmatic effectiveness study by Weetke 2015 found that only
      26% did benefit from training alone, but if supplemented by need with 1-3 injections of
      glucocorticosteroid 76% achieved excellent or good result.

      To our knowledge no randomized clinical trials have investigated the combined effect of
      training and injections. The hypothesis of this study is, that training and slowly
      progressive rehabilitation combined with glucocorticosteroid injections will have better
      effect than the same training and rehabilitation combined with injections of local
      anesthetic.
