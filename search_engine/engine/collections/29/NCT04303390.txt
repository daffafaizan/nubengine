    
      A prospective randomized controlled patient blinded study with 2x2 factional design. It aims
      to study optimal duration of antibiotic to reduce surgical site infections following cardiac
      surgery in adults 24 or 48 hours using 1st generation cephalosporin (Cefazolin) or 2nd
      generation cephalosporin (Cefuroxime). Patients shall remain on either medicines for 24 or 48
      hours. The primary endpoints of the study are:(1) 48 hours antibiotic prophylaxis is superior
      to 24 hours in adult cardiac surgery (2) Cefuroxime is superior to Cafazolin as a
      prophylactic antibiotic in adult cardiac surgery. Secondary endpoints include; organisms
      causing surgical site infections, length of hospital and ICU stay, and worsening in renal
      function.
