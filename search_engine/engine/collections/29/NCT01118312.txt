      (ALA-ACRC) network have identified rhinitis and/or sinusitis as a significant co-morbidity in
      people with asthma that affects asthma symptoms and control. The objective of this clinical
      trial is to determine if treatment of chronic rhinitis and/or sinusitis with nasal steroids
      improves control of asthma in children and adults. Although chronic rhinitis and/or sinusitis
      have been associated with poor asthma control and increased health care utilization, the
      effect of treating these diseases on asthma control is not known. This will be a six-month
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial enrolling 380 participants, 190 children
      and 190 adults, with poorly controlled asthma and chronic rhinitis/sinusitis. Participants
      will be randomized to receive nasal steroid or a matching placebo in addition to their
      regular asthma treatments. The primary objective of the trial will be to evaluate whether the
      addition of treatment with nasal steroids improves asthma control. We will perform allergy
      skin testing on all participants and keep a record of pollen counts at all centers, to
      determine if allergy is an important factor in the response to nasal steroid in participants.
