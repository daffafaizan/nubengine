      Randomly subdivided in 3 groups. The Study Group (SG n=30) receive a LLLT by the B-cure
      Dental Pro 808nm diode low level laser (Biocare Enterprise Ltd, Good Energies, Haifa, IL).
      The therapeutic protocol previews 2 applications a day for 7 consecutive days performed at 5
      Joules/min, 250 milliWatts and 15 KiloHertz for 8', (40 Joules total each) in contact mode
      over the painful area.

      The first application is performed at the Department of Oral Sciences of Sapienza University
      of Rome, by a laser expert blinded examiner and serves as instruction. The remnants
      applications must be performed at home by the patients themselves.

      The Placebo Group (PG n=30) follows the same protocol by a sham device, seemingly identical
      to the effective ones, including the pointer light, but devoid of the main diode source.

      The Drug Control Group (DG n=30) follows the conventional drug treatment for TMJDs related
      pain, 2 non-consecutive cycles of 5 days of nimesulide (100mg a day), interspersed with one 5
      days cycle of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (10 mg a day) Two pain evaluation are registered,
      before and after treatment.
