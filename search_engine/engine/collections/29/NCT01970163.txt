    
      This study is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of DermACELL in the treatment of
      chronic wounds of the lower extremities. DermACELL will be compared to conventional care in
      both subjects with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and subjects with venous stasis ulcers (VSU).
      In addition, DermACELL will be compared to an active comparator, GraftJacket, in subjects
      with diabetic foot ulcers.

      DermACELL and GraftJacket are both made from donated human skin (dermis). These products have
      been processed so that cells are removed and bacteria and viruses are destroyed. This
      processing provided a supporting structure, an acellular dermal matrix, into which cells can
      migrate and divide during the wound healing process.
