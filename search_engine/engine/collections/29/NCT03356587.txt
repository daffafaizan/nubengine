    
      This study will be conducted as a treatment arm 4 of the umbrella clinical
      trial.(NCT03292250)

      During or after palliative 1st line platinum based chemotherapy, we will perform prescreening
      NGS based molecular characterization. The molecular characterization will be done by
      following three methods.

        -  NGS : Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment (245 genes)

        -  Nanostring nCounter including immune signature

        -  IHC : PD-L1

      The present trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in patients with
      recurrent or metastatic HPV (-) HNSCC with genetic alterations of cell cycle pathway who
      failed to platinum-based therapy. We will also evaluate feasibility and the effect on
      decision making of next generation sequencing of HNSCC.
