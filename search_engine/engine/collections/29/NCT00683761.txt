    
      This is a multi-center, open label, non-randomized, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the use of
      multiple intravenous doses of 131I-TM601 in patients with progressive and/or recurrent
      malignant glioma.

      The study will be conducted in two phases. Prior to initiating treatment as part of this
      study, patients will be administered a single imaging dose of 131I-TM601, IV, to demonstrate
      tumor uptake. Only patients demonstrating tumor uptake will remain on the study. During the
      first, Dose Escalation Phase of the study, eligible patients will be assigned in groups of
      3-6 (depending upon the treatment response seen at each dose) to dose cohorts of between 2-5
      weekly IV doses of 131I-TM601, with escalation to the next highest dose dependent upon
      demonstrated tolerance in the previous dosing group. Patients enrolled in the second phase
      will be assigned to a dose determined by the experience in the first phase.

      Patients in both study phases will have safety parameters evaluated continuously throughout
      the study. Clinical response to 131I-TM601 will be assessed in each study patient at 28 days
      following the final study dose, and then at quarterly intervals scheduled at 3 month
      intervals following the first study dose, until disease progression.
