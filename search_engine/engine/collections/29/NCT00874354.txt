      intracoronary infusion of autologous bone marrow cells in patients with myocardial infarction
      (MI). We hypothesize that patients treated with stem cell therapy will have beneficial
      effects on left ventricular (LV) remodeling and functional regeneration after MI and
      successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in setting of prospective
      randomized controlled trial.

      Congestive heart failure (CHF), which is most commonly caused by acute myocardial infarction
      (AMI), is the most frequent cause of hospitalization in the United States in patients over
      the age of 65. Although current pharmacotherapy can inhibit neurohormonal activation, this
      falls short in preventing LV remodeling and the development of CHF. Stem cells are
      undifferentiated pluripotent cells that can be obtained from the patient and have the
      potential to proliferate and differentiation into cardiomyocytes. The majority of the data on
      stem cell transplantation comes from preclinical animal studies. Although the results are
      interesting and perhaps safe, early phase I clinical studies are small and are very
      preliminary. Data from large, randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the short
      and long term effects of cellular cardiomyoplasty.
