      groups:

        -  PEP group: positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing.

        -  INS group: inspiratory incentive spirometry breathing. The period between day 0 and 20
           days post-trauma is considered an immediate phase of TT.

      Once admitted, an initial evaluation by the doctor will be performed, and pleuro-pulmonary
      complications, the presence of respiratory failure, and pain control will be evaluated. The
      CP will perform a clinical, pain control, secretion and a dynamic costal examination. The
      medical treatment of pain control will begin, and the treatment of CP will begin, where it
      will be randomized in 2 groups: 1- PEP group: positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing
      the help of a PEP bottle device. 2- INS group: inspiratory incentive spirometry device
      (CoachÂ®). Will be daily FR sessions, on weekdays. Upon admission, hospital discharge and
      post-discharge, radiological checks (simple radiography) will be performed and forced vital
      capacity will be measured with forced spirometry.
