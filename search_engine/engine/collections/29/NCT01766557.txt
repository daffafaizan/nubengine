      primary ovarian defect, up to 10% and 40-50% of those women develop diabetes and insulin
      resistance (IR) respectively. IR and associated hyperinsulinemia are recognized as important
      pathogenic factors in determining diabetes in the majority of PCOS women, particularly when
      obesity is present. Treating IR might reduce the risk of diabetes and improve ovulation and
      fertility in PCOS women. We recently found that obese, IR men and women consuming a cod
      protein diet showed a 30% improvement in insulin sensitivity compared with other animal
      proteins, and also a 24% decrease in high-sensitive C-reactive protein plasma concentration.
      Therefore, dietary fish protein could represent a natural, safe and practical means to
      improve insulin sensitivity in PCOS women with IR, and a new non-pharmaceutical approach for
      the treatment of the multiple endocrine and metabolic abnormalities of PCOS women (see
      outcome measures for a more extensive description).
