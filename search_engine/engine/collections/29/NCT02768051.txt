      atrial flutter ablation procedure, and the D700 system will be used additionally to
      demonstrate system safety, feasibility and usability.

      The entire procedure will be conducted as customary, using standard and approved off-
      the-shelf equipment (body surface electrodes, diagnostic and irrigated ablation catheters, RF
      generator and recording system), in a completely clinically independent manner from the D700
      system that will merely be a 'silent witness'. The operator will neither use nor rely on any
      of the D700 system output for clinical decision making.
