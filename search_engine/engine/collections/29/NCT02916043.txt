      associated with increased mortality for up to 10 years. The incidence of AKI after
      cardiovascular surgery is as high as 55% and the incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT)
      to be up to 8 %.

      Cell-count related risk factors for acute kidney injury after cardiovascular surgery have
      been reported. The authors attempted to investigate whether the perioperative cell counts of
      neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet are associated with the postoperative acute kidney injury
      and long-term mortality after cardiovascular surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.
