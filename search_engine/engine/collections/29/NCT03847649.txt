      drug and not a chemotherapy drug. Laboratory tests show that it works by allowing the immune
      system (PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction) to detect your cancer and reactivating the immune
      response. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die.
      Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in more than 6000
      people. This drug seems promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than
      standard treatment alone or if people can be re-treated with durvalumab after previous side
      effects
