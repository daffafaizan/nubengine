      chronic myeloid leukemia receiving sargramostim (GM-CSF)-treated autologous bone marrow
      transplantation followed by GM-CSF and interferon alfa. II. Determine the toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo harvesting of autologous bone marrow. A portion of the cells are
      treated ex vivo with sargramostim (GM-CSF) for 3 days. Patients then receive myeloablative
      chemotherapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide on days -9 to -2 according to the preparative
      regimen protocol. Patients undergo sargramostim (GM-CSF)-treated autologous bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0. Patients receive GM-CSF subcutaneously daily on days 5-180, and
      interferon alfa daily on days 90-180. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-19 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years.
