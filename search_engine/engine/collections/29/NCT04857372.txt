      dose escalation part, followed by a dose expansion part. The escalation part will
      characterize the safety and tolerability. After the determination of the recommended
      dose/maximum tolerated dose, dose expansion will assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity
      in defined patient populations and further assess the safety and tolerability at RD/MTD.
