      worldwide. Although the prognosis of surgical resection for esophageal cancer has been
      improved, more than 50% of such patients are inoperable and have to undergo palliative
      treatments because of late stage cancer or metastasis. Dysphagia is the predominate symptom
      of patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. To relieve the dysphagia and improve the
      quality of life of such patients, brachytherapy has previously been utilized. Recently, stent
      placement has been widely accepted to be an option for palliation of the symptoms due to the
      esophageal strictures. However, recurrence of the neoplastic stricture remains a challenge
      after stent placement. To combine the advantages of the immediate relief of the esophageal
      dysphagia with the stent placement and radiation therapy with brachytherapy, a novel
      esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds has been developed in the authors' institute. The
      technical feasibility and safety with this new stent has been demonstrated to be adequate in
      a healthy rabbit model. The following preliminary clinical study in a single institute has
      demonstrated longer survival time, better quality of life and less restenosis of the stent
      than whose with the conventional stent. This prospective multiple center trial is designed to
      further demonstrate the clinical outcomes with this irradiation, stent in patients compared
      to those using a conventional covered stent.
