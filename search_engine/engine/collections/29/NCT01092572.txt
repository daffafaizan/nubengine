        1. To determine the effect of 12 weeks of 40 mg once daily simvastatin on general
           inflammatory molecules, IL-6 and CRP in the blood of CF patients.

        2. To determine the effect of simvastatin on LPS-related pathway molecules in the blood.

        3. To determine the effect of simvastatin on inflammatory pneumo-proteins in the blood.

        4. To determine exacerbation and safety data on statins in preparation for a large phase
           III trial of statins in CF.

      Study Endpoints

      The primary endpoint will be the quantitative changes in serum levels of CRP.

      Secondary endpoints will include:

        1. blood biomarkers IL6, LPS related proteins, LPS, LBP, sCD14 and EndoCAb, and
           pneumoproteins, SPD and CCL18; and molecules such as TNF-Î± and IL-1beta;

        2. changes in FEV1 over 12 weeks ; and

        3. exacerbations over 12 weeks
