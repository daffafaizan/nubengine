      regimen (epirubicin, cisplatin and FU) is often considered as a reference regimen. And ECF
      regimen has been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA. According to the
      result of a Chinese phase III clinical trial in metastatic lung cancer, endostar-- a new
      angiogenesis inhibitor prolonged the overall survival, time to progression and improved
      response rate. So we designed this clinical trial to evaluate whether endostar can bring
      survival benefits to patients with advanced and metastatic gastric cancer patients.
