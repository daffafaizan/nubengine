      mechanically ventilated patients. Supported by compelling preliminary data, the trial will
      determine whether early activity and mobilisation during mechanical ventilation improves days
      alive and at home at 6 months compared to standard care. Recruiting 750 patients, this will
      be the largest trial ever conducted of early mobilisation.

      Patients allocated to the early activity and mobilisation protocol (intervention group) will
      be assessed by a physiotherapist daily during the ICU stay to determine the highest level of
      mobility. This will determine the dosage and type of exercise that will be delivered, led by
      the physiotherapist with assistance from the multidisciplinary team. For both groups,
      concomitant care will be guided by the treating clinician. In addition, all post-ICU patient
      management will be at the discretion of the patient's ward-based treating physicians.

      Patients will be randomized via web-based system and de-identified data will be collected on
      the following: baseline demographics; comorbidities; sedatives, analgesics, corticosteroids
      and neuromuscular blockers; pain/sedation/delirium scores; tracheostomy, intubation and renal
      replacement therapy. The intervention will be administered during the ICU stay upto 28days
      and the Day 180 follow up will be conducted centrally.
