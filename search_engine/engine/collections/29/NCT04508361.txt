      questionnaires to patients with sarcoidosis at baseline and after six and 12 weeks.

      Participants can either complete the questionnaires whilst they are attending clinic, or
      alternatively return the questionnaires via a pre-paid postal envelope. The questionnaires
      will be administered at the same time; no other study measures will be taken subsequently.
      Demographic and clinical information will be collected from the patients' medical records.
