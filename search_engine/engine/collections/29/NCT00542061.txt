      primary care, primarily by General Practitioners (GPs). In 1995 a Regional Diagnostic Centre,
      Etten-Leur, The Netherlands (also called SHL: Stichting Huisartsen Laboratorium) started a
      lung function monitoring service for patients with asthma and COPD of GPs in the region. The
      GP receives recommendations on treatment, additional diagnostics and referrals of the patient
      based on extensive anamnesis (i.e. dyspnoea, symptoms, smoking stage), measurement of lung
      function, and BMI. Moreover,the general practitioners are supported by an Asthma/COPD nurse
      that visit the general practice half-yearly.

      Main research question of this study: Is a written expert advice for GPs on additional
      diagnostic, treatment, and referral of patients based on half-yearly monitoring of patients
      with COPD or asthma with a persistent airway obstruction with support of an AC nurse
      consultant related to less impaired health related quality of life (HRQoL), less symptoms and
      better lung function of the patients compared to usual care?

      A multi-centre, single blinded (patient, lung function assistant, advisor, and research team
      are blinded), parallel group study is carried out to compare the monitoring intervention with
      usual care during 24 months. General practices were allocated by a minimisation procedure and
      all participating patients of a general practice were allocated to the same treatment group
      (nested design).
