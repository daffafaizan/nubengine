      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Abemaciclib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      To participate in this study, the participant must have an abnormality in one of the
      following genes: CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK4, or CDK6. Abnormalities in these genes may cause
      the cancer to grow more rapidly. CDK4 and CDK6 are proteins that are involved with the cell
      growth process. D-type cyclins (CCND1, CCND2, and CCND3) are proteins that help control the
      activity of CDK4 and CDK6.

      Abemaciclib is being studied as a treatment for people with advanced cancer. Abemaciclib is a
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDK inhibitors work to stop cell growth. In this
      research study, the investigators are hoping to learn whether Abemaciclib can be used to slow
      or stop the growth of cancers with specific genetic abnormalities.
