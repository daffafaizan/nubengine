      total of 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled in 4 transplant centers throughout the
      Netherlands, in a 9 to 12 months period. The treatment consists of a standard dose of 4
      infusions IT-combination (4 mg/m2), given 48-hours apart over a 4-hour period.

      The intended follow-up period is 12 months. The patient will also be asked to participate in
      additional research aiming at determining the presence and evolution of biomarkers suggestive
      for the extent to which the IT-combination 'resets the T-cell compartment, induces clinical
      tolerance, and/or enhances the risk of over-immunosuppression."
