    
      This is a 2-part randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of APT-1011 in adults and
      adolescents (≥12 years) with EoE.

      Part A will evaluate the efficacy and safety of APT-1011 3 mg administered HS for the
      induction of response to treatment (histologic and symptomatic) over 12 weeks.

      At Week 14, subjects will move into Part B. Subjects with histological response to APT-1011,
      defined as ≤6 peak eos/HPF, will be re-randomized to continue APT-1011 or receive placebo
      (active treatment withdrawal). APT-1011 histological non-responders will continue APT-1011,
      placebo histological non-responders will receive APT-1011 3mg HS. Placebo histological
      responders will continue placebo. Histological responder status will be determined at the
      time of EGD in Part B (at or prior to Week 52, depending on unscheduled EGDs) and is defined
      as ≤6 peak eos/HPF.
