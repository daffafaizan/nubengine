      likelihood that untreated or recurrent cervical dysplasia may progress to invasive cancer,
      there is an urgent need to develop appropriate therapies.

      Patients are randomized to receive either intravaginal fluorouracil or no treatment
      (observation only). Fluorouracil cream is self-administered via applicator at biweekly
      intervals for 6 months. Patients are evaluated for recurrent cervical dysplasia by cytology
      and colposcopy with or without biopsy.
