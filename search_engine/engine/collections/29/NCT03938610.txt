      consisting of Family Medicine attendings who have been out of residency greater than 3 years
      will complete the SCT. They will be provided an Informational Consent. Their willingness to
      be a panel member is their implied consent to be part of the research study.

      The basic idea behind SCT is to compare residents' performance with a group of persons who
      are representatives of the profession (or the specialty) to which they wish to belong.
      Therefore, panels are made up of physicians with good overall clinical experience in the
      field rather than experts from narrow parts of the field. Panel composition also depends on
      the assessment goal.

      This study will determine if a Script Concordance Test (SCT) correlates with Family Medicine
      In Training Exam (ITE) scores, American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) certification exam
      scores, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) medical knowledge and
      patient care milestones, and failing family medicine inpatient clinical rotation grades.

      The SCT will be given to PGY1, 2, and 3 residents each year during the Residents three year
      residency, in June or July.
