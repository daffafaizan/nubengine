      undergo surgical resection or biopsy will be enrolled into the study. The patients invited to
      participate in the study will provide full consent, but will only undergo 18F-FPIA PET/MRI
      imaging once they have satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once these have been
      satisfied, eligible participants will proceed to 18F-FPIA PET/MRI.

      On the day of imaging the participants will undergo a blood test to measure plasma
      concentrations of carnitine. During the scan, a single dose of 18F-FPIA (maximum, 370 MBq) IV
      will be administered to the participant followed by a whole brain dynamic PET/MRI scan over
      66 minutes. During the MRI sequences, the participant will receive an additional IV bolus of
      Gadolinium contrast medium administered through a peripheral venous cannula. Arterial blood
      sampling through a peripheral arterial line will be performed to determine the concentration
      of radiotracer within arterial plasma. All the participants that are enrolled into the study
      will undergo biopsy or surgical resection as part of their routine clinical care, from which
      their tumour grade will be confirmed; the Investigators will obtain tissue from these
      procedures to perform metabolomics, genomics and proteomics. Surgery or biopsy will be
      performed typically within 2 weeks but no later than 3 months.
