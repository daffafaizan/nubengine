      week double-blind treatment period for both components AVE5530 and atorvastatin, followed by
      a 40-week period with maintenance of double-blind design for AVE5530 component and open label
      for atorvastatin component transitioning at 20 mg for all patients with subsequent titration,
      if necessary, based on regular LDL-cholesterol monitoring. The treatment period can be
      variably extended up to approximately 18 months with double-blind for AVE5530 component and
      open-label for atorvastatin.
