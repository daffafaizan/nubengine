      β-amyloid (Aβ) into senile plaques, the abnormal aggregation of intracellular Tau protein to
      form neuron fiber tangles (NFT) and neuron death. There are still no effective treatments to
      prevent, halt, or reverse Alzheimer's disease.

      Exosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers
      with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. These
      vesicles have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs,
      and regulatory miRNAs. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling,
      and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body, and can
      influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.

      The purpose of this single center, open label, phase I/Ⅱ clinical trial, therefore, is to
      explore the safety and efficacy of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs-Exos) in the treatment of mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's
      Disease.
