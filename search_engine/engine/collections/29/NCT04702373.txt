      interventions, drug therapy and surgical palliation have had varying degrees of success in
      enhancing growth. Passive ROM has improved somatic growth in preterm infants and has been
      demonstrated in a previous Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) to be safe and feasible in neonate's
      post-Norwood procedure. Improved growth may also favorably impact neurodevelopment,
      behavioral state, and time to hospital discharge.

      This study's objectives are to evaluate growth in infants with hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome (HLHS) or other single right ventricle (RV) anomalies after the Norwood procedure
      who are randomized to a passive range of motion (ROM) exercise program vs. standard of care.
