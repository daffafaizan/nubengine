    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-981. TAK-981 in combination with an
      anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody is being tested to treat people who have RRMM. The study will
      include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

      The study will enroll approximately 81 patients, approximately 30 participants in the dose
      escalation phase (Part 1) approximately 15 participants in (Part 2) and up to 36 participants
      in dose expansion phase (Part 2). Participants will receive escalating doses of TAK-981 in
      combination of fixed doses as follows:

        -  Phase 1, Part 1 - Dose Escalation: Arm A - TAK-981 Twice Weekly (BIW) + Mezagitamab

        -  Phase 1, Part 1 - Dose Escalation: Arm B - TAK-981 Weekly (QW) + Mezagitamab

        -  Phase 1, Part 2 - Dose Escalation: TAK-981 + Daratumumab and Hyaluronidase-fihj

      Once RP2D is determined in Phase 1, participants with RRMM will be enrolled in Phase 2.

      â€¢ Phase 2 - Dose Expansion: TAK-981 + Daratumumab and Hyaluronidase-fihj or Mezagitamab

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America. The overall time to participate
      in this study is 48 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
      progression-free survival follow-up for maximum up to 12 months after last dose of study
      drug.
