        -  Compare the effectiveness of popular prostheses for improving performance in physically
           demanding tasks and environments.

        -  Compare amputee performance to a group of high-functioning non-amputees to determine
           performance differences between the groups.

      Hypotheses:

      Prosthetic feet with shock absorbing and torsional features will perform better in field
      activities. Prosthetic feet with high energy return and low mass will perform better during
      treadmill running. Non-amputee controls will demonstrate superior performance in all outcomes
      in both field and laboratory environments compared to amputee subjects.

      Relevance:

      This study has the potential to quantify differences between highly mobile amputees and
      non-amputees. Additionally, it will provide objective measures of how different prostheses
      may enhance mobility of soldiers with amputations. The study will compare laboratory and
      field measures to indicate which conditions increase efficiency of prostheses during rapidly
      changing mobility demands. This has the potential to permit retention of already trained
      soldiers.
