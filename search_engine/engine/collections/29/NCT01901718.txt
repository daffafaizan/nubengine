      into the study. Subjects who are currently taking Actiq® for their breakthrough pain and will
      be discontinued due to lack of efficacy, poor tolerability, patient or prescriber
      dissatisfaction and meet all other study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria will be candidates to receive a sublingual fentanyl spray (Subsys™). The total
      duration of the study for each subject will be no more than 4 months.
