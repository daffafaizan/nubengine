      gastroduodenal (GD) ulcer and its complications. Up to 40% of average-risk NSAID users suffer
      from dyspepsia without endoscopic evidence of gastroduodenal injury. It results a significant
      loss of productivity and impairment of Quality of Life (QoL). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
      have been shown to be effective in preventing and reducing NSAID-induced GD injury. PPIs are
      believed to have a class effect but Rabeprazole, the least expensive PPI, is grossly
      under-utilized in this area .

      Current Hospital Authority (HA) guidelines, however, only endorse the use of PPI in patients
      at high risk of ulcer bleeding. Since NSAID-induced dyspepsia is not an indication for PPI
      according to HA guidelines, those patients do not receive PPI for treatment.
