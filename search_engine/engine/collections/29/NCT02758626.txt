      or Dravet syndrome resulting from a nonsense mutation and evaluate changes in convulsive
      and/or drop seizure frequency from Baseline following ataluren treatment in patients with
      CDKL5 or Dravet syndrome resulting from a nonsense mutation. Investigators will measure
      changes in minor seizure types (absence, myoclonic, complex partial/focal dyscognitive)
      following ataluren treatment in patients with CDKL5 or Dravet syndrome resulting from a
      nonsense mutation and changes from Baseline in cognitive, motor, and behavioral function as
      well as QOL following ataluren treatment in patients with CDKL5 or Dravet syndrome resulting
      from a nonsense mutation.
