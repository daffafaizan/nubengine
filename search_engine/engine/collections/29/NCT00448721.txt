    
      This is a single-arm phase II trial assessing the antitumor activity as measured by
      progression free survival of perifosine in patients with metastatic RCC who have progressed
      on sorafenib or sunitinib. A total of 48 patients will be enrolled in the trial. All subjects
      will have histologically confirmed metastatic RCC with predominantly clear cell features (â‰¤
      50% other histologic features). Patients who have been taken off sorafenib or sunitinib may
      only have been off therapy for less than three months prior to study enrollment. Patients who
      remain on sorafenib or sunitinib may continue on drug at their current dose until two weeks
      prior to the initiation of perifosine therapy.

      The study consists of three periods: pre-treatment/screening, treatment, and follow-up. Day 1
      will be defined as the first day of perifosine therapy. Patients will remain in the treatment
      phase until progression or toxicity. Patients will be seen by an MD every 3 weeks with 6
      weeks defining one cycle of therapy. Tumor evaluations will occur every 6 weeks.
