      patients will complete the baseline questionnaire packet, which includes a questionnaire with
      several validated scoring systems. Following injection, patients will receive a diary to
      document any adverse events between the first and second injection. In one week, patients
      will return for a second visit to receive the second injection. Again they will be asked to
      maintain their diary of adverse events following the second injection. The patient will then
      receive the final injection at week 3 and will again complete a diary of events for one week.
      At 1 week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks following the completed series of
      injections, the patients will complete a form that will include the pain, stiffness, and
      physical function subscales of the WOMAC score and a 10 point patient satisfaction question.

      At 6 months, the patients will receive by mail the same questionnaire packet they received at
      baseline, with the addition of patient satisfaction and subsequent injury/treatment
      questions.
