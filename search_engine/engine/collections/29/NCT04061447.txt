      gastrointestinal diseases such as peptic ulcer and even gastric cancer. However, with the
      global trend of increasing antibiotic resistance, the eradication rate of
      clarithromycin-based standard triple therapy has declined to less than 80%. To overcome such
      alarming antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial susceptibility-guided therapy is recommended.
      However, the literature on gastric juice PCR as susceptibility-guided therapy is scant;
      therefore, the investigators conducted this prospective randomized controlled trial with the
      aim of investigating the efficacy of antibiotic susceptibility-guided therapy via gastric
      juice PCR for first-line eradication.
