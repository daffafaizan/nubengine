    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Explore the activity of cisplatin, fluorouracil, gefitinib, and hyperfractionated
           radiotherapy, in terms of 1-year survival and 1-year distant metastatic disease control,
           in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Secondary

        -  Explore the activity of this regimen, in terms of disease-specific survival and local
           control, in these patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the toxicity and tolerability of long-term maintenance with gefitinib in patients
           rendered disease free after this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo hyperfractionated radiotherapy twice daily, 5 days a week,
      beginning on day 1 and continuing for 6 weeks. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 96 hours and cisplatin IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4 and 22-25
      and oral gefitinib beginning once daily on day 1 and continuing for up to 2 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
