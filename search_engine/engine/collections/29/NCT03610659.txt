      airway limitation, irreversible, preventable, and treatable (1,2). COPD is a major health
      problem that affects the entire world and is expected to be the fourth, the seventh, cause of
      death in 2030 (3). The concept of "holistic assessment of disease burden" is widely used to
      support the personalized care management of COPD patients. Disease burden; physical,
      psychological, emotional and / or social burden felt by the patient. When the questionnaires
      in the literature evaluating the quality of life / health status in COPD patients were
      examined, it was seen that none of these questionnaires included all aspects of COPD burden
      definition (4). Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) is a 10-question questionnaire that
      assesses COPD burden in most aspects and situations. Assessment of Burden of COPD (ABC) Scale
      was developed to evaluate the burden of disease in COPD patients by adapting this
      questionnaire. The ABC scale was formed by combining three items (a short tool for early
      identification of distress) and a substance that measures fatigue with the questions of the
      CCQ scale. As a result, a scale of 14 items with 5 fields was formed.
