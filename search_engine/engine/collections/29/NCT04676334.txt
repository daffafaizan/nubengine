    
      Patients enrolled in this study are required to have completed an End-of-Treatment (EOT)
      Visit with associated assessments as specified in the Clovis-sponsored parent study. Patients
      who are no longer receiving treatment and are in LTFU in the parent study may enroll into the
      LTFU portion of this study, as applicable based on parent study objectives, without repeating
      the EOT visit.

      The starting dose of rucaparib administered at initiation of this study will be the same as
      the last dose received in the parent study, or as deemed appropriate by the investigator and
      based on available dose strength tablets. The first treatment in the rollover study will
      begin at the next scheduled treatment visit following the EOT Visit in the parent study.

      Patients enrolled to receive continued rucaparib may be treated until disease progression, as
      assessed by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death, loss to
      follow-up, or study closure by the sponsor. If a patient demonstrates disease progression per
      investigator assessment while receiving treatment with rucaparib but continues to derive
      clinical benefit, then continuation of treatment beyond progression is permitted based on
      investigator decision and patient consent. If a patient continues treatment post-progression,
      all study assessments should be continued per institutional standard of care. The patient
      should be discontinued from treatment once it is clear that no further clinical benefit can
      be achieved.
