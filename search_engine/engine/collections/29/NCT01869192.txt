      regimen used, even though the individual drugs may differ substantially in mechanisms of
      action. We are interested in identifying a set of genes that may be associated with breast
      cancer cell survival following selection by chemotherapy. We intend to use two different
      selection pressures (different chemotherapy regimens with different mechanisms of action) in
      order to focus on those genes that are regulated similarly in response to either regimen.

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is in common use for locally advanced breast cancers. Although it
      does not yet appear to impart a survival advantage, it does enhance the likelihood of breast
      conserving surgery and also provides important prognostic information. Taxotere appears to
      add significantly to pathologic complete responses when added to doxorubicin and
      cyclophosphamide alone. The combination of capecitabine and docetaxel was superior to
      docetaxel alone in metastatic disease. Many investigators are interested in incorporating
      this regimen for the treatment of earlier stages of breast cancer.
