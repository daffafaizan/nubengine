      population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and
      effective preventive measures are not implemented. According to the World Health
      Organization, hypertension is the most common attributable cause of preventable death in
      developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular
      disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. Despite the availability of
      antihypertensive treatments, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about
      one-third of patients continue to maintain control successfully.

      TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker and this study is being
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral azilsartan medoxomil compared to
      placebo and olmesartan in subjects with essential hypertension.

      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 11 weeks. Multiple
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine
      collection, vital signs including sitting blood pressure and pulse, body height and weight,
      physical examinations and electrocardiograms. Outside of the study center, participants will
      be required to wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device at 24 hour intervals.
