    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, interventional, low-risk, low-constraint, biological
      collection study to assess the exposure of health care workers to COVID-19.

      Three blood samples will be taken at day 1, month 3 and month 6. The blood samples will be
      stored in a serum biological collection. A prospective data collection will be set up at the
      level of symptoms and co-morbidities at each collection at D1, M3 and M6.

      In the event of the appearance of symptoms between samples, a self-questionnaire will be
      completed by the participating personnel as well as an invitation to screening by RT-PCR SARS
      Cov2 according to standard practices in force at the national level as well as an additional
      serological test.
