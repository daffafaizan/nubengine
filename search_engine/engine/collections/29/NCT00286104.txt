        1. To assess the cranial and extracranial infection rate of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis
           versus antibiotics-impregnated catheter.

        2. To assess the patients' outcome and carry out cost analysis for systemic antibiotic
           prophylaxis versus antibiotics-impregnated catheter.

      Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial

      Hypothesis: The use of antibiotics-impregnated catheter instead of systemic antibiotic
      prophylaxis will not increase the rate of cerebrospinal fluid infection, will decrease the
      rate of opportunistic/nosocomial infection and improves the overall outcome in these
      patients; that would convert into a reduction in treatment cost of these patients.

      Method: After ventricular catheter insertion, patients will be randomized into one of the two
      groups:

        1. Periprocedural antibiotics: Only ie Unasyn and Rocephin and insertion of the
           antibiotics-impregnated ventricular catheter.

        2. Periprocedural antibiotics and prophylactic dual antibiotics ie Unasyn and Rocephin and
           insertion of ventricular catheter without impregnation of antibiotics.

      Primary outcome variable: Cerebrospinal fluid infection and extracranial infection.

      Sample size: We aim to recruit a total of 180 patients with 90 patients in each arm and
      expect to complete patient recruitment in 2-3 years. The calculation is based to detect a
      difference of nosocomial infection rate between 20% and 40%, with 5% level of significance
      and 80% power.

      Projected results and significance:

      The project has a good chance to be the first clinical study to the outcome and cost impacts
      of antibiotic-impregnated ventricular catheter.
