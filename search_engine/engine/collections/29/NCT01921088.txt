      resonance imaging neurofeedback (RT-fMRI-NF) protocol aiming at modulating brain activity and
      psychophysiological functions. About two weeks after the initial training session it will be
      estimated how stable training effects have been. The two weeks in between, subjects will
      receive ambulatory training of the strategies via a smartphone-based application.
