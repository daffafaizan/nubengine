      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study
      agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment
      with targeted study agent in patients with advanced refractory cancers/lymphomas/multiple
      myeloma.

      II. To evaluate time until death or disease progression.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify potential predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which
      treatment is assigned or resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid
      (RNA), protein and imaging-based assessment platforms.

      II. To assess whether radiomic phenotypes obtained from pre-treatment imaging and changes
      from pre- through post-therapy imaging can predict objective response and progression free
      survival and to evaluate the association between pre-treatment radiomic phenotypes and
      targeted gene mutation patterns of tumor biopsy specimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles
      1-4 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if less than 2
      years from study entry, and then every 6 months for year 3 from study entry.
