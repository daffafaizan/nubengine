    
      Study design: Observational, longitudinal, analytic and prospective cohort study.

      .With the Ethics and institutional investigation Committee acceptance, patients with stable
      coronary plaque or post-infarct angina with indicated coronary angiography and stent
      placement, from the Hemodynamic Unit from the National Medical Center "20 de Noviembre" of
      the Institute of Security and Social Services of State Workers (ISSSTE) are invited to
      participate. Patients who agree to participate in the study sign the informed consent. The
      independent variables will be the coronary profile components (oxidative stress, inflammation
      and endothelial disfunction biomarkers) and the consequence variables (dependent) will be the
      coronary and/or stent remodeling during the post-angioplasty with stent placement monitoring,
      Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) during the post-angioplasty with stent placement
      monitoring period.

      Clinical data:

      to homogenize the study population respect to potentially confusing variables, information
      about sex, age, body mass index, vital signs. lipid profile. co-morbility presence like
      systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, drugs and troponin
      determination for stratify the acute coronaropathy.

      Coronary Catheterization and sampling. The coronary catheterization (angioplasty with stent
      placement) is made under medical indication.

      -Coronary catheterism: Is made in the hemodynamic laboratory. Asepsis, antisepsis and local
      anesthesia are performed in the intravascular approach area.
