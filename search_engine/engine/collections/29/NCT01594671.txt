        1. Principal: To assess if the topical and intravenous tranexamic acid reduce less or at
           least than 20% the blood losses with respect to the habitual haemostasia in patients,
           after unilateral total knee arthroplasty.

        2. Secondary: To assess the treatment safety. To perform a cost- analyses.

      Methods: Randomized, multicentre, open and parallel clinical trial with three comparative
      groups: Topical tranexamic acid, Intravenous tranexamic acid and habitual haemostasia. In all
      patients, a single drainage of 8mm will be inserted in the joint, and it will remain closed
      during one hour after the closure of the skin.

      NÂº of participant centres: 2. Random allocation will be centralised in "Hospital de la Santa
      Creu i Sant Pau".

      Main outcome: Total blood loss (mL) in the post-operative period collected by the habitual
      drain system ).

      Secondary outcomes: Total blood loss (mL)and hidden blood calculated by Nadler's formula.
      Proportion of patients with blood transfusion, complications of surgery wound, haemoglobin
      pre and post-operative, units of blood transfused, post-operative mortality, days of hospital
      stay, safety of interventions assessed.Direct cost analysis.

      Substudy: Pharmacokinetic study. The first 24 patients included in "Hospital de la Santa Creu
      i Sant Pau" for tranexamic acid (12 topical- 12 intravenous) to determine:

        1. Plasmatic concentrations of tranexamic acid

        2. In topical and intravenous tranexamic acid administration determine the absorption rate
           and drug bioavailability by these routes: maximum plasma concentration, time to reach
           Cmax, AUC, and half-life.
