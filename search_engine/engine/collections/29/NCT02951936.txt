    
      Patients will be divided into two groups , the study group and the control group randomly
      assigned by a computer program .

      After obtaining written informed consent , cardiac monitoring will be carried out by means of
      a NiCAS patients in both groups.The physician will not be exposed to the measurement data of
      the patients in the control group. For the research group : Monitoring will be carried out
      once a day , preferably at the same time the first three days . An increase in time interval
      is possible in accordance with an improvement in the patient . Patients will be treated
      according to the protocol described in Figure 1. Also , a graphic description of the various
      treatment zones and the exclusion zone is presented in Figure 2 .

      For the control group patients will be treated according to the usual ward protocols.

      The basic rules are:

      Avoiding over- drying by using parameter TBW .

        -  Avoidance of renal dysfunction by maintaining the cardiac output above 2.3 , and
           avoiding the use of beta-blocker overdose in cases of low cardiac output and bradycardia
           as a result of maintaining an average blood pressure over 70 .

        -  In cases of high peripheral resistance - Reduction of resistance while maintaining
           normal blood pressure .
