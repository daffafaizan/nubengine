      burnout in order to detect earlier workers at risk.

      In the present protocol, parameters are measured on several occasions (0, 1 week, at 6 month,
      at 12 months and then at each occupational visit within 5 years).

      Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata software (version 13; Stata-Corp, College
      Station, Tex., USA). All statistical tests will be two-sided and p<0.05 will be considered
      significant. After testing for normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test), data will be treated
      either by parametric or non-parametric analyses according to statistical assumptions.
      Inter-groups comparisons will systematically be performed 1) without adjustment and 2)
      adjusting on factors liable to be biased between groups.

      Analysis will be performed using anova or Kruskal-Wallis (KW) tests. When appropriate
      (p<0.05), a post-hoc test for multiple comparisons (Tukey-Kramer after anova and Dunn post
      KW) will be used.

      Comparisions of categorical variables will be performed using Chi-squared or Fischer test.
      Marascuillo's procedure will be performed for multiple comparisons. Relations between
      quantitative outcomes will be analyzed using correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman).
      Fisher's Z transformation and William's T2 statistic will be performed to compare
      correlations between variables and within a single group of subjects. Longitudinal data will
      be treated using mixt-model analyses in order to treat fixed effects group, time and group x
      time interaction taking into account between and within participant variability.
