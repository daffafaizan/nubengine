      health and disease. Iron is an essential nutrient for both bacteria and humans. In the United
      States, of the donors who provided the ~15 million units of red blood cells that were
      collected for transfusion, 69% were repeat donors. Although iron deficiency is surprisingly
      prevalent in first-time donors, its prevalence is even higher in these particularly
      altruistic frequent donors, (i.e., up to 49% and 66% of male and female repeat donors,
      respectively), manifested as iron depletion or iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Iron deficiency
      from blood donation is associated with fatigue, restless leg syndrome, decreased physical
      endurance and work capacity, and impaired concentration, attention, and other neurocognitive
      functions; however, these conclusions are not based on definitive studies and have not yet
      changed blood donation policy. The goal is to conduct a prospective, double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial, recruiting 60 healthy regular donors who meet donation standards, while
      exhibiting iron-deficient erythropoiesis by laboratory test criteria. In this ancillary
      study, we will determine what effect donor iron deficiency and IV iron repletion have on the
      gut microbiome.
