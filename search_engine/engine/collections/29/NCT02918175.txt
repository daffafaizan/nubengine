    
      This is a multi-center randomized controlled study in eligible subjects with heart failure
      and diabetes mellitus. Step counts, self-reported quality of life, medication adherence,
      blood samples and relevant clinical measures will be collected from all study subjects. The
      mobile health (mHealth) intervention will combine personalized text messages to encourage
      physical activity and a medication adherence teaching tool. A total of approximately 200
      eligible subjects will be randomized in in a 1:1 ratio to either mHealth intervention + usual
      care/data collection or the control group (usual care/data collection only). The study
      duration is 6 months for all subjects; those in the intervention group will receive the
      mHealth intervention during the initial 3 months followed by 3 months of data collection
      only. The underlying hypotheses is that the proposed mHealth intervention can favorably
      impact specific health behaviors (physical activity and medication adherence) and physiologic
      measures of disease status for both heart failure and diabetes. Additional hypotheses to be
      tested will assess the persistence of behavioral changes (daily physical activity and
      medication adherence) and physiologic measures (NT-proBNP, HbA1c) beyond the 3-month time
      point of the active mHealth intervention (i.e. through 6 months).
