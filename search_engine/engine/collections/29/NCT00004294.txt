    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients undergo autologous transplantation using peripheral blood stems
      cells (PBSC) stimulated with filgrastim (G-CSF) and transduced with a retroviral vector
      containing the human glucocerebrosidase gene (R-GC). Patients may receive up to 4 transplants
      if a deficient glucocerebrosidase level is found in peripheral leukocytes 1 month following
      transplantation.

      The G-CSF-stimulated PBSC are enriched for CD34-positive stem cells and transduced with the
      R-GC vector. Stem cells with normal gene activity are selected for transplantation.

      Patients are followed every month for 6 months, every 6 months for 18 months, and then
      annually thereafter.
