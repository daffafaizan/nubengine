    
      This is a world wide, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of 3 target doses (5, 15, and 25 mg/kg/day) of
      topiramate compared with placebo as an adjunct therapy in infants with refractory partial
      onset seizures (POS). There are 4 phases to the study, a screening phase of 3 days, a double
      blind treatment phase of 20 days, a one year open label extension phase and a posttreatment
      (taper and withdrawal) phase. The oral liquid formulation will also be assessed during this
      study, as it is investigational, unlike the marketed sprinkle formulation. 5, 15, 25
      mg/kg/day of topriramate sprinkle and oral liquid formulation will be administered during the
      four phases of the study.
