      uninfected cells, rendering them permissive for HIV-1 replication. HIV-1 Tat enhances chronic
      viral replication and induces immune suppression. Antibodies to Tat inhibit this Tat-mediated
      transcellular activation in vitro and minimize chronic plasma viremia. HIV-1 Tat activities
      can be blocked in vitro and in vivo by anti-Tat antibodies.

      The Thymon Universal Tat Immunogen (TUTI-16) is a fully synthetic, self-adjuvanting
      lipopeptide vaccine that is water soluble and administered by subcutaneous injection. In
      preclinical studies, a priming dose and a three week boost in rats induced a high titer
      antibody response to the eight known distinct epitope variants of HIV-1 Tat protein. These
      antibodies block the function of the HIV-1 Tat protein (toxin), which is essential to the
      maintenance of chronic HIV-1 viremia. Therefore, TUTI-16 has potential as a therapeutic
      vaccine for HIV-1 in humans.
