      in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). At present Ticagrelor remains a
      first line therapy as an adjunct to aspirin for patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI for
      reducing major adverse events. However, the safety and efficacy of Ticagrelor has not been
      investigated in patients with STEMI post fibrinolysis. Ticagrelor results in significantly
      higher platelet inhibition than aspirin or clopidogrel and may expose patients to an
      increased risk of bleeding if administered post thrombolysis. However, fibrinolytic therapy
      itself results in a prothrombotic milieu with greater activation of platelets, a condition
      that can be balanced with addition of stronger antiplatelet agents. Similar concerns were
      initially reflected for clopidogrel as an adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy but were later
      proven to be unsubstantiated. In fact, adjunct administration of clopidogrel to fibrinolytic
      therapy reduces major adverse events as shown by multiple studies and has become the standard
      of care recommended by guidelines. The present study is proposed to study the safety and
      efficacy of Ticagrelor in patients undergoing PCI post fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI.
