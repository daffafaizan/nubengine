    
      Primary Objective To determine whether oral HA will prevent AI-induced arthralgias and
      preserve physical function.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To explore whether oral HA will have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.

        2. To determine whether oral HA will prevent other AI associated symptoms as assessed by
           patient reported outcomes (PRO's).

        3. To assess how many of the subjects are 90% compliant with taking the HA as directed.

      Exploratory Objective To determine if mi486, (a microRNA enriched in skeletal muscle) and
      other biomarkers associated with AIMSS (TNF, IL-6, IL-17) vary with the administration of HA.
