    
      Trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of olfactory mucosa-derived mesenchymal stem cells
      based therapy for the patients with chronic laryngeal and tracheal stenosis.

      Mesenchymal stem cells are obtained from tissue biopsy of olfactory mucosa using explant
      method. Biomass of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in 10% human albumin solution is
      injected submucosally around and over the tissue after removal of a granuloma tissue during
      surgical intervention.
