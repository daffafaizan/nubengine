      intervention that consists of a video and an education booklet. Phase 2 is to conduct a pilot
      study to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. A total of 60 participants with low
      health literacy and diagnosed with CHD will be recruited in two settings. Data will be
      collected at baseline and 4-weeks after enrollment. The following data will be collected:

      At baseline: Socio-demographic information (e.g. age, gender, education level, income, past
      medical history, social support), health literacy (eligibility screening at time of
      recruitment), CHD knowledge, medication adherence, and medication self-efficacy.

      4-weeks after enrollment: medication self-efficacy and medication adherence.
