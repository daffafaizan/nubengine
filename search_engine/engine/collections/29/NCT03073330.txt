      amount of glucose and testing blood glucose level one hour after drinking it. If this value
      is above a certain cut-off (>135mg/dl), the patient is subjected to another test involving
      drinking a solution containing a higher amount of glucose and checking blood glucose while
      fasting, 1 hour after drinking the solution and 2 hours after drinking the solution. (Two
      step approach).

      Cut off values will be: 3 hour>180 mg/dl, 2 hour > 155 mg/dl, 1hour >140 mg/dl, fasting
      >95mg/dl. Two abnormal values will meet the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

      In other parts of the United States, and most of the rest of the word, screening for
      gestational diabetes uses a one-step approach by drinking a solution containing 75g of
      glucose (As recommended by the American Diabetic Society, the Endocrine Society, WHO and the
      International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study groups1-3). Blood glucose values
      are checked at fasting, one hour and two hours after solution drinking.

      The diagnosis of gestational diabetes is based on one elevated values. (cut off: Fasting
      ≥92mg/dl, 1hour ≥180 mg/dl, 2 hours ≥153 mg/dl).

      Our study will assess if there is a difference in incidence of gestational diabetes using
      these different screening approaches. Prior studies have proven similar incidences including
      a randomized controlled trial.
