      therapy currently due to its efficacy and safety. However,there was no valuable report at
      present on the clinical efficacy of pregabalin for acute and subacute herpetic neuralgia
      (SHN), expect for a smaller study which included 29 outpatients who had acute zoster pain for
      a period of 7-1 4 days. And it is not clear whether early application of pregabalin can
      reduce the incidence of PHN.

      Therefore, this study was rational designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin
      in the treatment of herpetic neuralgiaï¼Œand follow-up to the 8 months, evaluation whether
      impacting the accidence of PHN.

      It is the first time in the international that treating acute herpetic neuralgia (AHN) and
      SHN with pregabalin as a large sample size clinical trial. The results of this study will be
      great significance for guiding the clinical medication.
