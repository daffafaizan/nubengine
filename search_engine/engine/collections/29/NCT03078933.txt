      defined plasma stream. This study is a randomized, prospective, multi-center feasibility
      study that will assess the effect of Nitric Oxide treatment time (minutes) and frequency
      (days/week) on wound healing in adults with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and to provide
      information that will be used to develop final safety and effectiveness hypotheses for a
      pivotal trial of the APT001 device.
