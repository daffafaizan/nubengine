    
      Design: Prospective, case control Setting: subjects will undergo a tailored training program
      utilizing a novel biomechanical system comprising four modular elements attached onto
      foot-worn platforms (APOS system, Apos - Sports and Medical Technologies Ltd. Hertzlia,
      Israel) which conveys perturbation throughout the gait sickle. Pre and post training level
      walking will be examined via: (1) a three-dimensional motion analysis system and (2) ground
      reaction force analysis using force platforms (3) Electro-Myography system. Each subject will
      be examined in 4 different settings Patients will then participate in continued biomechanical
      perturbation training for 3-6 month and will then undergo a second gait examination Ages
      Eligible for Study: 50 Years - 75 Years, Genders Eligible for Study: None Accepts patients
      suffering from medial compartment knee osteoarthritis
