    
      Rh-Endostatin (Endostar; Simcere Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, JiangSu,China) is a humanized
      recombinant endostatin which is a direct angiogenesis inhibitor targeting the microvascular
      endothelial cells (ECs). A pivotal phase III study completed in China demonstrated that the
      addition of rh-endostatin to navelbine plus cisplatin conferred clinically significant
      improvements in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), as well as response
      rate (RR), in patients with previously untreated metastatic non small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). In vitro, the combination of Endostatin and fluorouracil showed synergistic activity
      in inhibiting colon cancer. MFolfox6 was standard first-line regimen in advanced colorectal
      cancer. The investigators carried out a phase II trial to investigate the activity and safety
      of rh-endostatin plus mFOLFOX in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
