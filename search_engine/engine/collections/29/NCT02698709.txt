      tomography (an exam commonly used in such cases), and those who present such signs in only
      one eye were compared to eyes of unaffected patients. Several characteristics of anterior and
      posterior corneal astigmatism (special emphasis was given to the latter) were collectively
      assessed among all patients by a method referred to as vectorial analysis. Statistical tests
      were then performed, in an attempt to highlight differences among those three groups of
      patients and, eventually, define new diagnostic criteria.
