      receptor. It is a non-selective opioid antagonist which has been shown to prevent the
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory liver injury in a methionine/choline deficient
      diet fed rat model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In vitro, JKB-121 neutralized or
      reduced the LPS-induced release of inflammatory cytokines, deactivated hepatic stellate
      cells, inhibited hepatic stellate cell proliferation, and collagen expression. Inhibition of
      the TLR4 signaling pathway may provide an effective therapy in the prevention of inflammatory
      hepatic injury and hepatic fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. This study
      will evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of two dose levels of JKB-121 (5 mg twice
      daily and 10 mg twice daily) in reducing liver fat and/or liver biochemistry compared to
      placebo in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
