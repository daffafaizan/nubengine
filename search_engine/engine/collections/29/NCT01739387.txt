    
      Approximately 340 subjects aged 12 years and over who have asthma or chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD), and are on medication for their condition will be recruited for the
      study. Subjects will be recruited to ensure that different severities of disease are included
      in the study.

      Severity of disease will be determined by predicted FEV1. During the study subjects will be
      trained to use both the pMDI device and the BAI device being compared. Following training the
      subjects' use of each device will be assessed by a trainer/assessor using assessment criteria
      which cover handling, actuation and inhalation aspects for each of the devices under test.
      The order in which subjects receive each device will be determined using a randomisation
      schedule.

      During the study subjects will continue to take their prescribed asthma or COPD medication.
      The pMDI and BAI devices used for the patient handling assessment will only contain placebo.

      The duration of the study for a subject will be up to 58 days. Training and use of each
      device will be separated by 7 to 21 days
