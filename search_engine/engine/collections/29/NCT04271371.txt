      acceptability of an intervention to help prevent prisoners relapse to smoking after release.
      The study will work in accordance with the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for
      developing and evaluating complex interventions. The Preventing Relapse tO Smoking among
      PrisonErs after Release (PROSPER) study consists of three key Phases:

        1. Document the support provided to manage nicotine addiction during imprisonment and in
           the periods immediately before and after release; establish the extent to which
           prisoners intentionally resume or unintentionally relapse to smoking after release; and
           obtain views on how relapse might be prevented.

        2. Drawing on current literature and findings from Phase 1, develop and design an prototype
           intervention to prevent smoking relapse after release.

        3. To pilot the designed prototype intervention and conduct a process evaluation to inform
           the development of further work in this area.

      The research will be carried out in three prisons in the East Midlands. The main duties will
      include recruitment of participants (HMPPS staff members and prisoners), data collection,
      data analysis, assist with intervention development and refining related intervention
      materials/resources, co-facilitate Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) groups, contribute to
      the ethical application for the pilot intervention, and preparation of manuscripts for
      peer-review publication.
