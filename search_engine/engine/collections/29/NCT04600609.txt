    
      The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of pediatric patients with blood
      disorders, specifically thrombotic, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), and hemostatic or
      bleeding disorders. The information gleaned from this study will help identify specific
      challenges faced by patients with hemostatic and thrombotic disorders - information that is
      necessary to develop impactful, evidence-based solutions to support patients with hemostatic
      and thrombotic disorders cope with the physical, emotional, and psychological impact of blood
      disorders. Participants with blood disorders in this study will participate in open-ended,
      semi-structured interviews with a study investigator focusing on the psychosocial experiences
      of patients with diagnosis and treatment of their underlying disorder and the understanding
      of their diagnosis. Female participants additionally will be asked questions about the unique
      effects of heavy menstrual bleeding, either from their underlying blood disorder or secondary
      to anticoagulation, on similar aspects of the impact of having a blood disorder. Validated
      questionnaires will be completed to obtain concurrent quantitative data. The interviews will
      be recorded and transcribed. Participation is complete after the interview has finished;
      participants will continue to receive standard of care treatment during and beyond the study
      period.
