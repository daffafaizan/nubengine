      accurately validate the position of the epidural needle tip when performing lumbar epidural
      analgesia in laboring women. This gravity flow technique was first described 26 years ago in
      1991, and has been at NYU Langone for 15 years, since 2002. The technique has not been
      formally studied and this study is designed to enable assessment of the success rate of the
      gravity flow technique.
