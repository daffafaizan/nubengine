    
      Participants will receive the following interventions because they are enrolled in the study:
      blood sample collection

        -  at diagnosis, before chemotherapy (pre-CT)

        -  after chemotherapy (post-ct)

      Two additional blood samples will be collected in each patient : one at diagnosis and one at
      the end of chemotherapy.

      The aim of this study is to describe the immunological profile at diagnosis in terms of
      phenotypic : PBMC in peripheral blood, TILs in ascites and in carcinomatosis, in patients
      treated for peritoneal carcinomatosis of ovarian or tubal origin. The treatment has to be a
      surgery and an adjuvant chemotherapy, or a neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by a surgery
      +/- adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Other objectives of the study include:

        -  Evaluate the association between the immunological profile at diagnosis and the
           characteristics of the disease at diagnosis (histological type, extension)

        -  Evaluate the prognostic value of the immunological profile at diagnosis in terms of
           clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (for patients with interval surgery)

        -  Evaluate the polarization of the immune response induced by chemotherapy, describing the
           phenotypic changes in the different types of samples (blood, +/- ascites, +/-
           carcinomatosis) after chemotherapy in comparison with samples at diagnostic

        -  Evaluate the association between these immunological phenotypic changes and the clinical
           response to chemotherapy in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy

        -  Collect biological material for peritoneal carcinomatosis for subsequent biological
           analyzes
