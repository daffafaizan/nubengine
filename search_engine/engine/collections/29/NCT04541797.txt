      ischaemia caused by microvascular coronary artery disease in asymptomatic patients with type
      2 diabetes.This study proposes to perform a randomised controlled trial to compare optimised
      medical therapy against empagliflozin in addition to optimised medical therapy to improve
      myocardial blood flow as measured by stress CMR. This trial would provide evidence if 10mg of
      empagliflozin given for 6 months could be an indicated treatment in asymptomatic high risk
      type 2 diabetic patients using stress CMR. The duration of 6 months is slightly longer than
      the mouse study (ie. 5 months) which showed an improvement in myocardial blood flow but not
      too long that the risk of increased patient withdrawal from the study will occur.

      All patients will undergo coronary CT angiography in order to assess degree of coronary
      artery narrowing non-invasively before allocation to the control or intervention group.
      Patients will also undergo coronary CT angiography at the end of the study after 6 months of
      placebo or empagliflozin.
