      improving the appearance of double chin. Furthermore, these treatments would optimally work
      by novel mechanisms so that the enhanced adverse effects at injection sites will not limit
      their use. Our studies suggest that RJV001 may fulfill these requirements.

      Adipocytes are attached to an extracellular matrix (ECM) that mainly consists of a collagen
      network, the degradation of which may induce apoptosis of adipocytes, leading to the
      improvement of the double chin's appearance. Collagenases are enzymes that break the peptide
      bonds in collagen; collagenase-induced destruction of the collagen network may lead to
      improvement in the appearance of the double chin.

      Rejuven is currently developing RJV001 for improving the appearance of moderate to severe
      convexity or fullness-associated SMF in adults. RJV001 is a mutant recombinant collagenase of
      Clostridium histolyticum, which contains one amino acid difference. This amino acid is in the
      active center and preclinical studies showed that Kcat of RJV001 was significantly lower than
      that of the wild type enzyme, but Km of RJV001 was close to that of the wild type.
      Preclinical studies conducted by Rejuven also demonstrated that RJV001 can still effectively
      induce lipolysis of fat tissue and that the decreased bioactivity may have the benefit of
      decreased adverse effects.
