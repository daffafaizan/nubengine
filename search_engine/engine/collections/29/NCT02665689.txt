      injections and the effect of optimal control of internal factors (eg. glycemia, blood
      pressure etc) on final functional (best corrected visual acuity-CBVA) and morphological
      (central retinal thickness-CRT) will be investigated. Patients will be randomized into two
      groups: Group with intensified diabetic control will be follow and investigated monthly at
      department of diabetology, endocrinology and nutritional medicine (Campus Benjamin Franklin)
      in Berlin with aim to reach the optimal glycemic control defined as HbA1c < 6,5%. Further,
      triglycerides values < 140 mg/dl and blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg will be pursued. Second
      group of patients will be followed by their general practitioner and in the study center only
      blood samples will be taken quarterly without active medical intervention.

      BCVA, CRT and the number of required ranibizumab injections will we evaluated and compared
      between both study groups.
