    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine feasibility and safety of long-term administration of two doses of a
      peripheral opioid receptor antagonist in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) receiving first-line systemic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether patients randomized to one or both of the two study drug arms have less
      decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than patients randomized to placebo.

      II. To estimate the difference in the pain levels and opioid/non-opioid analgesic
      requirements between patients receiving naloxegol or placebo.

      III. To estimate the difference in the adverse peripheral effects of opioids (e.g.
      constipation, nausea/emesis, dry mouth and urinary retention) between patients receiving
      naloxegol or placebo.

      IV. To explore whether there is a signal that naloxegol may be associated with longer
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      V. To evaluate the difference in discontinuation rate of systemic therapy due to adverse
      events (AEs) and deaths attributable to systemic therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
