      at a hospital-based outpatient endoscopy center. Eligible patients were randomized to two
      groups. Both groups received verbal and written instructions per standard care, while the
      intervention group received access to an interactive, on-line video. Primary outcomes were
      bowel preparation scores graded using the Boston Bowel Prep Score (BBPS), procedure show
      rates, patient satisfaction, and pre-procedure anxiety. Secondary outcomes included adenoma
      detection rate, mean bowel prep score per colonic segment, total number of polyps detected,
      and complication rates.
