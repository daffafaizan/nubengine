      the following decade, vaginal mesh operations for pelvic organ prolapse increased
      exponentially all over the world, particularly in the United States. Once the complications
      started to increase, the publication of mesh-related complications on social and broadcast
      media and the increase of medico-legal claims the United States led to an extensive FDA (Food
      and Drug Administration) restriction on vaginal mesh procedures in 2013. On January 5, 2016,
      the FDA reclassified surgical mesh for transvaginal repair of the pelvic organ prolapse into
      class III, which require premarket approval. Finally, on April 16, 2019, the FDA ordered all
      manufacturers of urogynecological mesh intended for transvaginal repair to stop selling and
      distributing their products immediately. However, awareness of the other doctors in branches
      of medicine outside of gynecology and urology is unknown.
