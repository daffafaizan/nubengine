      multiple blood product transfusions, especially in patients with severe liver dysfunction.
      Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) is a point-of-care device that has been used
      successfully to monitor coagulation on whole blood samples during OLT. Whether it allows
      blood loss and transfusion to be reduced during OLT remains controversial. ROTEM or
      conventional coagulation tests were used in this study to guide transfusion of platelets,
      cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) during OLT. Patient characteristics as well as
      pre- and post- transplant laboratory data were collected. Intra-operative blood loss, type
      and amount of blood products transfused, and cost were compared between the two groups.
