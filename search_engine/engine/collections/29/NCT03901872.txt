      larger subsequent prospective, Randomised Clinical Trial (RCT). The aim of this initial
      single arm cohort is to both validate that contemporary catheter directed therapy performed
      by experienced operators has significant efficacy and safety at 10 days, 30 days, 6 months,
      12 months, and 2 years (details below). If a strong signal of efficacy and safety is found in
      the initial single arm cohort at 30 days and 6 months, this will provide objective evidence
      to move forward with a larger multicentre, prospective, RCT.

      If the results of the initial single arm proof of principle cohort do not show efficacy, or
      there is a safety issue, a larger prospective, RCT will not be performed.
