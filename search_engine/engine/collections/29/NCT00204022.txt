    
      Proliferative glomerulonephritis is a common and severe manifestation of systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE) that usually requires intensive therapy with high doses of
      glucocorticosteroids and cytotoxic drugs, such as intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (CYC).
      The objective of the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial is to compare mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and
      azathioprine (AZA), in terms of efficacy and toxicity, as remission-maintaining treatment of
      proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis, after a remission-inducing therapy with a
      short-course IV CYC regimen. The hypothesis addressed by the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial is that
      MMF is superior to AZA.
