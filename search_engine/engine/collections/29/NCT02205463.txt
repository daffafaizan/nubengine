    
      This is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation phase Ib study to determine the safety,
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and efficacy of KD019, a multi kinase inhibitor of EGFR, HER2,
      Src and VEGFR2, in combination with trastuzumab and mFOLFOX-6 for patients with human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) metastatic or unresectable adenocarcinoma
      of esophagus, gastroesophageal junction or stomach.

      Patients with HER2+ metastatic or unresectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus,
      gastroesophageal junction or stomach will receive trastuzumab and mFOLFOX-6 in combination
      with KD019 to evaluate the safety, toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of this regimen. There
      will be four dose cohorts for KD019. KD019 will be administered orally continuously daily on
      a 28 day cycle. Trastuzumab and mFOLFOX-6 will be administered as infusions every 2 weeks at
      standard doses without escalation. The sequence on the days when all agents are administered
      will be KD019 followed by trastuzumab and mFOLFOX-6.

      Hypothesis A) KD019, a small molecule inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases
      including EGFR, HER2, VEGFR-2 and Src, can be safely added, in an effective dose, to the
      every 2 week schedule of mFOLFOX-6 + trastuzumab for patients with metastatic or unresectable
      HER2+ adenocarcinoma of esophagus, GEJ or stomach

      B) When added to mFOLFOX-6 + trastuzumab, KD019will increase response duration, progression
      free survival

      Primary objective:

      To assess the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dosing
      (RP2D) of KD019 in combination of trastuzumab and mFOLFOX-6

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of KD019 administered once daily in
           combination with every 2 week mFOLFOX-6 and trastuzumab in subjects with metastatic or
           unresectable HER2+ adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and
           stomach.

        2. To evaluate tumor biopsy specimens pre- and post- treatment with KD019 and trastuzumab
           for changes in target receptors and correlate with response
