      novel therapy for limbal stem-cell deficiency, for which no effective approaches have thus
      far been available, will be evaluated for the purpose of establishing this therapy as an
      effective strategy for this disease with an aim of improving visual acuity and corneal
      transparency. The primary endpoint will be an area of no conjunctivalization and no corneal
      epithelial defect at one year, which will be evaluated according to a 6-grade rating scale.
      The secondary endpoints will be corrected visual acuity, severity of corneal opacification,
      extent of corneal neovascularization, expected ocular complications, and all adverse events
      including abnormal laboratory findings. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the
      efficacy of the investigational therapy so as to provide rationales for making this strategy
      approved as an advanced medical care in the future.
