      classic infantile form. Some patients experience a rapid worsening in skeletal muscle
      function leading to loss of ambulation and respiratory failure, while others progress less
      rapidly. So there is a more inconstant response to treatment in skeletal muscle and lung
      function in the long-term. Therefore, an unmet clinical need is the collection and analysis
      of long-term data of rhGAA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in late-onset Pompe disease
      patient aged 8 years and older. The principal goal of our investigator driven study is to
      gain conclusive insight in long-term outcome data beyond 36 months up to 10 years of ERT
      treatment. In addition we will collect biological samples from all patients for a future
      biomarker study including gene modifier search by genome and RNA seq (not part of this
      proposal). This study may provide clinicians and researchers with a better understanding of
      late-onset Pompe disease under long-term treatment, to the benefit of all patients affected
      with late-onset Pompe disease, as well as, individuals and families with related diseases.
