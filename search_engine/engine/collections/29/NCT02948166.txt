      that the primary technical and clinical success above 95%. The technical success of
      recanalization of long occlusions femoral arteries less than 80%. Improvement of endovascular
      equipment designed for the treatment of total occlusions, increases the technical success of
      recanalization. The materials of the TASC II summarizes the results of several large studies
      that presented data on the operated segment artery patency at 56-73,7% within 2 years of
      observation. An alternative method of revascularization own femoral artery is remote
      endarterectomy. The two-year primary patency at remote endarterectomy is 86% (Moll F.L., Iio
      G.H. Closed superficial femoral artery endarterectomy: a 2-year follow up. Cardiovasc Surg.
      1997; 5: 398-400). Primary assisted patency for 33 months 88% (Rosenthal D, Martin JD,
      Schubart PJ, Wellons ED. Remote. superÔ¨Åcial femoral artery endarterectomy. J Cardiovasc Surg.
      (Torino) 2004; 45: 185-192). The length of the occlusion is not a limitation to the use of
      remote endarterectomy. Primary patency at 31 months was 60%.
