      thoracic, or vascular surgery in the designated operating room suite who require endotracheal
      intubation for general anesthesia.

      The investigators plan a cluster randomized multiple crossover design, where each cluster is
      crossed over to the other treatment in the next period. The operating suites will be divided
      into 2 separate clusters consisting of 11 operating suites each. Randomization will consist
      of randomizing cluster 1 to use either video laryngoscope or direct laryngoscope, and cluster
      2 to the alternative device in one-week blocks.
