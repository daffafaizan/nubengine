    
      This is a single-center, open label pilot study of Apremilast in ten subjects with both
      erythematotelangiectatic rosacea and papulopustular rosacea in which subjects will be treated
      with Apremilast 20mg twice per day for 12 weeks. There is a total of 10 visits over a period
      of 16 weeks.

      Adult male and female subjects 18 years of age or older will participate in the study after
      the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of the study have been fully explained, and
      after they have signed the informed consent form. Subjects must have a diagnosis or findings
      consistent with erythematotelangiectatic and papulopustular rosacea. Subjects must have at
      least 10 papulopustular lesions with underlying erythema/telangiectasias visible to the
      unassisted naked eye.

      Subjects will take Apremilast capsules 20mg twice per day for 12 weeks. If at anytime during
      the study a subject encounters overt study medication related adverse effects, dose reduction
      will be allowed following discussions between the subject and the investigator. Dose
      reductions to 20mg once per day will be allowed for subjects who experience intolerable
      adverse effects from the study medication. If the subject cannot tolerate 20mg per day,
      he/she will be terminated from the study.
