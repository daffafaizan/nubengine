      with different FOT (=Forced Oscillation Technique) devices. To this end, the respiratory
      impedance of fifty adult subjects will be measured in random order with five different forced
      oscillation devices. As there is no "gold standard" FOT-device, each setup will be compared
      to all other setups.

      Secondary study questions are: 1) is there a specific comfort (or discomfort) associated with
      the different measuring devices 2) Guidelines state that full chin and cheek support should
      be applied when measuring the human respiratory impedance. What is the influence of a partial
      cheek support?
