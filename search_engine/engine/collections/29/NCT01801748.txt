      with focus on wheat allergy by both a detailed medical examination and collection of medical
      history. Blood sample was taken for baseline determination of ImmunoglobulinE antibodies to
      wheat and to omega-5-gliadin. The oral wheat challenge were performed in all study subjects
      to identify a case of wheat outgrowing. The primary outcome was the development of oral
      tolerance to wheat. Oral wheat challenge were generally performed at least every 1 years if
      the child did not have an interval history of symptoms with unintentional exposure.
