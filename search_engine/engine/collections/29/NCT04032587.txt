      stress) relevant for learning mechanisms in addictive disorders. The investigators will
      examine non-treatment seeking subjects with alcohol use disorder (AUD; mild vs. moderate to
      heavy), and healthy controls with a focus on the impact of Pavlovian conditioned stimuli
      (context-related cues) on instrumental behavior (so-called Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer
      (PIT)) and whether the PIT effect can be systematically modified by manipulating the
      approach/ avoidance propensities of Pavlovian cues (work package (WP) 1). Concerning stress
      as a major modulator of cue reactivity in addiction, the investigators further plan to assess
      whether acute, active stress reduction modifies such PIT effects (i.e. decreasing transfer
      effects) as well as goal-directed vs. habitual behavior (i.e. strengthening goal-directed
      decisionmaking) (WP2). Lastly, this project aims at contributing to the understanding of the
      underlying neurobiological correlates of manipulation of approach/ avoidance propensities of
      Pavlovian cues and acute stress reduction by using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (WP3) with a focus on amygdala-striatal activity (PIT) and frontostriatal processes
      (goaldirected decision-making).
