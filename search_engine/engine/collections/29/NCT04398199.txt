    
      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ To determine the in-field control of hypofractionated radiotherapy consisting of 70 Gy in
      25 fractions without concurrent chemotherapy measured at two years after the first post-
      radiotherapy scan.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of thoracic hypofractionated radiotherapy consisting
           of 70 Gy in 25 fractions as graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE) version 5.0

        -  To determine proportion with local, regional, and distant progression at 1 and 2 years
           after the first post-radiotherapy scan, and compute progression-free and overall
           survival (progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively).
