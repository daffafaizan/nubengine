      rheumatoid arthritis. Similar pathways have been shown to be involved in vitiligo. Therefore,
      we are recruiting 10 adult patients with active vitiligo who meet specific inclusion and
      exclusion criteria to receive self-administered injections of abatacept weekly starting at
      week 0 and continuing until week 24. A 32 week follow-up visit will be performed to evaluate
      secondary endpoints as well. We will be monitoring patients to see if skin lesions of
      vitiligo stop spreading and start to repigment with continued treatment.
