      lobar degeneration. To accomplish this, the current study will evaluate different tests:
      brain imaging, skin biopsy, body fluid samples (blood and cerebrospinal fluid), thinking
      abilities, everyday functioning, and brain autopsy. The study team hopes that this
      information can be used to guide diagnosis and further understanding of mechanism of disease
      in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and possibly treatment in the future.
