      (500 mg); randomization was stratified by PI3K pathway activation status (activated,
      non-activated, unknown determined in archival tumor tissue) and visceral disease status
      (present or absent). Tumor evaluation was performed 6 weeks after the randomization date and
      then every 8 weeks until radiological progression (based on Response Evaluation Criteria In
      Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1).

      Novartis made the decision not to pursue further development of buparlisib and to terminate
      the ongoing studies in the program. Accordingly, on 19-Dec-2016, Novartis notified all the
      Investigators about the decision not to pursue further development of buparlisib in Breast
      Cancer. As a result, the CBKM120F2302 study was terminated on 19-Apr-2019 (last subject last
      visit).
