    
      Temocillin is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with activity against gram negative bacteria
      inclusive many ESBL producing bacteria. Temocillin is approved and marketed in a few European
      countries since the 1980Â´s but not in Sweden.

      The aim of the study is to find an ecological favorable alternative to cephalosporins in the
      treatment of this common indication.

      The hypothesis is that treatment with temocillin causes less disturbances on the intestinal
      microbiota while at least comparable efficacy.

      The study will be performed as an open prospective multicentre study with two parallel groups
      comparing 2 g temocillin three times daily with 1-2 g cefotaxim three times daily for 7-10
      days in male and female adult patients with febrile urinary tract infection.
