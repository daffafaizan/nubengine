    
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 2 arm study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of FMX103 topical foam containing 1.5% minocycline compared to
      vehicle, in the treatment of participants with moderate-to-severe facial papulopustular
      rosacea. Qualified participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (active:vehicle) to receive
      1 of the following 2 treatments:

        -  FMX103 minocycline foam 1.5%

        -  Vehicle foam

      Participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatments according to the randomization schedule.
      Participants will apply (or have applied) the study drug topically once daily for 12 weeks as
      directed. Participants will be advised to use the study drug at approximately the same time
      each day. Both the Investigator and participant will be blinded to the study drug identity.
      Participants will return for visits at Weeks 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Efficacy evaluations
      (inflammatory lesion counts and Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score) will be
      performed at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 during the study.

      Note: Originally the two studies FX2016-11 and FX2016-12 were combinedly presented in the
      protocol registration form under one NCT number (NCT03142451), and later separated since
      results were analyzed separately.
