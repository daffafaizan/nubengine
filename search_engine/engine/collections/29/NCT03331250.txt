      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Eribulin for your specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying how safe and effective eribulin is in
      participants with Angiosarcoma or EHE.

      Eribulin was created to mimic the structure of a chemical that is released from a sea sponge.
      The investigators believe that this drug has anti-cancer effects on tumors by blocking
      proteins called microtubules, among other functions. It may work by preventing the cancer
      cells from dividing and eventually cause the tumor cells to die similar to other drugs that
      target microtubules
