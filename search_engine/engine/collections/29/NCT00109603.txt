      morbidity and mortality among HIV infected people. However, significant adverse effects,
      including dyslipidemia, have been associated with HAART. Dyslipidemia may cause elevations in
      serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride
      concentrations, as well as a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations.
      Dyslipidemia is of particular concern for patients receiving HAART because the condition is
      associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events. TDF is an antiretroviral that has
      exhibited favorable lipid effects in several studies in HIV infected people, but the
      mechanism for the observed lipid-lowering effect of TDF is unknown. This study will evaluate
      the efficacy of TDF on lowering non-HDL in HIV infected adults currently on stable HAART.
      HAART itself will not be provided by this study.

      This study will last 32 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study
      arms. Arm A participants will receive 12 weeks of TDF daily, 4 weeks of no TDF, 12 weeks of
      placebo daily, then 4 weeks of no TDF. Arm B participants will receive 12 weeks of placebo
      daily, 4 weeks of no TDF, 12 weeks of TDF daily, then 4 weeks of no TDF. Participants will
      continue to take their currently prescribed stable HAART regimen for the duration of the
      study. There will be 13 study visits over the 32 weeks of the study. Clinical assessments
      will occur at all visits; blood and urine collection will occur at most visits.
