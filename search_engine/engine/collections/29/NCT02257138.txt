      I. To determine the tolerability of the combination of decitabine and ruxolitinib phosphate
      (ruxolitinib [DI]) in patients with leukemia. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of
      ruxolitinib in increasing and prolonging response induced by decitabine alone in patients
      with post myeloproliferative neoplasm acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (post MPN-AML)
      alternatively referred to as (myeloproliferative neoplasm - blast phase; MPN-BP). (Compared
      to historical response rate with decitabine alone) (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare whether there is a difference in response rate patients with post-MPN AML with
      janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations and patients without JAK2 mutations.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib phosphate followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and
      decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks
      for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
