      released from sympathetic nerves. Recently it was found that adenosine activates murine and
      human brown adipocytes, and recruits beiging of white fat via adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR).
      Furthermore, studies with mice have shown improvements in glucose homeostasis after
      administration of A2AR agonists.

      In this study the investigators use the PET radiotracer [15O]-H2O to quantify perfusion of
      BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle in three conditions: room temperature, cold
      exposure and intravenous infusion of adenosine. Another PET radiotracer [11C]TMSX is used to
      quantify adenosine A2A receptor density of BAT, WAT and muscle in room temperature and during
      cold exposure.
