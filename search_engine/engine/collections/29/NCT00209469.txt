      disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile
      dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease and
      vasculitis, treatment of glucocorticoid-associated osteopenia and osteoporosis with 18 months
      of alendronate (FOSAMAXÂ®, Merck & Co., Inc.) will result in greater improvement in the mean
      change of individual AP spine bone mineral density (BMD) (gm/cm2) determined by dual energy
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) than treatment with 18 months of standard of care therapy.
