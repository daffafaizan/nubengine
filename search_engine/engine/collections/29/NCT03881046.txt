      The primary symptoms of this health problem include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis
      and sputum. In addition to these symptoms, muscle strength, respiratory function and effort
      level are decreased.

      Inadequate daily living activities in cancer patients are expressed.But studies evaluating
      the activities of daily living in patients with lung cancer are inadequate and patients are
      evaluated only using scales. For the measurement of functional status in daily living
      activities, these scales provide important information about the detection of symptoms and
      the progression of the disease. However, it is very difficult to determine the limitation of
      perceived difficulty in daily living activities with these scales. In addition, since these
      scales are a method of measurement, the objectivity is open to discussion. It is thought that
      a performance-based protocol will facilitate the detection of limitations and provide more
      objective findings. We think that the Londrina protocol fully reflects the activities of
      daily living and thus will give us an objective measurement.

      This study will show us the problem and its cause in daily life activities in patients with
      lung cancer.
