    
      The PRESENT cohort is set up according to the 'cohort multiple Randomised Controlled Trial'
      design. The basis of this design is a prospective cohort of patients with bone metastases,
      receiving care as usual, who give informed consent for cohort participation. At the UMC
      Utrecht, patients are furthermore asked for informed consent to be randomized in future RCTs
      conducted within the cohort. Patients are informed that they will be offered the experimental
      intervention if they are randomly selected. They are also informed that they otherwise might
      serve as controls without being notified and that their data can be used in a trial context.
      For each patient in the cohort, clinical and patient-reported outcomes are captured at
      baseline and at regular intervals during follow-up. Within this cohort, multiple RCTs can be
      conducted. For this purpose, eligible patients who have provided the consent required for
      them to participate in an RCT within the cohort are identified. From this subcohort, a random
      selection of patients will be invited to undergo the experimental intervention. Eligible
      participants who were not randomly selected receive standard care, are not informed about the
      experimental intervention and serve as controls. Outcomes in this control group are compared
      with the outcomes of those who were offered the experimental intervention, in order to
      estimate the effect of the experimental intervention versus usual care. Within the cohort,
      the same process can be repeated for trials of other interventions.
