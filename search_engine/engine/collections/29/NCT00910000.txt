      Primary

      Phase Ib: Determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat when used in combination
      with standard (fixed) doses of carboplatin/gemcitabine during a 21 day cycle in patients with
      recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer

      Phase II: Estimate the median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with
      carboplatin/gemcitabine/vorinostat and vorinostat maintenance

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the response rate of carboplatin/gemcitabine/vorinostat

        -  Assess the toxicities of carboplatin/gemcitabine/vorinostat

        -  Assess the toxicities of maintenance vorinostat

        -  Measure overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      The Phase Ib study was originally design to follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation design and
      evaluate 4 vorinostat dose levels.The DLT observation period was the 21-day cycle 1 length.
      Note: Ultimately 6 dose levels were evaluated as the protocol was amended to add dose levels,
      de-escalating cumulative vorinostat dose per cycle when 2 of 3 participants in dose level
      cohorts 2A, 1B and 1C experienced DLTs.

      In the Phase II study, a median PFS of 13 months would be worthy of further study,
      representing a 66% improvement compared with the historical median of 8.6 months observed
      with carboplatin/gemcitabine. With 36 evaluable patients, there is 80% power to reject the
      null hypothesis in favor of the alternative at a 5% significance level.
