    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride
      (CB-839 HCl) (telaglenastat) in combination with MLN0128 (sapanisertib) and determine the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To examine preliminary efficacy of CB-839
      HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in squamous cell lung cancers (LSCC) and in
      select, molecularly-defined non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts.

      IIa. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and
      disease control rate (DCR) of patients treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128
      (sapanisertib).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate genomic and metabolomic signatures with response. II. To evaluate metabolic
      response (18Glutamine [GLN]-positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT];
      18Fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET/CT) in NSCLC tumors treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat)
      and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in the dose expansion.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride.

      Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and
      sapanisertib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly.
