    
      This is a prospective randomized double-blinded study. Patients will be randomized prior to
      primary cesarean section to either the study arm (Seprafilm® placement) or control arm
      (nothing placed). Seprafilm® will be placed over the repaired uterine incision and over the
      anterior aspect of the uterus prior to closure of the fascia (2 to 3 sheets per patient).
      Randomization will be by opaque envelops containing group assignment.

      Participants and surgeons will be blinded to group designation at the time of repeat
      cesarean. The surgeon will be asked to grade the adhesions at the time of repeat cesarean.
