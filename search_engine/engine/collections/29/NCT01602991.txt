      patients after surgery have problems such as nausea, pain, vomiting, heartburn or
      regurgitation. To investigate these problems, an endoscopy is used. Yet, endoscopy has some
      disadvantages such as the need for intravenous sedation, need to take time off work, need for
      special endoscopy units and nurses and a delay in diagnosing because the endoscopy cannot be
      done at the time of the clinic visit. A new technology called clinic-based
      nasopharyngoendoscopy can potentially solve many of the problems with the current endoscopy.
      This study aims to determine that this new technology is just as effective in diagnosing
      problems as the current gold standard.
