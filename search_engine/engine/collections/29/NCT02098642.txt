      symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the
      substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of this cell death is unknown. Early in
      the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are movement-related; these include
      shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait. The main
      families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are levodopa dopamine agonists and
      Monoamine oxidases-B inhibitors.A multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment (MIRT)
      is able to improve different parameters in PD that are poorly responsive to the
      pharmacological therapy. In this study, we aim to understand whether the passive mobilization
      of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux determines an increase in the joint range in
      this district, allowing to improve, at least, the gait in patients with PD. In this course,
      we will evaluate whether passive mobilization of this joint, lead to positive effects on the
      freezing of gait and on the festination.
