      safety assessments, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and PK sampling over a 1-week
      period. DS-8895a was infused again on Days 8, 22, and 36. The Day 36 infusion of DS-8895a was
      also trace labelled with ^89Zr, with subsequent PET imaging and PK sampling. Four dose levels
      (1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg) were to be evaluated, with 3 to 6 patients entered at each dose
      level. Patients who responded or had stable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at the Day 50 restaging may have continued to receive
      biweekly treatment with DS-8895a until disease progression, with restaging performed by
      computed tomography (CT) scans every 6 weeks.
