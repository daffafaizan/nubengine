        -  Determine the antitumor effects of low-dose beta alethine in patients with myeloma or
           progressive monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on anemia, performance status, pain, and
           delayed-type hypersensitivity (immune response) in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive beta alethine subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 6 doses. At day 85, patients
      may receive an additional 12-week course of therapy in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with an apparent complete response receive additional
      courses.

      Patients are followed for 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
