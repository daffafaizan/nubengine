      whole study, the participants will have to complete several clinical examinations:

        -  anthropometric measurements

        -  Body composition assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry

        -  Maximal aerobic test

      They will then randomly complete the following conditions:

        -  CON: a control day without exercise;

        -  HIE: an exercise day with an exercise set at 75% of the capacities

        -  LIE: an exercise day with an exercise set at 40% of the capacities
