    
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of an HIV-1 nef/tat/vif, env pDNA
      vaccine delivered with EP, followed by a rVSV HIV envC vaccine boost, in healthy,
      HIV-uninfected adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in Group 1 will
      receive the HIV-1 nef/tat/vif, env pDNA vaccine at Day 0 and Months 1 and 3, followed by the
      rVSV HIV envC vaccine boost at Months 6 and 9. Participants in Group 2 will receive placebo
      vaccine at Day 0 and Months 1, 3, 6, and 9. Study visits will occur at Day 0, Week 2, and
      Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 6, 6.25, 6.5, 9, 9.25, 9.5, 12, and 15. Visits may include
      physical examinations, urine collection, blood collection, HIV testing, risk reduction
      counseling, assessments, and questionnaires. Participants will be contacted by study staff
      for follow-up monitoring annually for 3 years following the initial study injection.
