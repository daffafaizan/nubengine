      meal.

      Healthy (n= 30) volunteers are recruited to participate in four consecutive visits in the
      research laboratory, when four meals are served in randomised order. Meals are: black currant
      puree, black currant and quinoa based snack, quinoa base and liquid containing glucose,
      fructose and sucrose. The meals contain the same amount of carbohydrates.

      In addition to glucose and insulin concentration, cytokine and free fatty acid concentrations
      are measured after each meal.
