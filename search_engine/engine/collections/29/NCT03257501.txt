    
      Up to 150 subjects will be enrolled at four (4) clinical research sites in the United States.
      Subjects will wear two Sensors of three unique sensor lots. Each Sensor will have a paired
      Reader that will be given to the subject. All Readers will be masked during the study (i.e.
      subjects will not be able to view glucose results obtained from the Sensor on the Reader
      screen). Subjects will be asked to perform at least 8 capillary Blood Glucose (BG) tests per
      day using the primary Reader. Interstitial glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained
      with the corresponding Readers immediately following each BG test. Subjects will be
      instructed to report any problems with the device. Subjects will make eight (8) scheduled
      visits to the clinical study site, including the Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit 1).
      Subjects will have five (5) in-clinic visits during which intravenous blood draws and YSI
      reference testing will occur.
