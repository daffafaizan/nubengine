    
      This exploratory phase I study will be conducted in two steps:

      Step A: A low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) dose escalation phase Ia, based on the Traditional 3+3
      design to determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and RP2D
      for lung LDRT.

      Step B: A lung LDRT dose expansion phase Ib

      All eligible patients will receive lung SBRT dosed at 30 Gy in 3 fractions, in combination
      with LDRT at different dose levels (decried as below) starting from the 2nd day of SBRT,
      followed by sintilimab monotherapy starting within 7 days after radiation completed.
      Sintilimab will be given at 200mg every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicities, the patient withdraws informed consent, or sintilimab reaches a maximum of up to
      24 months Patients in the dose escalation phase Ia will receive lung LDRT at 3 cohorts with
      increasing dose levels: 2 Gy in 1 fraction in dose level 1, 4 Gy in 2 fractions in dose level
      2, 10Gy in 5 fractions in dose level 3.

      During the dose expansion phase Ib, a cohort of 21 patients will receive lung LDRT dosed at
      the RP2D determined during the dose escalation phase in combination with SBRT and Sintilimab
      to obtain additional safety and response data.
