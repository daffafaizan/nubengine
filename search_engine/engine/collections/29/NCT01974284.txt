      microcarcinoma (PTMC) has equivalent oncologic outcomes to current treatment options
      including observation, thyroid lobectomy and total thyroidectomy. In addition, we hypothesize
      that it will yield superior long-term quality of life, including measures of pain, voice, and
      cosmesis than standard surgical therapy (total thyroidectomy). If our hypotheses are correct,
      the findings of this study have the potential to fundamentally change clinical management of
      this group of patients.

      This study was changed from its initial design: a 2 arm study comparing PEA to surgery
      (Amended April 30, 2015). The change in design was made based on several discussions within
      Yale Endocrine Surgery, with patients diagnosed with PTMC, and knowledge of other
      institutions performing PEA for PTMC as standard of care.

      The study team had been contacted by numerous potential subjects interested in PEA who were
      unwilling to be randomized to surgery. Because patients interested in PEA appeared to be
      firmly against the idea of thyroidectomy, we believed that we would be unable to enroll
      sufficient patients to this study as the protocol originally stood.
