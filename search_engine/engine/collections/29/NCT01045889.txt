      compared to the general population. The recent introduction of highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART)has improved HIV positive patients' clinical conditions and reduced the risk
      of opportunistic infections, thus making HIV+ patients more similar to HIV- patients. Several
      studies have shown that the early use (as first line treatment) of high dose chemotherapy
      (HDT) with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is superior in the HIV negative
      setting to conventional dose chemotherapy, at least in patients with poor prognostic factors
      at diagnosis. Recently, several experiences have shown the feasibility, safety and efficacy
      of HDT and PBSCT, in association with HAART, as salvage therapy in HIV positive patients with
      lymphoma who maintain a chemosensitive disease after first-line treatment failure. It is
      rationale therefore to explore the use of this treatment strategy earlier, within the upfront
      treatment of HIV-associated lymphoma, in those patients with poor prognostic factors at
      diagnosis, according to the international prognostic score (IPI).
