      derived from CD3 zeta, CD28 and 4-1BB. Autologous T cells will be gene engineered with the
      CAR gene using a lentivirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected
      to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24
      months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.
