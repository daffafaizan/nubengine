      and working memory.There is evidence for dysregulation of the attention system from low-level
      sensory processes up to emotional processes, and increased sensitivity to
      distraction.Milnacipran's balance of norepinephrine (NE) to serotonin (5-HT) of 3:1, similar
      to amitriptyline, a tricyclic that has demonstrated efficacy in fibromyalgia, as compared to
      venlafaxine which is 1:30, or duloxetine which is 1:10.7 In addition, because of
      milnacipran's effect on 5-HT, it should also be effective in treating other symptoms such as
      sleep disturbances and mood changes, which are associated to fibromyalgia, as well as other
      functional somatic syndromes. It is worth noting that several medications to treat
      fibromyalgia are sedating (e.g pregabalin, opioids, muscle relaxants) and impair
      neurocognition.
