    
      Combination ddI/ribavirin therapy, if safe and effective, offers an alternative combination
      antiretroviral regimen for patients unable to tolerate regimens containing zidovudine (AZT).

      Patients receive ddI alone for 4 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of combination ddI/ribavirin.
      Patients who complete the first 12 weeks without major toxicity may receive an additional 12
      weeks of combination therapy on an optional basis. Patients are followed for 60 days after
      the last treatment visit.
