      post-operative ileus involves trauma to the bowel. This traumatizing of the intestine and
      peritoneal surfaces results in production and release of inflammatory mediators. These in
      turn, lead to inactivation of inhibitory neural reflexes. There is also an additive effect of
      opioids used for post-operative pain, aggravating and adding to the duration of
      post-operative ileus. Acupuncture has shown promise in both human and animal model studies to
      reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting and post-operative ileus. It is the investigator's
      hypothesis that acupuncture will minimize or reduce both post-operative ileus and nausea
      following elective colon surgery and will lead to a decrease in inflammatory markers that are
      known to be elevated following abdominal surgery.

      The study goals are to determine if acupuncture:

        -  Leads to earlier return of bowel function

        -  Leads to earlier time to discharge following colon surgery

        -  Leads to earlier return of colonic motility

        -  Leads to decreased postoperative nausea and vomiting

        -  Leads to a decrease in inflammation
