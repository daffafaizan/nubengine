      testing for detection of latent tuberculosis in haemodialysis patients". Nephrol Dial
      Transplant 2009; 24: 1952-6), the investigators had compared 2 IGRAs (T-SPOT.TB and
      Quantiferon Gold) with the TST and shown that one IGRA was clearly more sensitive than the
      TST but that both tests had a very low sensitivity for detecting prior TB.

      This study applies the same protocol to renal transplant recipients undergoing routine annual
      check-up visits: questionnaire with detailed collection of risk factors for latent
      tuberculosis infection (LTBI), history of prior contact with tuberculosis (TB), BCG (Bacille
      of Calmette and Guerin vaccine), prior TB or LTBI, treatment for TB or LTBI, analysis of
      chest X-ray for signs of prior TB, on-going treatment, level of immunosuppression (CD4
      lymphocytes), simultaneous blood sampling for T-SPOT.TB and Quantiferon Gold, and tuberculin
      skin testing.
