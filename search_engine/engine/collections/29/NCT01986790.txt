      and details through qualitative interviews with 50 uninsured individuals. These responses
      will then lead to the development of three communication strategies to improve understanding
      of health insurance plans: 1) plain language, 2) plain language plus visual displays and 3)
      plain language plus narratives.

      The strategies will the be pilot tested with 30 individuals to assess readability, clarity of
      language, and layout. The revised communication strategies will be tested with 280
      individuals in a randomized experiment. Individuals will be randomly assigned to either a
      plain language condition alone, a plain language + visual displays condition, and a plain
      language + narrative condition.
