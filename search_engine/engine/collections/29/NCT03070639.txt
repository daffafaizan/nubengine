    
      This intervention trial uses a randomized controlled design and will be conducted in the
      Harriet Lane Clinic. The study conditions are: Standard Care Group (SG), Attention-Matched
      Control Group that receives a scald burn prevention intervention (CG), and Intervention Group
      that receives a safe sleep intervention (IG). Parents or legal guardians will be enrolled
      during the newborn visit (when the baby is approximately 4-7 days old). While waiting to be
      seen for their 2-week well-child visit, the parent will complete the Baseline Interview and
      be randomized to SG, IG, or CG. All participants will receive Standard of Care during all of
      their well-child visits, which will include standard anticipatory guidance delivered by the
      pediatric resident. The IG and CG interventions will be delivered in the clinic during the
      2-week visit after the baseline survey has been completed. The first follow-up will be
      conducted at the home of the parent after completing the 2-week visit, when the baby is
      approximately 3-6 weeks old. The second follow-up will be conducted at the home of the parent
      after the 2-month well-child visit, when the child is approximately 2-4 months of age. Each
      home visit consists of an interview covering safe sleep and scald topics, an observation of
      the baby's sleep environment, and testing the water temperature. The 2-week and 2-month
      well-child visits will be audio-recorded, and parent or legal guardians will be asked to
      complete a Visit Exit Checklist.
