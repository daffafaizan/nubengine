      however, to what extent elderly and disabled individuals could benefit from it is currently
      unknown. Our primary goal is to investigate if treatment with whole body vibration in elderly
      persons and patients with various neuromuscular and musculoskeletal deficits would result in
      more rapid return of their function and presumably at a higher level than comparable group of
      patients undergoing standard physical therapy.
