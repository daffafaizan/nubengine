    
      The objectives of this study are to further evaluate the S-ICD system's ability to identify
      and terminate induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients acutely with an S-ICD emulator
      and parasternal electrode during the implant procedure of a standard transvenous ICD.

      The active emulator is not a powered medical device and all elements of the test system are
      removed following the testing.

      This acute intra-operative protocol will test the ability of the electrode and emulator to
      appropriately convert the arrhythmia and allos an assessment of post shock pacing.
