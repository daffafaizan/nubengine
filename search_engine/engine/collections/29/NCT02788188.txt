      treatment of emerging infectious diseases. However, production of large quantities of
      anti-pathogen human plasma and/or immunoglobulin with high affinity and avidity antibodies
      currently requires donations by convalescent humans, a process that can limit availability
      for a number of reasons. One novel alternative source is transchromosomic (Tc) cattle that
      produce fully human polyclonal IgG (hIgG) de novo and mount a robust antibody immune response
      after vaccination.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SAB-301, a fully
      human polyclonal anti-MERS IgG collected from transchromosomic cattle. Beginning with a low
      single-dose, subjects are randomized to receive either SAB-301 or a normal saline control,
      and evaluated on Study Days 1, 3, 7, 21, 42, and 90. The safety and tolerability is evaluated
      using symptoms, clinical laboratory tests, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity assays.
      Utilizing a series of stopping rules and a medical monitor, the dose will be escalated as
      safety and tolerability are established.
