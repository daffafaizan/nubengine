      echocardiography, but only very few studies have been performed using cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging (CMRI), currently the reference modality is assessment in cardiac geometry
      function. In addition, no data are available on right ventricular (RV) and atrial structure
      and function. The pathophysiology of the cardiac involvement in acromegaly may be related to
      increase myocardiac water content and/or interstitial myocardiac fibrosis.

      The main objective of sthe study is to compare the myocardial water content in patients with
      acromegaly and in healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate :

        1. interstitial fibrosis and the structure and the function of LV and RV in acromegalic
           patients in comparison with healthy volunteers;

        2. the reversibility of the cardiac involvement (water content, fibrosis, LV and RV
           structure and function) after efficient treatment of acromegaly;

        3. the elasticity of aorta in acromegalic patients in comparison with healthy volunteers
           and with the post-treatment state. Twenty acromegalic patients will be included in order
           to dispose of 15 patients that will completed the study and the same number of age- and
           BMI-adjusted healthy volunteers will be included.
