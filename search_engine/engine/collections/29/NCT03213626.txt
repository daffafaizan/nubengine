    
      Primary Objective The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate a radiographic
      response rate of 15% or greater for the combination in a selected population.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this trial are:

        -  To estimate progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease
           control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS); and

        -  To assess safety and tolerability of this combination in the target patient population.

      Correlative Objectives

      The following tests will be performed on blood and tumor tissue samples collected during this
      trial to correlate with PFS and OS:

        -  c-Met and EGFR mRNA by RT-qPCR

        -  plasma HGF and soluble Met receptor

        -  c-Met and EGFR phosphoprotein levels by IHC

        -  KRAS mutation status
