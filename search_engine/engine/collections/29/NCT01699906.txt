      inflammation in fat stores. It is likely that, if fat store inflammation is reduced, then
      inflammation in breast fat also will be lower. Also, it is possible that blood immune cells
      may be changed with weight loss and even that immune cells in skin will be affected. Since
      vitamin D has important immune effects and vitamin D is low in obesity, we also want to study
      what happens to this vitamin during weight loss.

      This pilot study of weight loss will be done in 10 very obese post menopausal women. This
      study will include nutritional and medical evaluation, a 3 day inpatient hospital stay eating
      a diet providing 50% of what they were taking before starting the study and then a
      nutritionally adequate diet that will allow them to lose about 10% of their initial weight
      within 7 to 10 week period. They will have about 4-5 grams of fat removed by suction through
      a syringe and a biopsy of the skin in addition to studies of blood and stool samples.

      When they have completed the study with a 10% body weight loss they will be referred to a
      nutrition clinic which can counsel them to continue a slower weight loss to an optimal level.
