      ticagrelor or prasugrel as a treatment of choice in patients with both STEMI and NSTEMI
      (class of recommendation I, level of evidence B). Recommended dosing regimens of ticagrelor
      are identical in STEMI and NSTEMI patients, although epidemiology, clinical approach and
      early outcomes differ between these two types of myocardial infarction. It is not known
      whether PK and PD features of ticagrelor are uniform in STEMI and NSTEMI patients. However,
      the existing body of evidence suggest that PK and PD of ticagrelor may be attenuated in STEMI
      patients compared to healthy subjects and patients with stable coronary artery disease, which
      may expose STEMI patients at increased risk of developing thrombotic complications secondary
      to insufficient platelet inhibition. The PINPOINT study could provide a valuable insight into
      the knowledge regarding ticagrelor action in STEMI vs. NSTEMI patients.

      Since there is no reference study comparing pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor in STEMI and
      NSTEMI patients, we decided to perform an internal pilot study of approximately 30 patients
      (15 patients with each type of myocardial infarction) for estimating the final sample size.
