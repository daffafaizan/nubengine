    
      Mucositis (nasal, oral, pharyngeal, anal, or genital) is often experienced in relation to
      TKI, immunotherapy or mTOR inhibitor treatment in mRCC patients.

      The present trial will assess whether 12 weeks complementary treatment with folic acid in
      mRCC-patients receiving TKI- or mTOR inhibitor treatment or immunotherapy and displaying
      CTCAE mucositis grade â‰¥2 can reduce the degree of mucositis, compared to PLACEBO.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial of the effectiveness of
      folic acid supplement for 12 weeks on mucositis. Both arms will receive best supportive care.
      No crossover is allowed.

      The investigators anticipate a 24-month accrual period. The power calculation indicates a
      total of 50 patients per group are required.

      Block randomization based on received TKI/ mTOR inhibitor/IT-treatment will be performed.
