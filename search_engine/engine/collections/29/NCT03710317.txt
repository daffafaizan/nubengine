      sequence into one of two groups: one group received a pre-prepared sealed and opaque packet
      containing 400 μg of misoprostol (2 tablets of 200 μg), 2 ampoules of TA. The other group
      received similar packets containing two placebo tablets, two placebo ampoules (distilled
      water) and separate carbetocin ampoule (100 μg) for slow intravenous injection. The
      misoprostol and placebo tablets were similar in size, shape, and color, and ampoules of TA
      and carbetocin will be also similar to placebo. Randomization was done by the resident
      doctors immediately before transfer to the theater, whereas preparation of packets and
      confidential record maintenance was done by the labor room nursing staff.

      Study drug administration Group 1 100 μg carbetocin ampoule will be diluted in 10 mL normal
      saline and administered slowly (over 30-60 s) intravenously by the anesthetist after the
      birth of the baby

      Group 2 400 μg buccal misoprostol (2 tablets of 200 μg) will be given after spinal anesthesia
      and few minutes before skin incision in addition to 1 gm tranexamic acid in 100 mL of
      intravenous solution infusion over 15 min.
