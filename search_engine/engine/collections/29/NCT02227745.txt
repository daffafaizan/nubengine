    
      Patients referred to ophthalmology for developing type 2 diabetes subspecialist
      ophthalmologist evaluate the macula them by biomicroscopy, pupillary dilation, to detect
      clinically significant macular edema. EMCS diagnosis is made according to ETDRS criteria, and
      patients who were requested to submit fluorescein angiography.

      Patients presenting with focal leakage on angiography were scheduled focal photocoagulation;
      day focal photocoagulation is measured before the procedure Measurement of visual acuity,
      visual acuity, refraction Measuring contrast sensitivity Measurement of retinal sensitivity
      Measurement of Optical Coherence Tomography ophthalmoscopic review

      Subsequently photocoagulation treatment was applied according to the guidelines of the ETDRS
      (1-50 number of shots, shot diameter of 100 microns and 120-180 mW power) and the patient was
      re-evaluated at 4 weeks, which will repeat the testing day photocoagulation.

      The patient what the research project will be discussed, will be invited to participate, will
      be read and informed consent was explained, questions and concerns will be clarified during

      Patient 1 drop of topical drug in the treaty provided every 8 hours for 4 weeks eye is
      placed, the drug provided will be needed for 4 weeks, plus a control sheet dose delivery will
      be provided and shall be referenced again in April weeks later for evaluation:

      After 4 weeks of topical treatment, evaluation from 8:00 to 11 pm will be the same from the
