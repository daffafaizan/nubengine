      SARS, MERS, and now the newly emerged SARS-COV2 virus, have a major impact on morbidity and
      mortality worldwide, as well as having devastating global economic and societal impact.
      During these outbreaks it is critical to gain a rapid understanding of the exposures and
      immunity in the general population. Current ongoing serosurvey efforts to estimate the
      prevalence of infection/exposure are focused on the general population, but these estimates
      may not be applicable to individuals living with rare diseases. An effort to identify the
      impact of this pandemic on this community is underway in the Rare Disease Clinical Research
      Network (RDCRN) led by the Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) at Cincinnati
      Children s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) supported by NCATS. Through a survey they are
      attempting to evaluate infection rates and impact on those with rare diseases. In this study
      we propose to enroll a subset of the individuals participating in the RDCRN study to collect
      blood for SARS-Cov-2 antibody testing. This will allow us to add a biological marker to
      confirm infection/exposure and further our understanding of how widespread this infection is
      in the rare diseae community.
