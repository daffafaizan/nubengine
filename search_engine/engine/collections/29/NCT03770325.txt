      including lipids, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, coagulation factors, fasting
      glucose, insulin, adiposity (body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR)) and the
      mediation via testosterone and/or sex hormone binding globulin using a mechanistic, parallel
      RCT.

      Study design: a mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial in
      84 Chinese men in Hong Kong.

      Interventions: the eligible participants will be randomized to take berberine (500 mg orally
      twice a day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Blood samples will be taken at baseline, 8-week and
      12-week intervention.

      Data analysis and expected results: the investigators will use an intention to treat
      analysis, with multiple imputation for missing data. The investigators will compare the
      baseline characteristics of participants in the two arms using analysis of variance. The
      investigators will assess the effects of berberine on changes in CVD risk factors using
      analysis of variance, and the mediation using causal mediation analysis. Compared to the
      placebo group, the participants receiving berberine are expected to have lower burden of
      cardiovascular disease risk factors at the end of the intervention. These effects may be
      mediated or partly mediated by lowering testosterone.
