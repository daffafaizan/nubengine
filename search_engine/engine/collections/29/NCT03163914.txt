      anaesthesiologist (ASA) physiological status I-II will include this prospective, randomized
      clinical study. For randomisation of participants, computerized randomisation programme will
      use and they will divide into 4 groups. Basal value of systolic blood pressure(SBP) and heart
      rate (HR) will calculate with mean of the measure of 3 time SBP and HR before spinal
      anaesthesia. Spinal anaesthesia will perform with 5% marcain heavy 2 ml+20 microgram fentanyl
      at the point of lumbar 3-4 or 4-5 interspinous space to the all patients. After performed
      spinal anaesthesia, vasopressor infusion will start intravenously. Epinephrine,
      norepinephrine and phenylephrine will use for vasopressor infusion. Epinephrine will prepare
      5 mg/ml and infusion rate will adjust 30 ml/h for Group E. Norepinephrine will prepare 5
      mg/ml and infusion rate will adjust 30 ml/h for Group NE. Phenylephrine will prepare 100
      microg/ml and infusion rate will adjust 30 ml/h for Group P. salin infusion will launch 30
      ml/h for group Salin. If systolic blood pressure decrease 20% of basal value or below to 100
      mmHg, bolus ephedrine will apply intravenously (IV) for rescue drug. If heart rate will
      decrease 60 beat per min or 20% of basal value, atropine will apply IV.

      At the end of the study all collected data will use for statistically analysis.
