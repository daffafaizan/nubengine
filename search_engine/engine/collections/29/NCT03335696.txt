      2012-2013. A random sample of 800 of these participants was included in a sub-study
      comprising an MRI brain scan, a detailed clinical and cognitive assessment, and collection of
      blood and buccal mucosal samples for the characterisation of immune function and associated
      measures. Data collection for this sub-study started in 2012 and was completed by in 2016.
      The participants, for whom social and health records have been collected since 1985, were
      between 60-85 years of age at the time the MRI study started. The pre-specified clinical and
      cognitive assessment protocols, the state-of-the-art MRI sequences and latest pipelines for
      analyses of this sub-study have been published and are attached to this application.
