      medication adherence among patients with chronic heart failure (HF). The investigators will
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of this approach in this population and determine
      whether MT improves medication adherence. A prospective pre/post design study will be
      conducted among 50 stable outpatients with HF and sub-optimal medication adherence. MT
      sessions (one 30-min session/week over 8 weeks) will be phone-delivered by qualified
      mindfulness instructors. Data will be collected at baseline, and at 2- and 6-months since
      baseline.
