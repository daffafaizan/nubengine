    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TRC101 or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study will be
      progression of renal disease, defined by time to first occurrence of any event in the
      composite endpoint consisting of a confirmed â‰¥ 40% reduction in eGFR, end-stage renal disease
      (ESRD), and renal death. The study will terminate when the independent blinded Clinical
      Endpoint Adjudication Committee has positively adjudicated the targeted number of primary
      efficacy endpoint events. The maximum duration of follow-up for a randomized subject is
      anticipated to be approximately 6 years.
