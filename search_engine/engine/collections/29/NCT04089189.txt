    
      A total of 100 subjects with germline and/or systemic BRCA1/2 mutated advanced ovarian cancer
      is planned to be enrolled to observe the efficacy, safety, tolerability and PK profile of
      IMP4297.

      The primary objective is to assess ORR in subjects with germline and/or systemic BRCA1/2
      mutated advanced ovarian cancer with at least 2 prior lines of standard systemic therapy
      treated with IMP4297 capsules by independent imaging according to RECIST v1.1. Subjects will
      be treated until there is evidence of disease progression or any other discontinuation
      criterion is met. Best supportive care will be provided to all subjects and will be decided
      by investigators if there are no other specific restrictions within the protocol.

      Four to seven blood samples (approximately 2 mL/sample) are planned to be collected for each
      enrolled subject for the popPK and/or dose-response evaluation. Sample collection visits are
      planned on Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1, C1D15, C2D1, C3D1 and C4D1. The actual administration time,
      dose and blood collection time should be accurately recorded.
