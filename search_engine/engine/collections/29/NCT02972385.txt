      patient's providers will approach patients meeting the study criteria about participation in
      the study. Study personnel will not approach potential participants unless permission is
      given to the patient's provider. If the patient would like to participate in the study, study
      personnel will discuss details of the study in person during the patient's routine clinical
      care visit. There will also be a flyers available for posting and for distribution to
      potential participants.

      Participants consenting to the study will be asked to provide a cheek swab or mouthwash
      sample to provide buccal cells for DNA extraction. If the patient is receiving a blood draw
      during their regular clinical appointment, participants will be asked for a blood sample of
      15 milliliters. Genomic DNA will be isolated for genotyping and patient plasma samples will
      also be stored.

      Linear regression will be used to test association of SNPs with therapeutic warfarin dose
      using the algorithms derived by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Consortium. The
      primary phenotype (weekly stable warfarin dose) will be transformed by square root. SNPs and
      other variables associated with warfarin dose will be assessed in univariate analyses and
      entered into stepwise linear regression to determine the adjusted association with dose
      requirements using R2. Quality control procedures will include deviation from Hardy-Weinberg
      Equilibrium, and SNP and sample exclusions based on call rates. Ancestry-informative marker
      (AIM) analysis will be performed to estimate ancestry in each individual.
