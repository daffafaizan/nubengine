      study in 104 healthy volunteers, males and females, aged 18 to 45 years inclusive. The study
      will consists of 3 parts: Part 1, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) - participants will be
      administered a single dose (ranges from 9 mg to 900 mg) of DM1157 orally after fasting or a
      matching placebo; Part 2, Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) - participants will be administered
      three doses (ranges from 150 mg to 900 mg) of DM1157 orally once daily for three days after
      fasting or a matching placebo; and Part 3, Food Effect - participants will be administered
      300 mg of DM1157 orally with high fat meal or a matching placebo. Part 2 and Part 3 may be
      initiated after a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) review and approval of the of Part 1
      safety data. Study duration will be 16 months with patient participation duration 14 days for
      SAD and Food Effect, and 18 days for MAD. The primary objectives of this study are to: 1)
      assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of DM1157 at levels ranging from 9 mg to
      900 mg; 2) assess the safety and tolerability of DM1157 administered as single daily doses
      for 3 days at levels ranging from 150 mg to 900 mg; 3) assess the safety and tolerability of
      DM1157 administered with or without food. The secondary objectives are to: 1) assess the PK
      of single doses of DM1157 at levels ranging from 9 mg to 900 mg, including dose
      proportionality; 2) assess the PK of DM1157 administered as single daily doses for 3 days at
      levels ranging from 150 mg to 900 mg; 3) assess the PK of 300 mg DM1157 administered with or
      without food, including determination of the presence or absence of a food effect on
      exposure.
