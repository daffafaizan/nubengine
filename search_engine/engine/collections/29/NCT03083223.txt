      A questionnaire which consisted of a Subjects' Introduction Form and a Vital Signs-SaO2
      Record Form was used in collecting the data.

      The subjects were placed consecutively in random order in the five different positions,
      SSPB-45°, SSPB-60°, SPB-90°, LRSB-45°, and LLSB-45°, by drawing lots. Oxygen saturation
      (SaO2) and vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic
      blood pressure and body temperature) were measured in each position at 10, 25 and 40 minutes.
      Oxygen saturation and vital signs were measured with a finger pulse oximeter (Nellcor N-560).
      Nail polish was removed before measurement of oxygen saturation, and if there was any
      physical restraint on subjects it was removed. Body temperature was measured via the ear with
      a tympanic membrane thermometer (Covidiev Genius 2). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure
      were measured with a calibrated sphygmomanometer from the left arm with the same
      sphygmomanometer (Erka aneroid sphygmomanometer®) and stethoscope. Pulse rate and respiratory
      rate were manually monitored for a period of one minute by the researcher using a wristwatch.
      Verbal and written informed consent was obtained from the subjects or from their closest
      relatives.
