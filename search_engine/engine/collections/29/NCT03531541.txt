    
      Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and Cervical Joint Manipulation (CJM) are
      often used for pain treatment.

      TENS also promotes analgesia by activating a descending pathway, which originates in the
      periaqueductal grey (PAG) and in the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) to inhibit the
      excitability of nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

      Joint manipulation generates a series of stimuli within the central nervous system through
      the activation of proprioceptors located in the joint capsule or muscles, stimulates the PAG,
      causing pain inhibition by activation of non-opioid descending inhibitory pathways
