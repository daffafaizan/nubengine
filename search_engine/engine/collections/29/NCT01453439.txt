    
      Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a common and severe disorder in which a person is
      preoccupied by perceived defects in his or her appearance. The purpose of this research study
      is to learn more about two different forms of therapy to help individuals with BDD: cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT), a promising new treatment for BDD, and supportive psychotherapy
      (SPT), the most commonly received therapy for BDD. The investigators would like to find out
      which treatment is more effective for BDD. The investigators will also examine patient
      characteristics that may predict response to treatment.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to receive 22 sessions (over
      24 weeks) of either CBT or SPT. Both treatments teach participants about BDD. CBT focuses on
      helping participants to develop more adaptive thoughts and beliefs and to gradually reduce
      avoidance and compulsive (repetitive) behaviors. SPT focuses on relationships, feelings, and
      other factors that may affect BDD symptoms (e.g., work, stress), and helps participants to
      cope with challenges in their life by improving self-esteem and positive coping.

      For each participant, this study will last for 12 months. CBT and SPT sessions occur for 22
      sessions over 24 weeks. The severity of participants' BDD-related symptoms and other symptoms
      will be assessed at the end of treatment (week 24), and at 3- and 6-months after treatment
      ends.
