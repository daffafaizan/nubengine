      prescriptions, hospital admissions, including emergencies, and repeated treatment failures,
      in the absence of specific treatment of psychopathological problematic background. Indeed
      many arguments lead to evoke the existence of a functioning underlying addictive type, rather
      than a problem of suicide, especially from the second recurrence (often characterized by low
      lethality and suicidal intentionality). This impulsive behavior and / or compulsive
      repeatedly would not simply the consequence of a pharmacological benzodiazepine dependence
      (it is also not systematic), but would demonstrate a similar operation to that of behavioral
      addictions. Furthermore, a preliminary study has shown that this type of behavior was not
      limited to a BPD personality type, since it is mainly found pathological personalities
      depressive and avoidant types.

      In this context it is urgent to make an accurate characterization of these patients IMVr
      because the integration of the addictive dimension in their care will adapt strategies
      psychotherapeutic, pharmacological, and the terms of issue of psychotropic and especially
      benzodiazepines .
