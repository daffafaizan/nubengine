      I. To maintain a Childhood Cancer Registry for infants, children, adolescents, and young
      adults with cancer.

      II. To utilize clinical and biological data to help determine eligibility or stratification,
      based on childhood cancer disease classification schemas, for potential enrollment of
      research subjects onto Children's Oncology Group (COG) therapeutic clinical trials.

      III. To develop a well annotated childhood cancer biorespository for current and future
      research through the collection of biospecimens (at diagnosis, time of progression, time of
      recurrence and/or post-mortem), including tumor, host and when feasible parental germline
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); and key clinical data, including presentation, diagnostic,
      staging, summary treatment, and outcome information, from every child diagnosed with cancer
      at COG institutions.

      IV. To allow use of registry data for permission to be contacted in the future to consider
      participating in non-therapeutic and prevention research studies involving the child or their
      parents.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo medical data review to create a Childhood Cancer Registry. Patients also
      undergo collection of biospecimen samples (e.g., tissue, blood, bone marrow, plasma, serum,
      saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine).
