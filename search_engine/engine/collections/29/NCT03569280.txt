    
      This Phase 1 study will comprise two parts: Part 1 will be a 3+3 dose escalation design to
      characterize the MTD and a RP2D, Part 2 will be an expansion cohort at RP2D. In Part 1,
      multiple escalating dose levels of KPG-121 (six cohorts: 1.5, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, and 30
      mg/day) in combination with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone or Apalutamide will be evaluated to
      determine the MTD and RP2D of KPG-121. A RP2D will be selected based on the MTD as well as
      the information including safety, efficacy, and PSA data. The Part 2 will follow the same
      schedule of procedures as Part 1 once the RP2D has been decided. For the expansion cohort of
      part 2, subjects will be given the RP2D once daily for 21 consecutive days along with
      Enzalutamide or Abiraterone or Apalutamide followed by 7 days without KPG-121 for each 28-day
      cycle.
