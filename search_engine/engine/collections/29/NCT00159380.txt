      particularly airway epithelial cells, and its increased concentration in asthma is likely to
      derive from inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expressed in inflamed airways. To evaluate whether
      an increased bronchial flux of NO (ie, airway wall NO flux [Jno] in picoliters per second)
      produced in the large airways is due to an enzyme overexpression, we administered a
      relatively selective iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine, by nebulization in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled manner in asthmatic and healthy subjects and also investigated whether the
      same concentration of inhibitor has any effect on NO produced in the peripheral lungs (ie,
      alveolar NO concentration [Calv] in parts per billion [ppb]) or on the diffusing capacity of
      NO (Dno) [in picoliters per second-1 per ppb-1) in the airways. Aminoguanidine administration
      resulted in a significant reduction in Jno compared with administration of the saline
      solution control in eight healthy subjects and in eight patients with asthma but caused no
      significant changes in Calv or in Dno in either group.
