      autopsied stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) at all regional hospitals in our region.
      We will also estimate the number of non-hospitalized strokes and TIAs by screening for
      potential cases at more than 100 outpatient sites throughout five counties in Greater
      Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky. We plan to identify and abstract detailed information from the
      medical record for every potential case. These results will be compared with data from all
      stroke patients identified by similar methodology in all study periods.

      In addition, we have interviewed 1500 ischemic stroke patients and/or their families in the
      study periods 1999-2010 to obtain detailed information including demographic information,
      functional outcome and quality of life, access to and type of rehabilitation therapy, social
      support, caregiver availability and health status, access to post-hospital care, health
      insurance status, current health status, medications, prior risk factors, and knowledge about
      stroke signs and symptoms. We also obtained genetic material via a blood sample for most of
      this cohort.
