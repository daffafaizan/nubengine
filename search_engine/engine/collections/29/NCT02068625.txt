      In previous experimental studies neuroprotection by rasagiline has been shown in rds-mice, a
      model for slow retinal degeneration. It is known from these experiments that rasagiline
      specifically delays apoptosis, but also modifies inflammation and autophagy. The
      bioavailability of the drug in the central nervous system is high, and based on the
      literature is sufficient in the retina.

      In retinal detachments the outer layers of the neurosensory retina are deprived of nutrients
      and degeneration of the photoreceptors occurs fast. This is particularly relevant in the
      macular area of the retina where the density of photoreceptors is high, such that visual
      acuity recovery can be significantly limited by photoreceptor loss.

      Objective

      To assess the neuroprotective effect of oral rasagiline (1mg daily for 7 days) administered
      perioperatively in patients undergoing surgical retinal detachment repair for central vision
      involving retinal detachments.

      Methods

      In this clinical trial, patients suffering from retinal detachments affecting the fovea get
      randomly assigned to perioperative oral treatment with either rasagiline (1mg) or placebo
      once daily for 7 days. Pharmacologic treatment is initiated at the time of hospital
      admission, usually the day before surgery. The main outcome of the study is visual acuity six
      months after surgical retinal detachment repair. Structural differences of the neurosensory
      retina between groups will be analysed by optical coherence tomography, a non-invasive
      imaging method for retinal pathology.
