      centers in the United States, Canada and Europe. The target enrollment for study completion
      is 2,100 subjects.

      At each study visit, blood specimens are collected from subjects, processed and stored in the
      sample archive, with corresponding patient information entered into the clinical database.
      The analysis plan for each study objective includes a defined sample selection protocol that
      stipulates the inclusion and exclusion criteria for both patients and samples, and also the
      required number of blood specimens for the molecular analyses to achieve statistical
      significance.

      The diagnosis and treatment of acute cellular rejection remains a clinical management
      priority that is currently based on transbronchial biopsy. Gene expression profiling is a
      technology based on molecular biology that measures changes in the RNA levels of different
      genes expressed by circulating mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood. A key goal of the
      project is to use gene expression profiling to differentiate between the absence and presence
      of lung allograft acute cellular rejection, with the aim of using this novel information to
      develop a non-invasive diagnostic testing alternative.
