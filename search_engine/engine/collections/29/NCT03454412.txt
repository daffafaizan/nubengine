    
      Intensive Neurophysiological Rehabilitation System is a novel multimodal rehabilitation
      approach that combines different treatment modalities. The treatment course lasts for 2 weeks
      with daily therapy up to 4 hours. Main treatment programs include biomechanical correction of
      the spine, extremity joint mobilization, physical and occupational therapy, reflexotherapy,
      special massage system, rhythmical group exercises, mechanotherapy and computer games therapy
      and some other.

      Preliminary observational studies indicate an improvement of gross and fine motor functions
      in children with Cerebral Palsy after the treatment course.

      The aim of the study is to observe the effects of Intensive Neurophysiological Rehabilitation
      System on hand function in children with spastic cerebral palsy.

      About 50 patients with spastic forms of cerebral palsy with mild to moderate impairment of
      hand function (Level I to III according to Manual Abilities Classification System) would be
      evaluated before and after the two-week treatment course.

      This study may help to generate the hypothesis of the effects of the Intensive treatment
      course on hand function abilities and to prepare a future randomized controlled trial.
