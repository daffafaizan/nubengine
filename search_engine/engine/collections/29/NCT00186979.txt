    
      Objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of the combination of irinotecan and
           ZD1839 when given on this schedule.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of gefitinib alone and in
           combination with irinotecan and vincristine.

        -  To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gefitinib in combination with escalating
           intravenous irinotecan by using selective intestinal decontamination with oral cefixime
           or cefpodoxime to prevent diarrhea.

        -  To estimate the MTD of vincristine (MTD) in combination with gefitinib and irinotecan.

      Details of Treatment Interventions

      First Cohort:

      Standard dose escalation, starting at ZD1839 150 mg/m2/day for 21 days in combination with
      irinotecan 15mg/m2/day on a daily x 5 for two consecutive week schedule. Dose-limiting
      diarrhea was seen in this cohort. ZD scheduled was reduced to 12 days. The first dose level
      (1a) consisted of ZD1839 112.5mg/m2/day for 12 days + irinotecan 15mg/m2/day daily x 5 x 2
      and was found to be the MTD in this cohort.

      Second Cohort:

      Cefixime then added at 4 additional subjects were enrolled at dose level 1c, consisting of
      ZD1839 at 112mg/m2/day + irinotecan 20mg/m2/day + cefixime 8 mg/kg/day administered once
      daily, beginning on day -1, and continued to day 14.

      Third Cohort:

      Irinotecan/ZD1839/Vincristine/Cefixime- Cefixime 8 mg/kg/day administered once daily,
      beginning on day -1, and continued to day 14, with a maximum dose of 400 mg daily + gefitinib
      112.5 mg/m2 orally, daily for 12 days and irinotecan at 15 mg/m2 daily x 5 x 2 +1 mg/m2
      (maximum 2mg/dose) on days 1 and 8 with escalating dose of VCR as tolerated.
