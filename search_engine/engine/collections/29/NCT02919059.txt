      has been well demonstrated, firstly after CAFÃ‰ study, with 2073 hypertensive subjects
      followed up 3.4 years. It also evidenced higher prognostic value of central blood pressure
      compared to peripheral blood pressure. One year later, the STRONG study, showed central pulse
      pressure to be an independent cardiovascular risk factor as well as higher prognostic value
      compared to peripheral pulse pressure (Hazard ratio; 1,1510 mmHg Vs 1,10mmHg; X2: 13,4; p <
      0,001). Those subjects with higher central blood pressure and central pulse pressure showed
      higher incidence of cardiovascular events. This superiority of central pressure versus
      peripheral measures to predict cardiovascular events has also been reported in general
      population or in elder people.

      Finally, it has been also reported that dapagliflozin modestly reduces systolic blood
      pressure in patients with T2DM who were mostly receiving treatment for hypertension. Despite
      office blood pressure remains the gold standard method for screening, diagnostic and
      treatment of hypertension, it has been also well demonstrated that ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring (ABPM) better estimates cardiovascular risk and target organ damage than office
      blood pressure. It still remains unclear the effects on 24 hours blood pressure reduction
      with SGLT-2 inhibitors.

      The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on central blood pressure reduction have not been documented.
