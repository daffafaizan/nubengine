      approved clinical studies of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). An additional purpose of
      this protocol is to develop a registry of individuals who have been evaluated through the NIA
      Clinical Research Unit screening clinic. To participate, volunteers/patients must meet the
      specific requirements of at least one of the available NIA research studies. This protocol
      serves as a first step for admitting volunteers/patients to an appropriate approved protocol,
      and it is used to develop a registry of individuals who meet eligibility criteria for
      existing research projects.
