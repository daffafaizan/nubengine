    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study to compare the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of encorafenib and binimetinib plus pembrolizumab (Triplet
      Arm) versus placebo plus pembrolizumab (Control Arm) in participants with metastatic or
      unresectable locally advanced BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive melanoma. The study will have an
      open-label safety lead-in (SLI) phase to determine the safety recommended phase 3 dose (RP3D)
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of encorafenib and binimetinib plus pembrolizumab combination
      therapy prior to initiation of the randomized Phase 3 part of the study. Two dose levels of
      encorafenib in combination with binimetinib plus pembrolizumab will be explored in parallel.
      A minimum of 12 evaluable participants will be enrolled per dose level. During the
      double-blind randomized Phase 3 part of the study, approximately 600 eligible participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Triplet Arm (at RP3D determined in the SLI) or
      Control Arm (approximately 300 participants per arm). Randomization will be stratified by
      prior systemic adjuvant therapy and stage of disease by AJCC (ED8)
