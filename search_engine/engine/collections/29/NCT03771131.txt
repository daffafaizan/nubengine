      application to the program. Both experimental and control group underwent a
      neuropsychological assessment to investigate different cognitive domains, before and after
      (~3 months) the training program. Based on the scores obtained during the preliminary
      neuropsychological assessment, the participants of the experimental training group were
      divided into small subgroups (ranging from 8 to 12 subjects) to further address
      individualization of training (i.e. level of difficulty of the exercises proposed). The
      experimental group attended weekly sessions of the multi-domain cognitive training. Each
      session lasted around one hour and the overall duration of the training was of 3 months, for
      a total of 13 sessions. To promote improvement transfer to everyday life, some of the
      exercises proposed were ecological in their nature, in that, they asked participants to solve
      tasks that recalled everyday situations (such as remembering names or road maps).
      Furthermore, throughout the training, approximately once every two sessions brief
      psycho-educational interventions were provided.
