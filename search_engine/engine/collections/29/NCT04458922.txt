      I. Determine the objective response rates (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 of atezolizumab in adult (>= 18 years) and
      pediatric/adolescent (>= 2 years) patients with clear cell sarcoma (CCS) and chondrosarcoma
      (CS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine duration of response (DOR) using RECIST v 1.1 and/or change in clinical symptoms
      (time frame: baseline until disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of
      another anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or study termination).

      II. Measure progression-free survival (PFS) time (time frame: baseline until disease
      progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of another anti-cancer treatment,
      withdrawal of consent, or study termination).

      III. Assess the number of activated CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumor before and after
      atezolizumab treatment, and correlate treatment-induced changes with clinical response.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare RECIST v 1.1 versus (vs) immune RECIST (iRECIST) in patients with CCS and CS on
      atezolizumab.

      II. Examine changes in PD-1/PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment before and after
      atezolizumab treatment, and correlate treatment-induced changes with clinical response.

      III. Evaluate potential associations between atezolizumab activity and tumor genomic
      alterations.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 30 days.
