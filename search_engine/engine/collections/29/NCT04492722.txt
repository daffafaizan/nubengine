      overall study period will be around 28 weeks. Approximately 632 participants comprising of
      67% diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and 33% non-DKD participants will be enrolled. After a
      screening period of up to 4 weeks, the participants will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to
      receive one of the doses of AZD5718 and/or placebo for the first 12 weeks (Day 85 [treatment
      period 1]), with an add-on therapy of 8 weeks of dapagliflozin for all participants from Week
      12 to 20 (Day 85 to 141 [treatment period 2]). Only participants still taking their assigned
      treatment from treatment period 1 will progress to treatment period 2. Any participant with
      urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) < 30 mg/g at Week 12 will be excluded from treatment
      period 2. The eligibility check to enter treatment period 2 will be done at Visit 7 (Week 12)
      using the last available urine ACR result. The final analysis will be done after all
      participants have completed follow-up period of up to 4 weeks. The expected total study
      duration, including the Screening Period, for each participant will be at least 28 weeks.
