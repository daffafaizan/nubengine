      blood vessels on healthy volunteers. These studies will be conducted in the NIH MRI systems
      located at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. These procedures may involve the
      intravenous administration of commercially available MR contrast media, supine exercise or
      the inflation of blood pressure cuffs on the lower extremities during the MRI imaging. The
      results will be used to evaluate the performance of various research pulse sequences,
      gradient coils, and radiofrequency receiver coils on human subjects and will provide
      essential ground work for specific patient protocols, both diagnostic and therapeutic.
