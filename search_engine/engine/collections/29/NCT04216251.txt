    
      This prospective, single-arm, research study evaluating the effect of AMR101, as a
      chemopreventive agent to reduce risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a history of
      colorectal adenoma.

        -  AMR101 is made of marine omega-3 fatty acid, which is a family of natural substances
           found in the oil of certain fish, such as salmon and mackerel. Marine omega-3 fatty acid
           cannot be produced in sufficient amount by the human body and has to be obtained through
           diet or supplemented to maintain normal function in the body.

        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved AMR101 as a treatment for
           any disease.

        -  AMR101 is commercially available in the US as VASCEPA (icosapent ethyl)

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
           including evaluations and follow up visits, including:

             -  Lifestyle questionnaire,

             -  Nutritional survey

             -  Flexible sigmoidoscopy (24 biopsies of normal colorectal mucosa, one stool sample)

             -  Blood samples,

        -  AMR101 administered daily, orally for 8-12 weeks and it is expected 80 participants will
           take part.
