    
      Sample size: 45 subjects

      Site Locations: Sheba medical center

      Patients: Patients presenting with an acute MI with onset of symptoms  6h, and planned to
      undergo primary PCI will be included. The target lesion should be located in the proximal or
      middle segment of a main native coronary artery, and should be suitable for percutaneous
      intervention.

      Primary Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of 2 vs 4 cycles of postconditioning
      method during primary PCI and direct stenting in acute MI, and to compared to primary PCI and
      direct stenting without the postconditioning.

      Primary Endpoint:

        -  ST segment resolution.

        -  Segmental wall motion score, resolution of edema and wall thickness by echocardiography.

        -  Infarct size estimation by cardiac enzymes and cardiac MRI.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Composite endpoint of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) at 30 and 90 days

      Methods:

        -  ECG at baseline, immediately after procedure, 90 and 180 minutes after the procedure and
           6-24 hours after intervention.

        -  Core laboratory angiography measurements of TIMI flow, corrected TIMI Frame count,
           myocardial blush score and left ventricular angiography.

        -  Myocardial enzymes measurements: every 4 hours in the first 24 hours and every 6 hours
           in the following 48 hours.

        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction and wall motion score determined by echocardiography.

        -  Cardiac MRI estimation of infarct size. • Clinical follow-up at 30 and 90 days post
           procedure.

      Follow-up:

        -  Follow up at 30 days: Clinical.

        -  Clinical Follow up & Cardiac MRI at 90 days.
