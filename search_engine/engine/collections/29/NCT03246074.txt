    
      This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized multicenter dose-escalation study with the
      primary objective to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of fostamatinib when
      administered with weekly paclitaxel in women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      Between 8 and 18 adult female subjects will be enrolled and receive weekly paclitaxel in
      combination with increasing doses of fostamatinib. There will be three dosing intervals of
      fostamatinib (100 mg bid, 150 mg bid, and 200mg bid) selected based on prior phase I studies
      of single agent fostamatinib. Dose-escalation will follow a modified toxicity probability
      interval (mTPI) design. In this study, up to 18 adult female subjects will be enrolled and
      receive weekly paclitaxel in combination with fostamatinib at the MTD of the combination; at
      least 6 patients with receive fostamatinib plus paclitaxel at the MTD.
