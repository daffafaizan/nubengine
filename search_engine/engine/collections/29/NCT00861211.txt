      KCa3.1 in the function of several different cell types involved in the inflammatory response,
      and the effects seen in an animal model of allergic asthma, it is reasonable to explore the
      utility of senicapoc, a KCa3.1 blocker, as a novel treatment of asthma. This study will test
      the ability of senicapoc to alleviate bronchospasm induced by an allergen challenge in
      patients with allergic asthma. It is analogous to the study performed in animals in which
      senicapoc demonstrated the ability to reduce airway resistance and hyper-responsiveness
      induced by airway challenge with antigen and carbachol, respectively. This study is also the
      first to test the ability of senicapoc to reduce airway inflammation, which is the key
      pathophysiologic process in asthma. In summary, with a demonstrated safety profile across a
      wide range of doses in humans and efficacy in an animal model of allergic bronchospasm and
      hyper-responsiveness, the initiation of exploratory studies of senicapoc for treatment of
      asthma is justified.
