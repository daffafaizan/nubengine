      various autologous therapies for the treatment of knee OA. Differences in the processing of
      autologous therapies can yield substantial differences in the resulting output. It appears
      that the safety of autologous therapies is roughly equivalent across different processing
      methods. However, making generalizations regarding the effectiveness across these autologous
      therapies is more complicated. Thus, each autologous therapy requires independent efficacy
      evaluation. nSTRIDE APS has been shown to decrease pain, increase function and have a
      favorable safety profile in a small pilot trial. However, demonstration of the treatment
      effects in a more heterogeneous population is lacking. Further, neither the effect time
      course nor the utility of multiple injections has been documented. This study will allow for
      low burden, efficient data collection in a larger heterogeneous population of persons
      suffering from knee OA. The study will document the treatment effects and timeline of
      treatment effects for nSTRIDE APS following single or repeated injections.
