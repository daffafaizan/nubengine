      (ZCT450,ZCT525 and ZCT600) toric IOLs. Some subjects had the higher cylinder toric IOLs in
      both eyes with other subjects having a higher cylinder toric IOL in one eye and the lower
      cylinder toric IOL in the other eye.

      Per the statistical plan, data for the ZCT450/525/600 toric IOLs were to be pooled together
      and reported as one group.

      The primary endpoint is the rate of severe visual distortions reported by subject at 6 months
      via questionnaire. The analysis population for this endpoint will be bilaterally implanted
      subjects with a high cylinder IOL (ZCT450/525/600) in the primary eye and a high cylinder IOL
      (ZCT450/525/600) or a low cylinder IOL (ZCT300/400) in the fellow eye.

      There were no formal secondary endpoints. Data from a few other endpoints (rate of IOL
      repositioning due to IOL misalignment and percent change in cylinder) have been reported. For
      these endpoints the analysis population contains all subjects implanted with a ZCT450/525/600
      in at least one eye.

      Adverse events were reported by subject for all subjects with a high cylinder IOL
      (ZCT450/525/600) in at least one eye.
