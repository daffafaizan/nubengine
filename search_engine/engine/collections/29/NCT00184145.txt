      specific (animal) phobia than relaxation immediately after treatment and at follow-up.
      Secondly to test whether an additional one-session exposure therapy offered to both treatment
      groups (EMDR patients and relaxation patients) improves outcome in the EMDR-group and results
      in equal outcome for both treatment groups.
