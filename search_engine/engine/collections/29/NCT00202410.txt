    
      Vaccination with the Tuberculosis Mycobacterium has proved to be effective in the animal
      model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalitis.

      In a study of phase I-II our group has demonstrated the safety of this therapy together with
      preliminary evidence.

      The study includes patients with an initial disease (diagnosis supported by paraclinical
      criteria): single clinical poly or mono-symptomatic attack in the 6 months preceding the
      study, MR picture compatible with MS.

      Study design 100 randomized patients (i.e. randomly assigned) to be included either in a
      group of 50 patients undergoing therapy or to a group of 50 patients receiving placebo.

      Patients are followed up with monthly contrast MRI for 6 months. At the end of the six months
      the disease activity in the group of treated patients is benchmarked with the disease
      activity of the group of patients receiving placebo.

      Safety is granted by the extremely wide diffusion of this kind of vaccination worldwide and
      by the previous study in patients affected by multiple sclerosis.
