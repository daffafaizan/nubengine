      percutaneous osteotomy-osteoclasis technique. The mean age was 46 months. Genu varum was
      bilateral in 52 children and unilateral in 18 with a mean preoperative proximal medial tibial
      angle 66.67 Â± 2.670. Under general anesthesia, transverse osteotomy osteoclasis was performed
      below the tibial tuberosity. Follow-up radiograph was done within the first post-operative
      week and then every two weeks to assess alignment and consolidation.
