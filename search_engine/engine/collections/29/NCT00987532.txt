      developed and developing nations. More effective interventions to prevent inactivity in
      childhood thus are urgently needed. The preschool years, including the adiposity rebound
      period, might represent a good window of opportunity. Study literature suggests that
      targeting parents is crucial for lasting changes in young childrens' behavior. However, it is
      not known which methods are effective for involving parents in physical activity promotion.
      Consistent with experience from community-based participatory research, encouraging parents
      to participate the intervention in terms of content and structure might lead to higher
      intervention effectivity and sustainability. In our study, we therefore "enriched" a
      child-centered physical activity intervention in preschools (twice weekly gym lessons over 6
      months) with a parent-focused participatory community intervention component.
