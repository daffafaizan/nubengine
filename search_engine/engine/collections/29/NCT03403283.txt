      endothelial progenitor cells (EPC's) are defective in people with diabetes. Diabetic
      retinopathy (DR) is an eye disease related to diabetes. It can cause blurred vision and
      possible bleeding in the blood vessels in the back of the eye (retina). Damage to the cells
      of the blood vessels from DR can cause vision loss or blindness. Even with current
      treatments, the quality of life for people with DR is much reduced.
