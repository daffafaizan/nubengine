      I. To validate the use of intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) for better definition of
      tumor margins therefore, minimizing the necessity of a second surgical procedure to obtain
      negative margins.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive indocyanine green solution intravenously (IV) between 2-8 hours before
      surgery. Fluorescence measurements are taken from all specimens removed during surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 48 hours.
