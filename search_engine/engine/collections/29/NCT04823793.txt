      increasing worldwide. Early detection of CRC can provide great opportunities to help
      patients, increasing their 5-year survival rate. Colonoscopy has been considered as the
      golden standard of CRC screening method, but the invasive procedures cannot be widely adapted
      by recipients.

      Nowadays, the most common CRC screening method is fecal immunochemical test (FIT) which is a
      cost-effective and non-invasive approach. The sensitivity of FIT for CRC detection is about
      80%, but only 20% for adenoma.

      The methylation level of candidate genes are determined by qMSP to estimate the risk of
      colorectal cancer. This study implements fecal DNA methylation test and fecal immunochemical
      test simultaneously to evaluate whether the fecal DNA methylation test can improve the
      detection rate of adenoma and CRC.
