      administration simulator improves nursing students' medication administration safety within
      simulated practice; increases student self-efficacy and knowledge of the medication
      administration process; and, improves motivational and cognitive processing attributes
      related to student learning in a technology-enabled environment. It is hoped that by
      completing this trial, the effectiveness of using an eMAR simulator as an educational tool to
      better prepare nursing students to administer medications using eMAR technology for practice
      will be ascertained.
