      malnutrition and wasting. Thalidomide has been proposed as an effective therapy for severe
      forms of aphthous ulceration in AIDS patients.

      Patients are randomized to receive 4 weeks of either thalidomide or placebo orally,
      administered once daily. Patients are followed weekly. Complete responders after 4 weeks of
      acute treatment enter a 24-week maintenance phase. A pharmacokinetic substudy will be
      included.
