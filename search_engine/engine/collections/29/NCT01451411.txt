      be further stratified in a 1:1:2 ratio for age groups: 2-5 years, 6-10 years, and 11-17
      years.

      Subjects will need to remain hospitalized for the 48-hour Treatment Period through Hour 96
      (Day 4). There will be a follow-up safety visit on Day 9 or day of hospital discharge,
      whichever occurs first. There is a final follow-up phone call at Day 32 to assess if any
      serious adverse events have occurred since hospital discharge.
