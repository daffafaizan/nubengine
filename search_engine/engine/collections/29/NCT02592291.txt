      (SCI),Cerebral Palsy (CP), Spina Bifida (SB), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), often require
      complex self-management routines to manage various needs such as bowel and bladder, skin
      integrity, and general health and wellness. Tasks such as self-catheterization, bowel
      regimens, skin checks, and routine administration of medications require consistent
      follow-through to prevent complications. Early detection and treatment of problems such as
      urinary tract infections (UTIs) or wounds, can prevent serious complications like
      osteomyelitis and sepsis which can result in hospitalization, death, and expensive medical
      care. The investigators have developed an innovative mobile health (mHealth) system aimed at
      improving self-management skills and preventing and detecting early signs of secondary
      medical complications. The system consist of a mobile health applications (apps), a clinician
      portal and a two-way secure communication system between the two. People with complex care
      regimens can use the apps to get reminders or cues to carry out their self care routines such
      as bowel/bladder routines, take medications, report success with their activities or new
      problems (e.g. new wound, UTI symptoms etc.), and track symptoms of depression. A clinician
      can use the portal to view the report and communicate with the users through a secure
      communication system that is embedded in the apps.

      This study will assess the benefits of using the system in improving users' wellness and
      self-management skills compared to those who receive standard of care only.
