      perhaps IIE-1) Hp-positive gastric pure (de novo) DLBCL. The status of NF-kB, BCL10, BAFF,
      and CagA IHC nuclear staining will help to tailoring the treatment for early-stage gastric
      pure (de novo) DLBCL. And 50-60% of stage IE / IIE-1 pure (de novo) DLBCL patients can be
      cured by 2-weeks of antibiotics rather than the 6-months of relatively toxic front-line
      systemic chemotherapy. The investigators shall also elucidate the distribution of CYP2C18/19
      in patients with pure (de novo) DLBCL and their association with the efficacy of sequential
      antibiotics for eradication of Hp infection.
