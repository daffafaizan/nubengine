      differentiate vibroacoustic signals in inpatients with and without confirmed COVID-19 as the
      first step to establish the performance characteristics - sensitivity, specificity, positive
      and negative predictive value - of the imPulse™ Una device for early and rapid, point-of-care
      diagnosis of COVID-19. This will inform the utility and design of further larger-scale
      studies using the device.
