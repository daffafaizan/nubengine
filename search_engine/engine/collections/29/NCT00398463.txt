    
      This study will investigate the effect of treatment with a high bolus dosage of Tirofiban (in
      addition to Aspirin, Heparin and 300mg or 600mg clopidogrel) on the rate of periprocedural
      myocardial infarction compared to Aspirin, Heparin (or bivalirudin) and 300mg or 600mg
      clopidogrel alone in patients resistant to aspirin and/or to clopidogrel.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled (with bailout tirofiban as rescue)
      multicenter study. Enrollment will last between 12 and 36 months depending on the final
      number of participating centres. The minimum follow-up will be 30 days after the index
      procedure.
