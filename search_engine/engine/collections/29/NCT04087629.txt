      Steroids are known to cause many side effects and few effective pharmacologic alternatives
      exist. Contact dermatitis is observed in 56% of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
      (CTCL) being treated with topical mechlorethamine gel. This usually requires chronic
      treatment with mid-to high-potency steroids. Numerous chemo/immunotherapies are associated
      with cutaneous reactions including paronychia, hand and foot syndrome, and acneiform rash.
      Skin toxicity often requires dose reduction of cancer therapies and a variety of skin
      directed therapies including topical antibiotics and topical steroids. Cutaneous reactions
      are often the earliest manifestation of acute graft versus host disease. Skin manifestations
      can be debilitating and treatment usually requires high potency topical steroids. Additional
      therapies are needed for the treatment of disorders that rely on topical steroids.
