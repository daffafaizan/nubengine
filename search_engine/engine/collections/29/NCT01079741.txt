    
      This is a Phase I open label dose escalation study of the TLR3 agonist Poly-ICLC as an
      adjuvant for NY-ESO-1 protein vaccination in patients with high risk melanoma in clinical
      complete remission (cCr), followed by a randomized Phase II component in which patients will
      be randomized to subcutaneous vaccination of NY-ESO-1 protein with Poly-ICLC alone dose TBD
      (Arm A) or with NY-ESO-1 protein, Poly-ICLC dose TBD and MontanideÂ® ISA-51 VG (Montanide)
      (Arm B).

      Patients with histological confirmed malignant melanoma, AJCC Stages: IIB, IIC, III or IV,
      who are in complete clinical remission (cCr) but at high risk of disease recurrence, will be
      eligible for enrollment, regardless of whether antigen expression in the autologous tumor can
      be demonstrated by either PCR or immunohistochemistry.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To define the safety of subcutaneous vaccination with NY-ESO-1 protein,
           Montanide and escalating doses of Poly-ICLC.

        -  Phase II: To evaluate the induction of humoral and T cell (CD4+ and CD8+) immunity to
           subcutaneous vaccination with NY-ESO-1 protein in combination with Poly-ICLC when given
           with or without Montanide.

      Exploratory analyses:

        -  Evaluation of primary tumor expression of NY-ESO-1 by IHC or RT-PCR.

        -  Histologic quantitation of original tumor TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes), CD3+
           cells, evaluation of mitotic index and correlation of this data with immunologic
           response.

        -  Correlation of NY-ESO-1 specific T cell responses with HLA type

        -  Investigation of polymorphisms for TLR3 through germline SNP analysis.

        -  Clinical Outcome (Time to Progression) reported descriptively.

        -  Skin section analysis of protein/adjuvant treated sites for immune cell infiltration and
           gene expression analysis
