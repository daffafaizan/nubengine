      prolongs the filter life when compared to enoxaparin.

      Fondaparinux is the first compound of a new class of synthetic oligosaccharides with
      antithrombotic effects. It represents the active portion of the natural heparin molecule.

      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in filter life when using fondaparinux or
      enoxaparin as anticoagulation for haemofiltration.
