    
      In a double-blind, placebo, diet, and training controlled design, 57 subjects will
      participate in an eight week, resistance and high intensity interval training study to assess
      the ergogenic potential of elevATP with and without caffeine plus vitamins in comparison to a
      visually identical, equal volume placebo within a periodized training program (described
      below). Prior to testing or training, subjects will report to the laboratory for screening
      and familiarization with testing protocols. The following week, subjects will complete
      baseline testing for all measurements including a 3 day food log. During the next eight
      weeks, subjects will participate in a periodized resistance training program which alters the
      repetition and loading schemes daily and weekly. During the entirety of the training
      protocol, subjects will supplement daily with either 1 serving of elevATP, 1 serving of Dropz
      (elevATP + caffeine), or 1 serving of an equal volume, visually identical placebo.
      Measurements will be repeated at the end of weeks 4 and 8, 10, and 12.

        -  Myokines and biomarkers of regeneration panels (weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12): Analysis to be
           performed by VDF FutureCeuticals, Inc. MusclePharm to ship frozen serum samples (1-2ml)
           from all subjects to VDF FutureCeuticals, care of Zbigniew Pietrzkowski, 16259 Laguna
           Canyon Rd, Irvine, CA 92618

      Resistance training protocol

      Will consist of a daily undulating periodization design with high volume, high velocity, and
      high intensity workouts. Exercises performed will be the back squat, bench press, deadlift,
      leg press, bent row, shoulder press, pulldown, dips, bicep curl, tricep extension, single-arm
      row, hammer strength chest press, lateral raise, incline bench press, power squat, leg
      extension, and leg curl. Exercises will be performed for 1-15 repetitions, 3-5 sets, and with
      0.5-5 minutes rest between sets.

      Diet Each subject will receive a personalized diet to suit their individual needs. Total
      calories will be calculated based on the Mifflin St. Jeor equation. One half of total
      calories will be derived from carbohydrates, while fats and proteins will equally compose the
      remaining one half of total calories.
