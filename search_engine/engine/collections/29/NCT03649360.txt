      The treatment of choice for unstable diaphyseal fractures in the tibia is reamed insertion of
      an intramedullary nail (IMN) with the additional placement of interlocking screws. The most
      common complication after insertion of an IMN as treatment of tibial shaft fractures is
      chronic knee pain with reported rates between 10 % and 87 % with a mean of 47,4 % in
      metaanalyses.

      Methods

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcome after inserting an
      IMN in patients with a tibial shaft fracture using an injury-specific questionnaire.

      This study includes patients operated on five Danish hospitals. A database search was made
      using operational codes for insertion of an IMN in a five-year period. Patients aged 18 years
      or older, alive and residing in Denmark at the time of follow-up could be included in the
      study. These patients then received a Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS)
      questionnaire by mail with questions regarding knee-specific symptoms, stiffness, pain,
      function and quality of life. Questionnaires were filled out and returned to the
      corresponding physician for further analyze. Patients who were unable to fill out the
      questionnaire due to concomitant physical condition or who had undergone amputation or
      further surgery on the affected limb were excluded.
