      (atazanavir, and efavirenz) levels, its toxicities, and its long term efficacy among
      HIV-infected adults in Thailand. The specific aims are (1) to evaluate the impact of genetic
      polymorphism on ARV drug levels (2) to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphism/ drug
      levels on long term immunologic and virologic response (3) to correlate the genetic
      polymorphism/drug levels on antiretroviral toxicities. The proposed study will be analysed in
      stored samples of the well-established cohort of long-term follow-up study for HIV-infected
      patients participated in HIV-NAT study protocols, the HIV-NAT006 study. This cohort provide
      us unique opportunity to study impact of pharmacogenomics on long term treatment response and
      long term drug toxicities since this cohort was started in 1996. Furthermore, the important
      factors include ARV regimen, drug toxicities, PBMC, immunological and virological parameters
      have been collected every 6 months basis in HIV-NAT006 study.

      A comprehensive understanding of the impact of pharmacogenomics to HIV infection and HIV
      medication will lead to development of appropriate intervention, particularly, dose reduction
      strategy in patient with particular gene correlated with greater drug levels. The dose
      reduction strategy will decrease long term drug toxicity and cost saving for Thai and Asian
      Ethnicity.
