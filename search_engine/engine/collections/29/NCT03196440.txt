      the four basic tastes, according to the methodology of International Organization for
      Standardization (1985) and to identify umami taste (Mojet et al. 2001, 2003). This is a
      cross-sectional study. The length of the inclusion of the study will be 24 months. This
      study's general objective is: to characterize food intake, nutritional status and identify
      thresholds for the five basic tastes in an elderly population.
