      formulated universal dental adhesive formulation in adult noncarious cervical lesions using
      self-etch and selective etch approaches.

      Thirty-three patients with at least two non-carious cervical lesions will receive one
      restoration utilizing the self-etch universal adhesive with no separate enamel etching and
      another restoration utilizing the universal adhesive and a a selective etch protocol in which
      in which enamel is etched with 37% phosphoric acid.

      After a screening/baseline visit at which the restorative procedures listed above will
      conducted, the patient will be seen at recall visits after approximately 6, 12 and 24 months
      to observe sensitivity, retention, marginal discoloration and marginal adaptation.
