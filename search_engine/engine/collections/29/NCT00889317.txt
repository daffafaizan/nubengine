      aim, we will investigate the neural basis of both attentive auditory perception and
      production of natural French vowels using functional magnetic resonance imaging. More
      specifically, we will compare vowels that varied along a given phonetic feature dimension
      while keeping other feature characteristics constant. The phonetic features to be tested are
      roundedness (rounded/unrounded vowels), place of articulation (front/back vowels) and height
      (close, close-mid, open-mid vowels). Our study posed three specific questions. First, where
      exactly in the human brain is the perceptual and motor segregation of different vowel
      categories accomplished? Second, are these stimulus dimensions implemented topographically in
      an orthogonal manner, as they vary orthogonally in natural speech? Most specifically, one
      would expect a topographic segregation between two vowel categories (e.g., front vs back
      vowels) in both auditory and motor cortices that are characterized by widely distinct
      acoustic and articulatory values. Third, does these possible sound-related topographic
      activations in auditory and motor cortices overlap during vowel perception and production?
      This latter result would support a functional coupling between speech perception and
      production systems.
