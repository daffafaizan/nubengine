    
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and PK
      profile of EXAPREL when administered intraoperatively at the end of surgery via local
      infiltration. Fifteen pediatric subjects 12 to less than 17 years of age undergoing spinal
      surgeries are planned for enrollment.

      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to study drug administration. During the
      screening visit, subjects will be assessed for past or present neurologic, cardiac, and
      general medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude them from
      study participation.

      Subjects will undergo their pre-planned spinal surgeries per the institution's standard of
      care. On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive a single dose of EXPAREL 4 mg/kg
      intraoperatively at the end of surgery via local infiltration into the surgical site. There
      is no required length of stay in the hospital; subjects may be discharged based on the
      medical judgment of the treating physician.

      A follow-up phone call will be scheduled for all subjects on Day 7. A final follow-up visit
      will be made on Day 30 to all subjects who received study drug.
