    
      The study will include both adults and youth in the United States, with a recruitment goal of
      at least 300-1,250 participants. Data to be collected to address the study objective will
      include CGM metrics; HbA1c; insulin delivery data; carbohydrate data; activity data from
      HealthKit; self-reported adverse events (e.g., severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis,
      hospitalizations); self-reported device issues; and psychosocial and user
      experience/treatment satisfaction surveys.

      Online forms will allow participants to report weekly device issues and serious adverse
      events including severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hospitalizations. General
      data updates will be obtained after three, six, and 12 months (and every six months
      thereafter if study participation continues). A fingerstick blood sample will be collected
      for HbA1c measurement after three months for cohort A and after six and 12 months for both
      cohorts. Quality-of-life/psychosocial and treatment satisfaction questionnaires will be
      completed after six and 12 months; new users also will complete questionnaires after 3
      months. Virtual focus groups will be completed within the first three months of starting Loop
      and at 12 months.
