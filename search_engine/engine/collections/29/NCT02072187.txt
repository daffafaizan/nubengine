      pathogenesis of depression and that supplemental vitamin D may have an antidepressant effect
      -either through a direct action on the brain or though correction of a deficiency state. The
      investigators hypothesize that eight weeks of vitamin D supplementation will produce a
      statistically significant decrease in symptoms of depression compared to placebo for people
      with non-remitted depression.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Individuals will be
      recruited who have failed to achieve remission from a depressive episode after a minimum of
      eight weeks of treatment with a first-line antidepressant, at an adequate dose. They will be
      randomized to receive either placebo or vitamin D supplementation in addition to their
      anti-depressant medication, which they will continue to take at the same dose for the
      duration of the eight week study.There will be an additional follow up visit one month later.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of supplemental vitamin D as an adjunctive
      treatment in the management of non-remitted depression compared to placebo. Additionally, its
      safety and tolerability will be assessed.

      A secondary objective will be to assess the relationship between changes in serum vitamin D
      levels and mood in order to elucidate information about the role that reversal of vitamin D
      deficiency may play in the treatment of this condition.
