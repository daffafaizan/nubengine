      Primary

        -  To evaluate tumor pathological complete response rate after neoadjuvant cyclophosphamide
           in combination with docetaxel vs doxorubicin hydrochloride in women with operable
           clinically node-negative breast cancer and normal topoisomerase IIα expression.

      Secondary

        -  To assess tumor clinical and pathological overall response rates in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of these regimens.

        -  To assess disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To assess the efficacy of short-course (3 days) filgrastim (G-CSF) as primary and
           secondary prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia in patients receiving docetaxel and
           cyclophosphamide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are stratified according to hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor [ER]- or
      progesterone receptor [PR]-positive vs ER- and PR-negative) and T stage (T2 vs T3). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all
      patients undergo surgery.

      Tumor specimens obtained prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy are analyzed for topoisomerase IIα
      gene and protein expression by IHC and FISH. Tissue samples are also collected at surgery for
      future studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.
