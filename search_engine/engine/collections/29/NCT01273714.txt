      controversial. Surgeons still continue to debate whether the potential benefits of total
      thyroidectomy outweigh the potential complications. Most low-volume surgeons avoid to perform
      total thyroidectomy owing to the possible complications such as permanent recurrent laryngeal
      nerve palsy and permanent hypoparathyroidism. On the other hand, the increasing number of
      total thyroidectomies are currently performed in high-volume endocrine surgery units, and the
      indication for this procedure include thyroid cancer, Graves disease and multinodular goiter.
      Recently there has been increasing acceptance for performing total thyroidectomy for
      bilateral multinodular non-toxic goiter as it removes the disease process completely, lowers
      local recurrence rate and avoids the substantial risk of reoperative surgery, and involves
      only a minimal risk of morbidity. This common perception is based largely on
      single-institution retrospective data, a few multi-institutional retrospective experiences,
      and only a few small prospective studies comparing the outcomes of total vs. subtotal
      thyroidectomy.
