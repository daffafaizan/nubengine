      after the initial trauma. Some of the most common, persistent, and disabling consequences of
      traumatic brain injury are deficits in higher order cognitive functions that direct more
      basic processes based on an individual's goals. Symptoms such as distractibility and
      difficulty holding goal-relevant information in memory can affect achievement of personal and
      professional goals. These cognitive problems can be exacerbated by post-traumatic stress
      (PTS) symptoms, commonly observed in the Veteran population. Interventions that strengthen
      goal-directed regulation of cognitive-emotion states could have far reaching benefits for
      Veterans.

      One challenge in rehabilitation is that response to training can be highly variable, and a
      better understanding of the neural bases for this variability could inform patient care.
      Investigators have developed a system for training neurocognitive skills that can be used in
      rehabilitation neuroscience studies to elucidate the neural bases of improvements in
      cognitive functioning. The training system is designed to help patients improve goal-directed
      brain state regulation, and preliminary work has investigated brain network parameters that
      may predict response to training. Electroencephalography (EEG) potentially provides easily
      accessible markers for the neural bases of improvements with training.

      Objectives in this pilot study are to investigate the potential of EEG markers to: (1)
      explain differential responses to attention regulation training; and (2) predict responses to
      training.
