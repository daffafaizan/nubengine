      value with respect to the homeostasis of dry and sensitive skin.

      An initial study (study report No. 1020813, DERMSCAN dated 2/10/2004) showed that the
      combination of L. paracasei NCC2461 (ST11) with Bifidobacterium lactis NCC2818 (Bb12) induced
      an improvement in certain parameters related to skin reactivity. However, the probiotics have
      not been tested separately.

      It was thus considered important to conduct a clinical trial aiming at confirming and
      documenting the data generated by the previous study and, also determining the specific
      efficacy of L. paracasei NCC2461 (ST11) on reactive skin symptoms. The latter probiotic
      strain was selected on the basis of its proven immune-modulatory properties (scientific
      dossier ST11-Nestec Benyacoub and Gueniche. Scientific evidence supporting the use of
      Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461 (ST11) for Inn√©ov. Report 11.02.2005 and references 23, 24,
      31-33). The strain was combined or not with a probiotic of the Bifidobacterium genus,
      particularly Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001. The data generated by various preclinical
      studies (NRC in-house studies) and clinical studies (public) show that this probiotic strain
      is able to modulate immune mechanisms and could interfere with inflammatory reactions.

      Moreover, the probiotic combination concept enables providing potential benefit all along the
      gastrointestinal tract, inducing maintenance of an optimum intestinal flora.
