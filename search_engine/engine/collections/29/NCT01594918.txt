    
      This is a Phase I, open label, dose-finding, multicenter clinical trial to establish the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 IV
      q21 days) in combination with mitoxantrone (4-12 mg/m2 IV q21 days) and prednisone (5mg
      orally BID) in patients with metastatic CRPC who have not undergone prior chemotherapy for
      metastatic disease.

      Up to five cohorts will be enrolled to determine the MTD and DLT profile of this combination.
      An accelerated titration design method is being used in order to minimize the number of
      patients exposed to subtherapeutic doses of mitoxantrone.
