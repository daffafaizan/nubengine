      purposes. Investigators have shown, first by a study of 104 cadavers that it was possible to
      reduce the opening by making the gesture under ultrasound guidance and to perform the
      procedure under local anesthesia. Then investigators performed an open study of 25 patients
      confirming the absence of iatrogenic lesions with this new technique.

      The percutaneous treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome under ultrasound guidance is a gesture
      of interventional radiology. One can envisage making this type of treatment in interventional
      radiology room which overcomes the operating room and thus reduce costs.

      The objective of the study is to continue the study of percutaneous treatment of carpal
      tunnel syndrome under ultrasound guidance by an open study conducted in interventional
      radiology room.
