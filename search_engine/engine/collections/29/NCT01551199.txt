      veterans returning from war-zone areas, many will experience anxiety disorders such as PTSD
      and comorbid problems. Currently, about one in every six OIF/OEF veterans experiences PTSD
      and co-occurring PD. Although effective treatments exist for treating one or the other, we do
      not yet have treatments that can simultaneously target PTSD and PD. Thus, recent attention
      has focused on the development of multi-component treatments that simultaneously address PTSD
      and PD. This study is the first systematic investigation of a time-limited, multi-component
      cognitive-behavioral treatment for veterans with specific comorbid anxiety problems. The
      purpose of the first phase of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      the multi-component cognitive-behavioral treatment in an open trial.
