      peer support for sexual violence (SV) and become change agents who play a significant role in
      preventing sexual violence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the statewide
      application of Green Dot among high schools students. We hypothesize that students in high
      schools with Green Dot will over time report lower rates of SV compared with students in
      comparable high schools randomized not to have Green Dot. A high school based controlled
      intervention trial is being used to test the efficacy of Green Dot. Both panel and cohort
      survey methods will be used to provide baseline and prospective data on student's attitudes
      supporting SV, bystander behaviors and violence victimization and perpetration. In 13
      Kentucky regions, 2 demographically comparable high schools were recruited to participate in
      Green Dot intervention either as the intervention or control site. Schools were randomly
      assigned to the intervention. Study Population includes all students in participating high
      schools invited to complete anonymous panel surveys beginning spring 2010 through 2014. This
      state-wide, population-based, multi-site controlled intervention trial provides an empirical
      test of a promising intervention, which, if proven effective, could result in the primary
      prevention of SV and a reduction in the health and academic consequences of SV.
