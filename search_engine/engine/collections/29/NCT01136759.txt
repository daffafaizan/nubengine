      intercourse to prevent transmission of HIV. Research has shown that pregnant women are still
      at risk of sexual transmission of HIV, and some research has suggested that pregnant women
      may be at increased risk of HIV infection. Microbicides may also aid in preventing
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV, because they might be a feasible alternative to oral or
      intravenous medications in regions where these methods are difficult to implement. In tests
      on healthy women the vaginal microbicide tenofovir 1% gel has been safe and well tolerated.
      This study will test the safety of tenofovir 1% gel in healthy, pregnant women and healthy,
      lactating women.

      Participation in this study will last approximately 3 to 10 weeks. Pregnant women will be
      followed until approximately 2 weeks after delivery of their children, and lactating women
      will be followed for 3 weeks. Pregnant women will be given either the tenofovir 1% gel or a
      placebo gel to be applied daily for 7 days. Groups of pregnant women will be further divided
      according to how late into pregnancy they enroll.

      Pregnant women will have study visits at enrollment, 6 days after enrollment, and at
      delivery. They will also participate in phone assessments 1, 3, and 14 days after enrollment
      and at delivery.

      Lactating women will be given tenofovir 1% gel and have study visits at enrollment and 6 days
      after enrollment. They will also participate in phone assessments 1, 3, and 14 days after
      enrollment.

      All participants will complete blood tests, physical exams, and assessments of adverse
      events.
