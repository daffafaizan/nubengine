      carmustine plus temozolomide in recurrent glioblastoma. II. Estimate the response rate of
      recurrent glioblastomas to this combination. III. Estimate the response rate of newly
      diagnosed anaplastic astrocytomas and mixed anaplastic glioma to this combination. IV.
      Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this combination in patients with
      anaplastic gliomas.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study. Patients are stratified by disease (recurrent
      glioblastoma vs anaplastic astrocytoma or mixed anaplastic glioma). Patients receive
      carmustine intravenously on day 1 two hours prior to temozolomide. Temozolomide is
      administered orally on day 1. Cycles repeat every 42 days. Treatment for patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma may continue for 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. If there is no disease progression after 8 cycles, treatment may
      continue further at the investigator's discretion. Patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or
      mixed anaplastic glioma continue for 4 cycles of treatment. Patients are followed
      periodically at the investigator's discretion, at least twice in the first 4 months, and then
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 17 patients and a maximum of 37 patients will be accrued in
      the recurrent glioblastoma stratum and 45 patients will be accrued into the anaplastic
      astrocytoma and mixed anaplastic glioma stratum.
