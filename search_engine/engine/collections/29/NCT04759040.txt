      Natural for individual suffering from multiple migraine attacks in one month . The purpose of
      this 7-months , randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study is to evaluate the

      based in Vancouver , BC , in reducing migraine headache severity and frequency of attacks
      compared to placebo when used every day, as a preventative solution for migraine and to

      The primary end-point is the severity and the frequency reduction of migraine attacks. The
      secondary end-points will be the existence of adverse reaction.
