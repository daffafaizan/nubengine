      laser can deliver 0.25 to 100 ms laser pulses at a maximum of 20 J/cm2. Bipolar RF energy
      will be delivered across the laser beam via two appropriately sized electrodes and spacing
      between the electrodes. Bipolar RF energy may be delivered at a maximum of 35 J operating at
      1 MHz. Typical RF pulses will be of duration of between 100 and 300ms. Epidermal cooling is
      accomplished via contact with a cooled window.
