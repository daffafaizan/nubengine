      had tremendous success in sub-Saharan Africa. However, HIV transmission continues to occur
      because (1) implementation of PMTCT is incomplete and (2) ARV interventions are not 100%
      effective in blocking infection. Thus the challenge of providing treatment to HIV-infected
      children is far from over. The capacity of early ART treatment to favorably influence the
      viral reservoir and potentially lead to post-treatment cessation viral control needs to be
      described in the population of infants, and to identify useful public health strategies.
