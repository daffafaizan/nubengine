      the vascular pattern in several levels. Thus, several vascular effects might interfere with
      women's health. The use of hormone replacement therapy has contributed to the improvement in
      these effects. In previous studies, the investigators observed the effects of hormonal
      replacement therapy in improving such effects in postmenopausal women. The aim of the present
      study is to evaluate the effects of CIMICIFUGA RACEMOSA on the Flow-Mediated Dilatation of
      the brachial artery.
