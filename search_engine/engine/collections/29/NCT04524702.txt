      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of paricalcitol plus
      hydroxychloroquine (PH) when added to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment by assessing
      the overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of paricalcitol plus
      hydroxychloroquine (PH) when added to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment in patients
      with advanced pancreatic cancer.

      II. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of paricalcitol plus
      hydroxychloroquine (PH) when added to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel treatment by assessing
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effects of PH on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and immune cells using
      mass cytometry (CyTOF) to characterize the presence and distribution of these cells.

      II. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate these pathways including TGF-beta1,
      TGF-beta1 RII, SMAD4, LC3 in addition to markers of fibrosis (collagen) and tumor
      (cytokeratin).

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning day -14, patients receive paricalcitol intravenously (IV) three times weekly and
      hydroxychloroquine orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Patients also receive gemcitabine IV over
      30 minutes and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 12 weeks
      thereafter.
