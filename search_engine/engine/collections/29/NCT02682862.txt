      of asthma attacks. Despite this, smoking cessation rates are very low due to the highly
      addictive nature of tobacco smoking. Asthma in smokers is particularly challenging to manage
      because it is resistant to the beneficial effects of inhaled corticosteroids, the main
      treatment for asthma.

      Unfortunately, there is no guideline consensus regarding how to best manage asthmatics who
      smoke. Research studies in asthma tend to exclude smokers because of concerns about
      recruiting patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hence, there is an
      unmet need for research studies in asthmatics who are unable to stop smoking.

      In view of the above, we propose to assess the effects of two different types of
      bronchodilators (inhalers which help open up the airways), in asthmatics who continue to
      smoke.

      Participants will receive both of the following drugs for 2-4 weeks in random order, with a
      2-3 week washout period in between:

      Olodaterol which is a new long-acting bronchodilator. Olodaterol combined with tiotropium
      (dual bronchodilators). We wish to compare these inhalers using a sensitive pulmonary
      function test called impulse oscillometry.
