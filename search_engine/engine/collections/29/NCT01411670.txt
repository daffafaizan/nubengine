    
      Sixty septic patients with plasma protein C activity < 60 % will be enrolled in the study.
      Patients will be randomly allocated to be treated with either a) a continuous infusion of
      human Protein C concentrate at 3 UI/Kg/hr for 72 hours to reach plasma protein C activity
      between 70 and 120 % b)to a continuous infusion of activated protein C at 24 micrograms/Kg/hr
      for 96 hours, c) a standard teatment(control; each n = 20). In all groups, norepinephrine
      will be titrated to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 65 and 75 mmHg. Data from
      right heart catheterization, from microcirculation (SDF imaging) and from organ function as
      well as norepinephrine requirements will be obtained at baseline and after 24, 48, 72 hours.
