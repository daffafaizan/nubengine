      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients and has proven as effective as
      fluconazole for prophylaxis. Whilst micafungin has much to offer, little is known about its
      pharmacokinetic profile in specific patient populations, specifically concerning alternate
      dosing strategies with increased dosages over a prolonged dosing interval. Sufficient data
      are lacking up to now for twice weekly administration of micafungin as antifungal
      prophylaxis. Decreasing the dosing frequency to twice weekly seems a reasonable approach
      considering the long terminal elimination life (i.e. 10-17 h) and considering the data
      available from murine models that support the use of less frequent dosing with higher
      dosages.

      It will enable us to characterize both the pharmacokinetics of micafungin in the hematology
      cohort and directly compare the exposure to the alternate dosing strategy.
