      instrument, used in conjunction with appropriate reagents, is capable of automated cell
      lysis, dilution of nucleic acids from multiple sample types as well as automated
      amplification and detection of target nucleic acid sequences.

      A dual swab sample is collected when ICF is signed by patient. One of the swab will be tested
      on the revogene™, and the second swab will be tested with standard microbiology method at a
      Reference Center.
