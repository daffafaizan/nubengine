        1. "Spirometry Fundamentalsâ„¢: A basic guide to lung function testing," a computer-based
           training program that teaches primary care providers how to coach patients to produce
           high-quality spirometry tests and accurately interpret spirometric data;

        2. Spirometry Learning Lab: Case-based teaching of spirometry in practice guides test
           administrators and interpreters through clinical examples in an interactive virtual
           classroom setting. These sessions are led by expert clinical faculty and are archived
           for future reference and review;

        3. Spirometry Feedback: Tailored analysis of providers' spirometry testing sessions offers
           monthly individualized feedback reports by clinical experts on spirometry tests
           performed in the clinic.

      This is a cluster randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the Spirometry 360
      program. The Spirometry 360 program will be provided to 25 primary care pediatric practices
      from two practice-based research networks. A separate group of 25 matched control practices
      recruited from these same networks will receive standard training from the equipment vendor
      during the study and the Spirometry 360 training program at the end of the study.
