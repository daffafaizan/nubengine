      surgery. Thoracic epidural and paravertebral blocks (PVB) became the gold standard techniques
      to achieve this goal. However, both techniques may be associated with devastating
      complications such as spinal cord injury, total spinal anesthesia, inadvertent intravascular
      injection and pneumothorax.

      On the other hand, the advancement of ultrasound (US) technology and our ability to visualize
      the pleura and other structures in and around the paravertebral space has increased interest
      in performing thoracic paravertebral blocks guided by US.

      "Pecs" block is a less invasive procedure involving US guided interfascial injections has
      been suggested as potential alternative analgesic technique. The Pecs I block was initially
      described by Blanco for minor breast surgery. A year later, on 2012, he described a Pecs II
      block or "modified Pecs block" for breast surgery involving the axilla.

      The Pecs I block targets the medial pectoral nerve (MPN) from C8 and T1 and the lateral
      pectoral nerve (LPN) from C5, C6, and C7. These nerves arise from the medial and lateral
      cords of the brachial plexus, respectively, and innervate the pectoralis muscles.

      The Pecs II block targets the T2-6 intercostal nerves, the long thoracic nerve which supplies
      the serratus anterior, and the thoracodorsal nerve which supplies the latissimus dorsi.
      Potential complications include accidental intravascular injection and pneumothorax.

      The easily identifiable landmarks allow this block to provide a simple alternative to
      paravertebral and neuraxial blocks for breast surgery. The block produces excellent analgesia
      and can be used as a rescue block in cases with patchy or ineffective paravertebral or
      epidural block.
