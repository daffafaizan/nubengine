      clinical, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) among low drinking pre-menopausal women
      suffering from recurrent community-acquired UTI over 12 consecutive months of study product
      consumption. It is a prospective, single site, open-label, randomised controlled trial in two
      parallel groups:

        -  Control group: not changing their fluid intake habits

        -  Intervention group: provided with mineral water, fluid intake recommendations and
           regular hydration coaching support

      The study population consists in pre-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent UTIs and
      having a 'low drinker' profile.

      The total number of randomized subjects in this study is estimated at 140. The study will
      include only women who are low-drinkers (< 1.5 L fluids per day; urinary volume < 1.2 L per
      day) since they are most likely to have a predisposition to UTIs due to infrequent voiding.
