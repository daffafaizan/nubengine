      relapse rates. Patients are at especially high risk of relapse after leaving structured
      treatment (e.g., hospitalization). Adjunct interventions targeting patients' motivation and
      participation in treatment at these times may help patients recover from eating disorders.
      Project HEAL is a non-profit organization whose mission is to reduce suffering caused by
      eating disorders, and they have recently developed two adjunct, mentorship-based
      interventions for patients in recovery. In the peer mentorship condition, individuals meet
      weekly with a peer mentor who has previously recovered from an eating disorder in order to
      discuss symptoms and coping strategies. In the social support mentorship condition,
      individuals meet weekly with a social support mentor who has not personally struggled with an
      eating disorder in order to engage in activities unrelated to the eating disorder. The aim of
      the current study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention. The
      design of the study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing peer mentorship,
      social-support mentorship, and wait-list control conditions. Participants in the study will
      be randomized to one of the three conditions for six months. Wait-list participants will
      subsequently receive either type of mentorship. Participants will complete assessments of
      their eating disorder symptoms at baseline, monthly throughout the course of the study, and
      one year after beginning the study. Outcomes will be compared between groups.
