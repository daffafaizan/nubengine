      to characterize a reference Cardiac Device implant procedure, to seek consensus from
      experienced device implanters on the appropriateness of the steps as well as errors
      identified, and to determine if such validated performance metrics are a valid assessment
      tool with the ability to discriminate between the performances of experienced and novice
      implanters.

      These validated metrics will potentially serve as an educational and training tool to improve
      and quality assure Cardiac device implant training.

      The steps involved in characterising a reference procedure are as follows:

        1. Define the implant procedure in quantifiable steps (already performed)

        2. Seek consensus and agreement by an independent panel on the steps (already done).

        3. Video record routinely performed device implants by experienced and novice physicians.

        4. Reviewing and scoring the video recorded procedures to verify that the metrics
           distinguish between a novice and an expert cardiac device performance.
