    
      Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will preliminary examine the effects
      of an electromoxibustion device and knee health education on reliving knee osteoarthritis
      (OA) pain.

      Method Design: This pilot RCT will embed a two-arm randomized control trial. The project will
      recruit 48 participants with knee OA. Eligible participants will be randomized into 2 groups
      - (1) Electromoxibustion, or (2) knee health education at 1:1 ratio.

      Interventions: Participants in the electromoxibustion group will receive electromoxibustion
      using a knee-brace-like device which produces thermal stimulation with a moxa pad inside
      (Fort Mayer, Guangzhou, China); participants in the Knee health education group will attend 2
      sessions (120 minutes each, 1-week apart) of health education related to knee OA symptom
      management.

      Outcome measures: (1) Pain severity numerical rating scale (NRS) (Primary outcome); (2)
      Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) for pain, physical
      function, and stiffness related to knee osteoarthritis; (3) Short Form-6 Dimensions for
      quality of life; (4) Timed Up & Go Test (TUG); (5) Fast Gait Speed (FGS) for knee
      functioning.

      Statistical Analysis of quantitative data: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe
      the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants. A mixed-effects model with
      consideration of repeated measures and dropout by including all available data points
      (intention-to-treat analysis) to compare the electromoxibustion with the knee health
      education control group. SPSS version 23.0 will be used in this study.
