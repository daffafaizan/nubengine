      synergistic inhibition of angiogenesis and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling.
      Erlotinib is a oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets EGFR. Sorafenib is a oral tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet
      derived growth factor receptor beta, Raf-1, Flt-3, and C-kit. These agents also do not
      exhibit overlapping adverse event profiles which provided additional support for studying
      this combination therapy.
