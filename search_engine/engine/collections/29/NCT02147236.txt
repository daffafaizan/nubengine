      group treatment intervention for enhancing social behavior in 40 children with autism
      spectrum disorders (ASDs). An important long-term goal of this project was to develop a model
      for delivery of social skills training that could be tested in a larger trial and ultimately
      exported to schools and community settings. To accomplish these aims, we designed a
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate a structured social skills program for school age
      children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs)compared to a Wait List control group.
      Specific aims included gathering preliminary evidence on the efficacy of the intervention on
      various parent measures of behavior, as well as an assessment of overall social functioning
      by an independent rater who would be blind to treatment assignment. The Social Skills
      Development program uses semi-structured activities and peer tutors to promote interpersanal
      skills. To evaluate acceptability of the program, we planned to track attendance, attrition
      and parent satisfaction in the trial. Finally, to evaluate the durability of gains achieved
      during the Social Skills Development program, we re-assessed the subjects initially
      randomized to the active treatment group at 9 months post-treatment.
