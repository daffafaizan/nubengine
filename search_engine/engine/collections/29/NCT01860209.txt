      than in the general population, and may participate to the increased cardiovascular mortality
      observed in this group of patients. Despite a significant increase in knowledge about the
      harmful effects of obstructive sleep apnea, the pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly
      understood. Recent observations suggest a causative relationship between overnight fluid
      displacement from the legs to the neck soft and the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. This
      mechanism was demonstrated in otherwise healthy subjects, in heart failure patients, and in
      patients with venous insufficiency. We thus suspect that this pathophysiologic mechanism
      could explain the increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with
      hypervolemia, including chronic renal failure.

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the hypothesis that nocturnal rostral fluid ship
      is linked to overhydration and participates significantly to the severity of obstructive
      sleep apnea in patients on hemodialysis. The correction of overhydration by hemodialysis
      should therefore reduce the amount of nocturnally displaced water and consequently lower the
      severity of obstructive sleep apnea.

      The severity of obstructive sleep apnea is measured by two consecutive attended
      polysomnographies, performed before and after an ambulatory hemodialysis session with fluid
      removal, whereas overhydration and leg fluid are evaluated by bioimpedance, performed at the
      beginning and at the end of each polysomnography. The sequence of the two polysomnographies
      with respect to hemodialysis is randomized, to minimize the first-night effect.
