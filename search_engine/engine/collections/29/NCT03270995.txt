      in a randomized control clinical trial with women with breast or gynecological cancer.
      Participants will be recruited from Princess Margaret Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, the
      Jewish General Hospital, and the Ottawa Hospital. 144 cancer patients will be randomized to
      either receive the 6 week cognitive-existential group intervention or to a control group. The
      control group will also consist of six weekly sessions during which participants will discuss
      the challenges of living with a cancer diagnosis, but without a clear focus on FCR. Women
      randomized to participate in the study will a) be 18 years or older; b) have a first
      diagnosis of breast or gynecological cancer with stages between IIII; c) be disease free at
      the start of the group; d) gave clinical levels of fear of cancer recurrence; e) have
      clinical levels of distress; and f) have completed their cancer treatment.
