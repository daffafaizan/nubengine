      (IOL) dislocation and 60 patients in a control group with ordinary pseudophakia. Traditional
      surgery includes a capsular-IOL complex fixation to sclera by looping a prolene suture not
      only around haptics but also through capsular tissue. Such a suture may cut through the bag,
      which may result in a decentered IOL. A modification of "the traditional" method was created
      at S:t Eriks Eye Hospital in order to achieve better centration of the IOL. The study will
      evaluate the efficacy of these two methods. Additionally, the impact of fibrosis of capsular
      bag on IOL stability postoperatively will be evaluated.
