      produced by sound waves) when combined with radiation therapy and in some patients hormonal
      therapy to control prostate cancer.

      Hyperthermia refers to the use of temperatures 42 oC (107-6oF) or higher to treatment
      malignant tumors. Laboratory and some clinical reports have demonstrated a tumor killing
      effect if tumors are heated to 43oC (109oF) for 30-60 minutes.

      Many studies have shown that hyperthermia improves the killing effect of radiation treatments
      for many tumors. In clinical studies, the addition of hyperthermia has shown to be beneficial
      for tumors of the breast, urinary bladder and the head and neck region with combined with
      radiation therapy. Investigators found an improvement in tumor response rates and a
      lengthened duration of response. The proposed study is one of the first controlled studies to
      attempt to prove the usefulness of hyperthermia for patients with prostate cancer.
