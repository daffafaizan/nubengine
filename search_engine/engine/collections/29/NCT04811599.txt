      traditional Chinese medicine theory,health condition can assessed by observing tougue
      features,including color, gloss, shape and coating of the tongue, tongue features reflect
      gastric mucosal state, disease classification and prognosis. Recently, deep learning based on
      central neural networks (CNN) has shownTongue diagnosis is an important part of traditional

      Recently, deep learning based on central neural networks (CNN) has shown multiple potential
      in detecting and diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases. However, there is still a blank in
      recognition of gastrointestinal diseases .This study aims to develop and validate a deep
      learning algorithm for the diagnosis of digestive tract diseases depending on tongue
      images,and analyze gastrointestinal flora of common tongue images.
