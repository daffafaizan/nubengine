      double-blinded, but FDA-approved study medication. Participants will be required to spend the
      night on a clinical research unit, located on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Campus, for 4
      consecutive nights (Monday - Friday). Participants will undergo daily sessions Tuesday -
      Friday. Tuesday sessions will consist of taking a study medication in the morning and
      afternoon, and completing a pain testing session after each study drug administration.
      Wednesday through Friday sessions will consist of taking a study drug in the morning and
      providing self-report ratings of drug effects and vital sign measurements (such as blood
      pressure, pulse) several times for a 6-hour period. The investigators will also collect
      saliva samples to assess physiological functioning, and will ask you to complete a
      computerized task to assess levels of functioning.
