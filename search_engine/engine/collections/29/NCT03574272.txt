    
      Hospitalized patients who need transfer for a diagnostic examination or rehabilitation
      therapy during hospitalization, and have a risk of hypoxemia during transfer will be enrolled
      in this trial. The subjects will be provided with a portable oximeter and a smart-phone which
      application for monitoring is installed, and oxygen saturation and pulse rate will be checked
      in real time during transfer. The collected data will be transferred to cloud system via Iot
      network, and the transmitted data will be monitored in real time via monitoring equipment in
      the (Patient-hospitalized) ward. If there is a risk, the alarm system is activated so that
      the medical team is able to check risk factor and manage it immediately.

      All the risk factors and severity will be collected during transfer, also these are checked
      whether the monitoring system and the data transmission system work properly or not, the time
      from detecting risk factor to medical response, the composition of medical staffs who
      responding to alarmed risk factors and improvement of the subjects.

      Pilot study will be conducted with 20 subjects in Asan medical center. In pilot study,
      monitoring machines (HR, SpO2 monitor) commonly used in wards or hospitals will be used to
      verify the stability of oximeter used in this study and the developed risk detection system.
