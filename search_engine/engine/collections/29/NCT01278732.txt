      peripheral blood pressures for the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease: it is central
      systolic pressure (cSBP) against the heart ejects (afterload), and it is central pulse
      pressure (cPP) that distends the large elastic arteries. Indeed, cSBP and cPP have been
      associated more closely with left ventricular hypertrophy and carotid atherosclerosis as
      markers of hypertensive end-organ damage than brachial pressures in various populations.
      However, in these studies office blood pressure measurements have been used. As ABPM
      measurements per se show a closer association with hypertensive end-organ damage than office
      measurements, and as the investigators have recently developed and validated a novel
      algorithm (ARCSolver) to calculate central blood pressures from peripheral waveforms, the
      investigators speculate that cSBP measured during ABPM may be the best predictor of left
      ventricular mass.
