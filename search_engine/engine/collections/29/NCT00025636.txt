        -  Compare the efficacy of induction chemotherapy followed by combination chemotherapy and
           autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with or without high-dose
           sequential chemotherapy in terms of freedom from treatment failure in patients with
           relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the complete remission/unconfirmed complete remission rate at 3 months,
           relapse-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the frequency of severe toxic effects and secondary neoplasia in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, type of relapse (early first relapse [remission duration 3-12 months]
      vs late first relapse [remission duration more than 12 months] vs second relapse without
      prior high-dose chemotherapy salvage [remission duration after salvage at least 3 months]),
      disease status at relapse (stage I or II vs stage III or IV), age (18 to 49 vs 50 to 60), and
      response after 2 courses of study induction chemotherapy (complete remission vs partial
      remission vs no change).

      All patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising dexamethasone IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1-4 and 15-18, cisplatin IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1 and 15, cytarabine IV
      over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 2 and 16, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once
      daily on days 5-12 and days 19-26. Patients with complete remission (CR), unconfirmed CR,
      partial remission, or no change are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive BEAM chemotherapy comprising carmustine IV over 30 minutes and
           melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day 37 and etoposide IV over 30 minutes every 12 hours
           and cytarabine IV over 30 minutes every 12 hours on days 37-40. Patients also receive
           G-CSF SC twice daily beginning on day 41 and continuing until blood counts recover.
           Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) are reinfused on day 42.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 8 hours on day 37, high-dose
           methotrexate IV over 6 hours and high-dose vincristine IV on day 51, and high-dose
           etoposide IV over 8 hours on days 58-61. Patients then receive BEAM chemotherapy
           comprising carmustine IV over 30 minutes and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day 80 and
           etoposide IV over 30 minutes every 12 hours and cytarabine IV over 30 minutes every 12
           hours on days 80-83. Patients also receive G-CSF SC once on days 38 and 62 and twice
           daily beginning on day 84 and continuing until blood counts recover. Autologous PBSCs
           are reinfused on day 85.

      Patients with residual lymphoma at 100 days after completion of BEAM chemotherapy may receive
      radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed at 100 days after PBSC transplantation, every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 years.
