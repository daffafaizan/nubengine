      I. To explore the impact of trametinib alone or in combination with uprosertib (GSK2141795)
      on RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K pathway signaling.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine associations with early changes in functional proteomic biomarkers in tumor
      biopsies before and after treatment and tumor response in two subgroups of patients with
      recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer who are treated with trametinib alone or in
      combination with GSK2141795.

      II. To examine levels of circulating tumor cells in blood samples before and after treatment
      and correlate with tumor response in two subgroups of patients with recurrent or persistent
      endometrial cancer who are treated with trametinib alone or in combination with GSK2141795.

      III. To examine the bRaf/cRaf dimer or Raf/KSR/Mek1 dimers in paraffin sections from these
      patients before treatment by proximity ligation assay (PLA) assays.

      IV. To quantify exosomes from these patients before and after treatment by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay with CD63 antibody and explore bRaf/cRaf dimer or
      Raf/KSR/Mek1 dimers in exosomes from these patients before and after treatment by PLA assays.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood at screening, between days 3 and 5, 28, and 56. Patients
      also undergo collection of tumor biopsy at screening and day 28.
