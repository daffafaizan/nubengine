      advanced esopgageal cancer patients. Most local failures occur in the gross tumor
      volume.[F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT can identify residual metabolic disease (RMD).
      Hyperfractionated radiotherapy allows for delivering a higher dose without increasing late
      toxicity. Our previous phase I radiation dose escalation trial demonstrated that 86 Gy could
      be safely delivered to the RMD with concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin in advanced
      esophageal cancer.The aim of this phase II study is to examine the efficacy of this regimen.
