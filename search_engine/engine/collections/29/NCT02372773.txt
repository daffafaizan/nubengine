    
      This multicenter study will enroll 300 members of familial Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)
      families across 8 experienced FTD research centers with a known mutation in MAPT, PGRN, or
      C9ORF72 (100 mutation carriers with mild dementia or minimally symptomatic yet non-demented,
      100 asymptomatic mutation carriers, and 100 clinically normal relatives who are non-mutation
      carriers) to obtain annual assessments including T1-MRI, FLAIR, diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI), ASL perfusion (ASLp), intrinsic connectivity functional MRI (icfMRI), MR spectroscopy
      (MRS), CSF, blood, and behavioral, neuropsychological and functional assessment, for a total
      of three assessments per participant.

      A primary goal of this study is to identify the most robust and reliable methods to track
      disease progression in familial FTD so that disease-modifying therapeutic trials can be
      designed appropriately.
