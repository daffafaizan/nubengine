      However, its protective role in adults has long been controversial. This study aims to
      examine the effect of 12-week probiotics supplementation on lipid management in Chinese
      adults. By understanding the mechanism by which probiotics exert the beneficial effects, we
      can better control the rising prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, which is a major risk
      factor for cardiovascular diseases.
