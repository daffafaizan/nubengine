      active-controlled, parallel design study of the combination of pyrotinib in combination with
      capecitabine versus placebo plus capecitabine in HER2+ MBC patients, who have prior received
      anthracyclin, taxane and trastuzumab.

      Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms:

      Arm A: pyrotinib (400 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily) Arm B: placebo
      (400 mg once daily) + capecitabine (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily) Patients will receive either arm
      of therapy until the occurrence of death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      other specified withdrawal criterion.

      Efficacy assessments will be performed at screening, every 6 weeks until cycle 18, every 12
      weeks thereafter.

      Patients in control group can be provide pyrotinib treatment when they progressed after the
      placebo plus capecitabine treatment. Pyrotinb will be administrated until the patients
      reached progress again or wit
