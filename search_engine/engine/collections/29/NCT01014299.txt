      management in critically ill patients usually requires endotracheal intubation after rapid
      sequence induction. Induction of anesthesia is a well known cause of dramatic changes in
      respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. Moreover, when the intubation is for respiratory
      failure, the underlying pathology increases these modifications. The reduction in lung volume
      results in a deep hypoxemia after intubation. Moreover, mechanical ventilation applied on a
      collapsed lung increases the risk of ventilator induced lung injury. Recruitment maneuver,
      which consists of a transient increased in inspiratory pressure, decreases anesthesia-induced
      lung collapse and hypoxemia. During early acute respiratory failure, RM increases oxygenation
      and lung volume and may reduce lung oedema. Some authors have suggested the potential benefit
      of an early RM after induction of anesthesia in operating room. To date, no study has
      evaluated the short term effect of a recruitment maneuver performed early after intubation in
      critically ill patients. Therefore, our aim was to ascertain whether RM, performed
      immediately after intubation, is safe and more effective at reducing hypoxemia than usual
      management, in hypoxemic patients requiring intubation for invasive ventilation in the ICU.
