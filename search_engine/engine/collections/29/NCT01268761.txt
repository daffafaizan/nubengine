      protocols. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist administration in the luteal
      phase was recently proposed as a new approach for the management of patients with established
      severe OHSS We analyze the response of egg donors with moderate- severe early ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome after a GnRH antagonist stimulation protocol to the administration
      of a daily doses of GnRH antagonist (Cetrorelix 0.25) during 7 days after the second day of
      oocyte retrieval compared with placebo (saline solution).
