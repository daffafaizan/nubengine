    
      Patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery by laparotomy (general surgery or
      gynaecological surgery) will receive a thoracic epidural (around T9-T10/T10-T11) and general
      anesthesia. Apart from standard monitoring, the ANI (derived from the EKG) and the NoL index
      (obtained via a finger probe) will be recorded. The epidural catheter will be injected with
      6-10 ml of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 5 mcg/ml to produce anesthetic level of neuraxial
      blocade and then be perfused with the same solution at 4-8 ml/hour. After incision and
      confirmation of adequate blocade with the epidural local anesthetic, the patient will receive
      a series of painful electric stimulation with a standard nerve stimulator applied over the
      ulnar nerve in tetanic mode for 30 seconds at 100 Hz and 70mA. Each stimulation will occur at
      a different rate of infusion of IV remifentanil at steady state (0,005 mcg/kg/min; 0,05
      mcg/kg/min; 0,1 mcg/kg/min; 0,15 mcg/kg/min). A stimulation at 0,005 mcg/kg/min will be done
      before and after epidural loading with local anesthetics to look for altered variations in
      analysed parameters. The variation and the kinetic of the variations after stimulations will
      be observed for heart rate, mean blood pressure, BIS, ANI and NoL index.
