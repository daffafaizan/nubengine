      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to learn if nilotinib has the possibility of
      effectively treating PD symptoms. Nilotinib has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat certain types of cancer (leukemia) but is considered
      investigational in this study because it has not been approved for treating PD. Twenty-five
      sites will enroll participants into 2 cohorts,approximately 75 in Cohort 1 and 60 in Cohort
      2. Participants with moderate to advanced PD symptoms will be enrolled in Cohort 1, randomly
      assigned to take nilotinib (150 mg or 300mg) or placebo, and will complete 13 in-person study
      visits over 8.5 months.

      The results from Cohort 1 will determine if either dose of nilotinib (150mg or 300 mg) is
      safe and tolerable enough to move forward and evaluate in Cohort 2. If either dose is found
      to be safe and tolerable, participants with early PD will be enrolled into Cohort 2.

      Participants in Cohort 2 will be randomly assigned to either nilotinib (dose to be determined
      from Cohort 1 results) or placebo and will complete 17 in-person visits over 14.5 months. For
      both cohorts, the study visits will include clinical assessment of motor, neuropsychiatric
      and cognitive testing as well as collection of blood and cerebral spinal fluid, collected by
      lumbar puncture.

      This study will also evaluate if nilotinib can help improve motor symptoms associated with
      PD. All participants in Cohort 1 and participants in Cohort 2 who have started PD medications
      will have an assessment of the motor exam (Part III) in a practically defined OFF state (12
      hours post dose) and ON state (at least one-hour post dose).
