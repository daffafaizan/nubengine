      non-small cell lung cancer-NSCLC and locally advanced/unresectable pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma-LAPC). The Phase I part is determining for each disease group a safe
      dose-level that will be evaluated in the Phase II component of the study. The phase II part
      of the study is a randomized controlled trial that tests, for each disease group, the
      treatment efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in combination with AGuIX
      gadolinium-chelated polysiloxane based nanoparticles compared to treatment with stereotactic
      magnetic resonance (MR)-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) alone

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Activation and Guidance of
      Irradiation X (AGuIX) as a treatment for any disease.

      AGuIX is a gadolinium-based nanoparticle, gadolinium is the drug used for an MR with
      contrast. It is believed that the AGuIX may help the radiation received work better by making
      a tumor more sensitive to the radiation and allowing doctors to see the tumor more clearly.
      AGuIX has been tested in one previous study with humans. It was found that AGuIX did make
      tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including
      evaluations and follow up visits.

      Participants will receive study treatment for 5 treatment days and will be followed for a
      year after your treatment ends.

      It is expected that about 100 people will take part in this research study.
