      colchicine and reduction of factors affecting triglyceride metabolism, especially apoCIII and
      VLDL levels. We envision colchicine as playing a role in identifying and elucidating a new
      mechanism for lowering TG levels, which may have a great impact on targeting patients who
      have not met non-HDL goals according to Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII guidelines) or at
      risk for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [11]. We will accomplish this by
      conducting a prospective cohort clinical trial of low-dose colchicine in hypertriglyceridemic
      patients to assess percent (%) reduction of apoCIII, VLDL, and TG. Secondary endpoints will
      be to observe the effects of colchicine on apoA, apoB, HDL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL),
      and total cholesterol (TC).
