      automated angular measurement by the GazelabÂ® (ES12/13127) apparatus, compared to the
      standard gold which is the angular measurement by alternate occlusion test and prismatic bar,
      in horizontal strabisms (converging and diverging). Indeed in our daily practice the 2
      examinations are carried out. To compare with the standard gold which denotes a strong
      inter-observer variability, the investigator will compare the results of the Gazelab to the
      alternate occlusion by prism bar (standard gold) 2 times with 2 trained examiners
