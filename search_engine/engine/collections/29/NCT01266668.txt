      Histologically, the diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most predominant subtype of
      PBL. Previous studies in the pre-rituximab era have identified the worse outcomes in primary
      breast DLBCL compared with nodal DLBCL. Few clinical studies have been reported for
      investigating the efficacy of rituximab in patients with primary breast DLBCL. For clarifying
      this, a large randomized trial comparing survival in patients with primary breast DLBCL is
      required. However, the rarity of primary breast DLBCL makes large trial virtually difficult
      in single center or study group. Additionally, retrospective studies for evaluating the role
      of rituximab in primary breast DLBCL had bias according to the difference of treatment period
      between CHOP and R-CHOP era. Thus, in attempt to clarify the impact of rituximab on survival
      and patterns of progression in patients with primary breast DLBCL, the investigators
      performed this matched pair analysis following strict matching criteria in patients with
      primary breast DLBCL, who were identified from our previous nation-wide survey, and nodal
      DLBCL, who were selected from the data registry of Korean Society of Hematology Lymphoma
      Working Party, treated with R-CHOP regimen.
