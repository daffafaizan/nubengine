      high circulating parathyroid hormone. There is evidence suggesting that vitamin D may play a
      role in cardiovascular health outcomes; however, the research is currently inconclusive.
      Magnesium is a cofactor of vitamin D metabolism, and the prevalence of concurrent vitamin D
      and magnesium deficiency is high. This study aims to investigate the effect of vitamin D and
      magnesium supplements in individuals who are overweight and obese on parathyroid hormone and
      cardiometabolic health.
