      respiratory status of people with neurological conditions receiving or scheduled to receive
      Intrathecal Baclofen. The use of Intrathecal Baclofen to manage severe spasticity is a
      developing treatment option with a limited research base, particularly when evaluating the
      influence of intrathecal baclofen on the respiratory system. The proposed research is derived
      from clinical practice and involves joint collaboration between clinical team, research
      professionals and patients.

      In order for the study to evaluate the influence of Intrathecal baclofen has on the
      respiratory system, the proposed research will need to develop and evaluate a method of
      assessing people in the community ensuring it's feasible for people with neurological
      conditions. Prior to implementing a full powered community trial to evaluate the influence of
      intrathecal baclofen on people with neurological conditions.
