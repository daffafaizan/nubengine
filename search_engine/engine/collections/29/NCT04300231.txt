      methods in patients who will be having a cystectomy surgery (surgical removal of the
      bladder). By collecting this data, we aim to show improved postoperative pain scores,
      decreased opioid needs, and decreased opioid side effects (feeling sick to your stomach,
      feeling drowsy/sleepy, blockage/lack of movement in the intestines, inability to completely
      empty the bladder, unusually slow or shallow breathing).

      The specific aim of this study is to compare the difference between the pain control methods
      in achieving the following:

        1. Decreased opioid requirements

        2. Improved postoperative VAS pain scores

        3. Decreased opioid side effects (Nausea, sedation, ileus, respiratory depression)

        4. Decreased hospital length of stay (LOS)
