      eye, has reduced sensation due to a variety of reasons such as previous surgery or infection.
      In more advanced cases of NK, the cornea can develop an area of thinning called an ulcer. If
      the cornea becomes too thin, it is at risk for perforation or rupture, which requires
      extensive surgery to save vision and the eye. This risk can last for many years even after
      the ulcer is no longer active. The purpose of this research is to find out if Oxervate
      (cenegermin-bkbj 0.002%) an FDA-approved treatment for neurotrophic corneal ulcers leads to
      an increase in thickness of the corneal stroma (middle layer of the cornea) during and after
      treatment of a neurotrophic ulcer. The FDA trials demonstrated that Oxervate does lead to
      more rapid healing of the epithelium (thin surface layer) of the cornea, but we are still
      unsure if it increases the thickness of the stroma, which is the strongest part of the
      cornea. Corneal thickness will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT), a
      non-contact imaging device used routinely in ophthalmology examinations. Corneal sensation
      will also be measured during and after treatment with a device called a Cochet-Bonnet
      esthesiometer to see if the treatment increases corneal sensation. If treatment with Oxervate
      increases corneal sensation, then this decreases the risk of future ulcer formation.

      About 10 subjects will take part in this research.
