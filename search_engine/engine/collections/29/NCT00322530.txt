      critically ill patients with acute renal failure on the intensive care unit. In a
      prospectively randomized clinical study patients are treated with either continuous dialysis
      (SLED) or continuous hemofiltration (CVVHD). 200 patients should be included in the study
      (n=100 each). The primary outcome is death at ICU, secondary outcome measures are restitution
      of renal function, days on ICU, hemodynamic stability, dialysis efficiency.
