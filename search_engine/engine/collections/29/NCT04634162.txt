      inhibition until oral P2Y12 inhibitors achieve their full antiplatelet effects in patients
      undergoing coronary stenting. Although in this setting the potent oral P2Y12 inhibitor
      ticagrelor is commonly utilized, there is very limited data on the optimal approach for
      switching between these therapies. In particular, ruling out a drug-drug interaction (DDI) is
      critical to this extent as the presence of a DDI would translate into reduced or abolished
      antiplatelet effects exposing these acute patients to an increased thrombotic risk. Despite
      the available evidence suggesting a lack of DDI with the use of ticagrelor in cangrelor
      treated patients, most data derive from studies in which ticagrelor was given at the time of
      initiation or during cangrelor infusion. To date, there is no data to fully rule out a DDI
      when ticagrelor is given prior to starting cangrelor infusion. The need for such
      investigation is underscored by the relatively high prevalence of pretreatment with
      ticagrelor in acute settings. The methodological approach for this assessment should rely on
      comprehensive pharmacodynamics (PD) investigations aimed to assess levels of P2Y12 receptor
      inhibition, pharmacokinetic (PK) investigations to assess systemic levels of the drug/drug
      metabolite, and mechanistic investigations by assessment of levels of P2Y12 receptor gene
      expression. The overarching aim of this investigation is to rule out a DDI when ticagrelor is
      administered prior to cangrelor infusion.
