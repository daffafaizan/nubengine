      representing more than 13 million people. Current medical, non-surgical knee OA treatments
      focus primarily on symptomatic relief and have met with limited, temporary success. Various
      therapeutic exercise prescriptions have been used to help ameliorate knee OA symptoms and
      improve function. Leg strength training is most commonly used. However, recent evidence
      suggests that shorter programs of kinesthesia, balance and agility (KBA) techniques may
      result in more rapid symptom relief and functional improvements in comparison to traditional
      therapeutic exercise. These early benefits could potentially lead to greater long term
      exercise adherence.

      In a case study of an elderly female patient with dynamic knee instability related to OA,
      physical therapists reported success with a combination of KBA training and traditional
      therapeutic exercise. These findings need to be verified in a controlled clinical trial. This
      pilot study will help determine the proper testing and exercise training methods for a larger
      clinical trial, and will indicate if KBA training done without concurrent strength training
      is a viable intervention.

      Research Hypothesis: Among men and women age 50 and over with Kellgren and Lawrence (1957)
      Grade 2 or higher symptomatic tibiofemoral OA in one or both knees, an 8-week, 3-day per week
      kinesthesia, balance & agility (KBA) exercise program - designed to increase dynamic
      neuromuscular knee stability - safely and effectively changes physical function more
      effectively than standard leg strength training
