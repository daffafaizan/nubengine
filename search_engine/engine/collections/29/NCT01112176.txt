      possibility for right atrial pacing mode.

      Detailed Echo studies will be performed at baseline. Echo studies will be repeated at each
      pacing stage, stages defined as 10 bpm increments in paced heart rate. Each stage will last
      2-3 min or as long as it takes to record the echo study. Heart rate will be increased to 85%
      of predicted heart rate for age or at to appearance of signs of ischemia.

      Hemodynamic parameters will be recorded and segmental longitudinal strain will be calculated
      (as well as other Echo data), for each stage.
