      and nontumor tissues in subjects with mesothelin over-expressing cancers including
      mesothelioma, pancreatic, ovarian, and non small cell lung cancer. This is a single-center,
      single-dose, open-label, pilot study of amatuximab in approximately 20 subjects with
      mesothelin expressing tumors. 111Indium-radiolabeled amatuximab (5 mCi) will be administered.
      Serial SPECT imaging (at 3 specific time points up to 196 hours after cold infusion) will be
      performed to determine binding to tumor and nontumor tissue. Subjects will be observed
      closely for safety and possible development of anti-amatuximab antibodies. Pharmacokinetics
      of radiolabeled antibody will be determined with imaging over time.
