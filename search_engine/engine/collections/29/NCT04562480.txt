      I. To report the major acute wound complication rate associated with hypofractionated
      preoperative radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report the 5-year local failure rate associated with hypofractionated preoperative
      radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.

      II. To report the 5-year disease-free survival rate associated with hypofractionated
      preoperative radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.

      III. To report the 5-year overall survival rate associated with hypofractionated preoperative
      radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.

      IV. To report long-term toxicity rates associated with hypofractionated preoperative
      radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.

      V. To describe patterns of relapse associated with hypofractionated preoperative radiation
      therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.

      VI. To describe patient reported outcomes/quality-of-life outcomes with hypofractionated
      preoperative radiation therapy, 42.75 Gy in 15 fractions.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy once daily (QD) (except weekends and
      holidays) over 3 weeks for a total of 15 fractions. Within 3-6 weeks after completion of
      radiation therapy, patients undergo surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-8 weeks, every 3-4 months
      for years 1-2, and every 6 months for years 3-5.
