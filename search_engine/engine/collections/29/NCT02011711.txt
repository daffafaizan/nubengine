      promoting male to female sexual transmission. One putative risk factor is hormonal
      contraceptive use. Our laboratory recently reported that dendritic cell activation,
      virus-specific T cell expansion, and memory T cell development were impaired among female
      mice administered depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) prior to viral infection of
      mucosal tissue, and we now are enrolling women into a clinical investigation exploring the
      immunomodulatory effects of several common hormonal contraceptive forms. Completion of this
      research will provide important comparative evaluation of the capacity of these drugs to
      modulate host defenses combating genital tract infection, eventually supplying healthcare
      providers more informed recommendations regarding appropriate hormonal contraceptive choices
      among women at risk for acquisition of HIV.
