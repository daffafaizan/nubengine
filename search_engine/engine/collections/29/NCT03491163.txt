        1. To evaluate changes of syndecan-1 concentration during surgery and postoperative period.

        2. Determine the effect of aortic clamping and on-pump duration on endothelial glycocalyx
           damage.

        3. Assess the risk of early postoperative complications and syndecan-1 plasma
           concentrations.

        4. To evaluate the correlation of inflammatory status with glycocalyx damage.

        5. To evaluate glycocalyx damage to patients with diabetes vs non-diabetes.

      Methods:

      Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery are being treated at the Heart, Chest and
      Vascular Surgery Clinic of the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Hospital in Kaunas
      Clinics. After receiving patients written consent a syndecan-1 concentration test will be
      performed upon arrival at the operating room, before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), after CPB,
      upon arrival in the ICU and after 24 hours.

      All needed data for evaluating patients outcome will be taken from medical documentation
      during patients stay in hospital.
