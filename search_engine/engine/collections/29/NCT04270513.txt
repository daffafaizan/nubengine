      (Telemedical Project for integrative Stroke Care) to reduce time delays to EVT in stroke
      patients with large vessel occlusion: After telemedicine-assisted identification of EVT
      candidates in a PSC, a Flying Intervention Team (neuroradiologist and angiography assistant)
      is flown from a CSC via helicopter to the PSC to perform EVT in the local angiography suite.
      Flying Intervention Team service runs from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Patients remain at local stroke
      unit for further treatment.

      Analysis will include time delay to EVT, recanalization, symptomatic intracerebral
      hemorrhage, periprocedural complications, in-hospital complications, and mortality.
