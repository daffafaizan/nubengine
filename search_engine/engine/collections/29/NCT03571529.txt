      ongoing challenge in the rehabilitation field. Up to 85% of stroke survivors experience a
      certain degree of paresis of the upper limb at the onset and only 20% to 56% of survivors
      regain complete functional use of the affected upper limb despite the therapeutic
      interventions in first 3 months . Recovery of upper limb function is generally slower and
      non-complete.

      To support and speed up a recovery process, there are many robotic devices currently used in
      the stroke units. Unlike one-on-one treatment applied by clinicans, robotic devices can
      provide repetitive, task oriented movements,with greater intensity, stimulating and engaging
      environment for user, hence alleviating the labour-intensive aspects of hands-on conventional
      therapy. There are a number of complex robotic devices that have been developed over the last
      two decades to assist upper arm training in rehabilitation.

      Using EMG driven exoskeleton, commercially known as the Hand of Hope (HOH), has been shown
      its efficacy to improve patient's grip and pinch ability, muscle coordination and improve
      functional daily living tasks in patients even after 3,4,8,10 and 14 years after onset of the
      stroke. In addition to continuous investigation efforts needed to be spent, there has not
      been established any treatment protocol using EMG-driven exoskeletons. Since Stroke patients
      need to be focused on their own residual muscle power, clear indications for EMG-driven
      exoskeletons i.e., Hand of Hope, need to be established.

      An investigation designed to highlight all these points will make an important contribution
      to the therapeutic approach using EMG-driven hand robotics for the hand rehabilitation after
      stroke.
