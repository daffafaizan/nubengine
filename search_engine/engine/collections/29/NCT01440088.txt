      distant from tumor vessels. Doxorubicin has poor tissue penetration and targets the regions
      of tumors that are located in proximity to the tumor vessels. The presence of hypoxia in
      solid tumors is associated with a more malignant phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy.
      The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to selectively target the hypoxic
      microenvironment. Soft tissue sarcomas have evidence supporting the presence of hypoxia based
      on pO2 histography, F-MISO and gene expression profiling. There is an absence of therapeutic
      options for subjects with soft tissue sarcoma. Combining doxorubicin with TH-302 may enable
      the targeting of both the normoxic and hypoxic regions of soft tissue sarcoma.
