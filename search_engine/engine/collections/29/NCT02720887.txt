      analysis will be performed by a technique of dynamic light scattering, which permits the
      distribution by volume or by number of NP according to their size. Parallel to the different
      chemical species present in the sample must be measured by atomic emission spectrometry with
      inductively coupled plasma.

      The results of this study will be useful for further studies on the fetal toxicity of NP in
      humans.
