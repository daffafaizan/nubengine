      World Health Organization as a global pandemic. Outbreak forecasting and mathematical models
      suggest that the number of COVID-19 cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks and
      months. There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel interventions.
      This protocol aims to use passive antibody therapy via convalescent plasma from
      SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who have developed antibody immunity, COVID-19 convalescent
      plasma (C19-CP), as treatment for hospitalized children with COVID-19 disease at pediatric
      academic hospitals across Canada. The unknown role for convalescent plasma in treating
      COVID-19 necessitates further study.
