      participating parents had the opportunity to receive 10 video-based telemedicine sessions
      administered over 13 weeks. Study assessments took place at baseline, post-treatment, and 3
      month followup. Study outcomes included parent reported hypoglycemia fear, parenting stress,
      diabetes distress, and child glycated hemoglobin.
