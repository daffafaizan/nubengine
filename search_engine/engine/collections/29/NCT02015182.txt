      block has increased in recent years. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been
      used for postoperative analgesia for surgery to the abdominal wall and involves the injection
      of local anesthetic solution into a plane between internal oblique (IO) and transversus
      abdominis (TA) muscles. The TAP block has the advantage of providing unilateral analgesia in
      instances of non-midline abdominal incision and is particularly useful in cases where
      epidural blockade is either contraindicated or technically or logistically not feasible.
      Bupivacaine and ropivacaine have been used as local anesthetics for TAP blocks in published
      studies to date. However, no data exist regarding the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine after
      TAP block in children. The aims of this study are to determine population pharmacokinetic
      (PK) parameters of bupivacaine in children following a TAP block, using a population-based PK
      approach.
