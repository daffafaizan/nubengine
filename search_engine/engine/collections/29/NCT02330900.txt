      activated cell phone. ICD therapy will have been temporarily inactivated before exposure to
      cell phones to avoid inappropriate shocks, and the sensitivity level of the ICD will be set
      to maximum. The cell phones will be held over the ICD generator, as well as in the
      parasternar region (close to the ICD lead, which senses the signals).

      Interference will be assessed by the presence of visible artefacts on the real-time
      electrogram, with ICD marker annotations showing atrial and/or ventricular sensed episodes.
      The outcome measure will be the number and proportion of patients who have electromagnetic
      interference of the ICD when exposed to cell phones.

      The procedure will take approximately 5-10minutes, with reprogramming of the device at the
      end of the test. No further follow-up in the context of the study will be performed.
