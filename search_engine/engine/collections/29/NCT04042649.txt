      the risk for morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects
      of environmental interventions for the prevention of delirium.

      Methods: A total of 192 patients who had been admitted to the surgical intensive care unit
      (SICU) in Asan Medical Center during the pre-intervention period (Jun 2013 to Oct 2013) and
      the post-intervention period (Jun 2014 to Oct 2014) was enrolled and prospective cohort study
      was done. The environmental intervention included cognitive assessment, providing orientation
      and comfortable environment, and a proper sleeping environment. The primary outcomes were the
      incidence rate of delirium, time of delirium onset, and the duration of delirium.
