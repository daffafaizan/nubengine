      by 20-min once-per-day inhalation for 7 days, with wash-out period of 7 days to prevent the
      residual effects of interventions across study periods. The primary treatment outcome was the
      change in running time-to-exhaustion from baseline to day 7. Additionally, assessment of
      other exercise performance endpoints and clinical chemistry biomarkers were performed at
      baseline and after 7 days after each intervention.
