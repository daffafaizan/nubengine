      increased cognitive and physiological arousal and higher overall metabolic rate during sleep,
      particularly at sleep onset. There is evidence that reducing this arousal may impact sleep
      latency and nocturnal awake time. Although relaxation treatments have been integrated into
      behavioral therapies, there are numerous barriers to their implementation in real world
      settings. The present study is designed to examine the effect of a portable biofeedback
      device designed to induce physiological relaxation as compared to an inactive sham control
      device condition in reducing sleep onset latency in persons with primary insomnia over a 4
      week period at three separate research sites.
