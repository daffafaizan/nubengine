      lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts.
      Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions
      associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural
      artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to
      public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. The current study will advance
      nursing science by using a theory-based computer-run expert system to provide an effective
      physical activity intervention for this underserved population. The consent form was
      completed by all participants and describes the nature and purpose of the study, procedure,
      risks and benefits to participating, alternative therapies available, and confidentiality.
