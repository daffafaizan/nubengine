      program, BOKS (Build Our Kids' Success), in increasing objectively measured physical activity
      levels among children in elementary and middle school in 7 schools in Massachusetts. The
      study focuses on capturing valid and objective assessments of student-level physical activity
      during BOKS program time and assessing the impact of the BOKS program on overall daily
      physical activity levels using minute-by-minute physical activity level data among elementary
      aged students. Data is also collected to understand how increasing physical activity may
      impact students' sleep.
