      preserve end-expiratory lung volume. After emergence and extubation, this volume will
      diminish instantly. Some patients will have difficulties to restore functional residual
      capacity (FRC) during the early phase of recovery. If routine high FIO2 is being delivered
      together with maintained PEEP prior to extubation, several important prerequisites are
      established for the development of postoperative atelectasis. The investigators hypothesize
      that establishing zero positive end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) immediately prior to emergence
      preoxygenation, will prevent gas with high oxygen concentration from entering dorso-basal
      areas of the lungs, and thereby diminishing postoperative atelectasis formation and improve
      oxygenation.

      This randomized controlled study will study overweight patients undergoing general anesthesia
      for laparoscopic surgery. The patients in the two study groups will receive mechanical
      ventilation with identical settings, comprising low TV, PEEP, and no RM. Randomization will
      occur at the end of surgery, before awakening. The patients will be allocated to zero PEEP
      (ZEEP) or maintained PEEP during emergence preoxygenation and extubation. Importantly, the
      intervention group will have ZEEP established while still having low ETO2 levels, prior to
      any preoxygenation. Arterial blood gases will be collected before, during and after
      anaesthesia. Primary endpoint measure will be change in oxygenation from before awakening to
      after awakening.
