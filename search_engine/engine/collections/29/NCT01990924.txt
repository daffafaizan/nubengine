    
      Methods: Patients undergoing transradial approach diagnostic angiography ± ad hoc PCI, wil be
      randomized to fluoroscopy at 7.5 FPS vs. 15 FPS prior to procedure. Both 7.5 and 15 FPS
      fluoroscopy protocols will be configured with a fixed dose per pulse of 40 nGy. Primary
      endpoints will be operator radiation dose (measured with dosimeter attached to the left side
      of thyroid shield in µSv), patient radiation dose (expressed as dose-area product in μGy.m2),
      and fluoroscopy time.
