      channel blocker kinidinsulfate will be given under standardized conditions to patients with
      an early onset and pharmaco-resistant genetic epilepsy with and without mutations in the
      potassium channels KCNT1 and KCNQ2 and the sodium channel gene SCN2A. The primary endpoint
      will be a significant seizure reduction under trial medication compared to baseline.
      Secondary endpoints will be the improvement of electroencephalographic characteristics of the
      respective EEs.
