    
      This study is a randomized, double or evaluator-blinded, single dose, four-arm, crossover PK
      study in eighteen (18) healthy volunteers, both male and female adults, at 18-40 years of
      age.

      All candidates will be screened and only those who satisfy all enrollment criteria will be
      enrolled into this study. Each study subject will participate in a screening visit and four
      (4) study visits with one (1) randomized study treatment given in each visit.

      PK samples will be analyzed with an established LC/MS/MS method. An End-of-Study (EOS) safety
      evaluation will be conducted at the end of Study Visit-4.
