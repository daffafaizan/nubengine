      iron plus erythropoietin versus intravenous iron alone for the treatment of iron restrictive
      anemia (iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic inflammation) prior to unilateral total
      hip or knee arthroplasty surgery. Half of the study population will be randomly assigned to
      receive intravenous iron (Venofer; iron sucrose) and Eprex (subcutaneous epoetin alfa), while
      the other half will be randomized to receive Venofer (intravenous iron sucrose) and placebo
      (subcutaneous saline). This trial will be conducted in two phases. The vanguard phase will be
      conducted at a single site with a primary outcome of evaluating feasibility of the study. The
      full study phase will be conducted at four sites with a primary outcome of determining the
      impact of a combination treatment (intravenous iron plus erythropoietin) versus intravenous
      iron treatment alone on preoperative hemoglobin concentration. This study will also examine
      the RBC transfusion rate and clinical outcomes such as death, stroke, myocardial infarction,
      pulmonary embolism, infection, kidney injury, and deep vein thrombosis as secondary outcomes.

      Preoperatively, patients will be administered a total of 900mg of intravenous iron (Venofer,
      iron sucrose) over three visits (3-6 weeks before surgery). Then patients will be randomized
      to receive either two administrations of 40,000 IU of Erythropoietin (Eprex; Epoeitin alfa)
      or an identical placebo (saline) over two study visits (2-3 weeks before surgery). Study
      participants will be followed-up for 12 weeks after surgery.

      Study assessments and potential adverse events reporting will be undertaken at each study
      visit.
