      diagnostic modality to identify small bowel abnormalities, while the completion rate ranged
      from 75.1% to 95.6%. A novel magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) system could
      facilitate the capsule to pass through pylorus thereby reducing the gastric transit time
      (GTT). The investigators perform this study to determine the potential improvement in capsule
      endoscopy completion rate (CECR) under magnetic steering vs standard mode.

      Methods: Patients referred for magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy (MCE) in the
      participating center from June 2017 to November 2017 were prospectively enrolled. Magnetic
      steering of MCE was performed after standard gastric examination. Capsule endoscopy
      completion rate (CECR), gastric transit time (GTT), pyloric transit time (PTT) and rapid
      gastric transit rate (GTT â‰¤ 30 min) were compared with the historical control group enrolled
      from January 2017 to May 2017.
