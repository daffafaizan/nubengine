      Center (GCRC) for study on 5 occasions. All subjects will receive an intravenous injection of
      hCG dose of 1, 10, 25, 100, and 250 micrograms, each of which will be given on one of 5
      different days each separated by at least two weeks at 8 AM. Blood samples will be obtained
      at t -0.5, 0, and 24 hours after injection. All visits to the GCRC will be done as out
      patients. The total amount of blood withdrawn will be about 35 teaspoons. For normal control
      subjects this will be over a period of about 4-6 months and for PCOS subjects this will be
      over a period of about 6-10 weeks.
