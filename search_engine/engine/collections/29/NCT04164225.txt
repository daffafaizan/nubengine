      compared to exercise will result in reduced pain and improved body awareness and
      proprioception (primary behavioral endpoints), disability, balance, core muscle strength, and
      other CLBP symptoms will be secondary behavioral endpoints.To test this hypothesis, the
      investigators will assess (1) participant recruitment and retention ; (2) adherence to
      interventions, engagement/satisfaction with the program; and (3) changes in body
      awareness-related brain activation and connectivity pre-post intervention (Qigong vs
      exercise) related to primary endpoints of pain perception, body awareness and objective
      measures of lower limb proprioception.
