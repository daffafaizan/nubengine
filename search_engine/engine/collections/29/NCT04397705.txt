    
      This is a pilot, single arm, open label feasibility study. This is a single centre trial
      based in a large tertiary cancer centre which treats patients across all solid and
      haematological malignancies. Patients will be recruited from all disease groups.

      Patients who present with symptoms suspicious for Covid-19 who the admitting clinicians deems
      appropriate for outpatient management will be considered for this study.

      Patients who are enrolled will undergo continuous physiological monitoring for up to three
      weeks. This includes continuous monitoring of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature,
      activity levels (by accelerometer measurement) and twice daily pulse oximetry. The
      physiological data will not be reviewed in real time by clinicians and therefore will not be
      used to alter patients' standard care. The pulse oximetry data will be visible to patients
      who will be given clear guidelines to follow with regards to contacting the cancer centre
      hotline should values deviate from baseline.

      In the pilot phase of RECAP 10-30 patients will each be monitored for up to 3 weeks and the
      following endpoints will be addressed:

      Physiological trends and interactions predictive of clinical deterioration due to COVID-19
      (Co-primary endpoint) Reliability of biosensor data collection/transmission using digital
      technology from patients self-isolating at home (Co-primary endpoint) Acceptability and
      tolerability of wearable biosensors and continuous monitoring If the pilot phase is
      successful we will move to a phase II study in a larger number of patients where the
      objective will be to refine a physiological signature predictive of clinical deterioration in
      COVID-19 patients so that early hospitalisation and relevant medical interventions can be
      arranged.
