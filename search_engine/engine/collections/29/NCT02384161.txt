      handgrip exercises have been widely utilized to explain the effects of fatigue on the
      strength and activation of the muscles involved in certain exercises. Among the many factors
      that can influence the process of muscular fatigue, blood flow available at the time of
      exercise is an aspect of fundamental importance, as some studies demonstrate changes in the
      pattern of muscle recruitment and strength recovery when the exercise is performed associated
      with an external obstruction of blood flow.

      Resistance exercise associated with partial obstruction of blood flow (ischemic exercise) is
      gaining notoriety in the scientific environment, mainly due to strong evidence indicating
      that such activity can increase strength and muscle hypertrophy, even when performed with low
      intensity loads. The underlying neuromuscular mechanisms such effects are still partially
      unknown, and some studies have shown differences in the recruitment of motor units during its
      execution, and the relationship fatigue-strength after ischemic resistance exercise.
      Nevertheless, there are still some gaps in the literature regarding the neuromuscular
      responses during and after unilateral intermittent isometric handgrip protocols to failure in
      the associated task to partial obstruction of blood flow.

      Evidence suggests that the total obstruction of blood flow decreases performance and
      accelerates the recovery of the isometric strength after fatigue protocols, but the effects
      of partial obstruction on these variables remain unknown. In the above so far, it seems that
      isometric fatigue protocols associated with remote obstruction (away from the venue of the
      exercise) blood flow can influence acutely in strength members at a distance, but it is not
      known as a protocol unilateral isometric fatigue associated with partial and complete
      obstruction of blood flow can influence acutely the strength of the contralateral limb (ie,
      not subject to any type of exercise). Thus, the realization of this study is justified by the
      possibility of answering these questions still little studied, with regard to neuromuscular
      factors of ischemic resistance training.
