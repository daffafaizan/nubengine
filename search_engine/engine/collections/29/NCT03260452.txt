      in adipose tissue and the development of insulin resistance, resulting in type 2 diabetes
      occurrence. However, the mechanisms mediating inflammation and its metabolic consequences are
      still unclear. In humans, recent publications have suggested an important interaction between
      the metabolic status and medullar hematopoietic activity. A preliminary study performed by
      the STROMAlab's research team has identified functional hematopoietic stem cells in human
      adipose tissue samples, indicating that adipose tissue-hematopoiesis is an active mechanism.

      To determine whether an alteration in adipose tissue-hematopoiesis could be a hallmark of
      type 2 diabetes in human, biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue will be performed in 2
      groups of 10 volunteers: overweight/obese type 2 diabetes subjects versus healthy volunteers,
      matched on age.

      Then, hematopoietic stem cells extracted from human biopsies will be grafted into
      immunodeficient mice and after 12 weeks, flow cytometry using antibodies specific for human
      cell surface markers will be performed to quantify proinflammatory macrophages derived from
      human adipose tissue-hematopoietic stem cells.
