      cross-sectional area and muscle fascicle length following post-operative Achilles tendon
      surgery.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive an electrical stimulation unit (CompexÂ®, DJO
      Global, San Diego, CA). Twenty of these units will be experimental and 20 will be sham.
