      Primary

        -  To evaluate changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody levels over time among
           patients treated on ECOG-E9802.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the concordance of PSA antibody assessment between the ECOG Immunology
           Laboratory and the NCI Immunology Laboratory.

      OUTLINE: Previously tested samples are evaluated for changes in PSA antibody levels over time
      (from baseline to follow-up at 12 and 24 weeks) at the ECOG Immunology Laboratory and the NCI
      Immunology Laboratory. Results are compared between the laboratories.
