      pressure , systolic pulse pressure variations , stroke volume variation , pleth variability
      index etc are being used as markers of volume status and which in turn have been used as
      indicators of post general anesthesia induction hypotension in the past . In the current
      study the investigators aim to validate the role of a bed side 2-D transthoracic
      echocardiography (TTE) as a guide to identify the volume status of the patient before
      induction and clinically observe for the haemodynamic changes in the form of mean arterial
      pressure variations in the immediate post induction period.

      The investigators aim to perform preoperative bed side Transthoracic echocardiography in 150
      American society of Anesthesiologists grade-I/II patients posted for routine General
      anaesthesia procedures and assess their volume status . Then the investigators would collect
      10 mean arterial pressure recordings at one minute interval in the immediate postinduction
      period and assess the accuracy of TTE in identifying potential patients at risk of developing
      post induction hypotension.
