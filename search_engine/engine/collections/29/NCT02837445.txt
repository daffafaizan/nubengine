      protocol CS-03 Version 3.0 with more stringent hypertension inclusion criteria and different
      observation intervals for efficacy and safety.

      In CS-03 Version 3.0 the time of the primary efficacy endpoint was reduced from 6 months to 3
      months post randomization which was deemed a suitable interval for the chronic effect,
      whereas for the safety endpoint, the period was lengthened from 6 month to 12 months post
      randomization to better monitor potential risks of the treatment on cardiac function
      (Blinding period was increased from 6 to 12 months). Protocols were thus split in order to
      allow better clarification to the difference in the time to the primary endpoints for
      efficacy and safety between the two CIP versions and simplify data analysis.

      Protocol Ver 3.0 prescribes data analysis of all patients randomized under version 1.1 to be
      performed once they complete the 6 months follow-up as set in protocol version 1.1
      (NCT0283744). It is expected that ~40 patients will be randomized according to protocol
      version 1.1 prior to the enrollment of patients according to protocol version 3.0. The
      results will be considered as interim analysis.

      The recruitment for the protocol version 1.1 is now completed. Total of 47 patients were
      randomized according to protocol version 1.1 and all patients completed the follow-up period
      for the primary endpoint.

      Patients are currently being followed up for the study "extension period".
