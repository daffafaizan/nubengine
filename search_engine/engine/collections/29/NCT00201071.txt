      Proposed is a non-randomized, controlled, prospective trial to test the efficacy of a
      bilingual intervention to improve asthma care for low-income inner-city children enrolled in
      subsidized preschool childcare programs. Because of high rates of asthma prevalence,
      subsidized preschool childcare programs offer ideal settings to test innovative strategies to
      improve asthma care within communities at highest risk of morbidity.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study will comprise three arms. Arm 1 is surveillance, in which children with asthma are
      identified. In Arm 2, children with asthma are identified and given written Asthma Action
      Plans (monitoring). Arm 3 consists of surveillance, monitoring, and education.
