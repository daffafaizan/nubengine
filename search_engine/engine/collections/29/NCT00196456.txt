    
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the photodynamic therapy in periodontal
      pockets and to assess the reduction of subgingival bacteria.

      The first step will include the evaluation of the quantity of the light which will activate
      the photosensitizer in the various niches in the periodontal pocket.

      The second step will evaluate the distribution of the photosensitizer in the periodontal
      pocket.

      The third step will assess the woundhealing of the the photodynamic therapy compared to
      conventional periodontal therapy with an ultrasonic device.
