      determine the orthodontic treatment plan. The operator will inform them about the aim of the
      study and ask them to provide a written informed consent.

      Before brackets' bonding (T0) the operator will evaluate with intraoral clinical examination
      and take intraoral photographs and evaluate with DIAGNOdent. Then after brackets' placement
      on teeth, the CO2 laser will be applied to the area of enamel about 2 mm of width around
      orthodontic brackets in a split mouth design. To blind the intervention sides on patients the
      control sides will receive nontherapeutic light.

      Then intraoral photographs will be taken and the teeth will be assessed with DIAGNOdent (T1).

      All patients will be trained to brush their teeth with a tooth paste containing 1100 ppm of
      fluoride twice a day. After 4 weeks of irradiation (T2) the patients will be examined for
      white spot lesions formation by clinical examination using Geiger index, photographic
      examination using AutoCAD 2009 evaluating formation and area percentage of white spot
      lesions, and the degree of demineralization will be assessed with DIAGNOdent. The all exams
      will also be done after 12 weeks of irradiation (T3).
