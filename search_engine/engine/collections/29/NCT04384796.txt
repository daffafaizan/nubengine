      practices such as voicing, speaking, sitting, walking, mental skills, communication,
      socializing acquire new skills. Infant Movement Motivation Questionnaire(IMMQ) 27-item scale
      that questions babies' discovery, activity, motivation, and adaptation skills in daily life
      activities through the parent. The scale was developed in 2012 by Samantha Doralp. As the
      scale provides information about how babies spend their time in their natural environment and
      the personal characteristics of babies, it was decided to carry out a validity and
      reliability study in the Turkish language, considering the early use of support programs in
      clinical use. The development of this scale shows the first step in understanding the role of
      baby characteristics in the movement development of babies in the first year of life. A good
      understanding of the link between baby characteristics and motor development can have a
      significant impact on planning interventions and can have a significant impact in ensuring
      that a particular environment is optimally tailored to the child's use and needs.
