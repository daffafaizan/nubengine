      two groups by age and gender matched.100 mg Longevinex® capsule was given to the study group
      and 100mg placebo capsule to the control group. All participants underwent OCT scanning with
      spectral domain optic coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at baseline and 1 h following Longevinex®
      or placebo administration. The choroidal thickness was measured manually by the Heidelberg
      Eye explore software(version 5.3.3.0, Heidelberg Engineering) with a vertical line to the
