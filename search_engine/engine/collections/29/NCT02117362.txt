      with the standard therapeutic dose of ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma for whom
      ipilimumab would be considered standard of care. In addition to monitoring for toxicity and
      clinical response, blood samples will be obtained to assess immunologic measures relevant to
      galectin biology and ipilimumab T-cell check-point inhibition
