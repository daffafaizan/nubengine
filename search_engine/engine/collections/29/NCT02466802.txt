      combination of regorafenib and sildenafil. Both study medications will be taken orally on
      days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle.

      Using a modified 3+3 dose escalation design, 3-6 patients with an advanced solid tumor will
      be enrolled at each dose level. Additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD until a total
      of 12 patients have been treated at the MTD.

      Eligible patients will have received available standard treatments. Patients with solid
      tumors for which regorafenib would be considered a standard treatment are eligible as long as
      regorafenib has not been previously administered.

      Blood samples will be collected for correlative studies including PK, PD, and CTCs. Tumor
      samples archived from a previous biopsy or surgery will also be collected for correlative
      studies.
