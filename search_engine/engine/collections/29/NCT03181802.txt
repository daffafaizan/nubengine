      BoNT-A Type A injections to a placebo in patients with chronic Low-back Pain (LBP). This
      superiority trial obtained support from the French Hospital Clinical Research Project (PHRC)
      and the approval of a French ethics committee (2003/02) ("Comit√© Sud-Ouest et Outre-Mer III",
      consent obtained in February 2003).

      The number of participants included in the study was chosen to be similar as those included
      in previous studies, that showed a strong positive effect of BoNT-A injections on LBP.
      Furthermore, the design of our study (i.e. a crossover) increased the power of the
      statistical analysis. A scientific committee has been solicited at this step, after including
      19 patients, to assess the results.
