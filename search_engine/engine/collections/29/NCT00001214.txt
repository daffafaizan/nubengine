      variety of immunologic abnormalities including lymphocyte phenotypic and lymphokine
      production dysregulation. Because of their low blood counts, it has been difficult to obtain
      sufficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells for research studies. Patients agreeing to this
      protocol will be lymphapheresed the equivalent of one or two units of cells (approximately
      1-2 x 10(8) cells), which will be used for research purposes.
