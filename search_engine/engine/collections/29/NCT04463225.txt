      combination for suicide risk. The current study examines changes in alcohol/drug use/misuse
      and depression as soldiers undergo the transition from Active Duty to Veteran and offers a
      personalized internet-based brief intervention intended to prevent/reduce alcohol misuse and
      depression in this population.

      The study's objectives are to empirically quantify the form of changes that occur with
      respect to alcohol use and depression over the transition; to identify stable individual risk
      factors (e.g., personality, military experiences) and dynamic risk factors (e.g., changes in
      stressors and normative contexts over time) that may be associated with differential temporal
      patterns of suicide-related behavior (i.e., alcohol use/misuse) and cognition (i.e.,
      depression); and lastly, to determine whether a simple, internet-delivered brief intervention
      shown can reduce risky behavior in the transitioning Veteran population.
