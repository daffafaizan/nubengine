      reflux precipitated by upper gastrointestinal motility changes that respond to a gluten free
      diet; whereas patients without gluten related disorders develop Barrett's due to the accepted
      mechanism of acid reflux.

      The primary objectives are to explore if patients with gluten-related disorders (CD and GS)
      may have an altered mechanism of developing Barrett's esophagus typified by increased alkali
      reflux compared to those without gluten-related disorders; and to determine if this mechanism
      (altered motility and increased non-acid reflux) responds to a gluten free diet.

      Specific objectives include assessing whether patients with GRD and Barrett's esophagus have
      altered esophageal reflux extent, frequency, and type (assessed by pH-impedance); altered
      symptom profiles; differential esophageal body and sphincter pressures (assessed by
      manometry); aberrant gastroduodenal motility (assessed by videofluoroscopy) in comparison to
      patients with BE and no GRD. Finally a gluten free diet will be instituted to assess whether
      a gluten-free diet alters esophageal reflux extent, frequency, and type or symptom profiles
      in those with BE with and without a GRD.
