    
      The purpose of this protocol is to continue our studies of the evaluation and treatment of
      patients with fasting hypoglycemia due to diverse etiologies. Patients will be admitted to
      the Clinical Research Center under this protocol and undergo supervised fasting, dynamic
      tests of insulin secretion when appropriate, medically indicated imaging studies, and
      appropriate medical and surgical treatment.

      The goals of this study are:

        1. To understand the pathophysiology and various causes of hypoglycemia (e.g.,

           insulinomas, MEN1, MEN2).

        2. To identify new circulating biomarkers of insulinomas.

        3. To create a repository of clinical data and samples for future research of insulinomas.
