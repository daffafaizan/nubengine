      tacrolimus when combined with sirolimus is lower than that reported in the literature where
      tacrolimus was not combined with sirolimus. To determine if the difference was due to the
      drug interaction between sirolimus and tacrolimus, a controlled clinical trial was proposed.

      The purpose of this study is to understand whether the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus is
      influenced by the concurrent use of sirolimus.
