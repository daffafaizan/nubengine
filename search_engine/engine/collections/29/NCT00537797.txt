      from malignant follicular nodules and sometimes yields equivocal results due to inadequate
      sampling or indeterminate cytology. The standard of care for patients with equivocal or
      follicular histology is surgical removal of these nodules, most of which are benign in
      nature. FDG-PET, as evidenced by our prior experience and studies from other groups, may have
      application in discriminating benign from malignant disease in these patients with equivocal
      or follicular FNA results using standardized uptake value determination. We have demonstrated
      the feasibility and preliminary clinical utility of using limited neck FDG-PET exams in
      patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules in a pilot study. The purpose of this trial is to
      prospectively evaluate a larger series of patients with equivocal or follicular histology on
      FNA to more accurately define the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for diagnostic
      imaging of these nodules. In addition, the utility of this modality in identifying metastatic
      foci in patients with thyroid cancer having follicular or equivocal histology on FNA will be
      assessed. If the sensitivity and specificity of this modality are determined to be high
      (â‰¥95%) for diagnosing malignant nodules in these patients, many patients with benign disease
      may potentially benefit by avoiding unnecessary operations.
