        -  To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temozolomide (TMZ) in combination with
           methotrexate (MTX) and rituximab (RTX) when administered prior to twice daily
           fractionated whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with primary central
           nervous system lymphoma.

        -  To compare the two-year survival rate in patients receiving pre-irradiation
           chemotherapy, twice daily fractionated whole brain radiation therapy and
           post-irradiation temozolomide to the reported two-year survival rate of Radiation
           Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 93-10. RTOG 9310 does not fall within
           ClinicalTrials.gov registration/reporting requirements.)

        -  To compare the pre-irradiation chemotherapy tumor response rates to the reported rate
           from RTOG 93-10.

        -  To report progression-free survival.

        -  To assess acute and long-term neurologic toxicity, and to collect quality of life data
           for this patient group.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
