    
      The objectives of this study are to capture the change in pain intensity, physical/emotional
      function, and pain impact for patients diagnosed with neuropathic pain who undergo an
      Exablate treatment and to capture safety data of the procedure.

      The safety assessment measure is the incidence and frequency of device and procedure related
      Adverse Events (AEs) in subjects who undergo an Exablate treatment.

      Performance will be measure by assessing the change from baseline to 3 months post Exablate
      treatment for pain intensity defined as a decrease of at least 30% of pain on the Numeric
      Rating Scale (NRS). Assessing the change from baseline to 6-12 months post Exablate treatment
      for pain intensity assessed by using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)
