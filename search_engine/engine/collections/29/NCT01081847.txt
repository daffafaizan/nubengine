      escalation, Phase IB, which will assess the safety and immunogenicity of a mixture of
      synthetic peptides derived from CS protein of P. vivax, formulated in adjuvant Montanide ISA
      720 and 51; in healthy men and nonpregnant women without previous history of malaria
      infection.

      In order to optimize the vaccine dose, eligible participants were enrolled to receive three
      doses of vaccine containing peptide mixtures at a dose of 50 ug or 100 ug of each individual
      peptide, for a final dose of 150 ug or 300 ug respectively, in a volume of 0.5 mL. The
      previous clinical trial had indicated that doses between 30 ug and 100 ug produced better
      responses than lower doses. The first immunization dose (given at Month 0) contained the
      peptides N and C only, whereas the two boosting doses (given at Months 2 and 4) contained all
      three (N, R, and C) peptides (Table 1). Vaccination was performed by intramuscular injection
      in the deltoid muscle, alternating arms with each injection.

      For safety reasons, participants assigned to the low vaccine dose groups were immunized first
      and only two weeks after initiation when no serious adverse events (SAE) had occurred,
      immunization of participants in the high-dose was started. Half of the participants assigned
      to receive placebo were immunized along with each dose level group. Clinical monitors and the
      IRBs of the University of Valle and IMC, evaluated the occurrence and severity of adverse
      events (AE) associated with immunization. The occurrence of more than three AE (severity
      grade 2 or higher) or one SAE related to the vaccine would have led to study termination.
      Participants who left the study were not replaced.
