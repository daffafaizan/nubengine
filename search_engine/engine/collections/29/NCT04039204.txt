      women with endometriosis undergoing IVF have not been diagnosed or treated for their disease.
      Recent evidence suggests that biomarkers for endometriosis predict IVF failure and
      miscarriage. Further suppression of endometriosis prior to IVF has been shown to dramatically
      improve pregnancy rates in unexplained infertility with suspected endometriosis. Elagolix
      (Orilissa) is a new generation FDA approved orally active GnRHr antagonist that is rapidly
      reversible, for the treatment of endometriosis and pelvic pain. There have been no studies on
      the efficacy of elagolix for the treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility. Given the
      recent study in Fertility and Sterility demonstrating IVF outcome prediction using BCL6 as a
      biomarker for the presence of endometriosis and subsequent preliminary data showing benefit
      using surgery and GnRH agonist therapy, there is adequate rationale to examine the use of the
      orally active, non-peptide compound (elagolix) for estrogen suppression prior to frozen
      embryo transfer in women who test positive for BCL6 and an associated protein, SIRT1. In this
      multi-central randomized controlled trial (RCT), the EFFECT Trial, the investigators plan to
      recruit 100 subjects with prior unexplained IVF failure with positive endometrial BCL6/SIRT1
      expression. To qualify all subjects will need to have a preimplantation genetic testing
      (PGT-A) tested euploid embryo and intentions to undergo frozen embryo transfer. Subjects will
      be randomized to receive elagolix (200 mg BID) or OCPs for 2 months prior to standardized
      FET. Primary study outcomes will be pregnancy outcome.
