      undergo surgical treatment. Prior to scheduled surgery, subjects will be asked to donate a
      10-20 ml blood sample. After surgery, surplus tissues (including tumor and adjacent normal
      tissues) not required for diagnosis will be collected. Subject clinical information will be
      collected, including basic demographic information, medical history, family history, current
      cancer history and treatment. After surgery, a final pathology report will be obtained for
      each subject's surgical specimen. In some instances and based on the cancer indications
      required, longitudinal data may also be collected at a frequency of every 6 months to once
      per year. Longitudinal data will include information on study subject survival and disease
      recurrence.
