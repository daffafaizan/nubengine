      stem cell characterized by intravascular hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, anemia, and thrombosis.
      The clinical features of PNH result from the lack of one or more of GPI-linked proteins that
      serve to protect cells from autologous complement mediated attack. Two such proteins, CD55
      (decay accelerating factor) and CD59 (reactive lysis inhibitor) have been shown to be absent
      from PNH erythrocytes and platelets as well as other cell types.

      Evidence strongly suggests that lack of the terminal complement inhibitor CD59 is responsible
      for the sensitivity of PNH erythrocytes and platelets to the effects of autologous
      complement. Since the pathogenesis of PNH is due to the inability of PNH red cells and
      platelets to inhibit the activation of terminal complement, it is logical to hypothesize that
      a terminal complement inhibitor could effectively stop the intravascular hemolysis, obviate
      or lessen the need for transfusions, and possibly decrease the propensity of life threatening
      thrombosis. Eculizumab (h5G1.1-mAb) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that like CD59
      inhibits terminal complement.

      This study is an open label, multi-center study of eculizumab, administered intravenously for
      52 weeks to approximately 85 PNH patients. The study is designed to evaluate the safety of
      eculizumab in transfusion dependent patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
      and to determine if the administration of this terminal complement inhibitor could provide a
      safe and effective substitute for CD59 function.
