    
      Phase II study testing chemo-free induction therapy with Ibrutinib + Obinutuzumab during nine
      months followed by a MRD-driven strategy. Assessment of response as well as bone marrow MRD
      evaluation will be performed at Day 1 month 9:

        1. Patients reaching CR with marrow MRD below 10-4 threshold will continue ibrutinib during
           6 additional months.

        2. Patients in PR or bone marrow MRD > 10-4 will receive Ibrutinib during 6 additional
           months and 4 courses of FC+ GA101. At Day 1 Month 16, patients in CR but with MRD> 10-4
           will continue Ibrutinib until progressive disease.

        3. Patients in stable or progressive disease will be excluded out of the trial.

      Final evaluation of response (with BM MRD) will be performed at Day 1 Month 16.
