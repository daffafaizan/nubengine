      cancer pain who had successfully completed Study DO-118 with dose-stable pain control taking
      at least 8 mg of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) or its equivalent morphine sulfate SR
      (slow release) dosage. Patients were started on the dose of OROS hydromorphone equivalent to
      the opioid dose on which they had achieved dose-stable pain control in the SR (slow release)
      phase of Study DO-118. Patients returned to their study clinic once a month for 1 year.
      Dosage adjustments to study medications and breakthrough pain medication were permitted. OROS
      hydromorphone HCI (slow release) tablets in 8, 16, 32 and 64mg doses administered orally
      every 24 hours
