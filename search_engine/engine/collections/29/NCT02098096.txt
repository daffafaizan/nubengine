      osteoarthritis (PTOA). Given that the medical management of chronic PTOA is similar to
      idiopathic OA, the investigators propose a randomized, clinical trial to pilot negative work
      exercise in Veterans with knee OA as a proof-of-concept study for a subsequent investigation
      for people with PTOA.

      Research Setting: DC VAMC, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation Laboratory

      Participants: Men between the ages of 50 and 70 years with a history of bilateral knee
      osteoarthritis will be consecutively recruited from the DC VAMC Rheumatology Service,
      Geriatrics Service, and Primary Care Medical Service.

      Implications/Significance: The use of negative work exercise to enhance the force attenuation
      properties of muscle is an innovative approach to the treatment of OA and PTOA, and
      represents a significant departure from previous rehabilitation studies concerning arthritis.
      Use of a negative work paradigm may prove to be beneficial for older Veterans with OA and
      active military personnel with PTOA since similar muscle mechanics are involved in the energy
      absorption at the knee joint during gait. Despite the functional importance of lengthening
      muscle actions in protecting weight-bearing joints affected by arthritis, the authors are not
      aware of a study that involves the sole use of a negative work intervention for OA or PTOA.
      Addressing the aims of this proposal would lay the ground work needed to justify larger
      clinical trials featuring the negative work paradigm for soldiers with PTOA.
