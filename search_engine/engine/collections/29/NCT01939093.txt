      treatment with quetiapine and haloperidol. The quetiapine group will receive quetiapine at
      least 100 mg per day and the haloperidol group will receive haloperidol at least 2 mg per day
      orally once a day for four weeks. The doses will be increased every 5 days until no psychotic
      symptom is observed from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Common antipsychotic
      adverse events will be checked and documented daily.
