      flexibility training through a LumosityÂ®-based training module over the course a five week
      timeframe in patients with chronic hip, knee, and back pain results in detectable changes in
      resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). The investigators will explore changes in rsFC
      particularly within the default mode (DMN), frontoparietal (FPN), and cingulo-opercular (CON)
      brain networks.
