    
      This is a prospective, observer blind, multi-site, randomized, controlled, equivalence trial.
      The general anesthesia group will receive sevoflurane (intervention drug) for induction and
      maintenance of general anesthesia, dose up to 8% inspired for duration of procedure plus
      bupivacaine local anesthetic blockade (up to 2.5 mg per kg) administered via caudal or
      ilioinguinal nerve block. The airway can be maintained with a face mask, laryngeal mask or
      endotracheal tube, with or without neuromuscular blocking agents.

      The regional group will have no sedative agent. The regional blockade may be with spinal
      alone, spinal block with caudal block, spinal with ilioinguinal block or caudal alone. The
      maximum dose of 2.5 mg per kg of bupivacaine can be used.
