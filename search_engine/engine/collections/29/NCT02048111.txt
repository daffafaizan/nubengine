    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  to evaluate safety of IB1001 within the first 50 exposure days,

        -  to determine IB1001 pharmacokinetics (PK), and

        -  to assess efficacy of IB1001 prophylaxis with respect to breakthrough bleeding and with
           respect to control of hemorrhaging in subjects with severe hemophilia B within the first
           50 exposure days

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  to evaluate long-term safety of IB1001; and

        -  to evaluate long term efficacy of IB1001.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  to evaluate markers of thrombogenicity during the first 24 hours post-infusion
           [thrombogenicity markers will include at a minimum D-dimer test; however should there be
           a clinical reason (e.g., three consecutive elevations in D-dimer levels, a possible
           clinical thrombogenic episode), sufficient samples will be collected to also evaluate
           levels of fragment 1+2 (F1+2) and thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT)]

        -  to evaluate IB1001 immunogenicity response (development of inhibitory and non-inhibitory
           factor IX binding antibodies and antibodies to host cell proteins)
