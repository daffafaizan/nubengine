      integrin and which has shown its efficacy in Crohn's disease by inducing and maintaining
      clinical response/remission. The French marketing authorization was obtained for Crohn's
      disease in patients in failure with anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) agents.

      For Crohn's disease patients treated with vedolizumab, a strong association between
      vedolizumab serum levels and clinical response to induction and maintenance was demonstrated
      by anterior studies.

      It could be of paramount interest to early identify Crohn's Disease patients under
      vedolizumab who will be responders to vedolizumab induction and to identify those who will
      achieve clinical remission under maintenance therapy with vedolizumab.

      Researchers decided to assess the clinical response to vedolizumab induction at week 10, as
      the Gemini III trial has reported, among patients who had experienced previous TNF (Tumor
      Necrosis Factor) antagonist failure. 15% of those given vedolizumab were in remission at week
      6 (P=0.433) versus 12% under placebo. At week 10, 26% under vedolizumab were in remission
      versus 12% in the placebo arm.

      Moreover, at week 10, the proportion of patients presenting a clinical response was
      significantly higher in Crohn's Disease patients treated with vedolizumab (46% vs 24%).

      In this study, for clinically non-responders at week 10, an additional dose of 300 mg of
      vedolizumab will be infused at week 10 and then every four weeks. In a post hoc analysis of
      GEMINI 2, additional dose of vedolizumab in patients clinically non responders to vedolizumab
      obtained a clinical remission in 33% of case.
