      be conducted at The Steadman Clinic and Steadman Philippon Research Institute.

      Articular cartilage defects that extend full thickness to subchondral bone rarely heal
      without intervention. Some patients may not develop clinically significant problems from
      acute full-thickness chondral defects, but many eventually suffer from debilitating
      degenerative changes. Microfracture is the most commonly used first-line treatment technique
      for chondral lesions in the hip, however, this procedure's effectiveness is limited by the
      repair tissue being a hybrid of hyaline and fibrocartilage. We hypothesize that
      administration of a transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î²1) blocker, losartan (an approved
      hypertension drug, angiotensin II receptor antagonist) with microfracture will enhance
      articular cartilage repair as assessed on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging. We will
      also measure patient benefit through the recording of patient reported outcomes in the 18
      months following surgery. The Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products within
      the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration has granted
      an investigational new drug (IND) exemption to pursue this trial in accordance with 21 CFR
      312.2(b).
