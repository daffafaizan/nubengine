      Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2
      (PIMS-TS). A rapid international consensus process identified the need to evaluate
      corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as initial therapies in PIMS-TS, and
      confirmed tocilizumab and anakinra as biological anti-inflammatory agents to be evaluated as
      a second line therapy.

      This Swissped-Recovery trial is a sister trial to the RECOVERY international trial with the
      implementation of the study at Swiss study sites.

      The protocol describes an overarching trial design to provide reliable evidence on the
      efficacy of candidate therapies for children hospitalised with PIMS-TS receiving standard of
      care. It is an adaptive pragmatic platform trial with an open-label randomisation.

      For each pairwise comparison with the 'no additional treatment' arm, the primary objective is
      to provide reliable estimates of the effect of study treatments on the duration of hospital
      stay after randomisation. New trial arms can be added as evidence emerges that other
      candidate therapeutics should be evaluated.
