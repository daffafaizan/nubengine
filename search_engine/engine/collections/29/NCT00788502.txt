      (HT) treatment arm, the Desensitization Therapy (DT) arm, or the no-intervention arm.

      Subjects in Group 1 will receive three, 45-minute HT sessions during the first two weeks of
      their IVF cycle prior to oocyte retrieval. Group 2 will receive three, 45-minute DT sessions
      during the first two weeks of their IVF cycle prior to oocyte retrieval. Group 3 will receive
      no intervention. Subjects in Group 3 will be offered two HT sessions after completing study
      participation.

      All subjects and their partners will be asked to complete the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Infertility Self-Efficacy Scale
      (ISES) at three time points: 1) baseline 2) one day prior to oocyte retrieval and 3) 5-7 days
      post embryo transfer. In addition, subjects in all groups will complete a short pre-study
      questionnaire to assess expectation of therapeutic effect, and subjects in the two
      intervention groups will complete a short post-study questionnaire to evaluate their
      treatment experience. Demographic and pregnancy outcome data will be collected for all
      subjects.
