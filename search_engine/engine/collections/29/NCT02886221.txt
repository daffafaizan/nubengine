      Clinical evaluation was assessed pre-operatively, as well as at 3 and 12 months after surgery
      and at final follow-up of 48 months, using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society
      (AOFAS) Hallux grading system. Patient satisfaction and complications were recorded.Further
      parameters assessed were postoperative pain at rest and during movement by the numerical
      rating scale (NRS), patient satisfaction using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), quality of
      life, and return to daily activities. Incidence of Chronic Pain Syndrome (CPS), Type of
      anesthesia and ASA were evaluated and recorded.

      Computer-assisted measurement of antero-posterior radiographs was taken pre-operatively, as
      well as at 3 and 12 months after surgery and at 48-month follow-up, analysing the
      intermetatarsal angle (IMA), the hallux valgus angle (HVA), the distal metatarsal articular
      angle (DMAA), and the tibial sesamoid position. Also, the bridging bone/callus formation was
      evaluated at the different radiographic follow-ups, while the articular surface congruency
      and the metatarsal index were calculated only preoperatively and at last follow-up.
      Statistical analysis was carried out using the paired t-test. Statistical significance was
      set at p < 0.05.
