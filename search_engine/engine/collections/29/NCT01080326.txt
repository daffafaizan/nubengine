      for more than 70% of deaths associated with peptic ulcer disease. In addition to age and
      concomitant disease, intervention related complications are statistically significant
      predictors of death after hospital stay. Age, time to presentation and comorbidities are not
      factors that can be influenced. If it would be possible to reduce the impact of procedure
      related complications or the "second hit", that may lead to decreased morbidity and
      mortality.

      This will be a pilot clinical study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of endoscopic
      translumenal omental patch closure. Patients with the clinical diagnosis of a perforated
      viscus who are scheduled to undergo surgical exploration will be recruited. Endoscopic
      translumenal omental patch will be attempted first if the patient has no contraindication.
      Should this prove unsuccessful, the surgical team will proceed with conversion to
      laparoscopic or open standard surgical therapy as indicated.
