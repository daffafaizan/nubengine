      heart. It usually results from atherosclerosis, a condition in which deposits of fat,
      cholesterol, and other substances build up along the inner walls of arteries. Risk factors
      for CHD include tobacco use, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Visceral fat, the
      type of fat found in the abdomen and surrounding vital organs, is considered a greater risk
      factor for CHD than subcutaneous fat, the type of fat found directly below the skin.
      Pericardial fat, the fat surrounding the heart, is similar to visceral fat, and may be
      particularly damaging because of its lipotoxicity effects and its ability to trigger
      inflammation in the coronary arteries. Increased amounts of pericardial fat may therefore
      accelerate the development of atherosclerosis and CHD. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the relationship between pericardial fat and the development of CHD.

      This study will use previously collected data from participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
      Atherosclerosis (MESA) study, a study that examined characteristics of the subclinical, or
      the early stages of, cardiovascular disease in individuals. There will be no study visits
      specifically for this study. Participants' study data and computed tomography (CT) scans will
      be analyzed to determine the following: 1) the presence of pericardial fat and subclinical
      CHD at study entry; 2) changes in pericardial fat levels and plaque formation; and 3) the
      presence of pericardial fat and CHD at a 6-year follow-up visit.
