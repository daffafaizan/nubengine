      devastating visual loss in adults and children. This is a retrospective study to identify
      factors and biomarkers that are relevant to the pathogenesis, progression, and treatment
      response in inflammatory eye conditions. The primary objective is to identify ocular imaging,
      clinical and laboratory biomarkers in order to better classify presentations of uveitic
      diseases, assess disease severity and develop outcome measures of response to treatment. The
      secondary objectives are to identify etiological factors for uveitic diseases. The study
