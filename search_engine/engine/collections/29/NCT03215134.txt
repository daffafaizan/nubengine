      treatment within students with high levels of self-criticism. This pilot study aims to adapt
      the intervention for an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service, a primary
      mental-health service in the UK.

      Self-criticism is a transdiagnostic process across common mental-health disorders and is
      therefore, a potential target for psychological intervention. Clients at IAPT are likely to
      present with high levels of self-criticism. This pilot study may help develop an alternative
      evidence-based intervention that can be routinely offered within IAPT services.

      The researchers aim to recruit 20 clients registered at Talking Therapies Southwark,
      experiencing a significant impact of self-criticism on their daily life, and requesting help
      for self-criticism. Clients that provide consent to participate in this study would receive 6
      sessions of this intervention and a 2-month follow-up telephone session.
