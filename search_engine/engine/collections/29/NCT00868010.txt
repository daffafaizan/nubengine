      survivors (currently estimated as 5.5 million Americans) will continue to increase as the
      population ages and as the medical management of acute stroke continues to improve. Given
      stroke's devastating impact on activities of daily living and the large numbers of Americans
      afflicted, improving acute medical rehabilitation outcomes after stroke is of great public
      health importance.

      Predictors of poor functional recovery post-stroke include impairments in cognition and
      motivation. Recent evidence indicates that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may improve
      cognition and motivation; hence, their use post-stroke may lead to improved rehabilitation
      outcomes. Our group has demonstrated that use of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil
      is associated with improved functional recovery in a pilot sample (n = 40) of elderly,
      cognitively impaired stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Specifically, in
      this 12 week open-label study, those subjects receiving donepezil experienced a clinically
      meaningful 14 point greater improvement on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) than an
      archival comparator group.

      Based on these promising pilot study results, we propose a 12-week randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial (followed by a 12 week off-drug observation period) in order to test
      the efficacy of donepezil to promote post-stroke functional recovery in older, cognitively
      impaired stroke survivors undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. We will also use this
      randomized controlled trial to examine the drug's effect on cognition post-stroke;
      specifically, the drug's effect on those cognitive domains (attention/working memory,
      information psychomotor speed, and episodic memory) that are relevant to functional outcomes.
