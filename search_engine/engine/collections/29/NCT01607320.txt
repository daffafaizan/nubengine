      ovary syndrome, used for over 40 years. Despite the vast experience using this drug, the
      pregnancy rates associated with its use are low and recent large studies from Australia
      regarding birth defects suggest that CC may be associated with birth defects. Alternatives to
      CC are limited. Another selective estrogen receptor modulator, Raloxifene (RAL) does not have
      the long half life exhibited by CC, and has recently been shown to be equivalent to CC in
      terms of ability to induce ovulation in PCOS women. In addition, prior studies have
      demonstrated potential benefits on markers of uterine receptivity in a cell line model by
      blocking estrogen activity. Beyond this, there are no studies to examine whether Raloxifene
      is an effective oral agent for the treatment of women desiring pregnancy, but the
      investigators' hypothesis is that Raloxifene will work as well as CC but be better at
      establishment and maintenance of pregnancy than CC
