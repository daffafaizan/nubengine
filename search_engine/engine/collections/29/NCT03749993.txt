      cancer screening. According to European guidelines we will include men > 50 years of age and
      men >45 years of age and a family history of PCA as well as African-Americans >45 years of
      age. In this study, bpMRI will be used for opportunistic prostate cancer screening.

      The indication for prostate biopsy is based solely on the results of bpMRI. In case of
      detection of lesions suspicious for prostate cancer ( PIRADS 3), targeted MRI-TRUS fusion
      biopsy with 3 biopsies per lesion will be performed. In case no lesions suspicious for PCA (
      PIRADS 3) are detected, SB will performed if PSA exceeds 10ng/ml and/or DRE is suspicious for
      PCA.
