      prior to the surgery, combined with postoperative monitoring, will significantly lower the
      incidence of nutritional deficiencies in patients undergoing Sleeve Gastrectomy surgery, and
      will reduce complications arising from these pre-operative deficiencies.

      The investigators plan to examine the effect of Vitamins supplementation prior to surgery on
      the status of postoperative deficiencies one year after the surgery. Evaluation of outcomes
      will be made based on the results of blood tests specified, and related tests of bone
      density.
