      with the routinely used intravenous patient controlled analgesia (PCIA) with morphine in the
      postoperative phase after back surgery. The common use of PCIA with morphine is associated
      with a rather slow onset-time and active metabolites, with occurrence of potential harmful
      side effects as sedation and desaturation.

      This mono-centric project involving American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
      classification I-II patients undergoing elective neurosurgery (laminectomy) are recruited.
      Enrolled patients undergo numeric rating scale (NRS) and side effect questionnaire during the
      first 72h postoperatively.
