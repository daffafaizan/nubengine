      way, i.e. by avoiding taking blood samples. Saliva could potentially be an alternative to
      blood for this purpose. However, literature data on vitamins in saliva is scarce. The
      occurrence is best demonstrated for 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 where already indications for a
      correlation to blood levels have been observed in a small scale supplementation study.
      Occurrence of (forms of) vitamins A and E, B1, B2, B3, B6 and C has been reported but is less
      well documented. Some information is somewhat ambiguous and for none of these latter vitamins
      blood levels have been investigated in parallel to saliva.
