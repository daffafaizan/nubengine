      consent within 14 days post-surgery. Patients were then randomized to 1 of 2 groups: the
      Euthyroid or the Hypothyroid group.

      Once randomized, patients in the Euthyroid group received thyroid hormone suppression therapy
      (THST) for 4 weeks. At the end of the fourth week, the patient's TSH level was measured. If
      the TSH level was < 5 mU/L, Thyrogen (0.9 mg) was administered intramuscularly (IM) once
      daily (qd) for 2 days. Twenty-four hours following the second dose of Thyrogen, an ablative
      activity of 131I (100 mCi; 3.7 GBq) was administered. All patients then underwent
      post-treatment whole-body scanning (WBS) and remnant-neck imaging at 48 hours, at 72 to 96
      hours, and at 96 to 168 hours (preferably 120 hours) following ablation. In addition, the
      study allowed for the option to perform scans at 24 hours and between 144 and 168 hours after
      ablation. Following the final post-treatment scan, patients in the Euthyroid group continued
      THST.

      Patients randomized to the Hypothyroid Group did not receive THST after randomization. These
      individuals were monitored for at least 4 weeks or until their TSH was > 25 mU/L. Patients
      were given an ablative dose of 131I (100 mCi, 3.7 GBq). If the patient's TSH was < 25 mU/L at
      the end of the fourth week, the patient's TSH was measured again 1 week later. Patients then
      underwent post-treatment WBS and remnant-neck imaging at 48 hours, at 72 to 96 hours, and at
      96 to 168 hours (preferably 120 hours) following ablation. In addition, the study allowed for
      the option to perform scans at 24 hours and between 144 and 168 hours post ablation.
      Following the final post-treatment scan, patients in the Hypothyroid group commenced THST.

      Eight (Â± l) months later, patients in both the Euthyroid and Hypothyroid groups received
      Thyrogen (0.9 mg qd for 2 days) followed by an activity of 131I (4 mCi; 0.15 GBq), in
      preparation for 48-hour WBS and remnant-neck imaging.

      Patients with a negative neck scan (i.e. no visible uptake or, if visible uptake, less than
      0.1% uptake in the thyroid bed) 8 (+ 1) months following the 131I treatment were considered
      successfully ablated.
