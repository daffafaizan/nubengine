      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) as a single
      agent in non-small cell lung cancer participants with HIV infection and to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib in combination with antiretroviral therapy in this
      participant population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of erlotinib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer persons with
      HIV infection.

      II. To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between erlotinib and antiretroviral
      therapy in persons with HIV infection, while accounting for nicotine exposure.

      III. To investigate the effects of therapy on participant immune status and HIV viral load.

      IV. To preliminarily evaluate known molecular and phenotypic correlates of improved clinical
      outcomes associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
