    
      Given the limited information on the frequency and spectrum of disease manifestations and
      clinical course of Wilson disease, the UX701-CL001 study aims to assess the utility and
      feasibility of various assessments and biomarkers to inform endpoint selection for future
      clinical studies, better understand the relationship between biomarkers and potential
      clinical outcomes, and characterize the clinical presentation of Wilson disease. UX701-CL001
      is a clinical survey study. Subjects will complete assessments at the study site and at home
      to evaluate the clinical manifestations of Wilson disease in clinical and real-world
      environments.
