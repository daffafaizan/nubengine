           This study will consist of two parts. One is "biodistribution study of haloperidol" in
           12 subjects, and the other is "receptor occupancy study of haloperidol" in 12 subjects.
           In the biodistribution study, 18F-haloperidol (10 mCi) will be injected intravenously
           two times into each of the 12 subjects (cross-over design). Whole body PET will be
           conducted after the first haloperidol injection and local brain PET after the 2nd
           haloperidol injection after the 7 day washout period.
