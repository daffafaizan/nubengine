      prevention. The goals of this developmental study are to develop and evaluate the feasibility
      and acceptability of a primary care-based, preschool obesity prevention intervention
      integrating pediatrician counseling and a home-based program for parents of 2-4 year old
      children at risk for obesity. We propose to recruit 60 parent-child dyads from families of
      2-4 year old at risk children (e.g., BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile for age and
      gender or a BMI between the 50th and 85th percentile and at least one overweight parent) and
      randomize each dyad to one of the following groups: (a) Healthy Eating/Physical Activity
      Intervention including brief pediatrician counseling regarding the child's current BMI%ile
      status, recommendations for home environmental changes to achieve a healthy weight gain
      trajectory, and home safety and injury risk reduction recommendations paired with a 6 month
      home-based program delivered via phone by a health behavior specialist to promote
      implementation of the obesity prevention home environmental strategies, or (b) General
      Health/Safety/Injury Prevention Contact Control Intervention: Families will receive the same
      brief counseling from their pediatrician paired with a 6 month home-based program delivered
      via phone by a health behavior specialist to promote implementation of the general health,
      safety and injury prevention home environmental strategies.

        -  Healthy Eating/Physical Activity Home-based Intervention: The "Busy Bodies/Better Bites"
           intervention arm will include brief pediatrician counseling regarding the child's
           current BMI percentile status, recommendations for home environmental changes to achieve
           a healthy weight gain trajectory, and home safety and injury risk reduction
           environmental recommendations paired with a 6 month home-based program delivered via
           phone by a masters-level health behavior specialist to promote implementation of the
           obesity prevention home environmental strategies.

        -  Safety/Injury Prevention Home-based Contact Control Intervention: The "Healthy Tots/Safe
           Spots" intervention arm will include the same brief counseling from the pediatrician
           paired with a 6 month home-based program delivered via phone by a masters-level health
           behavior specialist to promote implementation of the safety and injury prevention home
           environmental strategies.
