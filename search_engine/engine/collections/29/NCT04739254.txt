    
      To assess the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of a CardioFlux magnetic field
      map study as a potential diagnostic, screening or surveillance tool for high-risk patients
      with endocrine disorders compared to the standard of care.

      All patients presenting to the Genetesis facility (5950 Mason Montgomery Road, Suite 1400,
      Mason, OH 45040) meeting the inclusion criteria for performance of an MCG scan for diagnosis,
      risk assessment or treatment monitoring due to cardiac illness (as determined by the
      Investigators) may participate.

      The outcome measures will be NPV, PPV, sensitivity and specificity for a CardioFlux
      magnetocardiograph against the patient's standard-of-care test results based on the
      indication for the scan (diagnosis, screening or surveillance). Patients will be contacted at
      intervals over a one-year period to obtain follow up data for the patient registry, based on
      consideration of a patient's clinical disposition. The patient may choose whether or not to
      provide follow up data or to participate in another scan.
