      (BP) lowering treatment options in people with diabetes. ACE inhibitors have a long half-life
      and offer the advantage of a single daily dose, usually empirically taken in the morning.

      Objective: We assessed the influence of time of administration of ACE inhibitors on circadian
      BP control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with stage 1 hypertension.

      Methods: Twenty T2D patients (9 being women) with a mean age of 58.7 years, diagnosed with
      stage 1 of hypertension and naive to BP lowering medications, were included. They were
      randomly allocated to receive perindopril 10 mg/day as a monotherapy either in the morning or
      in the evening for 28 days, with crossover without washout period on day 29th and additional
      28 days follow-up. A 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed at baseline, days
      28 and 56.
