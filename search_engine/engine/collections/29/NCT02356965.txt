    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging placebo-controlled
      evaluation of the analgesic efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ketamine sublingual
      wafer in adult subjects who experience post-operative pain after undergoing third molar
      extraction.

      The study will enroll approximately 80 subjects at a single site. Subjects will be at least
      18 years to 38 years of age. Subjects will receive a single dose of 70 mg or 100 mg
      sublingual ketamine wafer or placebo.

      Efficacy assessment will include pain intensity, use of rescue medication, and Patient Global
      Assessment (PGA) of pain control. Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs and SAEs,
      clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, oral assessments, and ECGs.

      A maximum of eight 4ml blood samples will be taken from each participant up to 8 hours after
      study drug administration for plasma analysis.
