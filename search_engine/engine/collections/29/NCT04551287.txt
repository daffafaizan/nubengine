      fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. Remarkable progress has been made in deep
      learning algorithms in recent years, but its clinical application in cervical cancer cytology
      screening still limited. In this study, a Cervical Cancer Artificial Intelligence Screening
      System (CAISS) was trained and validated for cervical cytology grade diagnosis through
      diverse cervical cytological whole slide images (WSIs) from different hospitals.
