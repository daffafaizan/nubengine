      services highlighted the development of distance education for nurses. In addition
      information presented via the distance learning method via software systems was more stable
      than the face-to-face method via lecture, and it saved time and energy. Nurses are
      responsible for BP monitoring and assessment in the clinical setting. Finding new strategies
      for distance education is of great concern and ,compared with traditional face-to-face
      interventions, those carried out through social networks have the advantage that the
      participant does not need to attend the sessions in person, and offers unlimited access to
      the intervention materials whenever they wish.
