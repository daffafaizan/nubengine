    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Develop and combine advanced, quantitative, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging
           methods (i.e., dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI [DCE-MRI], diffusion-weighted MRI [DW-MRI],
           and magnetic resonance spectroscopy [MRS]) to characterize breast tumors in women with
           known or suspected breast cancer.

        -  Identify surrogate biomarkers that can guide diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer
           using these methods.

        -  Correlate biochemical information obtained from magnetic resonance analysis with
           clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings in these patients.

        -  Establish an imaging data bank that includes information on DCE-MRI, DW-MRI, and MRS
           findings in these patients and in healthy participants.

      OUTLINE: Quantitative, multi-parametric magnetic imaging methods will be employed for breast
      imaging for the following subjects:

        -  Group A: Healthy volunteers who undergo up to 3 breast MRIs over 6 weeks.

        -  Group B: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer who will: 1) undergo preoperative breast
           MRI followed by definitive surgery or 2) undergo MRI prior to initiating neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy, at 1-2 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy, and prior to definitive
           surgery.

      Clinical information, including radiologic and pathologic data, on all patients is collected
      for inclusion in the imaging data bank.

      After completion of the study, patients and healthy participants are followed periodically.
