    
      This is a phase I study, with an expansion cohort, of up to 34 patients to identify the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a 3-fraction regimen of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
      for locally-advanced pancreatic cancer patients who have not developed distant progression
      following induction chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) as per
      standard of care. After completion of induction chemotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy
      SBRT will be administered in 3 fractions, every other day, on an outpatient basis. Dose
      escalation will start with dose level 1 (9 Gy x 3 fractions) and increase by 1 Gy per
      fraction at each dose level, dose level 2 will be 10 Gy x 3 fractions and dose level 3 will
      be 11 Gy x 3 fractions.
