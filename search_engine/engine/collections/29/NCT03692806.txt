      metabolic syndrome and therefore will improve cardiometabolic risk factors. The aim of the
      current study is to assess the impact of a 12-week intake of STABLOR, compared to a placebo,
      on visceral fat in patients with metabolic syndrome. The primary objective of the study is to
      assess the efficacy of 12-week STABLOR® consumption on visceral fat mass compared to placebo,
      in persons with metabolic syndrome. The Secondary outcomes include Anthropometric
      measurements and body composition, metabolic syndrome status, STABLOR® metabolism,
      Cardiovascular biomarkers, Systemic inflammation, Quality of life and Behavior.
