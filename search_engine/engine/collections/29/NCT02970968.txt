      the United States. One hundred fifty (150) subjects diagnosed with gastroparesis, who satisfy
      the selection criteria for the study, will be randomized to one of two treatment groups,
      active or placebo.

      The study is divided into two phases: the screening phase and the evaluation phase. The
      screening phase includes a screening visit to evaluate subjects' preliminary eligibility for
      the study. During the screening phase, subjects will collect diary data for at least 4 weeks.
      The evaluation phase includes 4 weeks of randomized double-blind treatment.
