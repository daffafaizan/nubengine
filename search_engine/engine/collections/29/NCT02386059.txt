      pharmaceutical treatment and 1 placebo) in a double-blind manner at the start of the surgery
      and 15 minutes before the end of surgery.

      The syringes were prepared by a third, neutral person not involved in the perioperative care
      of the patient, immediately before the start of anesthesia.

      All vitrectomy surgeries were performed, in each unit,under local anesthesia by a retrobulbar
      block.

      Each patients was observed and treated during a period of 24 hours after the surgery. For
      patients who have nausea and vomiting despite the antiemetic prophylaxis, will be given a
      rescue dose of 4 mg ondansetron IV.
