      only been evaluated using a glucose load of 50 g, and it is uncertain whether patients with
      T2DM are capable of regulating their incretin effect equivalent to healthy subjects.
      Furthermore, it is of great interest to quantify the secretion of GIP and GLP-1 during
      increasing glucose loads in both patients with T2DM and in healthy subjects in order to
      evaluate whether an increased secretion of one or both of the two incretin hormones
      contributes to the regulation of the incretin effect.

      The aim of the present study is to quantify the incretin effect in healthy subjects and in
      patients with T2DM during increasing amounts of oral glucose challenges and corresponding
      isoglycemic iv glucose challenges. The proposed studies will answer important questions on
      the pathophysiology underlying T2DM and be of importance in relation to future preventive-
      and treatment strategies.

      Eight patients with T2DM and 8 matched healthy subjects will be evaluated with oral glucose
      tolerance tests (OGTT) using increasing glucose loads (25, 50 and 100 g glucose) and
      isoglycemic iv glucose tolerance tests imitating the glucose concentrations as obtained
      during the oral glucose loads. The results will describe the regulation of the incretin
      effect in patients with T2DM and, thereby, contribute to the clarification of the
      pathophysiology of the postprandial hyperglycemia characterizing these patients.
