      are high stress environments and are one of the significant drivers of high costs in
      healthcare. The prevalence of anxiety experienced by patients in the emergency department
      (ED) is abundant and substantial. Anxiety negatively affects the patient, the ED healthcare
      environment, and ED healthcare staff. Additionally, anxiety routinely results in the
      administration of medication that would be otherwise unnecessary, and contributes to the
      overall cost of healthcare and the stress of clinicians, particularly nursing staff. The
      University of Florida (UF) Department of Emergency Medicine, in partnership with the UF
      Center for Arts in Medicine, has recently completed phase one, and is proposing phase two, of
      a three-phase study to assess the impact of live preferential music on emergency department
      operations, including pain medication utilization and cost of care. The investigators propose
      to expand on the phase one pilot study to conduct a full randomized controlled study
      utilizing a group of highly talented musicians to provide live preferential music in our ED
      and level one trauma center setting. The project, the first systematic investigation of its
      kind, seeks to demonstrate that live preferential music in an emergency and trauma care
      setting can positively impact quality and cost of care.
