      runners(1) with incidence as high as 39% in marathoners(2). In adventure races it is the most
      commonly reported injury(3) and in expedition length ultramarathons, blisters account for
      nearly 74% of medical visits(4). While most blisters are of minor medical significance, they
      can impair concentration, decrease athletic performance, and can be potentially debilitating.

      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate whether RockTape has similar efficacy to
      Elastikon in the treatment of foot blisters in ultramarathon runners. Elastikon with paper
      tape and spray adhesive is a well-accepted means of blister treatment and has been used by
      medical staff at over 50 multi-stage ultramarathons around the world. RockTape is another
      commercially available product that has also been used by runners successfully to treat foot
      blisters. RockTape's adhesive qualities have a potential advantage over Elastikon, in that it
      does not require an additional adhesive substituting a level of complexity, weight, and cost
      for foot care. There have been no studies examining the efficacy of either agent for blister
      treatment.

      This randomized controlled trial will compare the traditional method of treating blisters
      with a multi-step approach of percutaneous drainage, paper tape, spray adhesive and then
      Elastikon to percutaneous drainage, paper tape and RockTape.
