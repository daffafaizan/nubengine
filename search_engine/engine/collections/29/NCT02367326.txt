      data obtained when monitoring patients on thiopurines. This initial work will enable to
      identify clinical and/or lab factors in order to develop a score based on an international,
      multicenter, cross-section study. Two hundred patients with treatment failure on thiopurines
      will be included and at least as many in clinical remission on thiopurines. A subsequent
      longitudinal study, over all recruiting centers will enable to validate the score. Finally, a
      prospective study will assess the clinical impact of the optimization of this score in
      patients sustaining a treatment failure on thiopurines. This score - if confirmed - will
      subsequently be at no additional cost in the management of patients on thiopurines.
