      designed to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and quality of life of
      sotatercept (ACE-011) for treatment of CIA in participants with advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens. Other objectives included the
      effect of sotatercept treatment on bone metabolism, the evaluation of the expression of
      Activin A and other proteins/biomarkers (including myostatin and follistatin) and the
      assessment of renal function biomarkers. The study consisted of a Screening Period, a
      Treatment Period of approximately 6 months (up to 4 doses of sotatercept at either 15 mg or
      30 mg administered subcutaneously every 42 days) and a Post-treatment Follow-up Period or End
      of Treatment (42 days after the last dose of sotatercept). The study was terminated early due
      to a slower than expected rate of enrollment as a result of substantial changes in the
      standard of care for cancer participants with anemia which resulted in challenges to timely
      accrual and completion of the study. Therefore, 26 participants were randomized into the
      study and the planned Part 2 of the study consisting of a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled Phase 2b/3 study conducted at the optimal dose of sotatercept (ACE-011) in
      up to 750 subjects with metastatic NSCLC was not performed. Due to the small sample size and
      variability of the data, changes were made to modify the study endpoints and revise them to
      be exploratory only.
