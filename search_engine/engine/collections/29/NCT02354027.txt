      single-center study of SHR3824 and metformin in healthy adult volunteers. SHR3824(a

      treatment for patients with T2DM. SHR3824 will be administered orally (by mouth) as 25 mg on
      Days 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and metformin will be administered orally as two 500mg tablets on Days
      1 and 8. Both SHR3824 and metformin tablets will be taken with 8 ounces (240 mL) of water.
