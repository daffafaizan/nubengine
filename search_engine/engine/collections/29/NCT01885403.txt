    
      The study is designed as a single-center, open, interventional, observational study according
      to clause ยง23b of the German Medical Device Act (MPG). The study will recruit 50 patients
      suffering from cardiogenic pulmonary congestion and edema including ambulant patients and
      patients of intensive care.

      We will investigate whether respiratory parameters during re-compensation are related to the
      therapy effects and changes in pulmonary congestion status. This study will collect data in
      an observational and clinical setting in the re-compensation phase of ADHF.

      Correlation between measured lung and respiratory parameters and standard clinical parameters
      characterizing stages of re-compensation will be undertaken. Standard clinical parameters may
      include diuretics and other cardiac medication dose frequency, weight, heart rate,
      respiratory rate, chest x-rays (when routinely performed), symptoms such as shortness of
      breath or fatigue, biomarkers such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), stroke volume, cardiac
      output, and oxygen requirements.
