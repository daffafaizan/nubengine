      pressure (IOP) in relation to the initial number of antiglaucoma drops at the end of 12
      months observation period. The subject must suffer from glaucoma and cataract at the same
      time, and qualify for a cataract surgery. The group will be composed of 40 patients of the
      Ophthalmology Clinic of the Medical University of Bia≈Çystok qualified for planned cataract
      removal surgery. They will be surgically implanted an I-stent by-pass during
      phacoemulsification.
