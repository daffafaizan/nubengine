    
      Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy have been reported in epilepsy patients. A causal
      relationship with the administration of antiepileptic drugs has not been established. The
      most important known risk factor for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the
      occurrence and frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Twenty-seven patients
      with only GTCS were enrolled in the conversion to monotherapy study. In this study, two
      patients with only GTCS had SUDEP. Due to the potential increased risk of SUDEP in patients
      with only GTCS in a trial setting, the 1 remaining patient with only GTCS was withdrawn from
      this study.
