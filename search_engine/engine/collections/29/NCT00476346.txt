      injuries seen in military recruits, and they are also problematic for non-military athletic
      populations. The goal of this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to
      determine if a calcium and vitamin D intervention could reduce the incidence of SFx in female
      recruits during basic training.

      Methods: We recruited 5201 female Navy recruit volunteers and randomized them to a 2000 mg
      calcium and 800 IU vitamin D supplement/day or placebo. SFx were ascertained when recruits
      reported to the Great Lakes clinic with symptoms. All SFx were confirmed with radiography or
      technetium scan according to the usual Navy protocol.

      Results: A total of 309 subjects were diagnosed with a SFx resulting in an incidence of 5.9%
      per eight weeks. Using "intention-to-treat" analysis by including all enrolled subjects,
      Fisher's Exact test found that the calcium and vitamin D group had a 25% lower incidence of
      SFx than the control group (6.6% vs 5.3%, respectively, p=0.03). The per protocol analysis,
      including only the 3700 recruits who completed the study, found a 27% lower incidence of
      fractures in the supplemented vs the control group (8.6% vs 6.8%, respectively, p=0.02).

      Conclusions: Generalizing the findings to the population of 14,416 females who entered basic
      training at the Great Lakes during the 24 months of recruitment, calcium and vitamin D
      supplementation for the entire cohort would have prevented about 130 persons per year from
      fracturing. Such a decrease in SFx would be associated with a significant decrease in
      morbidity and financial costs.
