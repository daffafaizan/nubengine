    
      The purpose of the Registry to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Venablock©Vein Sealing
      System for Varicose Veins in Singapore (RIVERIA), is to investigate the performance of
      cyanoacrylate glue closure (CAC) using this device, in which multiple incompetent superficial
      saphenous truncal veins (great saphenous (GSV), short saphenous vein (SSV), anterior
      accessory saphenous vein (AASV) will be treated at the same setting, and compression
      stockings will not be used post-operatively. The inclusion criteria for this study will be
      liberalized, and veins up to 12mm in diameter will be treated. As such,RIVIERA will be the
      first prospective trial conducted in Asia on a predominantly Asian cohort of patients to
      report on the performance of Venablock© for blocking incompetent truncal veins. This study
      specifically focuses on the initial technical outcomes, safety, anatomical occlusion, and
      patient experience after treatment with Venablock© with broader inclusion of patients than
      previous caucasian based trials.
