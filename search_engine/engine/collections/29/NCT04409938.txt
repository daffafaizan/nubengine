      nursing students' BPM skills, and anxiety levels and vital signs.

      Methods: This was a randomized controlled experimental study conducted at the nursing
      department of the faculty of health sciences of a university. PMR participants rested for ten
      minutes between the sessions and then practiced PMR for 15 minutes. PMR consisted of taking a
      deep breath five times and then clenching fists, raising the shoulders, bringing the forearms
      towards the body, stretching the triceps muscle, and tensing and relaxing the forehead, eye,
      chin, neck, chest, abdomen, back, hips, thigh, and feet muscles. The investigators made a
      video of exercises in a certain order and uploaded it to the television in the lab prior to
      the intervention. The investigators turned on the video during the intervention and asked the
      participants to follow the instructions for PMR exercises. PMR+NS participants practiced PMR
      accompanied by nature sounds.
