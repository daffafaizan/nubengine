      function of the rectum and its sphincters. It is intended to measure the resting pressure in
      the anal canal, as well as pressure during voluntary contraction of the external anorectal
      sphincter and pelvic floor muscles and to evaluate reactions to the functional tests.

      Several studies have been performed to evaluate normative metrics of anorectal manometry to
      the moment, but most of them enrolled patients living in the US and countries of the Western
      Europe. Nutritional patterns, ethnic composition of the population and other factors may
      cause the differences in the mormative values of HRAM in different populations. Current study
      is organized to evaluate normative metrics of HRAM in a Russian healthy cohort.
