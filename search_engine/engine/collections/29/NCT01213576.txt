      infection who would be randomized to receive standard annual treatment (albendazole 400 mg +
      ivermectin 200 mcg/kg), annual treatment with an increased dose of albendazole (albendazole
      800 mg + ivermectin 200400 mcg/kg) or semi-annual treatment with a standard (albendazole 400
      mg + ivermectin 200 mcg/kg), or an increased albendazole dose (albendazole 800 mg +
      ivermectin 200 400 mcg/kg). Microfilarial levels, as well as measures of adult worm burden
      (circulating antigen) will be followed every six months for two years to determine whether
      the higher doses, or more frequent regimens are more effective.

      The data obtained would be used, in combination with the data from other similar studies
      being conducted in Mali and in India to advise the Global Programme for the Elimination of
      Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) on improved methods of treatment both for mass treatment and for
      the management of problem areas within the global programme.
