    
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of playing Recollect versus Tetris for 20
      minutes per day, 5 days per week over a 4 week period, on executive functioning deficits in
      individuals who have Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).Consenting
      participants will be screened using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for
      DSM-5 (MINI) to confirm ADHD diagnosis. Participants will be asked to download either
      Recollect or Tetris on their own mobile device. Following a training/orientation session,
      they will be asked to spend 20 minutes per day at least 5 days per week playing Recollect or
      Tetris over a 4 week period. At Week 4, study staff will check the time log on the
      Recollect/Tetris App to confirm how much time was spent playing the game. Participants will
      be asked to complete two ADHD symptom severity scales, as well as App-based neurocognitive
      testing at baseline (Week 0) and endpoint (Week 4).
