    
      Stroke survivors with varying levels of motor deficit impairment in their upper extremity
      (UE) will be assessed using standardized clinical scales for cognition and motor impairment.
      Following assessment, the patient and therapist will complete a therapy session consisting of
      activities of daily living (ADL).

      During the therapy session, visual 3D motion tracking will be used via Kinect, audio will be
      recorded, and basic measurements (i.e. the distance between a participants wrist and elbow)
      will be taken. After the patient-therapist interaction has been mapped, members of the
      research team will build computer based models of the therapist and patient using the
      insights gained from the human-human interaction. The models developed in this proposed study
      will be used as a template for programming safe and intuitive humanoid-patient interactions
      for future study. The model of the therapist will be implemented on the Robot (w/o a patient
      involved) and in a simulation environment where it will be tested with a computer-based model
      of the patient.
