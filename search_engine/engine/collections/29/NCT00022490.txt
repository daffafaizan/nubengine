        -  Determine the rate and duration of complete or major and minor cytogenetic responses
           after 6 and 12 months of treatment in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous
           leukemia treated with imatinib mesylate and cytarabine.

        -  Determine the rate and duration of complete hematologic responses after 6 and 12 months
           of treatment in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the rate of molecular response in patients with a complete cytogenetic
           response after 6 and 12 months of treatment with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate on days 1-28 and cytarabine subcutaneously on days
      15-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 30-60 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
