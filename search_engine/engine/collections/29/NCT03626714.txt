    
      This is a first-in-human study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      sustained-release (SR) tacrolimus, which will be administered as a single dose of 0.1 mg/kg
      by subcutaneous (SC) injection in healthy subjects.

      The short-term general investigational plan is to evaluate sustained release tacrolimus in
      healthy volunteers for up to 30 days in an exploratory trial to determine safety and drug
      concentrations in blood. The results from this study will inform the long-term goal of this
      program, which is to provide an improved treatment modality for prophylaxis of organ (kidney,
      liver and heart) transplant rejection with the additional benefit of enhancing medication
      compliance. These improvements have the potential to mitigate both the personal and economic
      burden of this disease.
