      intravenous (IV) infusion of ULSC in a total of 20 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS that
      will include patients that are not intubated and not on a ventilator (NV) and patients that
      are intubated and on a ventilator (V) for respiratory support. Separate cohorts of each group
      (NV and V) will receive either a single dose (one infusion) or repeat dose (two infusions
      separated by 48-hour interval).

      The Phase 2a randomized and placebo-controlled trial in this study will investigate the
      potential efficacy of IV infusion of ULSC in a total of 40 patients with COVID-19-related
      ARDS that will all be EITHER NV or V; the determination of that eligibility criterion and the
      ULSC dosing regimen will be based on Phase 1 data of safety and tolerability. Phase 2a will
      evaluate EITHER single dose (one infusion) or repeat dose (two infusions separated by 48-hour
      interval). The randomization will be 3:1 with 30 patients receiving investigational product
      (ULSC) and 10 patients receiving placebo (carrier control).
