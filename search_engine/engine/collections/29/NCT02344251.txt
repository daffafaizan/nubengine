    
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the acceptability, tolerability,
      and efficacy of the ID-Cap system in a healthy population. The ID-Cap is an ingestible
      medical device for detecting the presence of an ingested capsule inside the gastrointestinal
      (GI) tract.

      Participation in the study takes 3 visits over a period of approximately six weeks. The first
      visit is a screening visit to determine if participants are eligible to participate. After
      the initial assessment visit, participants will be randomized to one of two groups. Group 1
      will have adherence measured by self-report, pill count, and urine riboflavin levels. This
      group will not receive capsules containing ingestible sensors, but will receive their
      medication in a bottle capped with a MEMS Track Cap, which records when the medication bottle
      is opened and closed. Group 2 will receive capsules containing an ingestible sensor and will
      have adherence measured by self-report, pill count, urine riboflavin levels as needed, and
      data collected by an ID-Cap reader. Participants randomized to this group will also receive
      reminder calls and/or text messages to ingest the study medication if a signal is not sent
      from the ID-Cap reader to the study team within one hour of the scheduled medication
      administration time. They will also be using biometric identification technology to confirm
      subject identity, specifically electrocardiogram (ECG).

      After the initial screening visit, participants will be required to attend two clinic visits
      during the six-week study, a randomization visit and a one-week follow-up visit approximately
      one week after last medication dose.
