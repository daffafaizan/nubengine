    
      Patients will be recruited at the Geriatric Day Hospital.

      These patients came to a geriatric day hospital for examination without restriction on the
      reason for the hospitalization.

      They are referred by their general practitionner or referred by a specialist physician, live
      at home or in an institution and are representative of the geriatric population addressed by
      the MMSEa.

        -  The main objective of the study is to analyze the psychometric properties of the
           "antillanis√©e" version of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSEa).

        -  The ancillary objective of this study will be to carry out the psychometric validation
           of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) in people aged 65 years or older.

      It is an instrument for measuring the physical performance of subjects whose transcultural
      adaptation and psychometric validation have already been performed in subjects aged 65 to 74
      years.

      SPPB is used routinely in our routine practice in a day hospital, with no psychometric
      validation performed on this population. This ancillary objective will not modify the course
      of the MMSEa validation study since the SPPB is part of the evaluation tools.
