           were selected as study subjects to investigate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of
           ICG near-infrared imaging tracing in guiding laparoscopic D2 lymph node dissection for
           gastric cancer by comparing injection ICG group and non-injection ICG group

        2. Research design prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-control, Parallel
           assignment, superiority test 2.1 multicenter This study came from Fujian Medical
           university union hospital, Beijing University Cancer Hospital, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan

           2.2 Case group Group A (Study Group): Laparoscopic gastrectomy Group with the use of
           near-infrared imaging (ICG group) Group B (Control Group): Laparoscopic gastrectomy
           Group without the use of near-infrared imaging (Non-ICG group) 2.3 Estimate Sample Size
           3 years disease-free survival (DFS) is the main effectiveness evaluation index in this
           study. The study is superiority test, assuming that the team's three years DFS is better
           than that of control group,23, according to previous research results of laparoscopic
           local advanced gastric cancer surgery ,three years DFS is 65.2%, the control group 3
           years DFS is 65.2%, assuming that the experimental group 3 years DFS can be increased by
           9%, that is 74.2%, inspection level 0.025 (unilateral), take 0.9 inspection efficiency,
           using PASS 11 Logrank tests (Lakatos)[Proportion surviving] Calculated: Sample size
           N=428, that is, each group needed 428 people to consider possible exclusion and loss of
           follow-up cases (20% drop rate). The final sample size for each group was 535 cases, and
           a total of 1070 cases were initially assigned to 66-67 cases in each center 2.4
           randomization Stay into the group of cases after laparoscopic exploration, make sure
           comply with the standards, can be randomized groups in this study we adopt the central
           dynamic layered segment randomized method, considering the control factors are age,
           gender tumor site preoperative staging research center of the given seed number and
           segment length, application of SAS9.2 programming to produce serial number is 0001 ~
           1070 by corresponding treatment allocation, reserved in the data center and research
           center has the specialist is responsible for the cases of group information (age, gender
           tumor site preoperative staging research center) via email A telephone call or text
           message will be sent to the randomization implementation department of the data center,
           and the central randomization department will analyze the case information to determine
           the case enrollment and inform the research center where the case is located 2.5
           Blinding Method: This research adopts an open design. 2.6 Research cycle: Estimated
           enrollment cycle: complete enrollment within 2 years. Follow-up period: the enrollment
           of the first case and the postoperative pathological report (generally 2 weeks after
           surgery) was the end point of follow-up for secondary study purposes other than 3-year
           overall survival rate and 3-year recurrence type Estimated time: 2020.10（to complete
           enrollment）-2022.09（to complete follow-up）

        3. Study Objects All patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not conform to the
           exclusion criteria are qualified for this study.
