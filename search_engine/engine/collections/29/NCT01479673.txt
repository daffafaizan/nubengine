    
      Study objectives

      To evaluate the effect of tight caloric control in critical patients on:

        -  The rate of acquired nosocomial infections (Ventilated associated pneumonia, Catheter
           related infections, Urinary tract infections)

        -  Mortality rates, length of stay in the ICU and in hospital, length of ventilation and
           incidence of non-infectious complications.

      Primary endpoint:

      Rate of nosocomial infections (for definitions see appendage 1) acquired after 48 to 72 hours
      following admission.

      Secondary endpoints

        -  Metabolic control: glucose concentration, insulin administration, rate of hypoglycemic
           events.

        -  Success of tight caloric control: accumulative and maximum negative energy balance.

        -  Organ function: SOFA score.

        -  Rate of non-infectious complications: requirement for surgery or occurrence of pressure
           sores.

        -  Length of ICU stay and of assisted ventilation (LOS and LOV)

        -  ICU survival rate.

        -  Patient status and disposition on day 28 or at hospital discharge.

        -  3 & 6 months survival.
