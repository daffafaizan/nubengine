    
      In patients with unresectable recurrent gastric cancer who progressed (intolerance or PD)
      after standard treatment (primary and secondary chemotherapy) and have more than one lesion
      assessable in diagnostic imaging (one lesion must be >=2cm), localized short-term
      radiotherapy of 22.5 Gy/5 fractions/5 days will be applied to a symptomatic lesion or the
      largest asymptomatic lesion suitable for irradiation (Day 1-5). Nivolumab will be
      administered starting from Day 15-22 at a dose of 3 mg/kg (body wait) every 2 weeks to a
      total of 6 courses (end of intervention).

      The patients will be observed up to Day 180±14 and evaluated on Day 180±14 (end of study).
