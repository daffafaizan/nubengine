      medicine, has become more common for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and and
      other acute or chronic conditions. Cytochromes P450 enzymes are a group of proteins involved
      in metabolism of certain substances. A group of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes are
      extensively involved in drug metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of many drugs often vary
      considerably among individuals, largely because of variations in the expression of different
      cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes in the liver and other tissues. Flavonoids are antioxidants
      that may have health benefits. The flavonoids may also be responsible for cranberry's effects
      on urinary tract infections.

      To evaluate the drug interaction potential of cranberry, single doses of the three safe probe
      drugs alprazolam, dextromethorphan, and caffeine will be administered before and after a
      14-day treatment period with cranberry powder. Changes in the pharmacokinetics of these probe
      drugs will indicate the degree of enzyme inhibition or induction. The key pharmacokinetic
      parameters for four major CB flavonoids will be estimated by following the plasma
      concentration versus time course of absorbed flavonoids and their excretion in urine. The
      area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), oral clearance (Clo), terminal
      elimination half-life (T1/2) and renal clearance (Clren) will be determined for: epicatechin,
      quercetin (total glycosides), procyanidin A2, and cyanidin-3-galactoside.
