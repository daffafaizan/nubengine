      mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated GFR 15-60 ml/min), will be enrolled. After
      informed consent, qualified subjects will be randomized into 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio:
      lanthanum carbonate, calcium acetate, and dietary modification. The maximum length of
      treatment is 12 months. Dose of intervention will be adjusted based on changes in biochemical
      parameters. Primary end points are changes in serum phosphorus, urine phosphorus, serum
      parathyroid hormone, coronary artery calcification, aortic pulse velocity and flow mediated
      vasodilation.
