      with STA-9090 in patients with metastatic pancreas cancer who have failed (either progressed
      or did not tolerate) one or two lines of prior therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine
      response rate (by RECIST criteria v1.1). II. To determine overall survival. III. To evaluate
      the safety and toxicity profile in this patient population. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. We will
      obtain from all patients blood samples pre and post therapy (after 1 week of therapy) and
      isolate serum for interrogation for a variety of biomarkers (eg AKT, Stat3, Caspase 3).
      OUTLINE: Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor STA-9090 intravenous (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8,
      and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks.
