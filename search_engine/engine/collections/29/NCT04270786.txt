      treatment of empyrical antibiotics treatment in neutropenic fever patients undergoing
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). All patients undergoing HSCT will receive
      levofloxacin as regular prophylaxis. After patients develop neutropenia fever, the empirical
      antibiotics protocol will be impenem. In case of persistent for 48 hours, vancomycin will be
      added. If afebrile is achieved for 72 hours, all patients will randomized into early
      de-escalating group or control group. In de-escalating group, the empirical antibiotics
      treatment will be stopped and then levofloxacin prophylaxis will be resumed. In the control
      group, the empirical antibiotics treatment will be continue until recovery of neutropenia or
      at least 7 days.
