    
      Training protocol used is based on recommendations (Nici et al., 2006) and was previously
      used in our group (Varray et al., 1991; Vallet et al., 1997). A minimum of 20 sessions in 4-6
      weeks were proposed. The exercise intensity of exercise corresponds to target heart rate at
      ventilatory threshold measured during incremental exercise test. Training at this intensity
      allowed us to individualize effort for each patient.
