      specific outcome after renal transplantation, assuming that ethnic groups require different
      immunosuppressant regimens. Trough levels in transplant recipients determine the dosing
      requirements for Tacrolimus and Cyclosproine. It has been recently found, however, that
      testing cyclosporine levels in the blood 2 hours after taking cyclosporine is more effective
      in dosing cyclosprine for renal transplant patients than trough levels. The specific study
      aims include comparing the cyclosporine monitoring in patients with trough and C2 levels, and
      adjusting immunosuppression based on C2 levels.
