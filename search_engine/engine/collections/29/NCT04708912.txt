      COVID-19 patients and with other study groups (i.e. convalescent and healthy controls).
      Nasopharunx microbiota dysbiosis, in vitro cytokines production profile, and peripheral blood
      flocytometric results of the four study groups will be compared.

      In vitro cytokines production will be studied and compared in Nill (No antigens) and Mitojen
      (Cocktail of antigens) pre-prepared test tubes.
