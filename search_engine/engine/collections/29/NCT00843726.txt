    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare the incidence of toxicity with two established stereotactic body radiotherapy
           (SBRT) regimens in patients with node-negative, peripheral stage I or II non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare quality of life, patterns of failure, disease-free survival, and overall
           survival of these patients after treatment with one of two established SBRT regimens.

        -  To correlate outcomes and toxicities with imaging and patient and tumor biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to Karnofsky performance status and treatment
      center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo 1 high-dose fraction of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo 3 high-dose fractions (approximately 1 week apart) of SBRT.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and -LC13 questionnaires

      Blood and tissue samples may be collected periodically and examined for biomarkers via ELISA
      and immunoblotting.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 5 years.
