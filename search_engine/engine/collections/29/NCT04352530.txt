      to test the effects of different types of message features and appeals. The study was
      conducted online with Mexican American women aged 18-29 years old. Messages focused on sugary
      beverage consumption and the main outcomes were acceptance and receptivity to the message
      (i.e., perceived effectiveness), perceptions of social norms, and knowledge. The
      investigators also measured a number of hypothesized mediators and moderators of the effects.
