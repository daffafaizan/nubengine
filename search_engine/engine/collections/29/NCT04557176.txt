      cost-effectiveness of POC CRP-based TB screening, which is the next step required for
      successful scale-up of both systematic TB screening and TPT. The study's central hypothesis
      is that compared to symptom-based TB screening, a TB screening strategy based on CRP levels
      measured at the point-of-care will improve TPT uptake, thereby reducing TB incidence and its
      associated mortality among PLHIV.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct an individual randomized control
      trial enrolling PLHIV presenting to clinics in Uganda for routine antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) initiation. Eligible participants will be randomized to either POC CRP-based TB
      screening (intervention arm) or symptom-based TB screening (control arm). In both arms,
      screen-positive participants will undergo confirmatory TB testing; participants found to have
      prevalent TB will be initiated on standard TB treatment. In both arms, screen-negative
      participants will be assessed for TPT eligibility; TPT-eligible participants will be
      initiated on standard TPT. All participants will be followed for 2 years.
