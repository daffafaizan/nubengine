      skills training program designed for older people with serious mental illness (SMI), the
      Helping Older People Experience Success (HOPES) program, to help nursing home residents with
      SMI gain the skills needed to successfully live in the community. Although HOPES was
      originally designed to help older people with SMI maintain their residence in the community,
      the curriculum holds promise for helping nursing home residents with SMI to learn how to
      return to life in the community. Positive findings would be used to develop a grant
      application for a larger study of HOPES in nursing home residents with SMI. To evaluate the
      feasibility and acceptability of HOPES in nursing home settings, the investigators will
      enroll up to 12 residents of the Glencliff Home in Glencliff, New Hampshire. Participants
      will be individuals interested in discharge from Glencliff and are willing to attend multiple
      weekly skills training classes and several assessment sessions. Study participation will last
      until 6 months after discharge from Glencliff.
