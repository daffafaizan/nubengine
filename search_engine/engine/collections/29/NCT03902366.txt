    
      Aim 1 will evaluate the impact of DAA therapy on CNS function in Veterans with HCV and will
      test the hypotheses that following DAA therapy and obtaining a sustained viral response [SVR;
      i.e., when the virus continues to be undetectable in blood 12 weeks (or more) after
      completing therapy], participants will show: i) improved neuropsychiatric outcomes (e.g.,
      cognitive function, fatigue, mood), as compared to baseline (pre-DAA therapy), ii) restored
      functional connectivity and disintegrity within white matter tracks that had been observed at
      baseline, and iii) reduced immune activation profiles (e.g., decreased expression of
      inflammatory biomarkers and restored T cell balance), as compared to baseline. Aim 2 will
      determine the impact of an active AUD on the neuropsychiatric, neuroimaging, and
      immunological outcomes observed in aim 1. Participants will be evaluated at two time points
      [i.e., baseline and 12 weeks post-therapy (week 24)]. Evaluations will incorporate brain
      imaging methods [i.e., resting state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and
      diffusion tensor imaging] along with clinical and laboratory methods to assess the
      interactive effects of alcohol use and HCV on brain function. Clinical and laboratory data
      will include: i) demographic and medical information, ii) neuropsychological measures of
      attention, memory, and executive function, iii) neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires
      (e.g., depression and anxiety), iv) urine and oral fluid collection for medical laboratory
      tests, and v) blood sample collection for planned experiments (e.g., flow cytometry, qPCR,
      and multiplex immunoassays) and for contribution to the VA Liver Disease Repository.

      Evidence-based guidelines for the new DAA therapies are needed (e.g., How much alcohol is too
      much?). The VA is at the forefront of treating HCV and is now offering DAA therapy to all
      Veterans with HCV treated within VA health care systems. The proposed studies will address a
      critical gap in our knowledge concerning the effects of co-morbid HCV and AUD on antiviral
      therapy outcomes, particularly CNS function and neuropsychiatric symptoms that contribute to
      addiction and relapse.
