    
      Current effective dressings for burn wounds contain silver (nanoparticulate or ionic),
      hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, sulfa agents, chlorhexidine, iodine or other dilute
      antiseptics meant to provide some measure of antimicrobial protection. However, all of these
      materials have some proven limitations in facilitating wound healing and also have notable
      local and systemic adverse effects. None of the current clinical treatments enhance healing
      and/or reduce scar formation. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and
      effectiveness of SynePure™ Wound Cleanser when used in combination with Catasyn™ Advanced
      Technology Hydrogel for the treatment of superficial partial-thickness burn wounds.
