        -  Introduction to the study

        -  Inclusion in study

        -  Baseline information is obtained

        -  Instruct subject to pre-strip of abdominal skin

      Test visits 1-25 (up to maximum 25 visits per subject. (1-3 days after pre-stripping the
      abdominal skin):

        -  Baseline measurements are conducted on both sides of the stomach (TEWL, hydration,
           erythema, pH - 3 repeated measurements under each adhesive strip area (upper, middle and
           bottom of adhesive strip)

        -  Potential wetting of skin - shower/bicycle exercise (max 60 minutes) and after-wetting
           baseline measurements are conducted (TEWL, hydration, erythema, pH - 3 times/strips
           (upper, middle and bottom of adhesive strip))

        -  Adhesive strips are weighted and applied

        -  Potential shower/bicycle exercise (max 60 minutes)

        -  Adhesive strips are removed at pre-defined timeslots (peel force measured)

        -  Discomfort when strip was peeled of is evaluated by subject (VAS)

        -  Measurements are conducted (TEWL, hydration, erythema, pH - 3 times/strips (upper,
           middle and bottom of adhesive strip))

        -  Acclimatization Â½

        -  Measurements are conducted (TEWL, hydration, erythema, pH - 3 times/strips (upper,
           middle and bottom of adhesive strip))

        -  Adhesive strips are weighed

        -  Photo of adhesive strips

      The subjects can be asked to apply and change strips every 24 hours between two test visits
      but for a maximum of 10 days between two visits. The strips should be applied at the same
      place every time.
