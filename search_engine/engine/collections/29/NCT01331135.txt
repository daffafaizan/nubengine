      allograft rejection following solid organ transplant. It has anti-tumor effects mainly by
      blocking signals which drive cells from G1 to S phase during cell cycle through inhibition of
      mTOR, thus inhibiting cell growth. Sirolimus, as well as other mTOR inhibitors, has shown
      anti-tumor activity in pediatric solid tumor xenografts. Children with relapsed and/or
      refractory solid tumors are in need of novel therapeutic approaches. One option for these
      patients is the use of prolonged exposure to low dose antiangiogenic chemotherapy, with
      agents such as etoposide and cyclophosphamide. In this phase I trial the feasibility and
      optimal dosing for daily sirolimus, in combination with daily celecoxib, and low dose
      etoposide alternating with cyclophosphamide, will be determined in children with relapsed and
      refractory solid tumors. p70S6 kinase inhibition will be used as a surrogate for mTOR
      inhibition. The potential immunosuppressive effect of sirolimus administered on this schedule
      will be assessed by serial lymphocyte subsets and assessment of memory T cell number.
