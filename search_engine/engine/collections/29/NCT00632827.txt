      initial disease control and are able to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in
      first complete or partial remission. It administers intensive and novel induction therapy.

      Two cycles of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, Doxil (GND) will be used followed by two cycles of
      augmented dose Cyclophosphamide (CHOP) plus high-dose methotrexate (MTX). Patients will be
      restaged after two cycles of GND to assess response to GND alone and again after the second
      cycle of augmented CHOP/high-dose MTX.

      Those achieving a remission status will receive intensive consolidation with HiDAC/etoposide
      followed by stem cell mobilization. A five-day course of denileukin diftitox (Ontak) will be
      administered at and will serve as an in vivo purge. This will be followed by autologous stem
      cell transplant.

      Those not achieving partial remission or better following the four induction courses will
      receive 2 cycles of denileukin diftitox(Ontak) for 5 days. Those achieving partial remission
      or better to this regimen will go on to consolidation/mobilization and autologous stem cell
      transplant.

      Post-transplant, denileukin diftitox will also be used as an additional module of therapy.
