      I. To compare overall survival in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients in minimal residual
      disease (MRD)-negative first remission who undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (auto-HCT) followed by maintenance rituximab versus (vs.) maintenance
      rituximab alone (without auto-HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare progression-free survival in MCL patients in MRD-negative first remission who
      undergo auto-HCT followed by maintenance rituximab vs. maintenance rituximab alone.

      II. To define the overall survival and progression-free survival at 2 and 5 years of
      chemosensitive but MRD-positive (or MRD-indeterminate) patients who undergo auto-HCT followed
      by 2 years of maintenance rituximab.

      III. To describe the rate of complications (serious infection, hospitalization, need for
      intravenous immune globulin) in MCL patients undergoing maintenance rituximab following
      auto-HCT.

      IV. To determine the prognostic impact of MRD status at day 100, in MCL patients who were
      MRD-positive prior to auto-HCT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive standard of care preparative chemotherapy and undergo auto-HCT.
      Beginning 60-120 days after transplant, patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) once
      every 8 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care induction chemotherapy. Beginning 40-120 days
      after completion of chemotherapy, patients receive rituximab as in Group I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 and 6 months for 10
      years.
