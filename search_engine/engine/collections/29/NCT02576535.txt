      harboring an AVM to determine the feasibility of treating the lesion with gamma knife
      radiosurgery. Patient with lesions greater than 10 cc will be studied.

      Each patient will have a Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with gadolinium and an
      angiogram immediately before each radiation treatment. If there is a contraindication for MRI
      examination (pacemaker or any other implanted ferromagnetic material), a CT angiogram will be
      obtained instead. Each treatment will be spaced at least 3 months apart. Follow-up MRIs or CT
      scans will be obtained at 6 month intervals. A follow-up angiogram will be obtained when
      there is radiographic evidence of complete occlusion based on the MRI images, or at 3 years
      after the procedure, whichever occurs first.
