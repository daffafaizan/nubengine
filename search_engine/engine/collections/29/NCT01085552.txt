      differences in response to drugs in various ethnic populations. This study will investigate
      the pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic response in healthy Caucasian and Japanese
      male subjects after a single subcutaneous administration of 50IU/kg Epoetin beta

      This is a Phase I single centre, open label trial to investigate the bioequivalence of a
      single subcutaneous dose of Epoetin beta (NeoRecormonÂ®) in healthy Japanese and Caucasian
      Male subjects.

      The primary objectives are 1) to establish the pharmacokinetic parameters of Epoetin beta in
      healthy Japanese and Caucasian males, and 2) to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters AUCinf
      and Cmax in healthy Japanese and Caucasian males. The secondary objective is to establish the
      pharmacodynamic parameters of a single dose of Epoetin beta in healthy Japanese and Caucasian
      males.

      Subjects will receive a single subcutaneous administration of 50IU/kg on one occasion only.
      The planned study duration is approximately 1 month.
