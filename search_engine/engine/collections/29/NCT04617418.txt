    
      Rationale:

      The unpredictability of seizures and the unclear behavioral outcomes are major concerns for
      people with epilepsy and may surface as increased anxiety about independence. This
      unpredictability is also a true obstacle in capturing and studying seizure-related
      neurobehavioral alterations themselves. Also, seizures often impact consciousness and thus
      may go unnoticed. As a result, subjective seizure diaries are unreliable. Continuous
      smartphone-based monitoring of behavioral output is a fast-emerging topic and proven fruitful
      in monitoring other neurological disease states. In the field of epilepsy, these tools are
      yet to be introduced.

      Objective:

      The investigators hypothesize that quantifying smartphone behavior will help obtain a
      detailed and objective behavioral map of seizures that can complement existing subjective
      seizure diaries and thereby improve the way epilepsy treatments are evaluated in daily
      practice.

      Study design:

      A multicentre observational prospective cohort study with at least 3 months follow-up.

      Study population:

      100 subjects with refractory focal epilepsy with a seizure frequency of at least one per
      month.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Change in touchscreen interactions (tapping speed, texting speed, apps used, location,
      sleep-wake cycles) surrounding reported epileptic seizures.
