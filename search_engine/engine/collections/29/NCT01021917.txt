      enroll in these programs without the additional encouragement to be a participant in a
      research study. The study will employ an observational prospective design intended to
      introduce as little interference as possible with subjects' behaviors. This is in order to
      capture the pure effects of the weight-loss programs themselves, and to reduce the
      potentially confounding effects of merely participating in a research study. Subjects who
      have already committed to a weight-loss program (Medifast Direct, Take Shape For Life , or
      other) will be recruited to join this study, and will be asked to complete several
      questionnaires over a period of up to 6 â…“ years after enrollment. Questionnaires will measure
      information regarding anthropometrics, sociodemographics, and health & quality of life
      outcomes. The overall goal of this research is to be able to describe and compare the
      long-term dieting behaviors and outcomes among participants in Medifast Direct and Take Shape
      For Life programs in comparison with other dieters.
