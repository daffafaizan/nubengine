      inguinal hernia treated at Alexandria university hospital in the period between June 2014 and
      February 2017. Patients were randomized by sealed envelopes into 3 groups, each includes 40
      patients. Group I treated by laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair using 2
      separate meshes, Group II treated by open preperitoneal mesh repair, while Group III treated
      by bilateral Lichtenstein repair. The 3 groups were compared regarding: operative time,
      postoperative complications, pain, hospital stay, return to normal activity and work, chronic
      groin pain, patient's satisfaction and 3 years recurrence rate.

      Statistical Analysis: Numerical data in both groups was expressed as mean

      Â± standard deviation (SD) and compared using One-way analysis of variance while categorical
      data was expressed as percentages and compared using Chi-squared test. Logistic regression
      test was used to determine predictors of postoperative complications. Differences were
      considered significant at p <0.05.
