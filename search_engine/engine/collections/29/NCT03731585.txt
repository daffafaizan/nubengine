      I. Examine the feasibility (primary outcome) of the BREATHE intervention in women with lung
      cancer (LC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the initial intervention efficacy regarding psychological distress (secondary
      outcome) and cancer symptoms (tertiary outcome) relative to an education comparison (EC)
      group.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore potential mediation (e.g., mindfulness, compassion, inflammatory processes) and
      moderation (e.g., demographic and medical factors) of the intervention effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (PSYCHOLOGICAL): Patients participate in 5 psychological sessions and complete
      training on mindfulness, compassion, emotional processing, social support, generating
      positive emotions, and proactive coping strategies once a week for up to 5 weeks. Patients
      also complete questionnaires over 35 minutes and participate in video-based group sessions
      weekly for 5 weeks.

      GROUP II (EDUCATIONAL): Patients participate in 5 information sessions and receive education
      on lung cancer, symptom management, communication, and practicing self-care once a week for
      up to 5 weeks. Patients also complete questionnaires and participate in group sessions as in
      group I.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 1 week and at 3 months.
