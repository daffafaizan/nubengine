      fibrosis and vascular dysfunction. The leading causes of disease related morbidity and
      mortality are interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The
      6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a submaximal functional exercise test used to evaluate ILD and
      PAH in patients with SSc. Desaturations during the 6MWT have been considered suggestive of
      ILD and PAH. Still, the optimal method to measure peripheral oxygen saturation during the
      6MWT in patients with SSc remains unclear. Furthermore, other functional exercise tests may
      also be useful in patients with SSc.

      Patients with SSc will perform three functional exercise tests, and approximately half of the
      patients will be invited to repeat the tests 1 week later to determine test-retest
      reliability.

      During the 6MWT, the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be measured continuously on
      three anatomical locations. An arterial line will be placed, and blood will be drawn at
      baseline and after ended 6MWT and analysed for arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2).
      Bland-Altman plot will be used to display the agreement between SaO2 and SpO2 and between the
      two 6MWT. Further, the association between pulmonary variables and 6MWT results will be
      examined.

      Two alternative functional exercise tests will be investigated and compared to results in the
      6MWT: The 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1STST) and the 4-meter gait speed test (4MGS). The
      association between the three functional exercise tests and clinical parameters in patients
      with SSc will be examined.
