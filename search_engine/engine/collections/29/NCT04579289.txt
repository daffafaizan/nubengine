           A questionnaire was e-mailed to all identified institutions, with 3 reminders in one
           month. It included 39 questions concerning :

             -  morbidity and mortality linked with COVID-19

             -  structural features of the facility (location, architecture, residents
                characteristics)

             -  human resources

             -  crisis management (visits and circulation restrictions, personal protective
                equipment) A statistical analysis by logistic regression will be made, to identify
                explanatory variables for the occurrence of at least one COVID 19 infection among
                the residents.

        2. Qualitative survey :

      The investigators conducted semi-directed face-to-face interviews with facility directors.
      The investigators realized a purposive sample to assure maximal variability of the facilities
      (location, size, status, severity of the outbreak). The interview guide focused on
      structural, organizational, and human factors at stake in outbreak management, to identify
      incentives and obstacles associated with an easier crisis management.
