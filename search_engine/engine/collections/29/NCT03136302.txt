      when stimulating and to find the optimal target. This has to be evaluated for each target,
      such as globus pallidus (Gpi), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and ventral intermediate nucleus of
      the thalamus (VIM) separately. This is of special importance as the investigators can
      demonstrate the internal capsule, which is often a generator of stimulation-induced side
      effects: tetanic muscle contractions, dysarthria and gaze deviations.
