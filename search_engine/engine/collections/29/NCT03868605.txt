      with positive non-lifting sign will be included. Such lesions might be found during the
      colonoscopies at the trial endoscopy centers or at the cooperating referring endoscopy
      centers outside the study. Patient will be scheduled for the index therapeutic colonoscopy
      (iTC) and randomized in two groups - FTR group (therapy with FTRD) and ST group (standard
      therapy, EMR or ESD due to the indication, decided by the endoscopist). First follow-up
      colonoscopy (FC1) will be performed in 6 months interval. In case of LRN negativity at FC1,
      the second follow-up colonoscopy (FC2) will be done after 12 months (18 months since iTC). In
      case of LRN positivity at FC1, the LRN therapeutic colonoscopy (LRN-TC) will follow with the
      endoscopic method due the findings (patients will be divided into four groups): APC group
      (LRN ≤ 5 mm; APC therapy), EMR group (LRN > 5 mm and negative non-lifting sign negative; EMR
      therapy), FTR group (LRN > 5 mm and positive non-lifting sign; therapy with FTRD) and surgery
      group (complex lesion; surgical therapy). In some LRN positive cases, FC1 will be the same as
      LRN-TC. The first follow-up colonoscopy after LRN therapy (LRN-FC1) will be performed after 6
      months (12 months since TC). In case of re-LRN negativity at LRN-FC1 the second follow-up
      colonoscopy after LRN therapy (LRN-FC2) will be done after 6 months (18 months since iTC). In
      case of re-LRN positivity at LRN- FC1 the therapy will be done same as during FC1 and next
      follow-up will be done outside this trial. In some re-LRN positive cases, LRN-FC1 will be the
      same as re-LRN-TC. In conclusion, all patients will be followed-up within the study for 18
      months, if timely possible.
