      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once enrolled, patients are randomized into either the Pillar
      palatal implant group or a placebo/sham group.

      In both cases, patients come into the office for placement of the implants. This is an
      outpatient procedure. Patients are followed at one week, one month and 3 months. At each
      follow-up visit, patients will undergo a physical exam and complete questionnaires related to
      sleep and quality of life. Patients will also undergo reaction time testing on hand-held
      device similar to a pocket video game. At the three month visit, patients will return to the
      sleep lab for another sleep study.
