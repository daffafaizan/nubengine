      alternative communication (AAC), appears as a valuable tool to promote socialization in many
      groups of people. Serious games with virtual reality are an example of these resources and
      might bring benefits also to the elderly population, allowing an enjoyable and safe
      interaction that uses various sensorial stimuli. The purpose of this study protocol is to
      evaluate the effects of practicing virtual reality games on elderly socialization.

      Method/Design: It will be an experimental, prospective longitudinal study which will use
      serious games with virtual reality to improve the socialization of elderly people. A minimum
      of 23 people aged 60 years and older, of both sexes, from an informatics course for beginners
      will participate in the study. The evaluation will consist mainly in answering two validated
      questionnaires on socialization, the short Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults
      (SELSA-S) and short-form UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-6). Reaction time and performance will
      also be measured by three virtual reality games, namely Reaction Time, Random and
      Moviletrando. All this evaluation will be repeated in three moments: T0 - at baseline; T1 -
      after 8 conventional informatics classes and; T2 - after 8 informatics classes which includes
      15 minutes for practicing virtual reality games.

      Discussion: This study will determine whether the practice of virtual reality games in
      addition to the usual informatics classes contributes to elderly socialization. The evolution
      in socialization, the evolution of reaction time and performance in virtual reality games and
      the correlation of motor learning to socialization will also be investigated.
