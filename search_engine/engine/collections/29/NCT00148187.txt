      a cohort of subjects on hemodialysis and following them prospectively through the transplant
      procedure. The study will document patient adherence to medications and treatment, both
      before and after surgery. These preliminary data will permit appropriate design and power
      calculations for a future study assessing our ability to predict post-transplant compliance,
      based on pre-transplant behaviors.
