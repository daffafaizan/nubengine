      Primary

        -  To examine the relationship between adherence to endocrine therapy and variables from
           the Health Belief Model (i.e., perceived risk, barriers to and benefits of adherence,
           and cues to action such as physician recommendation) as well as measures of patient's
           perceptions of patient- and family-centered care in women with estrogen
           receptor-positive stage I-IIIA breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a 15 minute questionnaire on-line or by mail comprising questions
      of demographic and medical variables (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, marital and educational
      status, and medication side effects) as well as health beliefs and selected aspects of
      patient- and family-centered care. Data collected from the questionnaire will be stored in an
      Excel database.

      Patient's medical records are reviewed for information about the time since diagnosis, tumor
      characteristics, treatment, and comorbidity.
