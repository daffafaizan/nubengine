      previously demonstrated that enzymes of lipoxygenase pathway are present in uterine smooth
      muscle, and that an additive tocolytic effect can be obtained from the combined use of
      Montelukast and Nifedipine.

      Methods:

      This is a double-blinded randomized controlled assay performed at the CHUS on two groups of
      50 women. Women will be selected when admitted for preterm labor with a gestational age
      between 26 and 34 weeks.

      The first group will receive Nifedipine for 48 hours, as described by the standard protocol
      at the CHUS, in addition to 10 mg of Montelukast per day, until delivery or 35 weeks of
      pregnancy.

      The second group will receive Nifedipine for 48 hours, as described by the standard protocol
      at the CHUS, in addition to a placebo per day, until delivery or 35 weeks of pregnancy.

      Cervical secretions and urine will be sample at the admission, after one week and every two
      weeks during treatment.
