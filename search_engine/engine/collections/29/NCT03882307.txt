      hepatitis C treatment. The association of sofosbuvir with daclatasvir or simeprevir , with or
      without ribavirin , directly inhibits viral replication .

      Sofosbuvir (400 mg once per day) and daclatasvir (60mg once per day) or simeprevir (150 mg
      once per day) for 3 months treatment regimens.

      Sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy guarantees efficacy in HCV eradication in approximately
      90% of cases and is associated with mild to moderate adverse effects.

      Overall, studies describe an increase in serum cytokine levels in chronic hepatitis C
      patients, when compared with healthy individuals. ,interleukin-6(IL-6) is produced mainly by
      kupffer cells and induces the production of the acute phase proteins, C-reactive protein and
      haptoglobin .

      Previous studies reported that serum Interleukin-6 levels were increased, compared with
      healthy individuals, in patients with some liver diseases.Previous results suggest that
      baseline levels of Interleukin, as well as their decrease during treatment .Transforming
      growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a cytokine that has been assigned a key role in epithelial
      repair. Injury to the liver elicits a rapid increase in its expression. HCV -infected
      hepatocytes produce (TGF-β) which may stimulate T-regulatory cells.
