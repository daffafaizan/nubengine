      the major cause of heart disease, is thought to relate to dysregulated inflammation in the
      cardiovascular system and possibly results from over production of reactive oxygen species
      (ROS). The rate of atherosclerosis in patients with disorders of the immune system has not
      been well characterized but is likely to be dramatically different than that seen in the
      general population. Specifically, patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) may be
      protected from developing atherosclerosis due to reduced superoxide and other ROS production
      by phagocytic cells. We hypothesize that patients with CGD are at decreased risk of
      developing atherosclerosis. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      prevalence of atherosclerosis and it s inflammatory characteristics in these and other
      patients with in-born disorders of immune function. The primary objective will be assessed
      using carotid studies and other imaging techniques to measure coronary artery calcium scores
      and the presence or absence of soft plaque. Secondary endpoints include physiologic
      characteristics such as blood pressure as well as circulating biomarkers associated with
      heart disease such as C-reactive protein and lipid profile. This study may lead to improved
      understanding of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, specifically the role of free
      radical stress, and could lead to novel therapies for atherosclerosis that may benefit
      patients with immune disorders and the general population.
