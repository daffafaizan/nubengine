      for each participant, with two sessions conducted using a novel Lite Run Gait Trainer device
      (Lite Run, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and two sessions conducted using the comparator method of
      choice by the physical therapist (harness system). The initial condition (harness or Lite
      Run) will be randomized. The overall gait training physical therapy session will follow
      standard of care; the only factor that will change will be the assistive device used during
      therapy (harness or Lite Run).

      Participants will include 10 VA inpatients receiving physical therapy at the Minneapolis VA
      Health Care System (MVAHCS). Patients will be recruited from three VA rehabilitation units:
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R), Spinal Cord Injury and Disease (SCI/D) Center,
      and Community Living Center (CLC). Participants will have a range of diagnoses: stroke,
      traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, wounds, obesity.

      The number of therapists and their time involvement will be tracked as a primary outcome
      measure in this study. The effectiveness of treatment will also be assessed for both
      assistive device methods. The total amount of therapeutic treatment time will be measured as
      the time spent by the patient in an upright position. At the end of each therapy session,
      participants will also be asked to rate their pain (comfort), perceived level of exertion,
      and will fill out a questionnaire about their experience with the Lite Run Gait Trainer. The
      physical therapists involved in the study will also provide their feedback.
