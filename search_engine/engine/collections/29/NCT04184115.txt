    
      This Phase 3 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      identify the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of a repeated-dose regimen of DPI 386
      nasal gel (intranasal scopolamine gel) for the prevention and treatment of nausea associated
      with motion sickness. The study will have three arms: DPI-386 nasal gel, placebo nasal gel,
      and TDS patch (1.5 mg/72 hours), the current standard of care for the treatment of motion
      sickness. The study will include 34 subjects per arm, for a total of 102 subjects (n=102). A
      double dummy design will be used to mask the treatment assignment. All subjects will receive
      both a patch and nasal gel randomized to one of the following three arms: DPI-386 Nasal Gel +
      placebo patch, placebo nasal gel + placebo patch, or placebo nasal gel + TDS patch.

      Treatment Day 1 will be conducted aboard an ocean-going vessel to obtain data in an
      operationally relevant real world environment immediately followed by Treatment Days 2 and 3
      at a clinical site or one of its two satellite locations.
