      recruitment of consecutive patients with COVID-19. Enrollment will last 6 months or,
      considering the desirable drop in infections in the next few weeks, until exhaustion of
      enrolled patients. Enrollment will be followed by 18 months dedicated to transcriptomics and
      seroproteomics investigations, for a total duration of the study of 24 months.

      All patients will receive optimal medical therapy, and will undergo laboratory or
      instrumental examinations (chest x-ray, CT, echocardiography) as needed.

      Blood samples will be taken at the entrance and then twice a week for the duration of the
      hospitalization (generally 2-3 weeks).

      Anamnesis will be noted for all patients. In addition, at all times, patients will undergo
      clinical evaluation and the following laboratory tests, which include:

        -  blood count

        -  biochemistry

        -  standard coagulation and thrombin generation, fibrin generation and fibrinolysis (INR,
           PTT, D-dimer, Tissue Plasminogen Activator TPA, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor PAI-2,
           Plasmin-AntiPlasmin complex PAP, Thrombin activated Fibrinolysis Inhibitor TAFI,
           Thrombin-AntiThrombin complex TAT, Prothrombin Fragment PF 1+2, Fibrinopeptide A)

        -  inflammation/infection (IL-6, procalcitonin, ferritin, PCR, sCD14, TLR3 and 4, RANTES,
           CCR3 and 4

        -  other (troponin I, NT-pro-BNP, Hb1Ac). A subgroup of patients will undergo a
           microcirculation analysis with SDF (Sidestream Dark Field imaging).
