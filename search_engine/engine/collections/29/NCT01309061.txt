    
      Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSCs) represent an attractive and ethical cell
      source for stem cell therapy.

      With the recent demonstration of MSC homing properties, intramuscular aplications of MSCs to
      cell-damaged diseases have increased.

      In a human clinical trial, five patients who had suffered a progressive hemifacial atrophy(
      Romberg's disease) were intramuscular administered autologous hAdMSCs (1Ã—10e7 cells/500ul)
      with autologous microlipoinjection one time.
