    
      -  Paediatric patients up to the age of 17 years will be included. Number and time points
           of PK sampling will depend on age and tumour type.

        -  PK samples will be collected from two doxorubicin administrations. Analyzing samples
           from two doxorubicin administrations will allow distinguishing between interindividual,
           intraindividual and residual variability.

        -  Doxorubicin and its major metabolite doxorubicinol will be measured in plasma using HPLC

        -  In addition, the natriuretic peptide BNP and the precursors NT-pro ANP and NT-proBNP as
           well as troponin T will be measured in plasma up to 28 days after doxorubicin
           administration to evaluate their use as clinical markers for cardiotoxicity.

        -  A data set of max 5 samples (3 +2 (in the 1st + 2nd Doxorubicin sampling periods)) will
           be collected in the younger children (< 3 years) and a data set of max. 8 samples ( 5 +
           3) will be collected in the older children. Samples will be taken at predefined time
           points/ time intervals.

        -  An additional DNA sample will be taken and analyzed for genetic polymorphisms. The
           influence of genotype on pharmacokinetics and metabolism will be investigated by
           appropriate statistical methods, including population pharmacokinetic analyses. Genes to
           study would include MDR1 and SLC22A16, both involved in the transport of doxorubicin and
           AKR1A1 and CBR1, both involved in the reduction of doxorubicin to doxorubicinol.
           Selected genotypes will be incorporated as covariates into the population
           pharmacokinetic models developed. The potential impact of genetic variation will be
           evaluated in the context of other sources of variability such as age, weight, gender etc
