    
      In this 3 month, randomized (1:1 ratio), parallel-group, multicenter trial, patients in both
      groups (control and coaching) will receive information and guidance on the benefits
      associated with increased physical activity in COPD patients and their health status.
      Patients in both groups will use two PROactive monitors (ActiGraph® and DynaPort®) and a PDA
      to complete the PROactive questionnaire. In addition to above, the patients in the coaching
      group will receive daily coaching by a semiautomated system and coaching by the investigator
      during study visits.
