      its effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Yet it seems reasonable that the AS in temporary
      dentition could slow the specific development of carious lesions in early childhood. In
      addition, this non-invasive approach could delay the conventional food and thus save
      financial costs for more complex treatments. Finally, the installation of AS could afford, as
      demonstrated in adult teeth, lowering the cariogenic bacteria prevalence engaged in the
      caries process.

      Main objective: To evaluate the effect of AS on caries incidence in the deciduous dentition
      obtained over a period of three years, taking into account the risk of caries established
      initially.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To assess the prevalence and caries attack sites at the end of each year

        2. Estimate the retention rate (partial or complete) of the AS during the study

        3. Determine the cost savings of treatment during the trial period
