      is assigned by chance), double blind (neither investigator nor the participant knows the
      treatment that the participant receives), placebo controlled (an inactive substance that is
      compared with the study medication to test whether the study medication has a real effect in
      clinical study), study to assess the efficacy and safety of CNTO 328 plus BSC compared with
      BSC in patients with symptomatic Multicentric Castleman's Disease. The study mainly consists
      of 3 phases, including: the screening phase (majority of assessments performed within 28 days
      of first dose), the treatment phase (blinded and unblinded), and the follow up phase. In the
      blinded treatment phase, approximately 78 patients will be randomly assigned in 1:2 ratios to
      either of 2 treatment groups, ie, Placebo + BSC, or CNTO 328 + BSC. Participants receiving
      placebo + BSC during blinded treatment period who do not respond and have treatment failure
      will have the option to crossover and receive siltuximab + BSC during unbllinded treatent
      period. The follow up phase will be 3 months after last dose of study medication and the
      survival will be followed up until the study ends. Safety evaluations for adverse events,
      clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, patient-recorded temperature, and
      physical examination will be monitored throughout the study. The total study duration will be
      5 years after the last patient starts study medication.
