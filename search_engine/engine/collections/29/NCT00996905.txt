      circumstances (eg. predicted difficult epidurals). However, no large scale studies with
      multiple anesthesiologists performing the technique have been done to show that ultrasound
      scanning may be of benefit in their everyday clinical practice.

      This study will involve residents and fellows, each performing epidural insertions with and
      without the use of ultrasound scanning of the lumbar spine prior to the procedure. If the
      hypothesis is correct, then the use of this technique may become widespread, resulting in
      less complications and increased patients satisfaction.
