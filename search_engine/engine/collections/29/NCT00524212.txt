    
      Despite progress in surgical and medical treatment, infective endocarditis is still
      associated with high morbidity and mortality.

      The variable clinical presentation of IE makes the diagnosis a clinical challenge.

      Procalcitonin is a precursor from the hormone calcitonin and also a marker of systemic
      bacterial infections.

      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to investigate the diagnostic value of serum procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein
           (CRP) and sedimentation rate (SR) when IE is suspected.

        -  to investigate if a retrospectively generated clinical model suitable for exclusion of
           IE can be confirmed prospectively.
