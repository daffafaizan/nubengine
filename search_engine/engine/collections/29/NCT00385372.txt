      cause itching and lasting for at least six weeks. If there is no indication of a possible
      eliciting agent and because approximately 70% of patients benefit from it, a
      low-pseudoallergen diet should be carried out for 5 weeks. Although the low-pseudoallergen
      diet is successful, no explanation of the underlying mechanisms exists. On DBPC oral
      provocation testing with known food additives, only a small amount of patients, who
      experienced remission after a low-pseudoallergen diet react with new wheals and/or
      angioedema. For this discrepancy, natural food ingredients and new food additives are
      included in the dietary diagnostic. The high amount of substances, which are administrated
      within oral provocation testing can not reflect a realistic diet situation. Often it is
      impossible to ingest corresponding amounts of foods to reach the same concentration such as
      the provocation amount. Recording change reactions between food ingredients and the
      individual metabolism of the patients, the "step by step" food provocation method reveals
      itself to be most effective. In addition, individual predilections, amounts and frequency of
      ingested foods, are taken into consideration.
