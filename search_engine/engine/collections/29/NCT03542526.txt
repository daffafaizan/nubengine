      Several studies have shown that left ventricular hypertrophy is an important risk factor in
      patients with hypertension, leading to a fivefold to 10-fold increase in cardiovascular
      risk,1 2 3 4 5 which is similar to the increase seen in patients with a history of myocardial
      infarction.6 The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, in addition to hypertension, thus
      has important implications for assessing risk and managing patients, including decisions on
      interventions other than antihypertensive treatment, such as lipid lowering treatment and
      lifestyle modifications.7 8 Accurate and early diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy is
      therefore an important component of the care of patients with hypertension.

      Decisions about treatment should be based on assessments of hypertensive target organ damage
      and overall cardiovascular risk. The appropriate diagnostic work-up of suspected left
      ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension is less clear, however. There is many
      electrocardiographic indexes for the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy, based on the
      standard 12 lead electrocardiogram, have been described. Many of the proposed indexes have
      remained anecdotal, but others are commonly used, including the Sokolow-Lyon index,9 the
      Cornell voltage index,10 the Cornell product index,11 the Gubner index,12 and the
      Romhilt-Estes scores.13 However, debate about their comparative diagnostic value continues.14
      15 We did a systematic review to clarify the accuracy of different electrocardiographic
      indexes, with emphasis on their ability to rule out left ventricular hypertrophy in patients
      with arterial hypertension.
