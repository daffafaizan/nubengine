      by a 7 day wash-out period. The study will enroll asthmatic subjects ≥18 years of age who are
      currently receiving inhaled corticosteroid treatment with an FEV1 of between 40-85% of
      predicted normal and with airway reversibility as demonstrated by an increase in FEV1 of ≥12%
      and ≥200ml .

      Efficacy assessments include 24-hour serial lung function testing. Safety assessments include
      incidence of adverse events and measurement of vital signs.
