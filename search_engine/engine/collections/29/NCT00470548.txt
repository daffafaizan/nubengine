      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation when
           administered with pemetrexed disodium in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
           cancer, breast cancer, or other solid tumors. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, as measured by objective tumor response rate
           (RECIST criteria), in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the preliminary efficacy of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
           formulation and pemetrexed disodium in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this regimen. (Phase
           II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation followed by an open-label, phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and paclitaxel
           albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
           repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
           nanoparticle formulation at the MTD as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
