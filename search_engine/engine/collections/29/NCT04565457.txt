      equipped with 2D antiscatter grid technology, referred to as research CBCT. Each participant
      will also be scanned with a standard clinical CBCT as part of their standard clinical care,
      which will serve as the baseline, or control. Thus, the image quality improvement in research
      CBCT will assessed with respect to standard clinical CBCT.
