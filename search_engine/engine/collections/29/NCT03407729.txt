      determine whether differences in birth events and oxygen levels during the newborn period
      lead to structural and functional impairment within the brain's dopaminergic pathways and the
      cortical regions innervated by those pathways. The dopaminergic system is involved in
      modulating motor control and cognitive function.

      Using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), structural integrity of dopaminergic
      circuits will be quantified and compared in post-hypoxic former preterm children versus
      healthy control children born at term closely matched by age/sex/race.

      Functional activity during executive function tasks will be quantified and compared in
      post-hypoxic former preterm children versus healthy control children born at term using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging-blood oxygen level dependent (fMRI-BOLD) with high
      density electroencephalography (HD-EEG). Assessment of motor function (grooved pegboard task)
      will also be performed.
