      before and after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery in obese individuals was examined.
      Enteroendocrine cells were identified and isolated from intestinal biopsies and analysed for
      differentially expressed genes by Illumina High Throughput RNA-sequencing. It was discovered
      that the gene encoding liver-enriched antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2), a naturally occurring
      peptide in humans, was significantly upregulated compared to baseline expression.
      Interestingly, LEAP-2 was recently shown to antagonize ghrelin function in response to
      feeding in mice. Moreover, the mature murine LEAP-2 peptide is identical in mice and humans.
      Thus, LEAP-2 has been identified as an endogenous peptide that may be able to alter feeding
      behaviour and maintenance of glucose levels during calorie restriction.

      The study hypothesis is that LEAP-2 alters postprandial glucose metabolism and decreases
      appetite as well as food intake in relation to a liquid mixed meal and a standardised ad
      libitum meal compared with saline (placebo) in healthy subjects.
