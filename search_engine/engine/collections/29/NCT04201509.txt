      understanding of the discriminative validity of neurocognitive tests and how test results of
      neurocognitive functions and ratings of emotional factors and ADHD symptoms change over time
      and interacts during development. The project is studying the validity of clinical assessment
      methods within the Swedish child and adolescent psychiatry service (CAP) related to the
      identification of ADHD, additional impairments, and comorbidity. The prospective validity of
      neurocognitive functions and emotional factors in schoolchildren with ADHD and a control
      group of typically developing schoolchildren at baseline and after three years will be
      investigated.

      Specific aims: Aim I: Study how attentiveness and impulsivity in ADHD change over three years
      by comparing the results of psychological tests and rating scales at baseline and after three
      years Aim II: Study intellectual development in ADHD by comparing the results of intelligence
      tests at baseline and after three years- Aim III: Study how emotional factors change over
      three years by comparing the results of rating scales at baseline and after three years
