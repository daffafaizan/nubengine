      The main objective of this study is to establish a methodology to evaluate the acute impact
      of spice ingestion on metabolism and autonomic nervous system activity.

      Primary outcomes:

      Impact of the spice on autonomic nervous system activity: Power spectra analysis on heart
      rate variability (HRV) changes during the 90 post ingestive minutes (measured by ECG).

      Impact of the spice on metabolism: Energy expenditure changes during the 90 post ingestive
      minutes (measured by indirect calorimetry).

      As secondary outcomes blood pressure changes and facial temperature changes on specific area
      (nose, cheeks and forehead) will be evaluated. Substrate oxidation (carbohydrates and fat
      utilization) and the respiratory quotient (RQ) will be calculated using indirect calorimetry
      data for energy expenditure measure.
