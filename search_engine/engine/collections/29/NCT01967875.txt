      if ERCC1 expression could predict the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. A total of 180 patients are planned to be
      enrolled into the study. ERCC1 protein expression in paraffin-embedding tumor tissue is
      examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Patients with low ERCC1 expression (group L) will be
      treated with XP regimen. Patients with high ERCC1 expression will be randomized into group
      H-A or group H-B, and be treated with XP or DX regimen, respectively. The primary end point
      is progression free survival (PFS), and the secondary end points include the median overall
      survival, objective response rate (ORR),disease control rate(DCR), duration of response,
      safety(number and degree of adverse events), and the quality of life (QOL).
