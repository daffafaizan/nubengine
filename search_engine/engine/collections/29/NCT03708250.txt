      particular in children. Unexpected complications and death in children who have ingested
      button battery have been published for over twenty years in medical literature. The most
      serious cases are those related to the ingestion of button cells, especially in children,
      when the battery gets stuck in the esophagus. Poison control centres, as well as
      addictovigilance centres, are regularly called upon for serious poisoning resulting in
      hospitalization, for which precisely description is most often missing or difficult to obtain
      and limits the efficiency of the management of these poisonings. So there are many questions
      related to the treatment that remain unanswered, because some data are missing in previously
      published studies. For example, in many cases, there is a lack of detail of initial symptoms,
      delays between symptoms and completion of further tests, follow-upsâ€¦ A prospective and
      descriptive study about button battery poisoning performed on data collected by French PCC
      will be conducted between the 1st June of 2016 and the 31 May of 2018: any call in a PCC that
      occurred during the period studied and concerning an exposure to a button cell regardless of
      the route of exposure, the age of the patient, and its symptomatology will be included. The
      following data will be taken : severe complication, need for surgery, length of hospital
      stay, death, risk factors concerning the battery (size, voltage), abnormalities at the first
      fibroscopy.
