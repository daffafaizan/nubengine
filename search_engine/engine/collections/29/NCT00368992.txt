    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the frequency and severity of hemorrhage toxicities in patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer treated with the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, cetuximab
      and bevacizumab followed by therapy with cetuximab and bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival, response rate (confirmed plus
      unconfirmed, complete plus partial), and frequency and severity of non-hemorrhage toxicities
      in this group of patients treated with this regimen.

      II. To perform molecular correlative studies on patient tissue to investigate in an
      exploratory manner potential predictors of efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, carboplatin IV over 30 minutes, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for up to 3 years.
