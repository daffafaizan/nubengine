      assign patients to the treatment after randomization. The primary endpoint is overall
      survival. Response rate, progression-free survival, drugs related side effects and other
      endpoints events will be recorded and analyzed, to assess the combination treatment with
      modified-FOLFIRINOX and Anti-PD-1 antibody could or couldn't benefit the patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.
