      disease is increasing year by year, seriously affecting people's quality of life. The
      systematic treatment of psoriasis in modern medicine is limited of wide application due to
      the adverse reactions of different degrees and the high economic cost.

      Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have become an increasingly visible
      part of dermatology. Cupping is becoming an important therapy in complementary and
      alternative medicine. Although, moving cupping therapy has been widely used in the treatment
      of plaque psoriasis and has been recognized by a large number of peers and patients, but
      still lacks high-quality evidence-based medical evidence. Therefore, the project team intends
      to provide evidence support for the effectiveness and safety of moving cupping therapy for
      plaque psoriasis through clinical studies.
