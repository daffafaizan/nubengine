      measured during chronic non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy may be used to predict a
      disease exacerbation.

      Modern ventilators used in the home for chronic respiratory failure have the ability to
      monitor and store respiratory variables that may worsen during exacerbations, and may
      potentially detect exacerbations before symptoms become apparent. Normal pressure support
      ventilators monitor respiratory rate which might be expected to increase with worsening
      disease. In patients with obstructive airways disease an increase in expiratory time may
      potentially be observed with worsening airways obstruction. Adaptive servo ventilators, which
      modulate pressure support to maintain constant minute ventilation, may increase the amount of
      pressure support delivered if respiratory mechanics deteriorate as a result of an
      exacerbation.

      Consenting experienced NIV users will be switched to an adaptive-servo ventilator with the
      capacity to monitor and store therapy data. The device being used is the Stellar 150
      ventilator (Resmed, Ltd., Bella Vista, Australia) with hardware and software ability to
      measure variables such as respiratory rate, airflow, pressure support and leak.

      Patients will use the ventilator for a total of 4 months during which they will complete
      daily symptom diaries, including medication use and peak flow measurements.

      Changes in ventilator variables will be analysed and day to day variation identified. Changes
      will be compared with daily peak expiratory flow measures (an indication of how well the
      airways are functioning), patient symptoms, and healthcare utilization. Hospital admissions
      for exacerbations, GP consults, and healthcare team contacts will also be measured.
