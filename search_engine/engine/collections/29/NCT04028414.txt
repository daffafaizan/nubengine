      following early versus delayed weight bearing among individuals with a traumatic ankle
      fracture. This study will enroll patients ages 18 to 65 surgically treated for an ankle
      fracture or fracture dislocation (without syndesmosis) at participating civilian trauma
      centers and military treatment facilities. Eligible patients will be identified during
      hospitalization for definitive treatment and enrolled prior to discharge or at the first post
      op clinic visit. Patients that consent to participate will complete a baseline assessment at
      the first post op clinic visit and will be randomized to early versus delayed weight bearing.
      Both treatment groups will receive standardized exercises that can be done at home or with a
      therapist. Outcomes will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months following definitive
      fracture fixation. All 6 week, 3 and 6 month evaluations will take place in the surgeon's
      outpatient clinic and involve clinical and radiographic assessments of healing as well as
      functional outcome surveys. The 12 month evaluation will be conducted by phone except for
      individuals who were judged not to be healed (clinically or radiographically) at 6 months;
      these participants will be asked to return for their 12 month evaluation (to assess healing).
      Simultaneously, a pilot RCT will be conducted in patients 18-65 surgically treated with a
      unicondylar plateau fracture without joint impaction. The figure below provides an overview
      of the study timeline and procedures.
