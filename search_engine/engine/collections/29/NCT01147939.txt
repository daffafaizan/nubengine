      for patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). To be included in the
      study, patients must have failed to respond to two or three different therapies for AML, or
      have obtained remission but then relapsed within a relatively short period of time. Patients
      of age â‰¥ 65 with adverse cytogenetics can be included in the study after having received one
      and up to three previous induction/re-induction therapies.

      Elacytarabine is an investigational drug which is not commercially available. It is the
      elaidic acid ester derivative of cytarabine. Cytarabine is routinely used in the treatment of
      patients with AML. A substantial portion of AML patients have a deficient uptake of
      cytarabine, often explained by lack of a transport protein (hENT1) in the leukemic cell
      membrane. Due to the elaidic acid (a naturally occurring fatty acid), cellular uptake of
      elacytarabine is independent of this transport protein.

      Patients included in the study will be randomized to elacytarabine or control treatment.
      Since there is no standard therapy for relapsed or refractory AML, there is a list of 7
      control treatments and the investigator has to choose one that is locked before
      randomization.

      Elacytarabine is given as a continuous infusion over five days, followed by a rest period of
      minimum two weeks. Investigator's choice treatment is given according to the specific
      routine.

      After each course response evaluation and a decision on further treatment will be made.

      Repeated courses of elacytarabine and control treatment might be needed to attain and/or
      maintain complete remission or clinical benefit.

      After the end of study treatment, all patients will be followed for relapse and survival.
