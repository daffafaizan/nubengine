      a human protein called albumin. In Canada, nab-paclitaxel is currently approved for the
      treatment of metastatic breast cancer. This drug has been tested in other cancers and has
      shown promising activity in lung cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Information from
      research studies suggests that nab-paclitaxel may be a useful treatment for urothelial
      cancer.
