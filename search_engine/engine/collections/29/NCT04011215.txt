    
      The study will aim for a sample size of approximately 150 participants (equally distributed
      between 3 international sites) between the ages of 3 months and 5 years referred to the
      respective Dermatology Departments for management of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.
      They will be sequentially recruited and randomized to the wool-to-standard clothing arm or
      standard clothing-to-wool arm.

      The study will run for 12 weeks for each participant with two consecutive 6-week periods for
      each intervention, either of wool followed by standard clothing or standard followed by wool
      clothing. Participants will be assessed by a blinded trained researcher, at their initial
      appointment, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks and 12 weeks post commencement of the first
      intervention.

      The primary outcome is the severity of atopic dermatitis at 6 weeks post commencement of each
      intervention i.e.at week 6 and week 12. Severity of atopic eczema will be measured using the
      Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).

      Secondary outcomes include the severity and change in the severity of eczema using the EASI
      at 3 weeks, the validated Investigators Global Assessment for atopic dermatitis (vIGA-ADâ„¢)
      score and quality of life assessment using the children's Dermatology Life Quality Index
      (cDLQI) at 3 and 6 weeks of each 6 week intervention period, as well as weekly Patient
      Oriented SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (PO-SCORAD) scores.
