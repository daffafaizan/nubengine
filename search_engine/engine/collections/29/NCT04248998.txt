      associated with the lowest cure rates in the limited-stage disease setting, as well as with
      the lowest overall survival in the metastatic setting. Preclinical studies indicate that
      cycles of fasting or calorie-restricted, low-carbohydrate, low-protein diets, also known as
      fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs), have synergistic cytotoxic effects when combined with
      chemotherapy agents, such as doxorubicin or cisplatin, in several in vitro and in vivo tumor
      models, including murine TNBC models. More recently, intermittent fasting has demonstrated
      highly synergistic antitumor effects when combined with metformin; of note, these effects are
      mediated through the concomitant inhibition of glycolysis (via fasting-induced hypoglycemia)
      and metformin-induced inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
      Finally, small reports published so far indicate that cyclic fasting and FMDs are well
      tolerated in cancer patients, and can be safety combined with standard antitumor treatments.

      Based on these data, the BREAKFAST trial was designed to investigate the antitumor activity
      of cyclic FMD, alone or in combination with metformin, in patients with localized TNBC. In
      this study, 90 patients with stage I-III TNBC will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      approximately 6 months of standard preoperative anthracycline plus taxane chemotherapy in
      combination with eight triweekly cycles of 5-day FMD (Arm A), or the same chemotherapy-FMD
      regimen plus daily metformin (Arm B). The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate
      that one or both experimental treatments increase the rate of pCR from 45% (historical data)
      to 65%
