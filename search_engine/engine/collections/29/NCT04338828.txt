      patient presentations in the emergency department for respiratory complaints, with many of
      these patients requiring ICU admission and ventilatory support. While COVID-19 patients have
      an increased need for supportive care, there is currently no specific treatment directed
      against 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide inhalation has been used as a pulmonary vasodilator and has
      been found to have antiviral activity against other coronavirus strains.

      Preliminary data support a microbicidal effect of high concentration inhaled NO. We
      hypothesize that high concentration inhaled NO can have a viricidal effect against SARS-Cov-2
      and prevent the deterioration to a severe form of COVID-19 when administered at an early
      stage of the disease. Additional potential mechanisms why INO may be effective in this
      indication: 1)improves V/Q ratio, 2) reduces PVR and PAP, 3) Anti-thrombotic in lung. This
      would have potential benefit for the patients in terms of reducing the severity of the
      clinical course and time to recovery. An additional benefit could be for the society since a
      faster and a less severe clinical course could protect limited hospital resources (ED, floor,
      and ICU) from being overwhelmed.

      The primary aim is to prevent the deterioration of mild COVID-19 infection (defined by a
      RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen from any site) with respiratory signs/ symptoms
      to a more severe form of the disease as defined by the patient needing to 1) return to the
      ED, 2) be admitting to the hospital, 3) be intubated, 4) and all cause 28 day mortality.
