      processes, clinical efficacy, costs, and subjective experiences of IEHT following ยง115d of
      the German Social Code Book Five (SGB-V)compared to inpatient treatment from the perspective
      of service users, relatives or rather informal care givers' , staff and other stakeholders in
      mental health care. To maximize transferability of study results and to cover a broad
      spectrum of IEHT experience, 10 hospitals from different regions of Germany (e.g. rural,
      urban, east, west) participate in this study. Combining routine data, primary data and
      prospective follow-up data, the study results will be based/ involve a comprehensive
      database. Further, the combination of clinical and health economic data will enable the
      assessment of costs and benefits from a national perspective, a particularity of importance,
      given that there are only a few studies with health economic evidence of acute outreach
      mental health care. The qualitative evaluation of processes and out-comes of IEHT uses a
      collaborative-participatory approach that aligns with current demands for more user
      orientation and/ or involvement of people and researchers with lived experience in the
      process of developing interventions and their evaluation. The mixed-methods design of the
      trial corresponds with current standards of empirical social research enabling the
      triangulation of hypothesis-confirming, quantifiable factors and hypothesis-generating,
      qualitative aspects. By parallelizing on one hand quantitative and qualitative data and on
      the other hand routine data with primary data, data on implementation processes and data on
      treatment processes, different facets from different perspectives and levels of IEHT are
      targeted. This allows for a comprehensive, holistic assessment of this innovative treatment
      offer.
