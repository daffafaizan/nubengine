      life. We will also describe the anatomy of the foramen ovale and the septum primum during
      this time. The direction of flow across the foramen ovale will also be observed. Other
      cardiac lesions will be checked for as well. We will measure the change in size of the
      pulmonary arteries and the closure of the ductus arteriosus.
