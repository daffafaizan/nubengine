      duration.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new Giomer
      restorative system (Shofu Beautifil LS) for use in restoring non carious Class V lesions by
      comparing it to 3M ESPE FiltekTM Supreme in the following categories:

      Clinical Assessments (Documentation at baseline, 6months and 18months):

        -  Surface Luster

        -  Surface Staining

        -  Marginal Staining

        -  Color Match

        -  Anatomical Form

        -  Marginal Adaptation

        -  Fracture of Material and Retention

        -  Radiographic Examination

        -  Patient's View

        -  Postoperative Hypersensitivity

        -  Recurrence of Caries

        -  Tooth Integrity

        -  Adjacent Mucosa

      Sensitivity interview- assessed preoperatively (prior to anesthesia, if needed) at baseline
      and after restoration placement

      Dentin Sclerosis Rating- assessed at baseline
