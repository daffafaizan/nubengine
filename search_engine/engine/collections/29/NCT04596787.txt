    
      Aim: The number of obese patients (body mass index (BMI)≥30) has increased dramatically
      worldwide, and we, as anesthesiologists, routinely come up against them in our daily clinical
      practice. Although the preference of various peripheral and neuroaxial regional anesthesia
      (RA) techniques seems to be advantageous in the anesthetic management of these patients,
      their performances can also be associated with technical difficulties and greater failure
      rates. The aim of this study is to compare the performance properties and analgesic efficacy
      of ultrasound (US)-guided thoracic paravertebral blocks (TPVBs) in obese and non-obese
      patients.

      Material methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval; data of 82 patients, who
      underwent elective bilateral reduction mammaplasty under general anesthesia with adjunctive
      TPVB analgesia between December of 2016 and February of 2020, were reviewed. Patients were
      allocated into two groups with respect to their BMI scores (Group NO: BMI<30 and Group O:
      BMI≥30). Demographics, TPVB ideal US image visualization and performance times, needle tip
      visualisation and TPVB performance difficulties, number of needle maneuvers, surgical,
      anesthetic and analgesic follow-up parameters, incidence of postoperative nausea vomiting
      (PONV), sleep duration, length of postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and hospital stay, patient
      and surgeon satisfaction scores were all investigated and compared. Student's t,
      Mann-Whitney-U and Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis.
