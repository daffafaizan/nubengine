      treatment of precancerous lesions in low-resource settings. The Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
      test performed by women themselves (HPV self-test) could be an efficient method to assess the
      long-term risk of recurrent/persistent disease in women with a history of HPV infection and
      cervical intra-epithelial lesions grade 2 or higher (CIN2+).

      A total of 443 HPV-positive women, aged 30-65 years, have been selected through a screening
      campaign conducted in Ambanja, Madagascar, between 2013 and 2015. Of these, 260 have been
      treated by cold coagulation, conisation or electrocauterization. A follow-up visit at 1-3
      years after primary screening will be organized for all HPV-positive women detected at
      primary screening. Participants will perform an HPV self-test. A sample for cytology and HPV
      testing will also be collected by the physician. The goal of the study will be the
      histological search for CIN2+ lesions at one to three years after primary screening.

      The investigators expect to see that Self-HPV may be an accurate method for the follow-up of
      women with a history of HPV infection.
