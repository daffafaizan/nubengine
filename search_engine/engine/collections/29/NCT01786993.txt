      and again at 3, 6 and 9 months post implant. At implant, the final LV pacing configuration is
      programmed using any one of the 10 available pacing vectors. The paced/sensed
      atrioventricular (AV) and interventricular (VV) delays may be optimized as per the site's
      standard of care. Subjects will continue to receive BiV therapy until the 3-month follow-up
      visit.

      At the 3-month visit, responder status between Enrollment and 3 months will be assessed using
      the Clinical Composite Score (CCS). All subjects that are "Improved" using the definition
      outlined in the CCS will be grouped together as Responders. All subjects that are "Worsened"
      or "Unchanged" using the definitions outlined in the CCS will be considered as
      Non-responders. All subjects will undergo acute measurement of cardiac performance (e.g.,
      Echocardiography) at various MPP combinations compared to BiV pacing. Only subjects with
      "equal or better" echocardiographic measurements (i.e., EA VTI measurements) with MPP feature
      on compared to BiV pacing will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms - BiV arm
      or MPP arm.

      At the 9-month visit, responder status will be evaluated once again using the CCS and
      compared to the status at 3 months.
