      participate in the development of new blood vessels in ischemic tissue. The aim of the study
      is in a phase I safety study to evaluate the clinical effect of autologous mesenchymal stem
      cell therapy in patients with severe chronic myocardial ischemia.10 patients with reversible
      ischemia on a SPECT will be treated with direct intramyocardial injections of autologous
      isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells.Clinical and objective evaluations will be
      performed at baseline and during 24 months follow-up.
