      therapeutic modalities have to be developed to improve the patientÂ´s clinical outcome.
      Immunotherapy, which targets tumor associated antigens of tumor cells or tumor stroma, is
      currently an intensively investigated, novel therapeutic option. As survivin is expressed
      both by neoplastic cells as well as by endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature, this
      antigen is an intriguing target molecule. Spontaneous cytotoxic T-cell responses against
      different survivin epitopes in cancer patients underline the relevance of survivin-directed
      immunological trials. This study is comprised of a peptide vaccine with HLA-A1, -A2 and -B35
      restricted survivin epitopes in Montanide ISA-51 for patients with stage IV melanoma,
      advanced pancreatic, colon and cervical carcinoma. The vaccine is applicated as a deep
      subcutaneous injection. Vaccination is administered for the first 2 months weekly, afterwards
      every 4 weeks. Standard staging examinations are performed every three months. Clinical,
      laboratory and immunological monitoring is done every month.Diagnostic leucapheresis is
      performed before first vaccination and afterwards every 2 months.
