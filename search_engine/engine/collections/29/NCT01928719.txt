      reduce or eliminate nicotine dependence in low socioeconomic smokers, we will randomize
      smokers to either an Reduced Nicotine Content group with a gradual step-wise reduction in
      nicotine from 11 mg to 0.2 mg per cigarette in five 3-wk stages, or a control group with
      nicotine content similar to their preferred usual brand of cigarettes.

      Overall, we hypothesize that low socioeconomic smokers who switch to progressively lower
      nicotine cigarettes will initially alter their smoking behavior to compensate for lower
      nicotine until cigarette nicotine yields become so low that complete compensation becomes too
      difficult. At that point, smokers will either drop-out or continue to smoke the reduced
      nicotine content cigarettes but with incomplete compensatory behaviors.
