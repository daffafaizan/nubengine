      dependent or independent anemia at screening defined as an hemoglobin <10 g/dL with 10 mg BID
      starting dose with subsequent up titrations (maximum dose 25 mg BID) depending on safety and
      efficacy. This dosing approach for anemic MF patients will be systematically studied in this
      prospective multicenter phase II open label single arm trial to determine if the levels of
      spleen length reduction and symptom improvement are consistent with those reported in
      previous clinical trials with ruxolitinib in patients with anemia and doses according to
      platelet counts at the moment of treatment initiation, and whether this lower starting dose
      and up titration approach may minimize the initial hemoglobin and platelet declines and
      transfusion requirements.
