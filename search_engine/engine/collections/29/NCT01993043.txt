      laser or Bevacizumab. We will observe the patients in the hospital for the cure of ROP until
      54 weeks' postmenstrual age. We will check the changes of chemicals in the blood and observe
      short-term and long-term effects on visual system, brain and other body organs. Descriptive
      statistics from a two sample t-test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the short
      and long-term vision and neurological development outcomes. We predefined a statistical
      significance level p=0.05.
