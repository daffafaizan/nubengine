      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients with high-risk DLBCL typically have insufficient
      therapeutic outcomes. Therefore, the addition of novel agents to the currently used induction
      therapy (R-CHOP) is a rational approach to improve therapeutic outcomes in this disease
      setting.

      Based on pre-clinical and clinical observations, it is hypothesized that durvalumab will have
      activity in DLBCL because the PD 1/PD L1 pathway is involved in the pathophysiology of DLBCL.
      In particular, the addition of durvalumab may augment the anti-tumor activity of R-CHOP
      against high-risk DLBCL sub-types.

      The safety of durvalumab has already been explored. However, as there is limited clinical
      experience with durvalumab in DLBCL, the study is divided into two stages:

        -  A Safety Run-in Stage to evaluate the safety of the treatment combinations until at
           least 10 subjects are included in each of the two treatment arms

        -  An Expansion Stage to analyze the clinical activity of the treatment combinations

      Results posted following Primary Outcome Completion date are based on a database cut-off of
      August 2, 2018.
