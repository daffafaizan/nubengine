      suffered problems with the gross motor dysfunction and hand function disability. An inability
      to use the upper extremity in daily life can lead to loss of independence with ADLs and of
      important occupations (eg, school). Robotic therapy can deliver larger amounts of upper
      extremity movement practice for these individuals. Although the Robotic therapy appears to
      provide some benefit for upper extremity motor abilities and participation but is of
      uncertain utility for cerebral palsy(CP).

      Objective: To investigate the effects of robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha
      device on hand function and the participation of ADL for children with cerebral palsy(CP).

      Five children with CP aged 6 to 18 years were recruited and received 12times of
      robot-assisted hand rehabilitation for 6 weeks of treatment (Sixty minutes a time, twice a
      week). The performance was assessed by a assessor for three times (pre-test, post-test,
      follow up at one month). The outcome measures Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb
      section(FMA-UE),Box and block test(BBT), Maximal voluntary contraction(MVC) of extensor
      digitorum communis(EDC), Flexor digitorum(FD), grasp strength, & ABILHAND-Kids for ADL
      ability. Collected data will be analyzed with ANOVA test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha
      level was set at .05. Our hypothesis are robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha
      device has positive effects on hand function and the participation of ADL for children with
      CP.
