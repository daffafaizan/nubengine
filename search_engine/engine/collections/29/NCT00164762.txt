      resistance of HIV at two and six weeks postpartum in women who are participating in two
      different programs currently ongoing in Lilongwe, Malawi. The first program is through the
      HIV Infection and Breastfeeding: Interventions for Maternal and Infant Health, also known as
      the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals and Nutrition (BAN) Study, a clinical trial where all
      enrolled women receive zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (3TC) at the onset of labor and for up
      to seven days postpartum in addition to single-dose nevirapine (NVP). The second program is
      the Call to Action (CTA) program sponsored by the Malawi Ministry of Health and Population
      (MOHP) and UNC Project. The aim of the CTA program is to reduce mother to child transmission
      (MTCT) of HIV by providing women a single dose NVP to be taken at the onset of labor. Study
      participants are tested for NVP-resistant HIV at two and six weeks postpartum and the
      prevalence of NVP-resistant virus is compared among the two groups receiving different
      peripartum anti-retroviral regimens.
