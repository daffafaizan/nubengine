      cancer screening (CRCS) is effective, cost-effective and consistently recommended by clinical
      practice guidelines, only 57.3% of the adults over 50 years have been screened within the
      recommended interval. Preliminary research conducted by this PI demonstrates that
      approximately 90% of patients who have not had CRCS report that a doctors recommendation
      would motivate them to undergo screening. However, research also shows that physicians do not
      consistently recommend CRCS to each eligible patient. In this study the barriers of and
      facilitators to physician recommendation of CRCS are tested in the to proposed randomized
      controlled trial. The trial will pilot test an interactive, multifaceted, Web-based
      intervention (eToolbox) to increase primary care physician rates of CRCS. This application
      innovatively proposes to pilot test the eToolbox in the setting of the American Board of
      Internal Medicine (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification process within the Preventive Services
      Practice Improvement Module, a physician-directed measurement of their performance and
      quality improvement requirement for board re-certification.
