      will be evaluated in 20 patients with psoriatic arthritis, who have failed or have developed
      intolerable side-effects to at least one disease modifying antirheumatic drug including
      sulfasalazine, gold, methoxypsoralen and long wave ultraviolet A light (PUVA), retinoids,
      methotrexate or cyclosporin. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial patients will
      receive a four month course of intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day for 2-3 days every 4
      weeks for a total of four cycles) or placebo by a block randomization procedure to ensure
      groups balanced for disease activity. After a washout period of two months, the patients
      receiving placebo will have the option of crossing over to the fludarabine arm for an
      additional four months of treatment. Disease activity (both skin and joints) will be
      monitored throughout the study. At the end of the study, physician and patient assessment of
      disease activity as well as drug-related toxicities will be analyzed.
