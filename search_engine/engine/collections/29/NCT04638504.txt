      that it creates studies. Healthy Vascular Endothelial structure increases vascular tone by
      regulating nitric oxide (NO) release. Reduced nitric oxide production, reducing flexibility
      It has a facilitating effect on hypertensive diseases and other obstetric diseases.

      Endothelial function, which is a non-invasive, easily applicable, and reproducible method It
      can be detected by endothelium-dependent vasodilation. A good indicator of endothelial
      function in studies in which the brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) shown. Brachial
      artery blood pressure cuff at forearm level in normal healthy people with compression for 3-5
      minutes 50 mmHg above systolic pressure, 60-120 seconds after loosening the cuff When
      measured later, individuals with healthy endovascular function and the brachial artery are
      also reactive hyperemia, and a 10% dilatation is expected. Many obstetric effects such as
      obesity preeclampsia, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, preterm labor Although it was
      found to be related to pathology, the relationship between them could not be determined
      exactly.

      Our study aimed to increase brachial artery dilatation in obese and normal pregnant women.

      By comparing, determine the level of nitric oxide and endovascular function. Also uterine
      Vascular structures of obesity by comparing vascular structures with artery and umbilical
      uterine dops examine the effect on

      Pregnant women between the ages of 18-40 who apply to the Diseases and Obstetrics outpatient
      clinic will be taken. 24-28. Brachial artery dilatation, uterine, and umbilical artery
      doppler between 11-14, 37-40w weeks between gestational weeks, and visceral adipose tissue
      measurement at first trimester will be examined.
