      Triamcinolone hecacetonide (THA) has been used for local intraarticular injecton treatment
      for knee synovitis in decades, but no dose finding studies have been performed. In the
      literature the doses for knee injections vary between 20 mg and 80 mg, depending on local
      traditions.

      The aim of the present study is to find the optimal THA dosing, comparing the relapse rate
      during a 6 month observation period for the two most used dosages .

      Methods:

      Adult patients with RA or PsoA with treatment demands for ongoing knee synovitis are
      recruited at the Rheumatology Departments in GÃ¤vle and Falun. After informed consent patient
      characteristics,(age, sex, medical treatment), clinical and laboratory parameters of disease
      activity (DAS28, CRP), as well as degree of functional impairment (HAQ) are collected. A
      radiographic examination of the knee is performed and assessed (using Larsen Dale index) by
      an independent radiologist. The patients are allocated to either 20 mg or 40 mg THA using the
      randomisation dose which is hidden in prepared closed envelopes. After complete synovial
      fluid aspiration the THA dose is injected . The patients are told to contact the rheumatology
      department if no treatment response or if symtoms from the treated knee recurr. If so, the
      knee is examined again and if synovitis is confirmed a relapse is registered. Time from
      injection to relapse is calculated. Patients without relapse are called after 6 months to
      confirm they still are well and that no unknown relapse have occurred. When the observation
      period for the last included patient is finished the relapse rate between the 20 mg THA group
      is compared with the 40 mg THA Group.
