      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), dexelvucitabine (DFC) 200 mg once daily, to an
      approved NRTI, lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg once daily in treatment experienced patients with HIV
      that is resistant to 3 classes of antiretroviral therapies (NRTIs, PIs and NNRTIs). Patients
      meeting eligibility requirements will have a new 'optimized' background regimen (OBR)
      selected for them based on prior treatment history, and results of HIV genotype and phenotype
      performed during screening. In addition to the OBR patients will be randomized to receive at
      at one to one ratio DFC or 3TC in a blinded fashion. The OBR may include any approved HIV
      treatments except 3TC, FTC, ddI, d4T and ddC. Medications available through expanded access
      may also be available to selected patients. Treatment in the study will continue for up to 96
      weeks with primary endpoints at 24 and 48 weeks of therapy. Patients with an inadequate
      response to therapy after 16 weeks will have the option to change their OBR and the option to
      switch study medication (DFC to 3TC or 3TC to DFC). A total of 250 patients will be enrolled.
