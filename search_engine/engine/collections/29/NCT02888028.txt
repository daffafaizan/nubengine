      device-related workload, e.g. regular in-office follow-ups (FU). New means of ICD FU
      strategies are necessary to handle the increasing burden. ICD remote monitoring promises a
      time- and cost efficient alternative to conventional in-office FU strategies. Many studies
      have already shown benefits on FU burden reduction, on saving of costs and time, and recently
      on total mortality. The impact of remote ICD FU on Quality of life, anxiety and depression
      levels and device acceptance is still under discussion. The aim of this trial is to
      investigate the influence of additional remote ICD surveillance on the primary endpoint
      health related quality of life (HRQoL), further on levels of anxiety and depression and on
      device acceptance.
