      with cancer. Current surveys show that about 30-80% of patients with cancer have nutritional
      risk and/or malnutrition, and about 20% of the patients' death are directly caused by
      malnutrition. Appropriate and standardized nutrition therapy might not only improve the
      nutritional status, but also the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer, and improve their
      life quality and dignity.

      At present, there is still lack of large-scale investigation and research on nutritional
      status and dietary intakes in discharged patients with cancer in China, and thus affects the
      overall level of nutritional management for cancer patients, as well as the formation of
      related guideline.

      Therefore, we will conduct a national-wide cross-sectional online survey, which aim to
      investigate relevant data of nutritional status and dietary intakes among discharged patients
      with cancer. Data will be collected through an online semi-structured questionnaire using
      WeChat forms with a consent form. The link to the questionnaire was sent through emails,
      WeChat App groups, and other social media. The participants were encouraged to roll out the
      survey, and send the link to more patients as they could. On receiving and clicking the link,
      the participants will be directed to the information about the study and informed consent.
      After they accept to take the survey, they will fill up the demographic details and answer a
      set of questions related to nutritional status and dietary intake investigation.
