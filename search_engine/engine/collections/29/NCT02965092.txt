      recognize tumor associated antigen and kill tumor cells specifically. CAR-T therapy showed
      great effect on patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies. CAR consists of
      single chain variable fragment (scFv) and activation domain of T cell. In preclinical study,
      the researchers constructed a second generation CAR containing CD137 costimulatory domain.
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in patients
      with relapsed or refractory B cell Malignancies.
