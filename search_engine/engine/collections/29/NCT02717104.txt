      lesions in femoropopliteal arteries. All subjects meeting protocol criteria will be treated
      with the LUTONIX Drug Coated Balloon Catheter for approved indications according to the
      current Instructions for Use (IFU) and followed clinically for 2 years.

      Total enrollment will be approximately 250 subjects at up to 18 sites. Subject follow-up will
      occur at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. The primary efficacy endpoint is freedom from target lesion
      revascularization at 12 months.

      The primary safety endpoint is freedom at 30 days from the composite endpoint of target
      vessel revascularization and target lesion revascularization, major amputation and major
      reintervention of index limb, and device- and procedure-related death.
