      either with a magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreaticography (MRCP) prior to gallbladder
      removal or with an intraoperative cholangiography during cholecystectomy. When detecting an
      common bile duct (CBD) stone in MRCP, normally endoscopic removal is performed before an
      operation. When the CBD stone is detected during gallbladder removal instead, endoscopic
      retrograde cannulation of the pancreatic duct (ERCP) will follow after the operation.
      Investigators hypothesize that direct operation shortens the length of hospital stay.
      Therefore investigators randomize patients with elevated Bilirubin, elevated liver enzymes
      (two of the following: aspartate transaminase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT),
      gamma-glutamyltransferase (gGT) or AP), suspected CBD stones in ultrasound or dilated common
      bile ducts either in MRCP first or operation first pathway. All data (patient admission to
      discharge, ...) will be entered in an online database
