    
      Objective

      To evaluate the effectiveness of the high fidelity simulation for learning related to the
      drug preparation and administration process in the scenario of critical patient care in the
      cognitive, psychomotor and affective domains for undergraduate students of the nursing
      course.

      Hypothesis of the study

      Null hypothesis

      There will be no difference between learning through high fidelity simulation and traditional
      teaching / low fidelity simulation.

      Alternative hypothesis

      The high fidelity simulation strategy improves the performance of nursing students in drug
      administration more significantly when compared to traditional teaching / low fidelity
      simulation.
