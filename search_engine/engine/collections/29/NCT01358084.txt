      of a pemetrexed-based chemotherapy, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of
      approximately 6 months.However, the median time from completion of first-line treatment to
      initiation of second-line therapy is approximately 3 months. Recent experiences in non-small
      cell lung cancer patients have shown that a maintenance treatment given immediately after
      first-line treatment regimens can improve PFS and survival. Considering the toxicity profile
      of NGR-hTNF characterized by mild-to-moderate constitutional symptoms registered in a phase
      II trial in previously treated MPM patients, as well as the disease control observed in about
      half of the patients and maintained for more than four months and more than nine months in
      the triweekly and weekly cohorts, respectively, seems justified to compare in a randomized
      phase II trial the time-related efficacy of NGR-hTNF against placebo in advanced MPM patients
      who did not progress after six cycles of a standard pemetrexed-based treatment.
