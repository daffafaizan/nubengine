      thromboembolism, already anticoagulated with any DOAC or patients who initiate therapy with
      DOAC and who give their consent. Upon entering the study, demographic data, previous
      anticoagulant treatments, previous serious complications, comorbidities and baseline
      analytical results are recorded. The risk scores CHA2DS2-Vasc, HAS-BLED and Charlson
      comorbidity index (CCI) are calculated. The type of health education received in relation to
      anticoagulant therapy is also recorded. During the follow-up, complications and clinical
      changes and the analytical results of coagulation, renal and hepatic function will be
      recorded. The risk scores will be updated at each visit. In case of serious complications,
      the associated costs will be estimated.
