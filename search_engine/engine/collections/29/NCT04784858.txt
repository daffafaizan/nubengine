      programs, there are few "evidence-based" parenting interventions tailored to the needs of the
      population. This study will address this limitation in current parenting intervention
      research by exploring if Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch Up (ABC) is well suited and
      feasible to implement within integrated maternal substance use outpatient treatment. ABC is
      10-week evidence-based parenting intervention for parents who live in the context of complex
      risk, including mental health, addictions, child welfare involvement, and poverty.
      Investigators of this study will complete a research integrated-training process involving
      active implementation of ABC that will involve 1. Evaluation of the year-long implementation
      and training process and 2. evaluation of maternal mental health, substance use and parenting
      outcomes from beginning to end of treatment. Results of this mixed method pilot study will
      inform the planning for a larger multi-site trial with a control group.
