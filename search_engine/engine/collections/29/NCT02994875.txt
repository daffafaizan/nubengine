      using fMRI) of short-term N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration among methadone-maintained
      individuals with cocaine dependence. Specifically, this application proposes to conduct a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study to examine the effects
      of 7-day NAC administration (2400mg/day) on the neural networks engaged during response
      inhibition (Go/No-Go task) and affective (emotion-regulation task) processes among
      cocaine-dependent, methadone-maintained individuals (n=40; 20 per treatment-order condition).
