      common side effects of the use of atropine eye drop are dilation of pupil and decrease of
      accommodation. The investigators wish to evaluate the ocular responses of three low
      concentration atropine eye drops, 0.01% or 0.02% or 0.03%, mainly on the pupillary size and
      accommodative responses in children aged between 6 to 12 years old over two-week usage.
