    
      Primary Objective

      -To evaluate the safety and tolerability of weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of MORAb-066.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and to determine the maximum tolerated
           dose (MTD) of MORAb-066.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MORAb-066.

        -  To identify, on the basis of safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PDx) data, a recommended
           Phase II dose and schedule for MORAb-066.

        -  To make a preliminary assessment of the antitumor activity of MORAb-066.

        -  T

        -  To detect any antibody response (i.e., human antihuman antibodies [HAHA]) to multiple IV
           infusions to MORAb-066.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To evaluate the presence of tissue factor (TF) substrates such as protease activated
           receptor 2 when applicable.

        -  To evaluate the archived tumor tissue for TF overexpression by immunohistochemistry.

        -  To evaluate whether there are potential biomarkers that correlate responses to
           MORAb-066.
