    
      This is an open-label, single arm, first-in-human, Phase I study of intravenous
      administration of PTX-35 to patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible
      for, or who refuse available SOC. Five escalating dose levels of PTX-35 will be explored
      using a traditional 3+3 design based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) until optimal
      immunological dose (OID) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established.
