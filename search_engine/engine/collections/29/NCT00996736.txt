      has only been a single randomized trial of anti-fungal therapy for mycotic keratitis, and no
      new ocular anti-fungal medications have been approved by the FDA since the 1960s. The
      triazole voriconazole has recently become the treatment of choice for systemic fungal
      infections such as pulmonary aspergillosis. The use of topical ophthalmic preparations of
      voriconazole has been described in numerous case reports, however there has been no
      systematic attempt to determine whether it is more or less clinically effective than
      natamycin. Additionally, there have been many case reports of the use of oral voriconazole in
      the treatment of fungal corneal ulcers, however there has been no systematic attempt to
      determine if it improves outcomes in severe ulcers.

      This study is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial to determine if the use
      natamycin or voriconazole results in better outcomes for fungal corneal ulcers. 368 fungal
      corneal ulcers with baseline visual acuity between 6/12 (20/40, logMAR 0.3) and 6/120
      (20/400, logMAR 1.3) presenting to the Aravind Eye Hospitals and the UCSF Proctor Foundation
      will be randomized to receive either topical natamycin or topical voriconazole. The primary
      outcome is best spectacle-corrected logMAR visual acuity three months after enrollment, using
      best spectacle-corrected enrollment visual acuity as a co-variate.
