      patients with Tourette's syndrome and chronic motor tic disorder using [15O]H2O. Previous
      neuroimaging studies have looked at brain activity during tics using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET), but a major drawback of
      these studies lay in the difficulty distinguishing between the activity in the brain
      responsible for tic generation versus activity in motor-related structures due to tic
      movements. We plan to overcome this difficulty in our paradigm using two rest conditions
      without any movement. One is a state when patients suppress their tics and the second is
      sleep state, when tics usually cease or are at least very infrequent. 23 adult patients with
      a DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 2000) diagnosis of a tic disorder and frequent
      tics will be studied. These two rest states will be compared with a condition where tics are
      allowed to occur spontaneously. The differential activation of brain areas between these
      three conditions should help to elucidate/define the regions of the brain responsible for
      generation of tics.
