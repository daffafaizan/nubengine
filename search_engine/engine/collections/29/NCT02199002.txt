      clipped to the Z-line. Patients then will be given a standardized meal and the position of
      the acid pocket will be measured. After two hours the pocket will be aspirated through a
      gastric catheter. Then, patients will be allowed to return home and the study will be
      continued for another 22 hours.

      The special catheter will be removed at the end of the study. Collected acid pockets will be
      used to analyze content and perform permeability experiments.

      Data of the 24-hour experiment will be used to evaluate the position of the acid pocket and
      number of reflux episodes.
