    
      The study was conducted as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study on clarithromycin formulations
      comparing clarithromycin 250 mg/5 mL powder for oral suspension of Ranbaxy Laboratories with
      BiaxinÂ® granules 250 mg/5 mL oral suspension (containing clarithromycin 250 mg/5mL) of Abbott
      Laboratories in healthy, adult, human, male subjects under fasting conditions.

      A single oral dose of clarithromycin 250-mg/5 mL was administered during each period of the
      study under supervision of a trained Medical Officer.

      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, twelve-lead ECG,
      clinical examination, medical history, clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology,
      biochemical parameters and urine analysis) at base line and hematology and biochemical
      parameters at 24 hours post dose of the last period of the study. Twelve-lead ECG was
      recorded at 4 and 8 hours post-dose in each period.

      A Validated analytical method was used for the analysis of Clarithromycin in human plasma.
      Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis was performed to conclude the bioequivalence.
