      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles and higher miscarriage rate.

      The effectiveness of micro nutrients (PROfortil™) has been proven in improving sperm quality
      including sperm cell density, progressive motility and normal morphology.

      This randomized controlled trial includes male from infertile couples treated at the Center
      for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Hue University hospital, Vietnam from
      November 2019 to November 2020.

      The semen samples were collected from the husband after 3-5 days of abstinence and then
      evaluated for sperm motility, vitality, concentration and morphology by the guideline of
      World Health Organization (WHO) 2010.

      Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) was measured using a sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) test
      (Halosperm® kit, Halotech, Madrid, Spain). A total of 500 sperms were examined by only one
      highly trained technician to decrease variability. DFI was expressed as the percentage of
      sperms with small halo, without halo and degraded sperms over total of 500 sperms.

      Any case with high DNA fragmentation index (DFI >=30%) will be randomized indicated for
      (group 1) micro nutrient supplement (PROfortil™, twice daily) plus Vitamin E (Enat 400, once
      per day) in 3 months and (group 2) only Vitamin E (Enat 400 once per day) then checked again
      post-treatment for (DFI).

      The IVF/ICSI cycles will then be analyzed for embryo quality, pregnancy outcomes including
      biochemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, on-going pregnancy, miscarriage.
