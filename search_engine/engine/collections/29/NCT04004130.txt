      low (some articles reporting as low as 50% (unsuccessful LPs including dry taps and traumatic
      taps)).

      Firstly, the investigators would like to set a normal range of CSF:spine ratio (representing
      the amount of CSF at the expected level of LP) based on the measurements in neonates of
      different gestational age and postnatal age with assessing ventricular index (VI) on cranial
      US.

      In the next phase of the study the investigators plan to assess the subarachnoidal
      space/amount of CSF of those neonates whom need LP performed. The investigators hypothise to
      be able to create an ultrasound measurement index/number that would be able to predict
      unsuccessful LPs.
