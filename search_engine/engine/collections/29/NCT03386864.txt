      (FFA) are predictors of heart failure, the leading cause of mortality in patients suffering
      from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Epidemiological data suggest that diabetic
      cardiomyopathy (DC) presents as ventricular dysfunction in patients with T2DM independent of
      coronary artery disease. The underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Reduced
      mitochondrial activity and insulin resistance of skeletal muscle relates to liver steatosis,
      possibly due to higher substrate flux to the liver. High oxidation rates in the liver result
      in oxidative stress, damage of mitochondria and apoptosis. The investigators hypothesize that
      (i) HCL and impaired liver energy metabolism correlate with ventricular dysfunction, (ii)
      impaired glucose uptake and mitochondrial capacity in skeletal muscle relates to enhanced
      oxidative capacity, oxidative stress and lipid deposition in heart tissue (iii) reduced
      myocardial oxidative capacity limits recovery of myocardial function in patients with acute
      heart failure.

      The investigators aim to assess (i) liver energy metabolism and heart function, (ii)
      respiration and lipid metabolites in skeletal muscle and heart tissue in humans with advanced
      heart failure and (iii) the prognostic impact of these factors in humans with acute heart
      failure.

      This study will improve the understanding of mechanisms underlying the development of DC and
      the identification of patients at risk for poor outcome in heart failure.
