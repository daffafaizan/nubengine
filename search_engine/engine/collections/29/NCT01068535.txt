        -  Screening visit, which includes a quick finger stick cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides
           test (cholestech) to determine qualification, waist measurement, weight. Results are
           provided regardless of qualification. If the volunteer qualifies, a full blood draw
           (approximately 45cc or 3 Tablespoons) will occur. A snack is provided once blood is
           drawn. Additional study visit procedures include a medical history questionnaire
           including menstrual history, height & weight measurement, vital signs, and waist & hip
           measurements. This study lasts up to 90 minutes.

        -  MRI visit (to occur within a week of screening visit) occurs once serum pregnancy &
           creatinine results are received & only if approved to continue by P.I. (e.g. negative
           serum pregnancy and eGFR>60). An IV catheter is placed in the antecubital vein to
           administer an injection of (gadolinium) contrast medium. A coil is placed on each side
           of the subject's neck while laying flat on a bench, with her upper body inside the MRI
           scanner. The entire MRI procedure takes approximately 60 minutes.
