        -  Compare the pathological complete response rate at total mesorectal excision in patients
           with high-risk rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy comprising oxaliplatin,
           capecitabine, and radiotherapy with or without cetuximab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center and presence of T4 disease (yes vs no). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I:

             -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1,
                22, 43, and 64 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14, 22-35, 43-56, and
                64-77.

             -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days
                85-89, 92-96, 99-103, 106-110, 113-117, and 120-124 and receive oral capecitabine
                twice daily on days 85-126.

             -  Surgery: Four to six weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo
                total mesorectal excision (TME).

             -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 6-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin
                IV over 2 hours on days 1, 22, 43, and 64 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days
                1-14, 22-35, 43-56, and 64-77.

        -  Arm II:

             -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive oxaliplatin and capecitabine as in arm I
                neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29,
                36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78.

             -  Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy and receive
                capecitabine as in arm I neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab IV over 1 hour
                on days 85, 92, 99, 106, 113, and 120.

             -  Surgery: Four to six weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy patients undergo
                TME as in arm I.

             -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 6-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin
                and capecitabine as in arm I adjuvant chemotherapy and cetuximab IV over 1 hour on
                days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 164 patients will be accrued for this study.
