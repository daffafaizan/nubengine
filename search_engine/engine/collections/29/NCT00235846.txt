      in wound complications among 30% of the patients. Endoscopic harvesting decrease the
      complication rate, but it remains to be shown whether this is also a fact among patient in
      whom only short segments of veingraft material is needed from the leg. We hypothesise that
      the rate of wound complications will be reduced and the patient satisfaction will be
      increased also among patients in whom only short vein segments are endoscopically harvested
      compared to conventional open vein harvesting.

      Preoperative demographic as well ass peri- and postoperative data are collected prospectively
      at 5-7 days and 1 month postoperatively. Wound complications are registered as well as post
      operative pain in the wound is evaluated using af visual analogue scale. Patients are
      evaluating the cosmetic results after wound healing.
