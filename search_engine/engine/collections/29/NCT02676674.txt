      purpose of this Phase 1 trial is to determine whether topical application makes Vitamin D
      bioavailable to the systemic circulation in sufficient quantities to treat hypovitaminosis D.
      The study will assess the change in serum 25-hydroxy (25-OH) vitamin D concentrations
      following 3 doses of 100,000 IU or 3 doses of 300,000 IU of topical vitamin D3 ointment in
      volunteers with vitamin D deficiency. Adults with serum 25-OH vitamin D concentrations of <
      20 ng/ml will receive a total of 300,000 IU or 900,000 IU in divided doses of topical vitamin
      D once per week for three weeks. Two 0.75 ml applicators of ointment will be applied to each
      upper arm (50,000 IU or 150,000 IU per arm) by study staff. Blood will be drawn at baseline
      prior to the first dose (Day 0) and on Days 7, 14, and 21. Total serum 25-OH vitamin D will
      be assayed at each draw. Parathyroid hormone, a measure of clinical effects of low vitamin D
      levels, will be checked at baseline and on day 21. Serum albumin adjusted calcium levels will
      be checked with each draw to check for possible effects of too much vitamin D absorption. The
      study will determine whether the topical application of Vitamin D ointment is able to correct
      existing vitamin D deficiency.
