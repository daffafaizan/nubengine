      the study, 14 subjects will be recruited for the Clinically Stable Cohort. Subjects will be
      asked to provide 1 gm of expectorated sputum and 40-ml of blood. A cell count and
      differential will be performed on the sputum followed by analysis for IL-17 PMNs by
      fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). IL-17 PMNs also will be isolated by running the
      remainder of the cell pellet through a column of magnetic beads designed for this purpose.
      These neutrophils will be lysed and intracellular cytokines determined. Sputum supernatants
      will be stored frozen until analyzed for the presence of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, TGF-β,
      TNF-α, and neutrophil elastase. Clinical data will be captured from the subject's clinical
      outpatient visit including lung function measures and clinical culture results. IL-17 PMNs
      will be correlated with lung function measures and inflammatory mediators at baseline.

      In the second part of this study, 10 subjects will be recruited for the Exacerbation Cohort.
      Subjects will provide at least 1 gram of expectorated sputum and 40-ml of blood within 72
      hours of hospital admission. Sputum and blood will be processed and analyzed as described
      above. Sputum and blood also will be obtained at the end of treatment (within 72 hours of
      completion of IV antibiotics) when the subject is at his or her baseline as determined by the
      managing physician. Clinical data will be captured from the subject's hospitalization records
      including lung function measures and clinical culture results.
