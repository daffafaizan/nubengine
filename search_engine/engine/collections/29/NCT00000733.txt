      that ribavirin appears to inhibit the spread of the virus. Determination of how much and how
      often to give the drug will require further knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of
      the drug in patients with AIDS or ARC and in chronic virus carriers who do not have symptoms.

      Ribavirin is given to HIV-infected patients intravenously as a timed 30-min infusion at 1 of
      5 single doses; 2 weeks later, the same doses are given orally in a single dose. Following at
      least 2 additional weeks, 6 patients are then given ribavirin at the lowest dose twice a day
      for 16 weeks. They are evaluated for tolerance and the next group is given a higher dose.
      Each successive group begins at 3-week intervals to receive doses that increase each day
      until the MTD is reached. Blood samples taken periodically during the treatment period and
      for 8 weeks after treatment is stopped are used to measure blood levels of ribavirin and to
      determine the effects of ribavirin on the HIV and immune system of the patients.
