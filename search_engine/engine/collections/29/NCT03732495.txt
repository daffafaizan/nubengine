      thermo-ablation) in case of symptomatic lesions or at high risk of local complications. They
      also usually receive systemic bone-directed agents (bisphosphonate or denosumab), despite
      sparse available data in the context of differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC). As
      bone-directed agents have no antitumor activity, patients may require additional treatments.
      To date, only sorafenib and lenvatinib have been approved in the treatment of advanced
      Radioiodine Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Carcinomas (RR-DTC).

      Lenvatinib demonstrated efficacy in RR-DTC compared to placebo. While other kinase inhibitors
      appeared to be less effective in controlling bone metastatic disease compared to other soft
      tissue sites, lenvatinib showed, in a small number of patients, significant decrease in bone
      tumors size.

      Even if both study drugs are indicated in the treatment of patients suffering from RR-DTC
      with bone metastases, it is of essential importance to confirm that lenvatinib can provide
      clinical benefit and antitumor activity when combined with denosumab in this population.
