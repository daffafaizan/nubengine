    
      This is a Phase 1 platform protocol designed to evaluate various targeted agents for the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Each study arm will
      be conducted in a predefined disease subset. All study arms are open label and allocation to
      each study arm will not be randomized.

      As this master platform protocol has multiple study arms, subjects can be screened for
      several study arms at once. Likewise, a subject who ends participation in one study arm may
      be rescreened for participation in another (separate) study arm.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of targeted agents for the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). This protocol has a
      modular design, with the potential for future treatment arms to be added via protocol
      amendment.
