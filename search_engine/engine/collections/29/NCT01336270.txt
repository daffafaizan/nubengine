      cutaneous metastasis ( fresh samples) Part 2: NK cells study on metastatic regional lymph
      nodes ( fresh samples) and blood samples Part 3: a retrospective study of macrophages in
      sentinel lymph nodes and in corresponding primary melanomas Part 4: study of the cellular
      modulation by the chemotherapy (DTIC or cisplatin or inhibitor of B-raf) which(who) will be
