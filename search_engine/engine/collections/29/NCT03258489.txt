      include assessment of autonomic balance, blood pressure, and blood collection
      (catecholamines). Interventions (placebo, low frequency TENS and IES) will be randomized.
      Volunteers will be accommodated in the supine position. With properly sanitized skin (70%
      alcohol) and self-adhesive electrodes (5x5 area) will be positioned in the cervical
      paravertebral region. All participants will be submitted to a placebo TENS session, a low
      frequency TENS session (TENS, 10 Hz/200μs) and an IES session (STEIN et al., 2012). The
      sessions will take place in the morning in a 12-hour fast, lasting 30 minutes, in an
      air-conditioned place (23ºC).
