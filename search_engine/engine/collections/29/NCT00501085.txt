      and effectiveness of the LAP-BAND AP System in a real-life clinical setting. Effectiveness
      was assessed through the collection of weight loss data, as well as other secondary
      effectiveness measurements. Safety was assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse
      events (AEs) related to treatment.
