      hypertension. The molecule contains one chiral carbon atom and exists as a racemic mixture.
      As only the S-enantiomer of amlodipine [S-amlodipine] shows the CCB effect and R-amlodipine
      is responsible for the development of peripheral edema, purifying S-amlodipine can reduce the
      incidences of peripheral edema and other side effects.
