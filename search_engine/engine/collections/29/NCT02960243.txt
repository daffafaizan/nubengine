      5% of individuals over the age of 65. Of this 5%, roughly 20% of these patients suffer from
      Essential Voice Tremor (EVT): the phonatory manifestation of ET. Patients with EVT lose their
      ability to speak due to a tremor in the muscles of the larynx, pharynx, palate, and tongue.
      Because of this, an individual's quality of life is limited because they can no longer
      communicate effectively.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify to what degree Deep Brain Stimulation improves
      Essential Voice Tremor. In addition to this, we hope to examine which brain hemisphere is
      responsible for these positive results: right, left, or both, in a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded manner. By finding out more about the subcortical control underpinning speech,
      we will be able to improve our treatments and understanding of EVT and other neurological
      speech disorders.
