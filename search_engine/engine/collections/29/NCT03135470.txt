      period are given a letter interview for pain, pain medication and symptom follow up. They are
      also given a return envelope (with paid postal fee) to return the interview.

      Based on the results of the first interview phase, our pain medication practice is
      reconsidered by anesthetists and surgeons to create a standard operating protocol for pain
      medication. The standard operating protocol is informed to personnel. Then, patient interview
      phase is repeated for another 3 months.

      Then, investigators continue with a pilot study on using a mobile phone app in evaluating
      patients pain, sufficient pain medication and adverse effects. All patient with informed
      consent, suitable mobile phone, and willing to use it for reporting pain for hospital
      personnel are contacted via the mobile app. Other patients operated during that study period
      are interviewed by either letter interview or phone interview. Investigators try to estimate
      whether mobile apps are suitable for pain and medication follow-up.
