      referred as CRTH258-C002), were eligible to participate in the extension trial provided the
      core trial Visit 26 at week 96, was less than or equal to 12 weeks from the Baseline Visit in
      the extension trial, CRTH258A2301E1.

      Subjects who were treated with aflibercept during the core trial and met the eligibility
      requirements of this extension trial continued to receive aflibercept in this extension trial
      in order to maintain the masking during the extension trial. No hypothesis testing or
      descriptive analyses were planned.

      Subjects who were treated in the core trial with brolucizumab 3mg or brolucizumab 6 mg, and
      met the eligibility requirements of this extension trial, received the new formulation of
      brolucizumab 6 mg solution in the extension trial.

      Enrolled subjects were to receive three intravitreal (IVT) ophthalmic injections. The study
      eye was the same eye that received the treatment in the core study. The extension trial
      consisted of 7 study visits at 4 week intervals over a period of 24 weeks.

      Assessment of the efficacy and safety of brolucizumab 6 mg was based on a within-patient
      comparison with the last 6 months of corresponding core-study efficacy and safety data
      serving as the reference. Neither the patient selection process nor expected sample sizes
      supported a valid comparison between aflibercept and brolucizumab. The aflibercept arm was
      included only to maintain the masking in the extension trial. Data was presented
      descriptively for only brolucizumab in line with the study objective. No formal hypothesis
      testing was planned.
