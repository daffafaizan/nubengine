      Besides family history, and connective tissue diseases, the sudden increase in abdominal
      pressure as heavy lifting, chronic constipation , coughing, straining , situations such as
      difficulty urinating facilitate the formation and emergence of hernia.

      Constipation severity scale(CSS) was developed by Varma et al in 2008. CSS is a scale to
      determine the individuals defecation frequency, the intensity and difficulty during
      defecation.CSS has three subscales including Pain, Congestion stool and Large Intestine
      laziness(0-73 points).High scores indicate that serious symptoms.

      Investigators found no studies that show how constipation impact on groin hernias.
      Investigators are planning to understand the effect of constipation on direct and indirect
      hernia formation.
