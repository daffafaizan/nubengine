      cancer types and are found in the blood of cancer patients as single CTCs and CTC clusters,
      with the latter featuring a higher ability to seed metastasis.

      CTC cluster share several properties that commonly feature stem cell biology which drive
      metastases formation. Preclinical data shows that CTC clusters can be disaggregated into
      single cells by the treatment with cardiac glycosides such as digoxin. This single arm
      therapeutic exploratory study of digoxin in patients with advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer investigates whether cardiac glycosides are able to disrupt CTC clusters in breast
      cancer patients.

      Patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer in whom CTC clusters could be identified
      will receive an individualized daily maintenance dose of digoxin adapted to their kidney
      function. Blood samples for analyses of digoxin serum level and mean CTC cluster size will be
      drawn at specified time points.
