      development of insulin resistance. The insulin resistence is associated with a progression of
      fibrosis and the development of steatosis. The insulin resistence is frecuently associated
      with very difficult to cure patients as cirrhotics, afro-american patients, overweight
      patients and co-infected HCV-HIV patients. Recently is repported that sustained virological
      (SVR) response in genotype 1 patients is different according the insulin resistance. The SVR
      was 60% in patients without insulin resistance versus 20% in patients with strong insulin
      resistance (HOMA > 4.

      The present trial desire to analyze the effect that the treatment of insulin resistance
      produce in higher range of RVS.
