      To determine the frequency of Fabry disease in an unselected group of young patients (18 - 55
      years of age) with acute cerebrovascular event (CVE)

      Fabry disease and stroke:

      Rolfs and co-workers have shown a high frequency of Fabry disease in a cohort of patients
      with cryptogenic stroke (4 % [28/721]) aged between 18 and 55 years. This corresponds to
      about 1.2 % in the general population of young stroke patients. Therefore the authors stated
      that Fabry disease must be considered in all cases of unexplained stroke in young patients,
      especially in cases with the combination of infarction in the vertebrobasilar artery system
      and proteinuria.

      Cryptogenic strokes are cerebrovascular lesions of unknown origin. Clinical and laboratory
      data show that Fabry disease is itself a risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis and
      cardiac and renal disease, which can lead to emboli and hypertension. The pilot-phase started
      April 2007; the official study started January 2008.
