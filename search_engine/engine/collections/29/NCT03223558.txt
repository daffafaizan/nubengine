      participants randomly allocated to one of two groups: an early CR group starting exercise
      after 2 weeks, and a usual care group starting at 6 weeks. It will also collect information
      on the financial cost of earlier CR to both the health service and the patients.

      All primary and secondary outcome measures will be taken at baseline (1 week) and repeated at
      the start and end of 8 weeks exercise rehabilitation program (2 and 10 weeks from baseline
      for the early group, 6 and 14 weeks in the usual care group respectively) and at 12 months
      follow-up.
