      effect in suppressing airway inflammation and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in elite
      athletes and asthmatic individuals. Purified fish oil and the marine lipid fraction PCSO-524™
      (Lyprinol™) have both been used in supplementation studies in asthma [2, 10, 11]. While fish
      oil is a rich source of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Lyprinol® is a patented extract of stabilized lipids from the New
      Zealand green-lipped mussel, Perna canaliculus, combined with olive oil and vitamin E. EPA
      and DHA are the main ingredients of fish oil, and thus there will be similarities between
      Lyprinol and fish oil in terms of mechanism of action. Thus, we are aiming to show that
      Lyprinol® can modulate these inflammatory eicosanoids to exert anti-inflammatory effects.
