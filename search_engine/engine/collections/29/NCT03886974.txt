      emerging adults, parents, and healthcare providers who have or currently are involved in the
      transition process in T1D. Although, a few previous studies have focused on exploring these
      aspects of the transition process, these have mostly been at a regional level focusing on a
      few clinics instead of an attempt to capture responses at a national level. Additionally, as
      part of this study, each responding stakeholder participant will be requested to invite other
      other stakeholder group members who they might know to complete the questionnaire (e.g. a T1D
      patient sharing study information with their parents and their endocrinologist). This would
      allow the investigators to get a comprehensive picture of the transition process. The study
      consists of three phases including an online questionnaire (specific to each stakeholder
      group) (Phase 1), semi-structured phone interviews with a few participants from each
      stakeholder participant group (Phase 2), and subsequently, developing recommendations for a
      transition process that aligns the needs and expectations of the various stakeholder groups
      (Phase 3).

      This project has the potential to highlight T1D patients', their families, and providers'
      concerns and expectations regarding the transition process from a national sample which,
      could help develop recommendations to implement a patient-centered, successful transition
      process for emerging adults with T1D.

      Specific aims:

      Phase 1: To explore needs, expectations, and experiences of emerging adults with T1D, their
      parents, and healthcare providers around the transition process.

      Phase 2: To conduct semi-structured interviews with participants from three stakeholder
      groups for in-depth understanding of the issues related to the transition process

      Phase 3: To develop recommendations for a patient-centered transition process for emerging
      adults with T1D
