      mmHg or mean arterial pressure in the range of 50-65 mmHg. Pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological methods can be used to achieve controlled hypotension. Intravenous
      anesthetics, inhalation anesthetics, opioids, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers,
      nitrate derivatives are frequently used drugs for this purpose.

      General anesthesia maintenance is applied in two ways: total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)
      and inhalation anesthesia. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs used
      in both methods are quite different.

      Products of the body's oxidant antioxidant balance can be measured by biochemical methods and
      information about this balance can be obtained. Thiols are the regions of proteins most
      susceptible to oxidation, and the conversion of thiols to disulfides and oxyacids is the
      earliest marker of radical-mediated protein oxidation.

      Total antioxidant status (TAS) shows the total effect of all antioxidants in the human body
      and total oxidant status (TOS) shows the total effect of oxidants.

      In this study, it was aimed to investigate and compare the effects of inhalation anesthesia
      using sevoflurane and total intravenous anesthesia using propofol on oxidative stress in
      rhinoplasty cases under controlled hypotension. This assessment was planned using TAS (total
      antioxidant status), TOS (total oxidant status), Catalase, Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Total
      Thiol, Native Thiol and Disulfide parameters.
