    
      This is a placebo-controlled, double blind, randomized, single center, human clinical trial
      aimed at assessing the influence of probiotics on skin health in healthy female subjects,
      when administered in a food matrix over a period of 5 months.

      It will consist of five groups(40 subjects/group). The first group (1) of subjects will
      receive acidified milk that does not contain bacterial strains. The second group (2) will
      receive acidified milk that contains one specific probiotic strain. The third group (3) will
      receive fermented milk that contains a standard mix of yogurt bacterial strains. The fourth
      group (4) will receive fermented milk, containing the same standard mix of yogurt bacterial
      strains as in group 3 plus the same specific probiotic strain as in group 2. Finally, the
      fifth group (5) will receive fermented milk, containing the same standard mix of yogurt
      bacterial strains as in group 3 and 4 plus the same specific probiotic strain as in group 2
      and 4 plus a mix of antioxidants.

      This study will address whether:

      A.The bioefficacy of a specific probiotic strain is influenced by a milk matrix.

      B.Whether other bacterial strains impact the bioefficacy of this specific probiotic strain,
      and validate whether or not the bioefficacy is related entirely to the activity of this
      specific probiotic strain.

      C.Whether nutritional supplements impact the bioefficacy of a specific probiotic strain.
