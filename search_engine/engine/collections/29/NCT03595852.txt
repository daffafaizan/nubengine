      in clean, non-prosthetic, elective procedures. The intervention will be a single dose of
      prophylactic antibiotic (cefazolin): 2 gr in adults or 3 gr for patients weighing >120Kg and
      30mg/kg in children) within 30-60 minutes prior to skin incision. The control group will
      receive a similarly prepared placebo injection (water for injection) 30-60 minutes prior to
      incision.

      I will randomize patients in a 1:1 allocation ratio using a simple randomization. Patients
      will randomly pick an envelope with a number allocating to antibiotic prophylaxis or placebo.
      Patients and caretakers will be blinded to the intervention. The surgeon will also be blinded
      to the intervention. The antibiotic (or placebo) will be pre-mixed by the study investigator
      and administered by the anesthetist.

      Other preventive measures for surgical site infection (SSIs) such as effective surgical hand
      scrub, proper skin preparation with povidone and sterility of materials and instrument will
      be applied systematically in all groups. Dressing of the wound will be removed 48 hours after
      operation and no further dressing will be required. Patients will be followed for development
      of SSI documented by surgeon at discharge and will be called after 30 days of surgery to
      address any sign of SSI.
