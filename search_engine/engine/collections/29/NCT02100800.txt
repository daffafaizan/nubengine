      and bronchial remodeling. Emphysema is defined as an irreversible destruction of alveolar
      walls and subsequent enlargement of air spaces. New targeted therapies against emphysema are
      currently developed, thereby stressing the need for non-invasive tools aimed at quantifying
      emphysema. Multi-slice computed tomography (CT) is the method of reference to quantify
      emphysema but involves ionizing radiation, thus limiting the possibility of long-term
      follow-up. MRI is a non-ionizing 3D imaging technique; however, lung MRI is technically
      challenging with the result that it is currently not used in routine practice. Indeed, both
      low proton density and susceptibility effects lead to a very low signal intensity derived
      from lung parenchyma. Recently, pulse sequences with ultrashort echo time (UTE) have been
      implemented by the use of half radio-frequency excitations and radial projection
      reconstruction. These UTE sequences make it theoretically possible to retrieve more signal
      from the lung parenchyma. We aim at using 3D T1-weighted UTE pulse sequences on a 1.5T magnet
      (Avanto dot, Siemens) in COPD patients in order to distinguish normal lung from emphysematous
      areas. Thirty COPD patients and 10 volunteers are expected to take part in the study. All
      will benefit from Pulmonary Functional Testing (PFT), CT and MRI. Our strategy will consist
      in quantifying pulmonary emphysema using MRI and CT in those subjects, testing for
      correlations between MR and CT measurements and assessing the reproducibility of emphysema
      quantification using MRI. Our objective is to demonstrate that MR-UTE pulse sequence at 1.5T
      is accurate and reproducible in evaluating and quantifying pulmonary emphysema.
