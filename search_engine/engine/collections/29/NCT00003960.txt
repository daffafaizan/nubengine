      after treatment with HLA-matched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after high-dose
      chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral busulfan four times a day on days -8 to -5, cyclophosphamide
      IV over 1 hour on days -4 to -1, and methylprednisolone IV over 1 hour every 12 hours on days
      -2 to 0. CD34+ stem cell augmented donor bone marrow is infused on day 0. Methylprednisolone
      is administered IV over 1 hour on days 5-16, and then tapered. Patients are followed every 6
      months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
