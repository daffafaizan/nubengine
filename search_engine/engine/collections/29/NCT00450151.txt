      children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.

      It has been an established fact that cardiopulmonary bypass causes dysfunction in platelets.
      Activation of platelets during cardiopulmonary bypass is implicated as being a major factor
      in causing platelet dysfunction.

      For all participants, approximately 3.15 ml of blood will be collected in special tubes
      called CTAD tubes, before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (6.30ml in total). This amount of
      blood draw is well within the guidelines of NIH (National Institute of Health).

      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be performed using this plasma to make
      quantitative assessment of Platelet factor 4 and Transforming growth factor beta.
