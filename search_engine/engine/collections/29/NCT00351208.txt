    
      For a total of 9 weeks, patients will be randomized to 9 stimulation frequency and
      pulse-width setting combinations. The patient will stay with these settings for a week at a
      time. Prior to the patient's first office visit, he/she will be asked to take a chest x-ray.
      The patient will also repeat this chest x-ray at the end of the study. Each patient will be
      asked to provide daily information regarding pain medication usage, spinal cord stimulation
      usage, amplitude settings, and pain ratings. Additionally, patients will fill out the
      Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) every Monday
      when they come to the office, before he/she is randomized to the new settings for the week.
      The patient will also receive a call from the research assistant to see how he/she is doing
      that week and the patient will be provided with all the pertinent contact information to call
      at any time to ask questions. The patient can withdraw from the study completely at any point
      or drop out of the settings for the week. The patient will have a follow-up visit a month
      from the study's end date to discuss how the patient has been managing his/her pain at
      his/her spinal cord stimulator settings. Each patient will be compensated for completing the
      study. Efficacy will be measured based on the patient's answers to the pain probes, device
      usage, and medication usage.
