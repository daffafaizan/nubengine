    
      This is a phase 1b/II clinical trial using a fixed recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CD24Fc
      to explore the safety and efficacy of combining CD24Fc with ipilimumab and nivolumab to
      reduce the toxicity of immunotherapy combination, in patients who are na√Øve to anti-PD1/L1
      based checkpoint inhibitors. The dosing of nivolumab and ipilimumab will be fixed at FDA
      approved levels for each indication. Dosing of the drugs will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other discontinuation criterion is met. Patients
      who complete 12 months on study treatment and demonstrate clinical benefit with manageable
      toxicity will be given the opportunity to continue treatment for another 12 months upon
      agreement between investigator and drug manufacturers.
