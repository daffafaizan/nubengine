      the leading cause of death and disability among young adults in developed countries, and the
      incidence in the elderly population is increasing.

      Neurological damage after TBI is caused not only by the accident itself, but evolves
      afterwards. The posttraumatic secondary injury includes - among others - inflammation and
      oedema formation with subsequent increase of intracranial pressure. A key molecule in these
      processes is the gas nitric oxide, which is produced in excess during neuroinflammation.

      Ronopterin (VAS203) is an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Ronopterin reduces excess
      nitric oxide production and subsequent secondary injury.
