      biomarkers, and show initial feasibility in a small clinical trial. For paired taVNS to
      succeed as a clinical treatment, it is critical to develop and refine a closed-loop taVNS
      platform that delivers stimulation concurrently during specific movements of the motor
      rehabilitation training.

      Aim 1 develops this novel motion-gated closed-loop system that delivers taVNS in synchrony
      with specific upper limb motor activation (n=5) Aim 2 will combine the development of the
      closed-loop system with the investigator's mechanistic understanding to explore an open-label
      pilot trial (n=20) using closed-loop taVNS paired with task-specific training to determine
      the feasibility, safety, and potential effect size of this novel combination therapy.
