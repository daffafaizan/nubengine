      interscalene block (ISB) using plain bupivacaine with adjuvants vs. liposomal bupivacaine on
      mean postoperative pain levels in patients who have undergone a total shoulder arthroplasty
      within the first 48 hours. Principal Investigators hypothesize that ISB using plain
      bupivacaine with adjuvants will provide similar pain relief as ISB using liposomal
      bupivacaine.
