      seronegative) will be randomized 1:1 to receive adjunctive valacyclovir or adjunctive placebo
      for a 16 week period. The primary outcome that will be assessed is improvement in changes in
      visual and working memory scores in HSV-1 positive and negative participants over the course
      of the study. We will also measure the overall cognitive functioning and the severity of
      psychiatric symptoms over the course of the study and will evaluate the tolerability and
      safety of valacyclovir treatment in this population. In addition, we will explore the
      relationship between changes in the levels of inflammatory markers (HSV2, CMV, EBV, CRP, and
      Toxoplasmosis) and treatment response over the course of the study.
