      160/4.5 two inhalations in the manner prescribed in the approved package insert. The second
      intervention will be the inhalation of Symbicort 160/4.5 two inhalations through a valved
      holding chamber (Aero Chamber Plus). Breathing tests including spirometry will be measured at
      various time periods over a 12-hour time frame in each intervention. Comparison will be made
      of the two periods to demonstrate that the use of the valved holding chamber does not
      adversely affect the bronchodilation of the formoterol component of the combination drug.
