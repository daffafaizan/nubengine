      Bispectral Index (BIS) is a well known and widely used parameter derived from the patient's
      electroencephalograph (EEG). A closed-loop anesthesia system can be built using BIS as the
      control variable, a proportional-integral-differential control algorithm, a propofol and a
      remifentanil target-controlled infusion systems as the control actuators Preliminary results
      show that this system can be used during surgery.

      Spectral entropy relies on the extent of disorder in both EEG and electromyography (EMG)
      signals and returns 2 values: State Entropy (SE) and Response Entropy. SE is computed over
      the frequency range of 0.8-32 Hz and reflects the level of hypnosis while Response Entropy is
      computed over the frequency range of 0.8-47 Hz and reflects also EMG activity. BIS and SE are
      dimensionless numbers scaled from 100 to 0 for BIS and from 91 to 0 for SE. We hypothesized
      that SE can be used as the control variable. In preparation for a large multi-center control
      trial, we propose a prospective randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of such a
      closed-loop anesthesia system. Two groups of patients are compared: one in which propofol and
      remifentanil are administered by the anesthesiologist using target-controlled infusion
      systems, and one in which propofol and remifentanil are administered automatically by the
      combined closed-loop anesthesia system. In both groups, the goal is to maintain SE between 40
      and 60, the recommended range during anesthesia by the manufacturer. We expect the combined
      closed-loop anesthesia system group to do similar or better.
