      establishing the effectiveness of a quadrivalent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine against
      invasive meningococcal disease in children aged < 2 years would address this important,
      currently unmet public health need.

      At enrollment, each 9-month old subject will be randomly assigned to a study group and
      vaccinated. A second vaccination will be administered at 12 months of age. Subjects will
      provide one blood sample during the trial.

      Twelve-month old subjects will also be vaccinated with routine pediatric vaccines and provide
      one blood sample 30 days after vaccinations in the control group
