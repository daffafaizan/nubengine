    
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of IGIV-C in subjects suffering from
      AMD with occult CNV where fewer treatment options exist for patients with this disease form.

      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled
      prospective trial. Sixty patients, 30 per treatment group, with newly diagnosed pure occult
      CNV defined by angiography diagnostic criteria will be enrolled. If a subject has more than
      one eye affected with occult CNV, the eye with the better vision as measured by visual acuity
      ( Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution [LogMAR] score) will be entered as the study
      eye.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either IGIV-C at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight (bw)
      over 5 consecutive days or matching placebo. Additional 2 study drug treatment courses
      (IGIV-C or matching placebo) will be administered every 4 weeks at the same dose of 2 g/kg bw
      given over 5 days. Subjects' visual acuity will be measured and reported as LogMAR at
      screening, week 0 (baseline), day 5, week 4, week 8 and week 12. If at anytime during the
      study the subject's visual acuity worsens by â‰¥ 2 lines (0.2 on the LogMAR score), then a slit
      lamp examination will be performed and an angiogram will be conducted; the patient would be
      discontinued if the worsening is due to some other reason outside of the occult CNV or if the
      disease has changed from pure occult to the classic or mixed form.

      Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy (LogMAR score) at endpoint (at week 12 or at last
      LogMAR assessment at or after week 8, if the subject prematurely discontinues the trial).

      At the end of the treatment period (week 12), patients will be entered into a 3 month
      observation period with monthly visual acuity LogMAR score assessments.
