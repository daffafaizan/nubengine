      coronary syndrome require special attention with regard to antithrombotic therapy. Current
      guidelines recommend use of oral anticoagulation for almost all of these patients, the
      optimal antithrombotic strategy, however, has still to be defined. As with the use of any
      antithrombotic drug, clinicians need to balance the risks of ischemic stroke and
      thromboembolism, recurrent cardiac ischemia and/or stent thrombosis, and bleeding and
      haemorrhagic stroke.

      A recently published randomized clinical trial (PIONEER AF) compared the combination of a
      novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC; Rivaroxaban) plus dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) with
      standard therapy consisting of vitamine K inhibitor plus DAPT. Patients treated with
      Rivaroxaban showed less incidence of bleedings, whereas ischemic complications, death or
      stroke were equal in the groups compared.

      The RIVA-PCI Registry aims at providing an overview of the current antithrombotic treatment
      regimen in Germany in real life. Moreover, for patients receiving Rivaroxaban as part of
      their medication follow-up data with regard to their adherence to antithrombotic medication
      as well as complications over an interval of 14 months after index procedure will be
      evaluated.
