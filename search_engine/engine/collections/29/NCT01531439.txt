      controlled analgesia (PCA) for pain control postoperatively. PCA therapy is typically
      combined with an ultra low dose naloxone infusion because of the established benefit of
      reduced pruritis and nausea. The investigators hypothesize that using a higher dose naloxone
      infusion may lead to further improvement in pruritis and nausea and may improve GI function.
      Improvement in bowel function could lead to faster initiation of oral intake as well as
      transition to oral pain medication and even decreased length of stay.
