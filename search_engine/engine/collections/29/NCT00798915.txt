      be assigned to the group with "normal glucose tolerance", "impaired glucose tolerance"
      (between normal and diabetic), or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Each study subject will then be
      administered a graded glucose infusion (GGI) on 4 separate occasions. For the GGI, an
      intravenous glucose infusion will be started at a rate of 1 mg x kg-1 x min-1 for 40 min,
      followed by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 mg x kg-1 x min-1 (40 min for each step). A primed-continuous
      infusion of vehicle alone, GIP alone, xenin-25 alone, or the combination of GIP plus xenin-25
      (each peptide at a dose of 4 pmoles x kg-1 x min-1) will be initiated at the same time the
      glucose infusion is started. Blood samples will be collected before and during the GGI for
      the measurement of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GIP and xenin-25 levels.
