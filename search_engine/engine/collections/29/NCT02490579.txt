      realize that unhealthy diet, exercise and weight gain behaviors can be dangerous for their
      pregnancy and have harmful long-term consequences for their baby. There is great need for
      strategies to promote accurate knowledge about healthy behaviors during pregnancy. The
      purpose of this study is to assess responses to a brief (<1minute) video about healthy
      behaviors during pregnancy. The study sample will include pregnant women and members of their
      social network. Participants will be asked to watch a brief video and complete an anonymous
      online survey measuring their response to the video, and their basic demographics. The
      surveys will also assess how family and friends impact pregnant women's health behaviors.
      Online surveys are entirely anonymous. We will recruit pregnant participants from two
      sources: the University of Michigan Health System's prenatal clinics and a social media
      website (Facebook).
