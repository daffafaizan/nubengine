      the limits of stability as determined by the base of support. It is further divided in static
      and dynamic stability involving the ability of maintaining a base of support while standing
      or completing a functional Task. The importance of postural stability is accepted as a factor
      predicting falls and affecting the ability to perform activities of daily living.

      Despite of reported strength deficits and the importance of balance, to date the potential
      contribution of strength deficits in patients before and after Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)
      or Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) to compromised balance ability is unknown. Furthermore, the
      role of preoperative muscle function on functional outcome of THA and TKA is poorly
      understood. A correlation between compromised preoperative muscular function and
      postoperative outcome would suggest that preoperative physical therapy may be critical for
      preserving the muscular status and may help explain reported poorer outcome after late
      treatment when muscular function has already deteriorated.

      The project includes two studies differing in design and primary and secondary objectives but
      with overlapping patient populations.

      Study 1 will include all five groups, and there is only one visit by the participant (visit
      A).

      Study 2 will include only patients from groups 3 and 4. Three assessments will be performed:
      preoperatively (visit 1), 6 weeks postoperatively (visit 2) and 1 year postoperative (visit
      3). Visit 1 will be identical to visit A in study 1 in these two patient groups.
