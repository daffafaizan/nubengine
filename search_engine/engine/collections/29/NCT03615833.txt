      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed. Vitamin D level will be
      assessed : Patients without vitamin D deficiency will be excluded.

      The influence of vitamin D supplementation on the evolution of walking distance in 12 weeks
      will be studied by comparing the spontaneous evolution of this walking distance, in not
      supplemented patients (period 1 ), and the evolution under treatment with vitamin D (period
      2, afer 3 months ).

      The spontaneous evolution of the walking distance will be evaluated by the difference in
      walking distance observed between the beginning and the end of the first Period (3 months) .
      The evolution of walking distance under vitamin D treatment will be evaluated by the
      difference in walking distance between between the beginning and the end of the second Period
      (3 months).

      The duration of participation for a subject is equal to 6 months (2 periods of 3 months )
