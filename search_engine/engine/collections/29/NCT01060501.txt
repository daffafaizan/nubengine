      assumptions were made: The 5-year OS rate of 5-FU was estimated to be 58%. Our intention was
      to detect an increase in the 5-year OS rate by one of the additives of at least 10% with a
      power of 80% and a level of significance of 5% in comparison to 5-FU (one-sided). Hypotheses
      were analyzed as pair wise comparisons between the treatment options. This resulted in a
      target sample size of 280 patients per group and a total of 840 patients.
