      overall survival in a cohort of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) of WHO
      functional class I in Argentina.

      Secondary objectives are to study the discriminatory ability of the risk assessment tool
      presented in the European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS)
      2015 guidelines and to explore the potential prognostic advantage of a low-risk profile at
      follow-up as treatment goal.
