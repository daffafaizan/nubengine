      and advances in facilities. However, no doubt that early resuscitation and interventions make
      a big difference upon the overall outcome.

      A lot of methods, indices, laboratory and biomarkers have been utilized to evaluate the
      progress and quality of resuscitation and the early hospital interventions in such group of
      critically ill patients including central venous pressures, urine output, mixed venous oxygen
      saturation, and gastric tonometry. Most of recent means focus upon the regional tissue
      perfusion rather than global, however some researches have tried the difference between
      arterial and venous CO2,oxygen tension or content ( Pv -a co2& Pa -v O2 ) in addition to
      dynamic changes in lactate(3) as predictors for tissue perfusion in sepsis patients after
      establishment of sepsis campaign (bundle).
