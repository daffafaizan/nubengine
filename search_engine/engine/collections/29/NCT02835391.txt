    
      This study is a post market, multi-centre, randomised study evaluating PerClot compared to
      usual care.

      All subjects in this randomized study will undergo a laparoscopic or open gynecological
      procedure such as hysterectomy, cystectomy, myomectomy, endometrial excision or ablation.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive PerClot or usual care.

      This research will utilize a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled study. The
      study will be conducted in2 study sites in Europe. An assumed sample of 90 subjects will be
      enrolled to evaluate the time to haemostasis. The enrollment of subjects to receive treatment
      will be based upon specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will be randomized on
      a 1:1 basis to receive either PerClot or usual care. Data collected from both arms will be
      compared.

      Usual care will be at the discretion of the surgeon and may include any other haemostat or
      diathermy/electrocautery.
