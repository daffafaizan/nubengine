      (systematic telephone outreach and monitoring to improve quality and continuity of
      pharmacotherapy, and structured psychoeducational group programs focused on patient
      activation and self-management) in a population-based sample of patients with chronic or
      recurrent depression. Two forms of group self-management training will be evaluated: a
      Peer-Led Chronic Disease Self-Management Group (after that developed by Lorig and colleagues)
      and a Therapist-Led Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Group. Approximately 100 patients with
      chronic or recurrent depression were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) usual
      care; 2) phone care management; 3) phone care management plus peer-led self-management group;
      or 4) phone care management plus therapist-led CBT group. Blinded assessments will examine
      clinical outcomes (SCL depression score, depression diagnosis by SCID), functional outcomes,
      and process variables (self-efficacy for managing depression, use of coping strategies) over
      12 months. If patients choose not to participate in treatment, reasons for dropout were
      assessed. The data collected will provide:1) an evaluation of the feasibility and
      acceptability (including recruitment, intervention uptake and continued participation) of the
      intervention programs; 2) preliminary evaluation of effectiveness, i.e., the effects of each
      intervention on patient outcomes and process of care; and 3) information to inform the design
      and implementation of a full-scale effectiveness trial (refinement of intervention programs
      and measurement strategy, necessary sample size).
