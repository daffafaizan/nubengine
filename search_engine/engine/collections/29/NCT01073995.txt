    
      Patient Selection: All patients (ages 18-65 years) who have been diagnosed with lower
      extremity radiculopathy (sciatica) secondary to a lumbar disc herniation that have been
      referred for SNRI by the principal investigator (Dr. Neil Manson) will be asked to
      participate in the study. All patients will have exhausted non-operative measures.

      Initial Assessment: During the initial office visit, patients will be assessed by the
      principle investigator for inclusion in the study. If the patient demonstrates interest in
      the proposed research they will be provided a Consent Form and given the opportunity to ask a
      Research Assistant questions regarding their participation.

      . Injections: Standard procedures for SNRI will be used by the participating Radiologists in
      the Department of Radiology at the Saint John Regional Hospital. Each patient will be
      randomly assigned by a Research Assistant to either the treatment (Kenalog/Sensorcaine) or
      control (Saline) group. All treatments will be blinded to the treating physicians and the
      patient.

      Injectates: Control Group: Saline Treatment Group: Kenalog 40cc/0.25% Sensorcaine

      Follow up assessment: During a follow-up visit, patients will be re-assessed to determine the
      success of the injection. SNRI success will be determined by self-reported pain and symptom
      reduction. If the patient and principle investigator do not deem the injection successful,
      further treatment options will be discussed (second injection, surgery, etc) and follow-up
      evaluations will be scheduled.
