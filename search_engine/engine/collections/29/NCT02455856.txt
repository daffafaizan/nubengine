    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), fixed-sequence,
      single-center, single-dose study designed to assess the effects of steady-state itraconazole
      exposure on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of JNJ 42847922 in healthy male
      participants. The duration of study will be approximately of 6 weeks per participant. The
      study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study commences on Day 1);
      Open-label Treatment (6 days); and Follow-up (7 to 14 days after last dose of study drug or
      early withdrawal).

      All eligible participants will receive single oral doses of 5 milligram (mg) JNJ-42847922 on
      Day 1 and Day 6. A daily dose of 200 mg itraconazole will be administered from Day 2 to Day
      6. Followed by an overnight fast of at least 8 hours participants will be administered with
      study treatment 30 minutes after light breakfast. Participants will not be allowed to have
      food until 4 hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of
      pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
