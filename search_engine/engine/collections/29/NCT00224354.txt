    
      This is a phase I trial to assess the safety of depleting regulatory T (Treg) cells using 1-3
      doses of an interleukin-2 immunotoxin directed to the CD25 antigen (denileukin diftitox,
      ONTAK) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients, followed by six subcutaneous (SC)
      injections of autologous leukemic cells modified ex vivo to secrete human interleukin-2
      (hIL-2) and to express human CD40 ligand (hCD40L). Patients will receive a fixed dose (2 x
      10e7) of IL-2 secreting B-cells together with 2 x 10e7 hCD40L expressing B-cells,
      representing a safe, well tolerated and immunogenic dose in our previous dose escalation
      study.

      All eligible patients will be treated with six injections. Any patient whose disease
      regresses after the administration of 6 injections may be offered further injections of tumor
      vaccine if sufficient vaccine is available. There will be no use of placebo or control
      subjects.
