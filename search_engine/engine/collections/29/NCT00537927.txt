      pain. Method of fixation of the mesh in laparoscopic incisional / ventral hernia repair might
      influence the degree of this postoperative pain. Fixation of the mesh might also influence
      other outcome parameters such as return to preoperative activities, costs and recurrence
      rate.

      The study hypothesis is that there is no difference in postoperative pain when comparing
      three commonly used mesh fixation techniques in laparoscopic incisional / ventral hernia
      repair.
