      that are placed on the fingertips to measure pressure. The test takes about 20-25 minutes.
      During the procedure the participant will have biosensors placed on the index finger of each
      hand. The nondominant arm will have a blood pressure cuff applied with sufficient pressure
      for five minutes. At the end of the test the device will provide a reading that assesses the
      level of endothelial function/dysfunction.
