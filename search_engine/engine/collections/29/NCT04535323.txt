      and signs associated with a decrease in estrogen and other sex steroids involving changes to
      the labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibule/introitus, vagina, urethra and bladder. The
      syndrome may include but is not limited to genital symptoms of dryness, burning, and
      irritation; sexual symptoms of lack of lubrication, discomfort or pain, and impaired
      function; and urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria and recurrent urinary tract infections.The
      primary goal of treatment of GSM is symptom relief which may include non-hormonal and
      hormonal treatments. GSM is a challenging issue for breast cancer survivors on aromatase
      inhibitors due to symptomatic treatments that usually include estrogen which is
      contraindicated after treatment for breast cancer. GSM symptoms typically do not resolve
      without treatment and may worsen with time. PRP has been studied as a treatment option for
      various gynecological disorders and wound healing after cesarean sections and gynecological
      surgery.
