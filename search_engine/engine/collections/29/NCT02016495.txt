      on appropriate treatments. Although several drugs are currently used, the identification of
      effective and safe agents able to improve both maternal and fetal health is still warranted.

      In this study the efficacy a formulation based on magnesium and alpha-lipoic acid has been
      compared with placebo to evaluate the incidence of reduction of preterm delivery.

      Three hundred pregnant women at 14-34 weeks of gestation were enrolled and randomly divided
      to receive a daily single tablet containing magnesium and alpha-lipoic acid supplement or
      placebo until delivery.
