      with one-third of the surviving patients from stroke fail to regain independent walking
      ability. Robot-assisted gait rehabilitation that is able to deliver high intensity and
      consistent repeatability in a safe and controlled environment are gaining traction and
      advocators for its inclusion as part of the routine post-stroke rehabilitation program.
      However, despite the recent technological advances in the development and design of better
      robotics, the exact benefit of the robot-assisted therapy over traditional rehabilitation
      remain sparse and unclear. It is therefore the aim of the proposed project to fulfil this
      important gap in our clinical knowledge by comparatively investigate the clinical feasibility
      and efficacy of a recently developed HIWIN Robotic Gait Training System (MRG-P100) against
      the traditional rehabilitation program with an emphasis on the determination of functional
      recovery and the appropriate gait adaptation of such robotic system for stroke survivors.
