      shivering. However, there is still no clear protocol or gold standard for post-spinal
      shivering management. This is due to the fact that post-spinal shivering mechanisms are
      complex and are broadly grouped into thermoregulatory and non-thermoregulatory. Preventive
      measures that have been studied are broadly classified into pharmacological methods and
      non-pharmacological methods. For Non-pharmacological method, active warming of the patient by
      various methods have been found to be effective in preventing PSS. However, there is no study
      that looks at ways to reduce heat loss hence maintaining normothermia and preventing PSS in
      patients. Therefore in this study, we will be investigating if higher OT temperature will
      reduce the incidence of PSS. As for pharmacological methods, many drugs have been studied for
      examples analgesics (tramadol), opioid receptor agonists (pethidine, fentanyl),
      cholinesterase inhibitors (physostigmine), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists
      (ketamine, magnesium sulphate), Î±2-central agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine),
      antiserotonergic (ondansetron) and anti-inflammatory drugs (dexamethasone). Ondansetron is
      usually used to prevent chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced nausea vomiting and
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting. Due to the fact that it is generally a safe drug and has
      added benefit as an anti-emetics especially for obstetrics population, this drug is chosen to
      be studied. We will also look at the efficacy of the combined effect of increased OT
      temperature and prophylaxis ondansetron on preventing PSS.
