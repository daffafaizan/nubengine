      to enable more effective and efficient use of antibiotics.

      The current standard of care in Austin ICU is to give meropenem 1g via short (30 min)
      infusion. Small studies of healthy volunteers and intensive care patients and Monte Carlo
      simulation modelling in these groups, have shown that prolonged infusions of meropenem can
      provide at least equivalent T > MIC while using a smaller dose. Studies in intensive care
      patients have generally excluded those with renal failure, septic shock and certain other
      co-morbidities. Therefore, a study encompassing all groups of patients who receive meropenem
      in the intensive care setting is required to show if these findings have more generalised
      applicability.

      Hypothesis/research questions:

      500mg of meropenem administered as a 3 hour infusion is at least comparable to more
      traditional dosing of 1 g administered as a 30 minute infusion, in attaining target time
      above MIC.

      We plan to compare standard meropenem therapy (1g over 30 minute infusion) with prolonged
      infusion meropenem (500mg over 3 hour infusion) in a general intensive care unit. Meropenem
      levels will be monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (Victorian
      College of Pharmacy) to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes of the
      different dosing regimens and will be correlated with the meropenem MIC of any significant
      bacterial isolates from the patients

      The outcomes of this pilot study will help plan a larger project to improve the use of
      meropenem in intensive care unit patients.
