      position. Right heart catheterization was performed with simultaneous expired gas analysis at
      rest and during supine exercise at a 20 Watts workload for 5 minutes. After the first
      exercise phase (before any drug administration) and after return to steady-state baseline
      hemodynamic values, subjects were randomized. Study drug or placebo was infused for 5
      minutes. After a 10 minute observation period, hemodynamic measurements were repeated at
      rest, followed by repeat supine exercise at a 20 Watts workload for 5 minutes, identical to
      the study's first phase. Arterial and venous blood samples and hemodynamic and expired gas
      data were acquired during each stage of the protocol.
