      accounting for over 200,000 procedures each year. Most epidemiologic studies of uterine
      leiomyoma show that parity has a protective association with leiomyoma, but the mechanism is
      not known. Both epidemiologic data and data from an animal model indicate that the protective
      association is not an artifact resulting from reduced fertility among women with fibroids. We
      hypothesize that the process of uterine regression following delivery results in loss of
      small fibroids due to selective apoptosis of transformed cells and the extensive remodeling
      of the entire uterus.

      Study Objectives: Monitor fibroids during pregnancy and after postpartum uterine regression
      to assess any loss of fibroids and change in size of fibroids.

      Methods: Add a postpartum ultrasound examination to an existing epidemiologic study of
      pregnant women. The parent study documents fibroid number, size, and location with a 7 week
      ultrasound examination. With the additional postpartum ultrasound proposed here, data on
      fibroid number, size, and location through pregnancy and postpartum uterine regression will
      be collected on approximately 400 women. A subsample of 30 women will also have an MRI after
      their postpartum ultrasound in order to evaluate the sensitivity of ultrasound imaging.

      Significance: This study will provide the first data on fibroid change with
      parturition/postpartum uterine regression for a large sample of women. If small fibroids
      disappear during this time, it will document a process that results in "natural regression"
      of these tumors in premenopausal women. Insights from the biology of this process may be
      useful in developing treatment that could be used by nonpregnant women with fibroids to
      induce tumor regression.
