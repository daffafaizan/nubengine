      18 years of age and older, who are in good health, have no known history of COVID-19 or
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, and meet all other eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351
      manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc, given in vaccination schedules alone, sequentially, or
      coadministered with mRNA-1273. mRNA-1273.351 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated
      mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized S protein of the
      SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant. Enrollment will occur at approximately five domestic clinical
      research sites.

      This study includes two cohorts. Cohort 1 will provide rapid information about the
      immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351 in a previously vaccinated group. This cohort can inform near
      term public health decisions if the variant virus becomes more widespread. Cohort 2 will
      evaluate different strategies for generation of cross protective immune responses in a naïve
      population. This cohort will take longer to provide information on the immunogenicity of
      mRNA-1273.351, but is important to inform future public health strategies. Cohort 1 will
      include approximately 60 subjects 18 years of age and older who received two vaccinations of
      mRNA-1273 at dosages of 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 250 mcg in the Phase 1 clinical trial (DMID
      20-0003). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of the
      designated vaccine and will be followed through 12 months after vaccination. Follow-up visits
      will occur on Days 8, 15, and 29, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the vaccination.
      Cohort 2 will include approximately 150 participants 18 through 55 years of age who have not
      received a COVID-19 vaccine, have no known history of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
      do not have underlying conditions that are associated with an increased risk of severe
      illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. They will be randomly assigned to one of 8 treatment arms
      and will receive 2 or 3 IM injections of the vaccine and followed through 12 months after the
      last vaccination. Follow-up visits will occur 7, 14, and 28 days after each vaccination, as
      well as 3, 6 and 12 months post the last vaccination.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273 and
      mRNA-1273.351 vaccines, in naïve and previously vaccinated individuals. The secondary
      objective is to assess humoral immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351 vaccines, in
      naïve and previously vaccinated individuals.
