      mellitus (DM) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery remains a significant
      concern. In this study, the intraoperative glycemic stability among diabetic patients
      undergoing CABG surgery was compared between patients who received an intravenous continuous
      insulin infusion (CII) for tight glycemic control with those who received an CII for
      conventional glycemic control, during the intraoperative period.

      Research Design and Methods: This study implemented a quasi-experimental design with a
      convenience sample of 144 patients with DM undergoing CABG surgery at a major hospital in
      Amman, Jordan. Participants were randomly assigned to either a tight glycemic control group
      (n=72) or a conventional glycemic control group (n=72). Patients who received the tight
      glycemic control protocol had significantly more consistent and lower mean intraoperative BG
      levels than those who received the conventional glycemic control protocol. The tight glycemic
      control protocol resulted in significantly lower BG levels and fewer variations across each
      time-point and more consistent and stable BG levels than the conventional glycemic control
      protocol.
