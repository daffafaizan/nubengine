      been done outside of the United States until the last two years. Therefore, this is the first
      study of its kind to evaluate this subject internationally.

      In the next few weeks individuals will be receiving an on line survey from Survey Monkey.

      The purpose of the survey is to explore the spiritual/religious beliefs of oncologists from a
      world side perspective, to identify areas in which spiritual/religious beliefs may affect
      medical decision making, and to explore any correlation that may exist between
      spiritual/religious beliefs of oncologists and physician burn out.

      The surveys will take about 30 to 40 minutes to complete. Survey results will be encrypted
      even in transmission and sent to a secure server for anonymity. Even if one chooses not to
      fill out the surveys investigators ask that each person complete the demographic
      questionnaire.

      Without input, investigators will lose the opportunity to further an understanding of how
      spirituality and religious beliefs impact patient care and physician well being.

      Investigators welcome any feed back.
