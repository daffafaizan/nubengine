      subjects will be scheduled to begin 22 days of study participation. During the first week,
      participants will be randomly assigned to take either progesterone or placebo (inactive
      medication) twice a day, and to abstain from marijuana use. During this week, participants
      will upload videos of themselves taking their medication and performing saliva drug tests.
      They will collect and store additional saliva samples each morning for hormone testing. They
      will also participate in "CREMA" sessions (Cue Reactivity Ecologic Momentary Assessment)
      three times a day. These sessions include looking at stressful and neutral pictures and
      rating stress and craving. At the end of this week, participants will return to the clinic
      and participate in a stress task. For the next two weeks, participants will continue to
      collect saliva samples and participate in CREMA sessions. They will return at the end of the
      two weeks to return study supplies. Urine samples will be collected at each study visit.
