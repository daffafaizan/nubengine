      and efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor consolidation in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer
      paitents who received standard first-line chemotherapy and chest radiotherapy Â± SABR for
      metastasis disease.

      The primary endpoint is the safety and objective response rate of treatment. The secondary
      objectives are progression free survival(PFS), overall survial. The exploratory end point
      includes the correlation of PD-1 expression on the tumor tissue, and the TMB, Immune
      Repertoire sequencing derived from the tumor tissue and the blood sample with the efficacy of
      treatent. The plan for collection of tumor tissue and blood at baseline at different stages
      during or after treatment was defined in the protocol.

      The PICCARE-trial has been designed by National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese
      Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, and the hypothesis is PD-1
      inhibitor consolidation was safe and effective in the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC after
      sandard first-line chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
