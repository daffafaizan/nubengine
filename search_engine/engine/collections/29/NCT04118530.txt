      incident atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) during the initial 30 days of transplant
      who will be implanted with the Medtronic Reveal Linq Implantable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) within
      90 days of HSCT. We will evaluate the rate of recurrent AF/AFL as well as incident episodes
      of major cardiovascular events and the safety of ICM implantation in this population.
