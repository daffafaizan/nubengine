      diabetes patients who received an intensive lifestyle intervention at both one and four years
      after enrollment. Translating such findings into accessible and effective weight loss
      programs is a major public health challenge. We are conducting "Lifestyle Interventions for
      Treatment of Diabetes" (LIFT Diabetes). The overall goal is to investigate two approaches to
      improving risk factor control; one which is modeled after Look AHEAD and is designed to
      achieve 7% weight loss and increase physical activity to > 175 minutes per week among
      minority and lower income diabetes patients via a 12-month, group based lifestyle
      intervention, using community health workers supervised by an interventionist. Participants
      will have up to 4 group visits/month and up to 12 individual contacts/year. The other
      approach will promote Diabetes Self Management (DSM) by educating participants regarding
      health behaviors which lead to improved diabetes control; this arm is also 12 months, and is
      delivered in the clinic by intervention staff via monthly group visits and up to 12
      individual contacts/year. We will randomize 260 overweight or obese adults with diabetes to
      either intervention, and determine the impact on outcomes (UKPDS-estimated CVD risk, risk
      factor control), weight, cost, resource utilization, and safety at 12 months, and after
      transitioning back to usual care, at 24 months. The hypotheses are that the community based
      intervention results in 10% relative reduction in CVD risk compared to clinic-based
      intervention; the interventions are equivalent with respect to adherence and participant
      satisfaction; and the community based intervention is associated with lower cost than the
      clinic based intervention. Translating evidence based, lifestyle strategies, and targeting
      minority and underserved patients, will yield, if successful, models for addressing
      diabetes-related health disparities.
