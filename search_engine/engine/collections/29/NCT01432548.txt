      has been initiated by Liver & Transplant Division, Hospital Dr Cosme Argerich, Buenos Aires
      Argentina. The protocol was approved by ethics committees and an informed consent was
      obtained from each patient before they were enrolled. Sixty patients were randomized to
      either receive ischemic preconditioning prior to liver resection under intermittent pedicle
      clamping or Intermittent Pringle ischemia. Ischemic preconditioning was performed through a
      sequence of 10 minutes vascular inflow occlusion and 10 minutes of reperfusion prior to
      continuous pedicle clamping during resection. Intermittent pedicle clamping was conducted
      through a sequence of 15 minutes of vascular inflow occlusion and 5 minutes of reperfusion.
      The randomization process which was centralized was held in the operating room after
      inclusion criteria had been check and exclusion criteria ruled out.
