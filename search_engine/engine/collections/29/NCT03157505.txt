      characterised by local production of IgE during natural exposure to aeroallergens. These
      patients have negative skin prick tests and serum-specific IgEs but have positive nasal
      provocation tests for aeroallergens. More than 50% of patients with chronic non-allergic
      rhinitis may have a problem with lack of LAR diagnosis. Misdiagnosis can lead to mistakes in
      the treatment as well as inefficiencies.

      Besides on only local IgE-mediated reaction, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) could be a
      potential way of treatment such patients. However, there are only sufficient data that the
      AIT is effective in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma to pollens and house dust mites
      and some animal.

      The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of AIT for birch pollen allergens
      in patients with local allergic rhinitis and a confirmed birch pollen allergy.
