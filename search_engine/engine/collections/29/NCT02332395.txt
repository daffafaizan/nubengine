      associated with physical and psychological condition of the individual. This study is aimed
      to investigate the effect of surgical priority either emergency or elective on postoperative
      pain in caesarean section operations.

      Patients are invited to complete the pain catastrophizing scale questionnaire in preoperative
      period.

      A total of 100 patients will be included into the study. Patients are divided into two groups
      in terms of surgical priority whether emergency or elective. Spinal or general anesthesia
      will be performed to the patients. In postoperative period, patient controlled analgesia will
      be applied for pain relief and numerical rating scale is used to determine the pain intensity
      in 1st, 2nd, 6th, 12th, 24th hours. The analgesic consumption in 24 hours will be recorded.
