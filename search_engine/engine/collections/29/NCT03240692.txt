      for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) for a 6 week treatment
      course. This methodology has been successful for many people with treatment-resistant
      depression. One of the limitations of this approach is the long duration of the treatment
      course (approximately a 6 weeks per treatment course). Recently, researchers have
      aggressively pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce treatment course time with
      some preliminary success. This study intends to further modify the parameters to create a
      more rapid form of the treatment. This study will also look at the change in neuroimaging
      biomarkers associated with this treatment.
