      with oral etoposide alternating every 21 days with oral cyclophosphamide (metronomic
      chemotherapy) is effective in shrinking relapsed or refractory tumors in pediatric
      participants. In addition, this study seeks to learn the length of time this combination can
      keep the tumor from growing, learn more about the side effects of sirolimus when used in this
      combination, and to learn if the sirolimus is working by evaluating blood and tumor tissue.
