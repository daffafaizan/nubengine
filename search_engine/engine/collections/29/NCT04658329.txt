        -  Describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of participants infected with
           HIV-2, and the immuno-virological characteristics of the infection.

        -  To study the clinical and immunological progression of HIV-2 infection and the
           prognostic factors of this evolution.

        -  Study the response to antiretroviral treatment (clinical, immuno-virological) and
           contribute to the identification of the antiretroviral strategies and combinations most
           suited to the particularities of the infection.

        -  Allow an evaluation of the care practices of participants followed in French hospitals

        -  Provide a bank of clinical-biological data and samples allowing the performance of
           virological and / or immunological studies on HIV-2 infection.

      The follow-up of the participants is different according to the therapeutic status of the
      participants, naive of antiretroviral treatment or already treated with antiretrovirals.
