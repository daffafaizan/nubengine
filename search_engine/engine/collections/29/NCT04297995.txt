      determined according to Simon's two-stage Optimal design.

      In the first stage, 13 patients will be accrued. The patients will receive 3 mg/kg of HLX10
      every two weeks infusion combined with 600 mg HLX07 weekly (stage 1L). These patients will be
      assessed for treatment response after 8 weeks of first infusion of study drugs. If there are
      3 or fewer responsive patients in these 13 patients, additional 13 patients will be accrued.
      These additional 13 patients will receive 3 mg/kg of HLX10 every two weeks infusion combined
      with 800 mg HLX07 weekly (Stage 1H). If 3 or fewer responses after eight weeks treatment
      noted in these 13 patients in stage 1H, the trial will be stopped.

      If 4 or more patients are responsive to therapy in stage 1, the trial will be continued to
      stage 2, 30 additional patients will be accrued to reach a total of 43 patients. These
      additional 30 patients will receive the same dose of regimen as the prior patients.
