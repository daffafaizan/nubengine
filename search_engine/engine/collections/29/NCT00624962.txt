      Primary

        -  To determine the feasibility and acceptance of undertaking early enteral tube feedings
           in children receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia
           or myelodysplastic syndromes, primary cancers of the central nervous system, or
           high-risk solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety of proactive enteral nutrition in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the effect of enteral nutrition on nutritional status in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients have a small (6 or 8 French) nasogastral feeding tube or enterostomy tube
      inserted after diagnosis. PeptamenÂ® AF tube feeding is administered via the enteral tube.
      Tube feedings are started as a continuous drip using an enteral feeding pump with a
      subsequent steady daily rate increase. Patients receive enteral feeding during courses 1-4 of
      chemotherapy.
