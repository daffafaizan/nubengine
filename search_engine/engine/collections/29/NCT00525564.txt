      (ESWT) to pharmacotherapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This
      exercise testing modality needs to be further investigated because of its relevance for
      activity of daily living.

      Objective: To evaluate, in patients with COPD, the responsiveness of the ESWT to detect
      improvement in walking performance after single dose of salmeterol.

      Methods: In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 20 patients with
      COPD will perform, on two separate days, an ESWT at 80% of peak capacity, 2 hours after
      inhaling either a placebo or 50Âµg of salmeterol. Cardiorespiratory parameters will be
      monitored breath-by-breath during each walking test with a portable telemetric gas analyzer
      (Oxycom Mobile, Jaeger, Germany). Inspiratory capacities and Borg ratings for dyspnea were
      obtained every other minute throughout the tests.

      Planned analysis. The main outcome will be endurance time. This variable will be compared
      between the two treatment arms using a paired t test. The time course of the
      cardiorespiratory parameters and dyspnea over time will be compared between the two exercise
      modalities. Comparisons will be done using a repeated measure design (ANOVA). Significance
      level will be set at a p value of 0.05.
