      (DMTs) available to treat MS, with varying availability around the world.

      Significant heterogeneity exists in the efficacy and risks associated with these therapies.

      Neurologists caring for MS patients face important choices in each medical encounter: 1)
      continue with the same management, 2) initiate or escalate therapy for a more effective or
      safer agent, or 3) consider a reassessment within months under the uncertainty of the current
      status of the patient.

      Limited information on how physicians weigh in different factors when making therapeutic
      decisions.

      Physicians (cognitive biases affecting decision making) and health system (e.g. access to an
      infusion center) factors are the most responsible causes of practice gaps in MS care. The
      physician's component is the least studied.

      Therapeutic inertia (TI) is a common phenomenon in MS care defined as lack of treatment
      initiation or escalation (e.g. switch interferons or glatiramer to fingolimod /alemtuzumab
      /natalizumab/ocrelizumab/ etc.) when recommended by guidelines or evidence of disease
      progression. This phenomenon leads to poorer patient's outcomes, greater disability, and
      diminished quality of life.

      Goals of the study: i) to determine what are the most relevant factors influencing
      therapeutic decisions among neurologists with expertise in MS care; ii) to asses whether
      physicians rely on medical information provided in a case scenario versus a quantitative or
      qualitative estimation of disease progression based on hypothetical models.
