    
      -  Patients: With advanced malignant disease, any kind, in which all standard treatment has
           been tried, but still progression. In sufficient good performance status (ps 0-2)to get
           more treatment: first selenite and immediately afterwards chemotherapy (since an
           additive or synergistic effect from selenite and chemotherapy has been found).

        -  Treatment: We have performed the initial study with sodium selenite i.v. daily, 10
           treatments during 2 weeks. The week after that response evaluation and then
           chemotherapy. In each patient, his or her first line chemotherapy treatment is given,
           since in vitro studies indicate that selenite might reverse resistance. In the modified
           protocol, a 2 days continuous infusion will be performed.

        -  Toxicity evaluation (main criteria in phase I): Meeting a doctor once a week during
           selenite treatment and before each chemotherapy treatment and at End of treatment.
           Meeting a nurse each treatment day during selenite treatment. Blood samples for liver,
           kidney, blood and thyroid values. Plasma samples for selenite concentration during
           treatment.

        -  Response evaluation (to be: main criteria in phase II and studied also in phase I): CT
           scan just before and after selenite treatment and after chemotherapy. From May 2011
           FDG-PET-CT-scan just before and after selenite treatment. Cytokeratin and cytokeratin
           fragments evaluation.
