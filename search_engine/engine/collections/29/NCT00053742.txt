    
      This is a phase I/II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, study of MVA vaccine.
      The hypothesis is that MVA will be safe in vaccinia-immune adults when administered by
      intramuscular injection, and that this vaccine will result in an immunologic response
      comparable to that observed after Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) vaccination in previously
      vaccinia-immunized persons. The primary objectives include: evaluating the safety of MVA
      administered by intramuscular (IM) injection at 10(8) PFU, and determining whether MVA
      provides clinical evidence of protection against a 12-week Dryvax challenge when compared to
      placebo groups. The secondary objectives are to identify the schedules of MVA administration
      that provide clinical evidence of protection against Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) challenge
      and compare the Immunogenicity of Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) and MVA as measured by
      vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody, ELISA and intracellular cytokine assays, as well as
      variola-specific neutralizing antibody assays that will be conducted at the CDC on a subset
      of samples.
