    
      Twenty cohorts are identified, a cohort being defined as [one pathology, one target
      alteration] such as [gastric cancer with MET amplification (6%)].

      One cohort will be dedicated to miscellaneous, very rare pediatric diseases identified
      through INCa platforms or pan-genome programs (e.g. MOSKIDO, IGR) and will recruit up to 10
      patients.

      Two cohorts will be dedicated to a couple of diseases harbouring at least one specific
      alteration in one crizotinib target, same or different from those listed above, e.g. in AXL
      gene, arising from pan-genome trials.

        3. Colorectal cancer, adults, MET amplified

        4. Colorectal cancer, adults, MET mutated

       19. Anaplastic thyroid cancer, adults, ALK mutated

       20. Thyroid cancer (follicular + medullary + papillary), adults, MET mutated

       21. Miscellaneous rare pediatric diseases associated to at least one specific alteration in
           one crizotinib target, same or different from those listed above

       22. One another pathology associated to at least one specific alteration in one crizotinib
           target, same or different from those listed above.

       23. One another pathology associated to at least one specific alteration in one crizotinib
           target, same or different from those listed above.
