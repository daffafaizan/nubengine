      on chronic pain. Primary (characteristic pain intensity) and secondary (mood, quality of
      life) outcomes will be assessed at pre-treatment, three times during treatment,
      post-treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Potential treatment moderators and mediators
      will also be assessed. The study will address two aims:

      Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of 8 sessions of group delivered HYP training for reducing
      characteristic pain intensity in patients. The hypothesis associated with Aim 1 is:

      Hypothesis 1: Primary Study Hypothesis. Patients receiving 8 sessions of HYP training will
      report significantly reduced pre- to post-treatment decreases in average pain intensity.

      Aim 2 : To evaluate potential moderators (hypnotizability) associated with treatment outcomes
      following intervention. The hypothesis associated with Aim 2 is:

      Hypothesis 2a: Hypnotizability will augment treatment outcomes such that those with higher
      hypnotizability will experience significantly greater treatment gains.

      In addition to testing the above specific hypotheses, we will use the data obtained in this
      study to further explore (1) the longer-term (up to 6 months) effects of HYP and (2)
      additional potential moderators (e.g., treatment outcome expectancies, treatment motivation,
      demographic variables, pain type [neuropathic vs. nociceptive]) and mediators (pain
      acceptance, catastrophizing, mindfulness, therapeutic alliance, amount of skill practice
      between sessions) of treatment outcome.
