      of esophageal peristalsis combined with a defective relaxation of the lower esophageal
      sphincter (LES). The major symptoms of esophageal achalasia are dysphagia, chest pain, and
      regurgitation of undigested food.

      Currently, treatment options mainly focus on relief of the symptoms by reducing the LES
      pressure. Pneumatic dilation is the main endoscopic therapies for esophageal achalasia.
      However, the patients need repeat treatment to maintain therapeutic success and there is a
      risk of perforation (1%-3%). For surgery approaches, the laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM)
      combined with Dor's antireflux procedure has gained considerable interest. The LHM can
      sustain therapeutic effects for long-term in approximately 80% of patients.

      Recently, Inoue et al. succeeded in treating achalasia endoscopically with a method called
      peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and achieved promising results in short-term. Technically,
      POEM derived from natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and endoscopic
      submucosal dissection (ESD), in which a submucosal tunnel is created after submucosal
      injection, and then an endoscopic myotomy was made at the gastroesophageal junction.

      However, the clinical efficacy of safety of circular myotomy and full-thickness myotomy
      guided by peroral endoscopic in treatment of incision length of ≤7cm and of ≥7cm in achalasia
      patients were not determined, and there was no prospective study that compared different
      surgical procedures of POEM for esophageal achalasia. Therefore, we aim to compare the
      clinical efficacy of safety of circular myotomy and full-thickness myotomy guided by peroral
      endoscopic in treatment of incision length of ≤7cm and of ≥7cm in achalasia patients.
