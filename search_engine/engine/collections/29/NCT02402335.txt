      means of the painDetect Questionnaire, the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire, clinical
      examinations and different imaging procedures. Two groups of patients are compared with each
      other. Group one consists of patients with osteoporotic fractures of the vertebra. Group two
      is formed by patients with osteochondria , spinal disc herniation and nerval compression.
      Both groups of patients undergo surgery, as they are suffering from pain (e.g. kyphoplasty,
      nucleotomy, spondylodesis, decompression). In order to differentiate between chronic
      nociceptive pain and chronic neuropathic pain in these two groups the painDetect
      questionnaire is used. To examine the severity of disability in the patients' everyday life
      the Roland-Morris Disability questionnaire is used.

      The included patients are examined and seen preoperative, postoperative before discharge from
      hospital, 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery.
