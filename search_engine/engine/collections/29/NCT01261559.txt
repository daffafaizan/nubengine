      radiation-related cancer risk is increasingly recognized in the medical and lay community.
      One of the groups at greatest risk for radiation-induced malignancies is young females due to
      the radiosensitivity of female breast tissue. Breast tissue frequently lies within the
      imaging plane for CT of the abdomen with limited gain in diagnostic information. We propose
      displacing this breast tissue out of the direct imaging plane will decrease unnecessary
      radiation exposure and may also indirectly improve image quality.

      A device called Chrysalis has been designed and received FDA approval for the purposes of
      displacing female breast tissue during CT.
