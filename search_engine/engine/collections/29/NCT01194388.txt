    
      Up to 25 patients from from US centers are anticipated to be enrolled for this evaluation.
      Published literature on coils with electrolytic, thermal or hydraulic detachment will serve
      as the basis for control comparisons to the Axium™ MicroFx™ Detachable Coil System for
      patients undergoing embolization of intracranial aneurysm. Comparison will be based on
      criteria evaluating the safety of the procedure, the reliability of detachment, the occlusion
      stability and the packing density impact.
