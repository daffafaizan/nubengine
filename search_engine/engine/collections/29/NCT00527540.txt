      plus ribavirin 10-15mg/kg per day. The patients are visited every 4 weeks with biochemistry
      lab tests. They are checked with quantitative HCV PCR on the third month after initiation of
      the treatment to assess early virologic response and at the end of the study for complete
      response rate and on the six month after treatment completion for sustained response rate.
      The patients with undetectable HCV RNA are considered as responders.
