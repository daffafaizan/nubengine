      FDA for glucose lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Four randomized,
      controlled clinical studies in subjects with type 2 diabetes have demonstrated significant
      treatment difference in HbA1c (-0.5%). Study durations ranged from 12-26 weeks of therapy. In
      diabetes clinical studies, a therapeutic response to colesevelam hydrochloride, as reflected
      by reduction in A1c was initially noted following 4-6 weeks of treatment and reached maximal
      or near-maximal effect after 12-18 weeks of treatment. Reductions in both fasting plasma
      glucose and postprandial concentrations have been demonstrated. Simple measures of insulin
      secretion and action have suggested that this is due to improved insulin action rather than
      improved insulin secretion. The mechanism by which bile acids interact with the key pathways
      regulating glucose concentrations is largely unknown. The investigators propose a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo controlled trial with a parallel-group design where subjects are
      randomized to receive colesevelam or matching placebo for a 12 week treatment period. A
      labeled mixed meal before and after treatment will be used to measure intestinal transit,
      postprandial and fasting glucose fluxes, insulin secretion and action as well as
      enteroendocrine secretion.
