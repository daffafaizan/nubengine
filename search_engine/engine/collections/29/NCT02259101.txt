      for insomnia (CBT-I) will help adults diagnosed with HIV to improve the quantity (number of
      hours) and the quality of their sleep. The PI will compare adults who participated in the
      CBT-I program to adults who participated in a Sleep Hygiene group, a common treatment for
      insomnia. The PI will look at the overall quality of life, and number of hours and quality of
      sleep of adults who participated in the CBT-I program versus adults in the Sleep Hygiene
      group. Also, the PI will draw blood to compare how the body responds to medical illnesses
      between adults in the CBT-I program to adults in the Sleep Hygiene group.
