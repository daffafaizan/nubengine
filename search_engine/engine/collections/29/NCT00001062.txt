      convenient to administer, without the need for a permanent indwelling IV catheter. Although
      oral ganciclovir has been used as maintenance following induction with IV ganciclovir,
      patients with reactivation of disease must be reinduced IV. A fixed-schedule regimen in which
      oral and IV ganciclovir are alternated may prevent reactivation and progression of disease,
      as opposed to the current therapeutic strategy in which changes in therapy are event-driven.
      Also, the duration of intermittent IV therapy required to control disease may be short enough
      to eliminate the need for an indwelling catheter.

      Patients receive IV induction with ganciclovir for 2 weeks followed by an alternating course
      of 3 weeks of oral ganciclovir and 1 week of IV drug for four cycles (16 weeks). If CMV
      retinitis fails to arrest after initial induction, IV ganciclovir is administered for an
      additional 2 weeks.
