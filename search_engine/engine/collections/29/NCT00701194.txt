      evaluate the Early Intervention Foster Care Program (EIFC). EIFC, also known at
      Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care-Preschool (MTFC-P), is a preventive intervention that
      is specifically designed to address the needs of preschool-aged foster children and their
      caregivers. Over the first 5 years of the project data was collected from 177 preschool-aged
      children, 117 of whom were in the Oregon foster care system and 60 of whom were living with
      their biological families for a community comparison sample. Foster children in the study
      were randomly assigned to the EIFC experimental intervention condition or a regular foster
      care condition (RFC). The following hypotheses are under investigation: (1) Relative to
      children in the RFC condition, children in the EIFC condition will show greater improvements
      in temporally proximal outcomes (e.g., behavioral/emotional, salivary cortisol, and
      developmental) and in temporally distal outcomes (e.g., behavioral functioning in the school
      setting; long-term placement stability, including reunification or adoption; and mental
      health status, including psychiatric diagnoses). (2) Proximal outcomes over the course of the
      intervention will predict distal outcomes during the early elementary school years. (3)
      Proximal outcomes will be mediated by caregivers' childrearing practices-specifically,
      engagement with and monitoring of the child in the home, the quality and consistency of
      parental discipline, and the use of positive reinforcement strategies. (4) The same
      childrearing practices will mediate the psychosocial adjustment of the child in the aftercare
      setting (i.e., return to family of origin, placement in adoptive home, or continued placement
      in long-term foster home). (5) The EIFC intervention will cost-effectively reduce the need
      for mental health and social services for children, decreasing the length of time that
      children spend in foster care and reducing the need for special education services for
      children.
