      immune-suppression who are seeking treatment of warts that have already proven recalcitrant
      to standard therapy. The first cohort will include 4 patients ages 12 to 17. After all tests
      indicate treatment safety, the second cohort will be recruited and will include patients ages
      8 to 17.
