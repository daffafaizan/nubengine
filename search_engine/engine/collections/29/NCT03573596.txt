      TKI treatment outside trials but according to EURO-SKI procedures), with TKI for at least
      another 3 years, out of last two years with dasatinib. If MR4 or better is re-achieved and
      maintained for at least one year, patients will be eligible for a second stop. After
      verification of MR4, TKI treatment will be stopped and patients followed in the same manner
      as after first stop. If MMR is lost (BCR-ABL >0.1% (IS)), TKI treatment will once again be
      restarted.

      Patients exhibiting hematological relapse after first stop attempt will not be offered a
      second stop within this study. The same applies to patients in whom TKI was restarted
      prematurely (without loss of MMR).
