      GI neoplasms.However, one disadvantage of EMR is that lesions larger than 2 cm in diameter
      must be removed in pieces, which may result in a high recurrence rate of residual tumor
      tissue. In addition, in most patients, pathological assessment cannot be conducted after the
      procedure. ESD can overcome the disadvantages of EMR. However, it is difficult to perform ESD
      for GI neoplasms because of the high rate of complications.
