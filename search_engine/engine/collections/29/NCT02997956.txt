      non-treated patients with intermediate HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) tumors. However, TACE
      is not considered a curative strategy and eventual local recurrence is observed in nearly all
      (>95%) of cases. Therefore, significant clinical equipoise exists in this large group of HCC
      patients such that novel therapies can be tested in an adjuvant manner to TACE. Based on
      pre-clinical data in HCC and the increasing identification that IL-6 signaling leads to tumor
      progression or local recurrence in other solid malignancies, significant rationale exists for
      the use of Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor adjuvant to TACE. While Tocilizumab has
      been demonstrated to be safe in RA patients and is FDA approved, limited data exists for the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with cirrhosis and HCC. Therefore, a lead in phase
      IB study design is planned to identify the MTD of Tocilizumab in HCC patients followed by
      expansion to the phase II component whereupon the primary objective will be median
      progression free survival (PFS).
