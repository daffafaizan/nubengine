      ultrasonography in population born in 1952 in areas depending from Hospital de la Santa Creu
      i Sant Pau in Barcelona. Ultrasonography evaluations will be performed in primary health
      centers by previously trained doctors according to study protocol and AAA management will be
      according to United Kingdom's National Health Service screening model. A descriptive analysis
      will be performed to estimate local population prevalence of AAA in both men and women in
      order to create the basis for a future state AAA screening programme. A cost-effectiveness
      analysis will be performed in order to assess optimal screening strategies in our population.
