    
      Ischemic necrotizing scleritis patients who showed persistent and progressive scleral melting
      were included in this study.

      Perichondrium tissue was harvested from the patient's ear cartilage and transplanted to
      reconstruct the scleral defect after the necrotic tissue removal.
