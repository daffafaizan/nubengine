      anaesthesiological procedures.The peripheral venepuncture is a painful procedure and induces
      a higher level of perioperative stress in children.

      The punction of peripheral veins in children can be made difficult by the often distinctive
      amount of subcutaneous fat or other medical conditions.

      The AccuVein Â® AV300 vein scanner is a contactless, laser-driven device made for facilitate
      the search for peripheral veins up to a depth of 7mm. This could lead to a minimization of
      time until successful puncture and smaller number of failures.
