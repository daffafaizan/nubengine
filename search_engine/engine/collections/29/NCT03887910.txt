    
      Northwell Health Visits (NHV) is based on Family Connects (formerly Durham Connects), which
      is a short-term, universal, inexpensive postnatal nurse home visiting program designed to
      provide brief parenting intervention and to connect families with community resources based
      on individualized assessments of family needs. The intervention was found to reduce the
      number of infant emergency medical care episodes and rates of anxiety in mothers, as well as
      increase community connection, positive parenting behaviors, participation in higher quality
      out-of-home child care when implemented in Durham, so we are looking to replicate these
      outcomes. We are adapting the model to serve the local population that is served by Northwell
      Health - Katz Women's Hospital at Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Medical Center, to see if
      increasing services in and around discharge is more useful for mothers and infants, and
      improves outcomes for infants. The focus is of early intervention (education and support by
      Nurse Practitioner), and connection to community agencies, in order to: reduce healthcare
      costs, decrease the rate of mothers and infants Potentially Preventable Emergency Room Visits
      (PPVs), adhere to well-baby care and mother's postpartum care schedules, improve family
      functioning, strengthen family partnerships and well-being, reduce necessary reports to child
      protective services, improve mental and physical health outcomes of mothers and infants
      within the first six months of life.
