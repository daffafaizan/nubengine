      include: the signing of the ICF, demographic data, drug allergy history and history, height,
      weight, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) examination, laboratory
      examination, blood pregnancy test records (if applicable), endoscopic biopsy, AE and drug
      combination, check into/standard. Qualified patients will enter the administration period
      after screening and confirmation. Administration period (from Administration to safety
      follow-up) day of administration (study day 1): before administration of the experimental
      drug, 12-lead ECG, laboratory test (fasting) and vital signs were measured. Subsequently, the
      experimental drug was injected intravenously at 0.3 ± 20% mCi/kg, and subjects underwent
      urination and SPECT/CT examination 40 min after administration. AE and combined medication
      were recorded. The next day after administration (day 2 of the study): 12-lead ECG,
      laboratory examination (fasting), vital signs were measured, AE and combined medication were
      recorded. Between the administration of 99mTc-3PRGD2 and the safety follow-up, the
      investigator determined that chest/abdomen enhanced CT and PET/CT were performed at an
      optional date.

      Safety follow-up (day 14±2 of the study or before the next clinical intervention, whichever
      is shorter) :

      12 lead ECG, laboratory test (fasting), measurement of vital signs, blood pregnancy (women of
      childbearing age only), AE and combined medication were recorded.Lymph node histopathology
      was obtained by surgery in patients suitable for surgery, and by ultrasound-guided lymph node
      biopsy in patients unsuitable for surgery.
