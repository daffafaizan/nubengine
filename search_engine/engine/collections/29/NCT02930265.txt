      Chinese PLA General Hospital. All patients enrolled in this study will collect detailed
      baseline clinical data, including blood, enzymes (troponin, creatine kinase), blood sugar,
      serum creatinine, blood lipid levels (LDL lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), inflammatory
      markers (high sensitivity C- reactive protein, interleukin-6), endothelin (ET-1), pancreas
      glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).

      The investigators randomly assign eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to either liraglutide
      intervention group (N = 200) or control group (N = 200), liraglutide intervention group will
      accept ischemic cardiomyopathy conventional drugs and liraglutide (Novo Nordisk,
      specifications: 18mg / 3ml; 1.8mg subcutaneous injection of 1 / day), Control group will
      accept ischemic cardiomyopathy conventional drugs and a placebo.

      Primary end point of the study is main adverse cardiovascular events including Recurrent
      myocardial infarction, recurrent angina, revascularization, all-cause death, nonfatal
      myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure again. Secondary
      end point of the study was 1) New York Heart Association functional class, 2) left
      ventricular ejection fraction, 3) 6-minute walk test, 4) KCCQ clinical total score, 5)
      changes in blood glucose levels during follow-up, blood lipid levels and body weight
